Since generating such sequence diagrams is performed manually, automated or semi-automated support is beneficial in providing important and practical help. In this paper, a new semi-automated approach for generating sequence diagrams from user requirements written in Arabic is proposed. In this novel approach, the used Arabic requirements are parsed using a natural language processing tool to generate corresponding part of speech. A set of proposed heuristics are to be applied to obtain the sequence diagram components; objects, messages and work flow transitions (messages). The generated sequence diagram is represented using XMI to be drawn using sequence diagrams drawing tools. Using three different case studies as a benchmark from Isra Computer and Programming Company, the proposed approach is evaluated in terms of correctness and completeness of participants and messages exchanged between them.","doi":"10.1109/ICITECH.2017.8080018","publicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8053844/8079906/08080018.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICITECH.2017.8080018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8079906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A semi-automated approach for generating sequence diagrams from Arabic user requirements using a natural language processing tool","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080018/","displayDocTitle":"A semi-automated approach for generating sequence diagrams from Arabic user requirements using a natural language processing tool","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17285549","htmlLink":"/document/8080018/","conferenceDate":"17-18 May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A semi-automated approach for generating sequence diagrams from Arabic user requirements using a natural language processing tool","confLoc":"Amman, Jordan","sourcePdf":"049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058601S","chronDate":"17-18 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8053844","isNumber":"8079906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8053844","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8079906","articleId":"8080018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8080019,"authors":[{"name":"Kazar Okba","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University Mohamed Khider Biskra, Biskra, Algeria"],"firstName":"Kazar","lastName":"Okba","id":"38093613300"},{"name":"Saouli Hamza","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University Mohamed Khider Biskra, Biskra, Algeria"],"firstName":"Saouli","lastName":"Hamza","id":"38546838200"},{"name":"Benfanatki Hind","affiliation":["LIRIS UMR, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Benfanatki","lastName":"Hind","id":"37086235246"},{"name":"Alaoui Amira","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University Mohamed Khider Biskra, Biskra, Algeria"],"firstName":"Alaoui","lastName":"Amira","id":"37086236040"},{"name":"Bourakach Samir","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University Mohamed Khider Biskra, Biskra, Algeria"],"firstName":"Bourakach","lastName":"Samir","id":"37086235892"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6332-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6333-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8080019","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080019","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ontologies","Dictionaries","Semantics","Receivers","Information technology","Natural languages","Loading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["language translation","natural language processing","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semantic natural language translation","ontologies combination","automatic translation","human languages","contextual interpretation","diverse languages","source language","contextual meaning","equivalent word","receiver language"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["natural language","automatic translation","dictionary","ontology","semantics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICITECH.2017.8080019","endPage":"321","startPage":"315","publicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 8th International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8053844/8079906/08080019.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICITECH.2017.8080019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8079906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantic natural language translation based on ontologies combination","abstract":"One of the most important and difficult tasks is the automatic translation of human languages; is essentially due to the diversity of the contextual interpretation between diverse languages.

Joining interleaving and SLM is accomplished by generating randomly interleaved data streams and multiply it by a random phases sequences (SLM). Then the resultant sequence with lowest PAPR is processed by LCT.

The wiring harnesses used for the transmission of data and power delivery for these components may have up to 4,000 parts, weigh as much as 40 kg, and contain up to 4 km of wiring. The amount of wiring is expected to grow as vehicles evolve and begin to include enhanced active safety features and, eventually, self-driving capabilities and diversified sensing resources. Consequently, the ability to eliminate wires in vehicles is a compelling value proposition; it decreases part, manufacturing, and maintenance costs and improves fuel efficiency and, therefore, greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, it may spur innovation by providing an open architecture to accommodate new components, offering the potential for growth in automotive applications-possibly similar to the computer and phone industry over the past decade.","doi":"10.1109/MVT.2017.2736858","publicationTitle":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine","startPage":"77","endPage":"85","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MVT.2017.2736858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8079088","pdfPath":"/iel7/10209/8079088/08080149.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Energy harvesting","Sensors","Emissions","Frequency measurement","Actuators","Power system economics","Market research"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air pollution control","cyber-physical systems","energy harvesting","telecommunication power management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intravehicular energy-harvesting","wireless networks","mechanical systems","cyberphysical systems","electronic control units","data transmission","power delivery","enhanced active safety features","self-driving capabilities","diversified sensing resources","value proposition","manufacturing costs","maintenance costs","fuel efficiency","greenhouse gas emissions","automotive applications","computer industry","phone industry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Intravehicular Energy-Harvesting Wireless Networks: Reducing Costs and Emissions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080149/","volume":"12","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8080149/","accessionNumber":"17377792","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"The Science Academy Turkey","grantNumber":"BAGEP program"},{"fundingName":"Marie Curie Reintegration Grant","grantNumber":"PIRG06-GA-2009-256441"},{"fundingName":"Turkish Academy of Sciences TUBA","grantNumber":"Young Scientist Award Program (GEBIP)"},{"fundingName":"TerraSwarm","grantNumber":"sponsored by MARCO and DARPA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intravehicular Energy-Harvesting Wireless Networks: Reducing Costs and Emissions","sourcePdf":"mvt-coleriergen-2736858-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069949S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10209","isNumber":"8079088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10209","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8079088","articleId":"8080149","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8080153,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

For portable scanners using rotation of the magnet for spatial encoding with generalized projections, the spatial pattern of the field is important since it acts as the encoding field. In either a static or rotating magnet, it will be important to be able to optimize the field pattern of cylindrical Halbach arrays in a way that retains construction simplicity. To achieve this, we present a method for designing an optimized cylindrical Halbach magnet using the genetic algorithm (GA) to achieve either homogeneity (for standard MRI applications) or a favorable spatial encoding field pattern (for rotational spatial encoding applications). We compare the chosen designs against a standard, fully populated sparse Halbach design, and evaluate optimized spatial encoding fields using point-spread-function and image simulations. We validate the calculations by comparing to the measured field of a constructed magnet. The experimentally implemented design produced fields in good agreement with the predicted fields, and the GA was successful in improving the chosen metrics. For the uniform target field, an order of magnitude homogeneity improvement was achieved compared to the un-optimized, fully populated design. For the rotational encoding design, the resolution uniformity is improved by 95% compared to a uniformly populated design.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2017.2751001","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/8232484/08080154.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2017.2751001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8232484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Sparse Halbach Magnet Arrays for Portable MRI Using a Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080154/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Design of Sparse Halbach Magnet Arrays for Portable MRI Using a Genetic Algorithm","volume":"54","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17466874","pubMedId":"29749974","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","externalId":"5100112","htmlLink":"/document/8080154/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Sparse Halbach Magnet Arrays for Portable MRI Using a Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tmag-cooley-2751001-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081302S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"8232484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8232484","articleId":"8080154","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":8080156,"authors":[{"name":"Jingwei Zhang","affiliation":["College of Energy and Electrical Engineering, Hohai University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Jingwei Zhang (S\u201914) was born in Jiangsu, China, in 1989.

However, few researchers focused on the optimal design of the BSRMs. In this paper, the multi-objective optimal design of BSRMs is investigated. At first, an analytical design model is derived from the mathematical model of the BSRMs. An initial design is calculated by the analytical design model. The electromagnetic performance is compared with calculation results from the finite-element method (FEM). Then, the objective functions, constraints, and decision variables are also determined. Corresponding sensitivity analysis of the decision variables is implemented. Besides, aiming at solving the optimization problem with disconnected, non-uniformly distributed Pareto front and multiple local optimums, a novel multi-objective genetic particle swarm optimizer (MOGPSO) is presented. The algorithm performance of the proposed MOGPSO is validated by solving the standard test functions. Then the proposed MOGPSO is applied for the optimal design of BSRMs. Optimization results solved by MOGPSO, conventional multi-objective particle swarm optimizer, and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II are compared and analyzed. Comparison results reveal that the proposed MOGPSO can achieve more non-dominated solutions in Pareto front and is particularly suitable for optimization of BSRMs. The final optimal design is selected from the obtained Pareto front. The electromagnetic performance is compared with the initial design and verified by the FEM. Verification results show that the optimal design of BSRMs based on the analytical design model and the proposed MOGPSO is feasible and effective.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080156/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","isJournal":true,"externalId":"8100113","accessionNumber":"17466866","volume":"54","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8080156/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-Objective Optimal Design of Bearingless Switched Reluctance Motor Based on Multi-Objective Genetic Particle Swarm Optimizer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Objective Optimal Design of Bearingless Switched Reluctance Motor Based on Multi-Objective Genetic Particle Swarm Optimizer","sourcePdf":"tmag-wang-2751546-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117652S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"8232484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8232484","articleId":"8080156","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8080160,"authors":[{"name":"David Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/8269836/8080160/tsai-2750484-small.gif","p":["David Tsai (M\u201903) received the B.E. degree in software\n engineering (first class Hons.), the Master's degree in biomedical engineering from the University of New South\n Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in biomedical engineering from the University of New\n South Wales, in 2012, on electrical stimulation strategies for retinal implants to restore sight in the blind.

The per-channel antialiasing filters needed in the traditional multiplexing architecture limit its scalability for applications requiring high channel density, high channel count, and low noise. A particularly challenging example is multielectrode arrays for recording from neural systems. We show that conventional approaches must tradeoff recording density and noise performance, at a scale far from the ideal goal of one-to-one mapping between neurons and sensors. We present a multiplexing architecture without per-channel antialiasing filters. The sparsely sampled data are recovered through a compressed sensing strategy, involving statistical reconstruction and removal of the undersampled thermal noise. In doing so, we replace large analog components with digital signal processing blocks, which are much more amenable to scaled CMOS implementation. The resulting statistically reconstructed multiplexing architecture recovers input signals at significantly improved signal-to-noise ratios when compared to conventional multiplexing with antialiasing filters at the same per-channel area. We implement the new architecture in a 65 536-channel neural recording system and show that it is able to recover signals with performance comparable to conventional high-performance, single-channel systems, despite a more than four-orders-of-magnitude increase in channel density.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiplexing","Neurons","Bandwidth","Capacitors","Electrodes","Computer architecture","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","biomedical electrodes","CMOS integrated circuits","compressed sensing","filtering theory","medical signal processing","neurophysiology","signal denoising","signal reconstruction","signal sampling","statistical multiplexing","thermal noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["very dense high-channel-count acquisition systems","multichannel acquisition systems","per-channel antialiasing filters","traditional multiplexing architecture limit","high-channel density","high-channel count","multielectrode arrays","neural system recording","recording density","noise performance","one-to-one mapping","sparsely sampled data recovery","compressed sensing strategy","statistical reconstruction","undersampled thermal noise removal","digital signal processing blocks","scaled CMOS implementation","statistically reconstructed multiplexing architecture","signal-to-noise ratios","antialiasing filters","536-channel neural recording system","four-orders-of-magnitude"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electrophysiology","interpolation","multielectrode array","multiplexing","sampling"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Humans","Microelectrodes","Neurons","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Synaptic Transmission"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2017.2750484","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/8269836/08080160.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8269836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2017.2750484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistically Reconstructed Multiplexing for Very Dense, High-Channel-Count Acquisition Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Statistically Reconstructed Multiplexing for Very Dense, High-Channel-Count Acquisition Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080160/","volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8080160/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17491351","pubMedId":"29377795","dateOfInsertion":"25 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.

Due to bottleneck in electrical devices, mm-wave wireless signal at such high bit rates cannot be generated in an all-electrical method. Photonics-assisted mm-wave generation technology has become an effective solution to handle this problem of bandwidth limitation. Recent efforts with a single modulator to generate optical mm-wave signal largely simplify the architecture of the optical transmitter. Heterodyne detection based on advanced digital signal processing can overcome nonlinear effects in optical and electrical devices, and it also can improve the spectral efficiency and receiver sensitivity. Multidimensional multiplexing techniques can reduce the baud rate of each subchannel, and hence it can realize mm-wave signal long distance transmission. In this tutorial, we will describe these key enabling technologies and principle for the realization of ultrahigh speed, large capacity mm-wave signal transmission.

As one of the most fundamental components in computing systems, encoding scheme characterizes the relationship between the stimulus and the individual or ensemble neuronal responses. Although rate encoding is easier to implement and with high error tolerance, temporal encoding offers high data density and energy efficiency. In this paper, an inter-spike interval (ISI)-based resistive crossbar neuromorphic design, built with the standard CMOS technology, is proposed. Our proposed decoder exhibits not only computation accuracy but also robustness. Another worth-mentioning achievement is the data compressor in our work, which is based on the spike temporal encoding scheme. In this paper, design and performance analysis for proposed ISI-based resistive crossbar are elaborated; as well as the application of our proposed design. 24 patterns are adopted to encode the sensory information which are successfully represented by seven inter-spike intervals leading to significantly high compression rate. To evaluate the performance, a test bench of video frames consisting one person rotating her head from 0\u00b0 to 75\u00b0 with an increment of 15\u00b0 has been employed. The results showed that the ISI code has better performance in both recognition rate and converging speed.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2017.2765892","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/8330765/08080213.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8330765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2017.2765892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog Spike-Timing-Dependent Resistive Crossbar Design for Brain Inspired Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Analog Spike-Timing-Dependent Resistive Crossbar Design for Brain Inspired Computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080213/","publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17669810","htmlLink":"/document/8080213/","volume":"8","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006602","fundingName":"Air Force Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"FA8750-16-2-0120 and FA8750-15-1-0052"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog Spike-Timing-Dependent Resistive Crossbar Design for Brain Inspired Computing","sourcePdf":"jetcas-yi-2765892-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088972S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"8330765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8330765","articleId":"8080213","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8080214,"authors":[{"name":"Mingxing Ke","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Communication Networks Laboratory, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Mingxing","lastName":"Ke","orcid":"0000-0003-3037-5324","id":"37085667012"},{"name":"Yuhua Xu","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Communication Networks Laboratory, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Yuhua","lastName":"Xu","orcid":"0000-0002-4930-940X","id":"37596320600"},{"name":"Alagan Anpalagan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Alagan","lastName":"Anpalagan","orcid":"0000-0002-6646-6052","id":"37270506600"},{"name":"Dianxiong Liu","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Communication Networks Laboratory, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Dianxiong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086320490"},{"name":"Yuli Zhang","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Communication Networks Laboratory, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Yuli","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0001-9060-9933","id":"37086321691"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8080214","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":488},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080214","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Wireless sensor networks","Cognition","Nash equilibrium","Convergence","Position measurement","Distributed algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","time-of-arrival estimation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exact potential game","positional accuracy","convergence rate","distributed TOA","wireless sensor networks","potential game approach","time-of-arrival technique","traditional estimation methods","target node","anchor nodes","cognition information","positional information","positioning problem","game-theoretic perspective"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed positioning algorithms","TOA","potential game"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we solve the problem of positioning based on the time-of-arrival technique in wireless sensor networks.

A design procedure based on the definition of the voltage regulation range is presented. It introduces an additional degree of freedom that allows a proper design of the converter in order to reduce not only the active power but also the nonactive power, reducing losses and increasing power density. By means of the proposed approach, it is also demonstrated that by replacing the conventional step-up partial-power converter by a step-up/down partial-power converter, the active and nonactive power can be further reduced, allowing to better explore the benefits of the partial-power concept. In order to validate the proposed approach, two 750-W prototypes of full-bridge S-PPC and full-bridge/push-pull S-PPC were implemented and experimentally evaluated. The step-up/down prototype presented a reduction of 46.9% in nonactive power and 23.4% of its volume, resulting in a higher efficiency and power density in comparison to the voltage step-up prototype counterpart.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Series-Connected Partial-Power Converters Applied to PV Systems: A Design Approach Based on Step-Up/Down Voltage Regulation Range","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2765928","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8400452/08080234.pdf","startPage":"7622","endPage":"7633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2765928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8400452","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080234/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Series-Connected Partial-Power Converters Applied to PV Systems: A Design Approach Based on Step-Up/Down Voltage Regulation Range","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/8080234/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"17877344","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)"},{"fundingName":"CNPq\u2014Brazil","grantNumber":"309214/2013-0, 462247/2014-7 and 465640/2014-1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Series-Connected Partial-Power Converters Applied to PV Systems: A Design Approach Based on Step-Up/Down Voltage Regulation Range","sourcePdf":"tpel-zientarski-2765928-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101978S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8400452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"8400452","articleId":"8080234","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8080238,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Ma","affiliation":["School of Engineering, The University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8291762/8080238/hma-2765637-small.gif","p":["Hui Ma received the B.S. degree in electronic information science from Qufu Normal University, China, in 2010, and the M.Eng. degree in communication engineering from Shandong University, China, in 2013.

Two scenarios are considered: (a) eavesdroppers' channel state information (ECSI) is available and (b) ECSI is unavailable. In scenario (a), a QoS-based design is considered to minimize the worst case signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio at the eavesdroppers and to guarantee the QoS of the legitimate receiver. A secrecy rate-based design is also studied where the worst case secrecy rate is maximized. In scenario (b), a QoS-based design is considered to maximize the power of jamming signals under the QoS constraint of the legitimate receiver, and the secrecy rate-based design is not applicable. In all these designs, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming vector and the covariance matrix of jamming signals under individual power constraints. As the optimization problems are non-convex, we propose an algorithm for each problem through semidefinite relaxation. Our analysis and simulation results show that, even though the linear precoding scheme in our designs is transmit beamforming rather than the general rank transmit covariance, this does not cause any loss of optimality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080238/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","volume":"66","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"17578006","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8080238/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust MISO Beamforming With Cooperative Jamming for Secure Transmission From Perspectives of QoS and Secrecy Rate","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingName":"Agricultural Technology Innovation and Development Foundation of Shaanxi Province, China","grantNumber":"2016NY-178"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust MISO Beamforming With Cooperative Jamming for Secure Transmission From Perspectives of QoS and Secrecy Rate","sourcePdf":"tcomm-cheng-2765637-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.314917S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8291762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8291762","articleId":"8080238","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8080239,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofeng Ding","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8259379/8080239/ding-2765670-small.gif","p":["Xiaofeng Ding received the B.S., M.S., and D.S. degrees in electrical\n engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 2005, 2008, and 2011, respectively.","From 2008 to 2010, he was a Visiting Scholar in the University of Michigan-Dearborn, Dearborn, MI, USA.

Initially, a novel comprehensive analytical model of the inverter voltage distortion is developed. Not only voltage drops, dead time, and output capacitance, but also switching delay times and voltage overshoot of the power devices are taken into account in the model. Such a model yields a more accurate prediction of the inverter's output voltage distortion, and is validated by experimentation. Due to inherent shortcomings of the commonly used double pulse test, the switching characteristics of both SiC-mosfets and Si-IGBTs in the pulse width modulation inverter are tested instead, such that the actual performances of the SiC and Si devices in the motor drive system are examined. Then, the switching performance is incorporated into the physical model to quantify the distorted voltages of both the SiC-based and Si-based systems. The results show that, despite its existing nonlinearities, the SiC-based drive has lower voltage distortion compared to the conventional Si-based drive as a result of its shorter switching times and smaller voltage drop, as well as a higher efficiency. Finally, the overriding operational advantages of the SiC-based drive over its Si-based counterpart is fully demonstrated by comprehensive performance comparisons.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical and Experimental Evaluation of SiC-Inverter Nonlinearities for Traction Drives Used in Electric Vehicles","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2765670","startPage":"146","endPage":"159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2765670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8259379","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8259379/08080239.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Analytical and Experimental Evaluation of SiC-Inverter Nonlinearities for Traction Drives Used in Electric Vehicles","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"67","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8080239/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2018","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17506811","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51407004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004750","fundingName":"Aeronautical Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"20162851016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical and Experimental Evaluation of SiC-Inverter Nonlinearities for Traction Drives Used in Electric Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tvt-ding-2765670-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074789S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8259379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"8259379","articleId":"8080239","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8080240,"authors":[{"name":"Jianxiao Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Power Systems, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8643651/8080240/jwang-2766022-small.gif","p":["Jianxiao Wang (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Most of existing literature directly uses available weather conditions as input features, which might ignore some key weather factors and the coupling among weather conditions. Therefore, a novel solar power forecasting approach is proposed in this paper by exploring key weather factors from photovoltaic (PV) analytical modeling. The proposed approach is composed of three engines: (1) analytical modeling of PV systems; (2) machine learning methods for mapping weather features with solar power; and (3) a deviation analysis for solar power forecast adjustment. In contrast to the existing research that directly uses available weather conditions, this paper explores the physical knowledge from PV models. Different irradiance components and PV cell temperatures are derived from PV analytical modeling. These weather features are used to reformulate the input of machine learning methods, which helps achieve a better forecasting performance. Moreover, based on the historical forecasting deviations, a compensation term is presented to adjust the solar power forecast. Case studies based on measured datasets from PV systems in Australia demonstrate that the forecasting performance can be highly improved by taking advantage of the key weather features derived from PV models.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2017.2766022","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8643651/08080240.pdf","startPage":"1417","endPage":"1427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8643651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2017.2766022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring Key Weather Factors From Analytical Modeling Toward Improved Solar Power Forecasting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","displayDocTitle":"Exploring Key Weather Factors From Analytical Modeling Toward Improved Solar Power Forecasting","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080240/","publicationDate":"March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18629517","htmlLink":"/document/8080240/","volume":"10","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2016YFB0900103"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010880","fundingName":"State Grid Corporation of China"},{"fundingName":"Junior Fellowships for Advanced Innovation Think-tank Programme, China Association for Science and Technology","grantNumber":"DXB-ZKQN-2017-037"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring Key Weather Factors From Analytical Modeling Toward Improved Solar Power Forecasting","sourcePdf":"tsg-zhong-2766022-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17469S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8643651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"8643651","articleId":"8080240","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8080243,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Control Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/8225765/8080243/jwang-2766039-small.gif","p":["Jun Wang received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in control theory and control engineering from the China University of Mining and Technology, Jiangsu, China, in 2003, 2009, and 2015, respectively.","He has been an Associate Professor with the School of Information and Electrical Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology.

Driven by such an idea, a task-specific DNN model fine-tuned from VGG-face is constructed for both gender and identity recognition with hand vein information. Unlike the traditional transfer learning models, which fine-tune directly from source to target, we leverage the coarse-to-fine scheme to train the task-specific models in a step-aware way, such that the inherent correlation between the neighboring databases could serve as initialization base to relieve the problem of over-fitting, which is inevitable with the small-scaled hand vein database, and also speed up the convergence. Besides, the task-driven network training idea, which involves joint optimization of linear regression classifier and network parameters, is also adopted during training of each model to obtain more discriminative representation for specified tasks. Instead of adopting the trained linear regression classifier for gender and identity classification, the large margin distribution machine (LDM) is introduced to ensure the discriminative and generalization performance of the model simultaneously, and it should be noted that before feeding the gender feature vector into the LDM, a supervised feature selection step is incorporated to improve the classification performance by discarding the redundant feature and highlighting the important ones for gender classification. Rigorous experiments using the lab-made database are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model. What is more, additional experiment with a subset of the PolyU database illustrates its generalization ability and robustness.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2017.2766039","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/8225765/08080243.pdf","startPage":"733","endPage":"744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2017.2766039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8225765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bimodal Vein Data Mining via Cross-Selected-Domain Knowledge Transfer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080243/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Bimodal Vein Data Mining via Cross-Selected-Domain Knowledge Transfer","volume":"13","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17481774","htmlLink":"/document/8080243/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61379143"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bimodal Vein Data Mining via Cross-Selected-Domain Knowledge Transfer","sourcePdf":"tifs-wang-2766039-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158467S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"8225765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8225765","articleId":"8080243","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8080244,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Yin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/8103362/8080244/yin-2765830-small.gif","p":["Xi Yin received the B.S. degree in electronic and information science from Wuhan University, China, in 2013.

First, we propose a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) for face recognition, where identity classification is the main task and pose, illumination, and expression (PIE) estimations are the side tasks. Second, we develop a dynamic-weighting scheme to automatically assign the loss weights to each side task, which solves the crucial problem of balancing between different tasks in MTL. Third, we propose a pose-directed multi-task CNN by grouping different poses to learn pose-specific identity features, simultaneously across all poses in a joint framework. Last but not least, we propose an energy-based weight analysis method to explore how CNN-based MTL works. We observe that the side tasks serve as regularizations to disentangle the PIE variations from the learnt identity features. Extensive experiments on the entire multi-PIE dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work using all data in multi-PIE for face recognition. Our approach is also applicable to in-the-wild data sets for pose-invariant face recognition and achieves comparable or better performance than state of the art on LFW, CFP, and IJB-A datasets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Task Convolutional Neural Network for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2765830","startPage":"964","endPage":"975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2765830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103362","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8103362/08080244.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080244","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080244/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Task Convolutional Neural Network for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8080244/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17390364","pubMedId":"29757739","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Task Convolutional Neural Network for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tip-yin-2765830-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107121S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8103362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"8103362","articleId":"8080244","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8080245,"authors":[{"name":"Pascal Getreuer","affiliation":["Google Research, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/8359225/8080245/getre-2766049-small.gif","p":["Pascal Getreuer received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in applied\n mathematics from the University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA, and the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from the\n University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

We use direct-sequence spread spectrum modulation, which makes it highly robust to multipath, motion, and narrowband noise. We use a 127-chip pseudorandom code, repeating once per data symbol, and modulate its amplitude with orthogonal sine waveforms encoding 4-bit symbol values.

This paper presents a logistic discriminant metric learning method for this challenging problem. Different with most existing metric learning algorithms, it exploits both original data and auxiliary data during training, which is motivated by the new machine learning paradigm-learning using privileged information. Such privileged information is a kind of auxiliary knowledge, which is only available during training. Our goal is to learn an optimal distance function by constructing a locally adaptive decision rule with the help of privileged information. We jointly learn two distance metrics by minimizing the empirical loss penalizing the difference between the distance in the original space and that in the privileged space. In our setting, the distance in the privileged space functions as a local decision threshold, which guides the decision making in the original space like a teacher. The metric learned from the original space is used to compute the distance between a probe image and a gallery image during testing. In addition, we extend the proposed approach to a multi-view setting which is able to explore the complementation of multiple feature representations. In the multi-view setting, multiple metrics corresponding to different original features are jointly learned, guided by the same privileged information. Besides, an effective iterative optimization scheme is introduced to simultaneously optimize the metrics and the assigned metric weights. Experiment results on several widely-used data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to global decision threshold-based methods and outperforms most state-of-the-art results.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2765836","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8103362/08080246.pdf","startPage":"791","endPage":"805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2765836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Person Re-Identification With Metric Learning Using Privileged Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080246/","displayDocTitle":"Person Re-Identification With Metric Learning Using Privileged Information","volume":"27","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17390357","pubMedId":"29757732","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8080246/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National 973 Program of China","grantNumber":"2014CB347600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61432019"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Person Re-Identification With Metric Learning Using Privileged Information","sourcePdf":"tip-wang-2765836-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136975S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8103362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"8103362","articleId":"8080246","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8080248,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoli Xu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8318336/8080248/xu-2765641-small.gif","p":["Xiaoli Xu received the B.E. degree (Hons.) and Ph.D. degree from the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2009 and 2015, respectively.

The GE channel is a 2-state Markov model that is commonly used for channels with memory. While channel memory does not affect the end-to-end capacity of multi-hop erasure channels, we show that it degrades the end-to-end throughput, when batched network coding with finite batch size is applied, due to the higher variance in erasures within one coding block. On the other hand, if the initial channel state information is available, the channel variance can be significantly reduced. We show that this fact can be utilized for improving the efficiency of the recoding operations at the intermediate nodes, and hence improve the end-to-end throughput of batched network coding schemes. Specifically, we propose adaptive recoding operations, where the network coded packets are adaptively generated based on the number of received packets and the initial channel state for each coding block. The simulation results show that the proposed adaptive recoding scheme significantly enhances the end-to-end throughput of batched network coding over multi-hop GE channels.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2765641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2765641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

(CBCT) imaging technique that exploits a multi-slit filter is proposed in this paper. The multi-slit filter installed between the x-ray source and the scanned object is reciprocated during a scan. The x-ray beams through the slits would generate relatively low-energy x-ray projection data, while the filtered beams would make high-energy projection data. An iterative image reconstruction algorithm that uses an adaptive-steepest-descent method to minimize image total-variation under the constraint of data fidelity was applied to reconstructing the image from the low-energy projection data. Since the high-energy projection data suffer from a substantially high noise level due to the beam filtration, we have developed a new algorithm that exploits the joint sparsity between the low- and high-energy CT images for image reconstruction of the high-energy CT image. The proposed image reconstruction algorithm uses a gradient magnitude image (GMI) of the low-energy CT image by regularizing the difference of GMIs of the low- and high-energy CT images to be minimized. The feasibility of the proposed technique has been demonstrated by the use of various phantoms in the experimental CBCT setup. Furthermore, based on the proposed dual-energy imaging, a material differentiation was performed and its potential utility has been shown. The proposed imaging technique produced promising results for its potential application to a low-dose single-scan dual-energy CBCT.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2017.2765760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2017.2765760","startPage":"2578","endPage":"2587","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/8124116/08080249.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8124116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Feasibility Study of Low-Dose Single-Scan Dual-Energy Cone-Beam CT in Many-View Under-Sampling Framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Feasibility Study of Low-Dose Single-Scan Dual-Energy Cone-Beam CT in Many-View Under-Sampling Framework","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2017","volume":"36","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8080249/","accessionNumber":"17377809","pubMedId":"29192887","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080249/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"NRF2016M3A9E9941837 and NRF2016M2A2A9A03913610"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003662","fundingName":"Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology","grantNumber":"10051357"},{"fundingName":"KUSTAR-KAIST Institute"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Feasibility Study of Low-Dose Single-Scan Dual-Energy Cone-Beam CT in Many-View Under-Sampling Framework","sourcePdf":"tmi-cho-2765760-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094684S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"8124116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8124116","articleId":"8080249","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8080250,"authors":[{"name":"Huiming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8318405/8080250/chen-2765660-small.gif","p":["Huiming Chen received the M.Phil. degree from the Department of\n Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2016, where he is currently working\n toward the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include numerical optimization algorithms, with applications in signal processing."]},"firstName":"Huiming","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-4179-3815","id":"37085852250"},{"name":"Wong-Hing Lam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8318405/8080250/lam-2765660-small.gif","p":["Wong-Hing Lam (SM\u201909) was born in Hong Kong.

Permutation invariant training (PIT) is a state of the art model-based approach, which applies a single neural network to solve this single-input, multiple-output modeling problem. We propose to advance the current state of the art by imposing a modular structure on the neural network, applying a progressive pretraining regimen, and improving the objective function with transfer learning and a discriminative training criterion. The modular structure splits the problem into three subtasks: frame-wise interpreting, utterance-level speaker tracing, and speech recognition. The pretraining regimen uses these modules to solve progressively harder tasks. Transfer learning leverages parallel clean speech to improve the training targets for the network. Our discriminative training formulation is a modification of standard formulations that also penalizes competing outputs of the system. Experiments are conducted on the artificial overlapped switchboard and hub5e-swb dataset. The proposed framework achieves over 30% relative improvement of word error rate over both a strong jointly trained system, PIT for ASR, and a separately optimized system, PIT for speech separation with clean speech ASR model. The improvement comes from better model generalization, training efficiency, and the sequence level linguistic knowledge integration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080252/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17394392","htmlLink":"/document/8080252/","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Progressive Joint Modeling in Unsupervised Single-Channel Overlapped Speech Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progressive Joint Modeling in Unsupervised Single-Channel Overlapped Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"taslp-droppo-2765834-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15983S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"8124117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8124117","articleId":"8080252","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8080254,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias May","affiliation":["Hearing Systems Group, Department of Electrical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/8186325/8080254/tobma-2765819-small.gif","p":["Tobias May studied hearing technology and audiology and received the\n M.Sc. degree from the University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany, in 2007 and the binational Ph.D. degree from the\n University of Oldenburg in collaboration with the Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.\n Since 2013, he has been with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, first as a\n Postdoctoral Researcher (2013\u20132017), and since 2017 as an Assistant Professor.

A multi-conditional training procedure was used to simulate the uncertainties of short-term binaural cues in response to room reverberation by mixing the direct part of head related impulse responses (HRIRs) with diffuse noise. Despite being trained with only anechoic HRIRs, the proposed dereverberation algorithm was tested in a variety of reverberant environments and achieved considerable improvements relative to a coherence-based approach in terms of three objective metrics reflecting speech quality and speech intelligibility. Moreover, a systematic evaluation showed that the proposed system generalized very well to a wide range of acoustic conditions, including various measured binaural room impulse responses reflecting different reverberation times, azimuth positions spanning the entire frontal hemifield, various source-receiver distances as well as different artificial heads.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2017.2765819","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/8186325/08080254.pdf","startPage":"406","endPage":"414","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2017.2765819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8186325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Speech Dereverberation With a Neural Network-Based Post-Filter That Exploits Multi-Conditional Training of Binaural Cues","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080254/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Robust Speech Dereverberation With a Neural Network-Based Post-Filter That Exploits Multi-Conditional Training of Binaural Cues","volume":"26","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17447073","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8080254/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Robust Speech Dereverberation With a Neural Network-Based Post-Filter That Exploits Multi-Conditional Training of Binaural Cues","sourcePdf":"taslp-may-2765819-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093864S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"8186325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","xplore-issue":"8186325","articleId":"8080254","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8080258,"authors":[{"name":"Talha Cihad Gulcu","affiliation":["TUBITAK Advanced Technologies Research Institute, Ankara, Turkey","Institute for Systems Research, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Talha Cihad Gulcu (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, in 2009, the M.S. degree from Bilkent University, Ankara, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree from University of Maryland, College Park, MD, in 2015, all in electrical engineering.

At the same time, existing algorithms for general input alphabets are less practical because of high complexity. We address the construction problem for the general case, and analyze an algorithm that is based on successive reduction of the output alphabet size of the subchannels in each recursion step. For this procedure, we estimate the approximation error as O(\u03bc\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n/(q\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n)), where q is the input alphabet size and \u03bc is the \u201cquantization parameter,\u201d i.e., the maximum size of the subchannel output alphabet allowed by the algorithm. The complexity of the code construction scales as O(N \u03bc\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n log \u03bc), where N is the length of the code. We also show that if the polarizing operation relies on modulo-q addition, it is possible to merge subsets of output symbols without any loss in subchannel capacity. Performing this procedure before each approximation step results in a further speed-up of the code construction, and the resulting codes have smaller gap to capacity. We also show that a similar acceleration can be attained for polar codes over finite field alphabets. Experimentation shows that the suggested construction algorithms can be used to construct long polar codes for alphabets of size q = 16 and more with acceptable loss of the code rate for a variety of polarizing transforms.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2017.2765663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2765663","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/8232491/08080258.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8232491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Construction of Polar Codes for Arbitrary Discrete Memoryless Channels","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/8232491/8080258-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080258/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Construction of Polar Codes for Arbitrary Discrete Memoryless Channels","volume":"64","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17466858","htmlLink":"/document/8080258/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF1217245, CCF1217894 and CCF1422955"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF1217894 and CCF1422955"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CF1217245, CCF1217894, CCF1422955 and CCF1618603"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Construction of Polar Codes for Arbitrary Discrete Memoryless Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-gulcu-2765663-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094923S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8232491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8232491","articleId":"8080258","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8080261,"authors":[{"name":"Haq Nawaz","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Haq","lastName":"Nawaz","orcid":"0000-0003-4218-3821","id":"38497314900"},{"name":"Ibrahim Tekin","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Tekin","orcid":"0000-0001-5716-1348","id":"37267838000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"8080261","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3544},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Antenna measurements","Ports (Computers)","Patch antennas","Microstrip antennas","Couplers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","broadband antennas","electromagnetic wave polarisation","interference suppression","microstrip antennas","multiplexing","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-duplex communication","dual-polarized microstrip patch antenna systems","differential feeding","single-layer patch antennas","slot coupled Tx port","dc isolated Tx-Rx ports","co-planar quarter-wave microstrip fed ports","hybrid coupler","return loss impedance bandwidth","interport RF isolation","in-band nonlinear self-interference","frequency 2.4 GHz","frequency 2.41 GHz","bandwidth 50.0 MHz","bandwidth 20.0 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential antenna","full-duplex antenna","high RF isolation","self-interference cancellation (SIC)"]}],"abstract":"This communication presents two dual-polarized microstrip patch antenna systems based on a single radiating element with 180\u00b0 ring hybrid coupler for differential feeding to achieve high interport RF isolation.

In this paper, we describe an algorithm to construct families of sum-network instances using incidence structures. The computation capacity of several of these sum-network families is evaluated. Unlike the coding capacity of a multiple unicast problem, the computation capacity of sum-networks depends on the characteristic of the finite field over which the sum is computed. This dependence is very strong; we show examples of sum-networks that have a rate-1 solution over one characteristic but a rate close to zero over a different characteristic.

The terminals are randomly deployed around an access point (AP) and are equipped with multiple antennas as well as a rectenna array to harvest energy. In the OBF scheme, the AP acquires channel related feedback from the network's terminals and allocates the orthonormal beams to the users with the best link. We consider the case, where the feedback is solely powered by energy harvested from electromagnetic radiation. Specifically, each terminal adjusts the length of its feedback based on the amount of harvested energy; when the energy is not sufficient to feed back at least one bit, the terminal is considered to be in outage. We study two fundamental rectenna architectures, the direct-current combiner and the radio-frequency combiner (coherent and non-coherent), as well as a hybrid architecture of these two. Furthermore, to alleviate the doubly near-far problem, we consider a scheme where a terminal adapts the number of rectenna elements according to its distance from the origin. By using higher order statistics and stochastic geometry, the beam outage probability is derived in closed form for all considered architectures and scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080263/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","volume":"2","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17633688","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8080263/","dateOfInsertion":"16 March 2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Wireless Powered Feedback Protocol for Opportunistic Beamforming Using Rectenna Arrays","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001810","fundingName":"Research Promotion Foundation, Cyprus, under the project COM-MED","grantNumber":"KOINA/ERANETMED/1114/03"},{"fundingName":"European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme","grantNumber":"739551 (KIOS CoE)"},{"fundingName":"Government of the Republic of Cyprus through the Directorate General for European Programmes, Coordination and Development"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wireless Powered Feedback Protocol for Opportunistic Beamforming Using Rectenna Arrays","sourcePdf":"tgcn-psomas-2765718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117108S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7511293","isNumber":"8318827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7511293","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8318827","articleId":"8080263","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8080267,"authors":[{"name":"Shivesh Ranjan","affiliation":["Center for Robust Speech Systems, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/8124117/8080267/ranja-2765832-small.gif","p":["Shivesh Ranjan (S\u201915) is a Graduate Research Assistant at the\n Center for Robust Speech Systems, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA since the fall of 2014.

This study introduces a novel class of curriculum learning (CL) based algorithms for noise robust speaker recognition. We introduce CL-based approaches at two stages within a state-of-the-art speaker verification system: at the i-Vector extractor estimation and at the probabilistic linear discriminant (PLDA) back-end. Our proposed CL-based approaches operate by categorizing the available training data into progressively more challenging subsets using a suitable difficulty criterion. Next, the corresponding training algorithms are initialized with a subset that is closest to a clean noise-free set, and progressively moving to subsets that are more challenging for training as the algorithms progress. We evaluate the performance of our proposed approaches on the noisy and severely degraded data from the DARPA RATS SID task, and show consistent and significant improvement across multiple test sets over a baseline SID framework with a standard i-Vector extractor and multisession PLDA-based back-end. We also construct a very challenging evaluation set by adding noise to the NIST SRE 2010 C5 extended condition trials, where our proposed CL-based PLDA is shown to offer significant improvements over a traditional PLDA based back-end.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080267/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17394391","htmlLink":"/document/8080267/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Curriculum Learning Based Approaches for Noise Robust Speaker Recognition","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006602","fundingName":"AFRL","grantNumber":"FA8750-15-1-0205"},{"fundingName":"University of Texas at Dallas from the Distinguished University Chair in Telecommunications Engineering"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Curriculum Learning Based Approaches for Noise Robust Speaker Recognition","sourcePdf":"taslp-hansen-2765832-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147114S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"8124117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8124117","articleId":"8080267","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8080309,"authors":[{"name":"Guo-Wei Lu","affiliation":["Network Science and Convergence Device Technology Laboratory, National Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Tokyo, Japan","Institute of Innovative Science and Technology, Tokai University, Hiratsuka, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Guo-Wei Lu (M\u201905) received the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong, in 2005.

Unmodulated pilot subframes are periodically inserted and interleaved with data subframes to form an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. Owing to the coherence between the embedded pilot and data subframes, a Mach-Zehnder delay interferometer with a free spectral range equal to the frequency of the subframe is deployed for the self-homodyne detection of the OFDM signal. It saves the local oscillator and optical hybrid, which are usually used in a conventional coherent receiver, thus reducing the hardware complexity and implementation cost. Meanwhile, the digital signal processing (DSP) for the self-homodyne detection is free from carrier-frequency-offset compensation and carrier-phase estimation, reducing the complexity, power consumption, and latency of the system. It also allows the use of a low-cost laser source as the source for the downstream signal. The proposed scheme provides a cost-effective and energy-efficient downstream solution for optical access networks, owing to the hardware saving and complexity reduction in DSP. A 10-Gb/s OFDM downstream transmission over a 20-km standard single-mode fiber is experimentally demonstrated with an error-free operation, using both a 10-MHz distributed feedback laser and a 100-kHz external cavity laser as downstream laser sources.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2765336","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08080309.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2765336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","startPage":"24602","endPage":"24607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple Self-Homodyne Detection Scheme for Optical OFDM With Inserted Pilot Subframes and Application in Optical Access Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simple Self-Homodyne Detection Scheme for Optical OFDM With Inserted Pilot Subframes and Application in Optical Access Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080309/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17381212","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8080309/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001700","fundingName":"Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan","grantNumber":"15K06033"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Simple Self-Homodyne Detection Scheme for Optical OFDM With Inserted Pilot Subframes and Application in Optical Access Networks","sourcePdf":"access-lu-2765336-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116802S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8080309","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8080312,"authors":[{"name":"Maher Khaliel","affiliation":["Department of Digital Signal Processing, Duisburg-Essen University, Duisburg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7433271/8241467/8080312/khali-2765560-small.gif","p":["Maher Khaliel (M\u201916) received the master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from Benha University in 2012 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Institute of Digital Signal Processing, Duisburg-Essen University in 2016.

Consequently, the tag-ID is configured in two orthogonal planes. The frequency notches are encoded in the co-polarization plane and the re-radiation peaks are encoded in the cross-polarization plane. Therefore, the co/cross-polarizing Notch/Peak modulation scheme presents a novel criterion for maximizing the coding capacity of the chipless RFID systems. Moreover, the cross-polarized response enhances the tag detection in a real environment. The proposed tag and the associated physical modulation scheme are validated using EM simulations and measurements.","doi":"10.1109/JRFID.2017.2765560","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Radio Frequency Identification","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Radio Frequency Identification","pdfPath":"/iel7/7433271/8241467/08080312.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRFID.2017.2765560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8241467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Design Approach for Co/Cross-Polarizing Chipless RFID Tags of High Coding Capacity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080312/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Design Approach for Co/Cross-Polarizing Chipless RFID Tags of High Coding Capacity","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17468753","htmlLink":"/document/8080312/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Design Approach for Co/Cross-Polarizing Chipless RFID Tags of High Coding Capacity","sourcePdf":"jrfid-khaliel-2765560-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076546S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7433271","isNumber":"8241467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7433271","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8241467","articleId":"8080312","onlineDate":"23 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8080319,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Lin I","affiliation":["China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Chih-Lin","lastName":"I","id":"37282841300"},{"name":"Qi Sun","affiliation":["Information and communication engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"bio":{"p":["Qi Sun (sunqiyjy@chinamobile.com) received her B.S.E. and Ph.D. degrees in information and communication engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2009 and 2014, respectively.

Modes 3 and 4 support direct V2V communications but differ on how they allocate the radio resources. Resources are allocated by the cellular network under mode 3. Mode 4 does not require cellular coverage, and vehicles autonomously select their radio resources using a distributed scheduling scheme supported by congestion control mechanisms. Mode 4 is considered the baseline mode and represents an alternative to 802.11p or dedicated shortrange communications (DSRC). In this context, this article also presents a detailed analysis of the performance of LTE-V sidelink mode 4, and proposes a modification to its distributed scheduling.","doi":"10.1109/MVT.2017.2752798","publicationTitle":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/10209/8079088/08080373.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8079088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MVT.2017.2752798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LTE-V for Sidelink 5G V2X Vehicular Communications: A New 5G Technology for Short-Range Vehicle-to-Everything Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"LTE-V for Sidelink 5G V2X Vehicular Communications: A New 5G Technology for Short-Range Vehicle-to-Everything Communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080373/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17377791","volume":"12","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LTE-V for Sidelink 5G V2X Vehicular Communications: A New 5G Technology for Short-Range Vehicle-to-Everything Communications","sourcePdf":"mvt-molina-masegosa-2752798-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024329S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","isNumber":"8079088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10209","citationCount":"236","articleId":"8080373","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8080384,"authors":[{"name":"Aqiel Almamori","affiliation":["Systems Engineering Department UA Little Rock, Little Rock, Arkansas"],"firstName":"Aqiel","lastName":"Almamori","id":"37086240891"},{"name":"Seshadri Mohan","affiliation":["Systems Engineering Department UA Little Rock, Little Rock, Arkansas"],"firstName":"Seshadri","lastName":"Mohan","id":"37407015600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3019-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3018-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3020-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8080384","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Contamination","Interference","MIMO","Fading channels","Antennas","Partial transmit sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal arrival parameters","multicellular massive multiple-input-multiple-output","pilot assignment","pilot contamination","massive MIMO","spectral efficiency","inter-cell interference","pilot sequences","signal parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","Pilot Contamination","Spectral Efficiency"]}],"abstract":"A problem that arises with pilot assignment in multicellular massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems is due to inter-cell interference, also known as pilot contamination.

One aspect of player immersion is the level of challenge the game presents to the player. To avoid a mismatch between a player's skill and the challenge of a game, which can result from traditional manual difficulty selection mechanisms (e.g. easy, medium, hard), Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) has previously been proposed as a means of automatically detecting a player's skill and adjusting the level of challenge the game presents accordingly. This work contributes to the field of DDA by proposing a novel approach to artificially intelligent agents for opponent control. Specifically, we propose four new DDA Artificially Intelligent (AI) agents: Reactive Outcome Sensitive Action Selection (Reactive OSAS), Proactive OSAS, and their \"True\" variants. These agents provide the player with an level of difficulty tailored to their skill in real-time by altering the action selection policy and the heuristic playout evaluation of Monte Carlo Tree Search. The DDA AI agents are tested within the FightingICE engine, which has been used in the past as an environment for AI agent competitions. The results of the experiments against other AI agents and human players show that these novel DDA AI agents can adjust the level of difficulty in real-time, by targeting a zero health difference as the outcome of the fighting game. This work also demonstrates the trade-off existing between targeting the outcome exactly (Reactive OSAS) and introducing proactive behaviour (i.e., the DDA AI agent fights even if the health difference is zero) to increase the agents believability (Proactive OSAS).","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067294/8080400/08080415.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"59","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8080400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2017.8080415","doi":"10.1109/CIG.2017.8080415","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080415","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Artificial intelligence","Monte Carlo methods","Conferences","Computational intelligence","Engines","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","computer games","Monte Carlo methods","software agents","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DDA AI agents","Reactive OSAS","Proactive OSAS","Monte Carlo tree search","dynamic difficulty adjustment","player immersion","DDA Artificially Intelligent agents","AI agent competitions","human players","video game","outcome sensitive action selection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080415/","displayDocTitle":"Monte Carlo tree search based algorithms for dynamic difficulty adjustment","accessionNumber":"17289814","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8080415/","conferenceDate":"22-25 Aug. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monte Carlo tree search based algorithms for dynamic difficulty adjustment","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070253S","chronDate":"22-25 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067294","isNumber":"8080400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067294","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8080400","articleId":"8080415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8080426,"authors":[{"name":"Lewis Horsley","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex, Colchester, UK"],"firstName":"Lewis","lastName":"Horsley","id":"37086248934"},{"name":"Diego Perez-Liebana","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex, Colchester, UK"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Perez-Liebana","id":"37085693107"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3233-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3234-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-4289"}],"articleNumber":"8080426","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":465},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","Sprites (computer)","Generators","Data models","Games","Semantics","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","computer graphics","feedforward neural nets","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep convolutional generative adversarial networks","image generation","Convolutional Neural Networks","computer vision domain","available sprite data","automatic sprite generator","CNN","game-style sprite generation","DCGAN","unsupervised learning","human-like characters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080426","abstract":"In recent years, image generation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has become increasingly popular in the computer vision domain.

A possible reason for this is that the amount of available sprite data in games is significantly less than in other domains, which typically use hundreds of thousands of images, or even more. In this work, we provide some beginning evidence that CNNs can be utilized for game-style sprite generation, even with small input datasets. We utilize a class of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) known as a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for unsupervised learning and generation of new sprites. We have trained our network on various custom datasets, which contains human-like characters, faces and creatures in general.

Being an important sub-field in General Artificial Intelligence, GVGP has drawn a considerable amount of interest, and the research in this field got intensified with the release of General Video Game AI framework and competition. As of today, even though this problem has been approached with many different techniques, it is still far from being solved. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is one of the most promising baseline approaches in literature. In this study, MCTS algorithm is enhanced with a recently developed temporal- difference learning method, namely True Online Sarsa(lambda) to make it able to exploit domain knowledge by using past experience. Experiments show that the proposed modifications improve the performance of MCTS significantly in GVGP, and applications of reinforcement learning techniques in this domain is a promising subject that needs to be further researched.","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067294/8080400/08080453.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"324","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8080400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2017.8080453","doi":"10.1109/CIG.2017.8080453","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080453","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Conferences","Monte Carlo methods","Mathematical model","Computational intelligence","Learning systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","learning (artificial intelligence)","Monte Carlo methods","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reinforcement learning","True Online Sarsa","general artificial intelligence","Monte Carlo tree search","temporal- difference learning method","GVGP","general video game playing","temporal-difference learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080453/","displayDocTitle":"Monte Carlo tree search with temporal-difference learning for general video game playing","accessionNumber":"17303346","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8080453/","conferenceDate":"22-25 Aug. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monte Carlo tree search with temporal-difference learning for general video game playing","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"46.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097034S","chronDate":"22-25 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067294","isNumber":"8080400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067294","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8080400","articleId":"8080453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8080479,"authors":[{"name":"Nazire Merve \u00d6nder","affiliation":["Transportation, Security, Energy & Automation Systems Vice Presidency, ASELSAN INC., Ankara, TURKEY"],"firstName":"Nazire Merve","lastName":"\u00d6nder","id":"37086214899"},{"name":"Muhammet Can \u00c7akmak","affiliation":["Transportation, Security, Energy & Automation Systems Vice Presidency, ASELSAN INC., Ankara, TURKEY"],"firstName":"Muhammet Can","lastName":"\u00c7akmak","id":"37086223031"},{"name":"\u00d6nder \u00dcnver","affiliation":["Transportation, Security, Energy & Automation Systems Vice Presidency, ASELSAN INC., Ankara, TURKEY"],"firstName":"\u00d6nder","lastName":"\u00dcnver","id":"37085881487"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4922-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4923-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4550"}],"articleNumber":"8080479","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"abstract":"Being able to record and analyze data securely have a paramount importance to meet the needs of both military and civilian applications.

EKF2 improves the attitude estimation if GPS information is present. The third filter EKF3 determines the remaining state variables including the biases in an external loop if GPS measurement is available and tolerates the large difference between IMU and GPS frequencies. The method can be applied for state estimation of any type of vehicles. It is especially useful for vehicles having large (2-3 G) acceleration changes typical for UAVs. The results can later be used for identification of the nonlinear dynamic model of vehicles (control surface, thrust and inertia effects) building the basis for advanced control.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Intelligent Systems and Informatics (SISY)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067714/8080518/08080535.pdf","startPage":"000111","endPage":"000116","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Intelligent Systems and Informatics (SISY)","doi":"10.1109/SISY.2017.8080535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SISY.2017.8080535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8080518","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State estimation for UAVs using sensor fusion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["State estimation","Global Positioning System","Acceleration","Three-dimensional displays","Mathematical model","Earth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acceleration control","attitude measurement","autonomous aerial vehicles","Global Positioning System","Kalman filters","sensor fusion","state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state estimation","sensor fusion","unmanned aerial vehicles","three-loop technique","attitude estimation","GPS information","extended Kalman filters","UAV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["State estimation","EKF approach","Sensor fusion","UAV","Real flight data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080535/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"State estimation for UAVs using sensor fusion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8080535/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17291019","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State estimation for UAVs using sensor fusion","confLoc":"Subotica, Serbia","sourcePdf":"17sisy2017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061062S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067714","isNumber":"8080518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067714","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8080518","articleId":"8080535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8080544,"authors":[{"name":"Egbert Gedat","affiliation":["Telematics Research Group, Wildau Technical University of Applied Sciences, Wildau, Germany"],"firstName":"Egbert","lastName":"Gedat","id":"37086090201"},{"name":"Pascal Fechner","affiliation":["Telematics Research Group, Wildau Technical University of Applied Sciences, Wildau, Germany"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Fechner","id":"37086091904"},{"name":"Richard Fiebelkorn","affiliation":["Telematics Research Group, Wildau Technical University of Applied Sciences, Wildau, Germany"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Fiebelkorn","id":"37086091581"},{"name":"Ralf Vandenhouten","affiliation":["Telematics Research Group, Wildau Technical University of Applied Sciences, Wildau, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Vandenhouten","id":"37448776600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3855-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3854-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3856-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-0488"}],"articleNumber":"8080544","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":314},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Training","Videos","Skeleton","Legged locomotion","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation-maximisation algorithm","feature extraction","hidden Markov models","image classification","image motion analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","maximum likelihood estimation","neural nets","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pose detection","separate hidden Markov model","trained artificial neural network","hidden Markov models","neural network derived poses","human action recognition method","MOCAP motion capture database","manual pose classification"]}],"abstract":"A human action recognition method is introduced that detects a set of actions in videos by a temporal expansion with hidden Markov models of a pose detection with an artificial neural network.

It was trained with the skeletons and a manual pose classification of 370 key frame images from the motions resulting in an accuracy of 83.5 %. Three actions prevalent in the used motions were chosen to be recognized with the interplay of one separate hidden Markov model for each action. From the output of the trained artificial neural network for all 1,891 frames of seven of the eleven motions together with a manual pose and action classification the matrices of the hidden Markov models for the four actions were calculated. A tailored maximum likelihood estimation based on the Viterbi algorithm generated an action proposal for each frame.

The entire process of developing a face recognition model is described in detail. This model is composed of several essential steps developed using today's most advanced techniques: CNN cascade for face detection and CNN for generating face embeddings. The primary goal of this research was the practical employment of these state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for face recognition tasks. Due to the fact that CNNs achieve the best results for larger datasets, which is not the case in production environment, the main challenge was applying these methods on smaller datasets. A new approach for image augmentation for face recognition tasks is proposed. The overall accuracy was 95.02% on a small dataset of the original face images of employees in the real-time environment. The proposed face recognition model could be integrated in another system with or without some minor alternations as a supporting or a main component for monitoring purposes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8080587/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17303633","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"FaceTime \u2014 Deep learning based face recognition attendance system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FaceTime \u2014 Deep learning based face recognition attendance system","confLoc":"Subotica, Serbia","sourcePdf":"7sisy2017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054585S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067714","isNumber":"8080518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067714","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8080518","articleId":"8080587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":8080599,"authors":[{"name":"O.

For a given hyperspectral data, dictionary learned sparse representation is first applied to extract the sparse feature. Then, random subspace ensembles (RSEs) based on k-nearest neighbor classifier (k-NN) is performed, by randomly selecting subsets of components without replacement from sparse feature space, conducting k-NN classifiers on the subsets, and combining classification results with majority voting. Finally, spatial contextual information is combined for improving the classification results obtained in the second step by means of an iteratively probabilistic estimated regularization (IPER) method. Experiments are presented using AVIRIS hyperspectral images and the proposed classification scheme is compared with other classification maps obtained by some other methods.

After a preliminary oversegmentation of the image using superpixels, the superpixel segment averages are considered as the nodes of graph. A measure of spectral similarity (Euclidean distance) is used as edge weights. Superpixel segmentation is employed to reduce the effects of noise and artifacts existent in CRISM images and also to reduce the number of the points to be analyzed. Graph theoretic quantities are used to identify the points which lie on the boundary of the data cloud. Endmembers and anomalies belong to the set of the boundary points. Endmembers are the points on the convex hull and anomalies which are outliers in the data cloud can be found by ranking out of the boundary points set. This method can be applied to the images without imposing any assumptions on the type of mixing or the shape of the data cloud. We validate our approach by applying the method to some hyperspectral images and compare the endmembers and anomalies extracted by our approach and the ones identified by scientists.","doi":"10.1109/WHISPERS.2013.8080650","publicationTitle":"2013 5th Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 5th Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8054774/8080590/08080650.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WHISPERS.2013.8080650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8080590","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph-based identification of boundary points for unmixing and anomaly detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Graph-based identification of boundary points for unmixing and anomaly detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080650/","conferenceDate":"26-28 June 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"17289105","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8080650/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph-based identification of boundary points for unmixing and anomaly detection","confLoc":"Gainesville, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"whispers2013submission158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039676S","chronDate":"26-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"8054774","isNumber":"8080590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8054774","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8080590","articleId":"8080650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8080688,"authors":[{"name":"Edisanter Lo","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences Selinsgrove, Susquehanna University, PA, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Edisanter","lastName":"Lo","id":"38194025700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1119-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1118-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1120-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-6276"}],"articleNumber":"8080688","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"abstract":"Detection of anomalous objects in a large scene is an important application of hyperspectral imaging in remote sensing.

The Maximized Subspace Model (MSM) detector has the best probability of detection in comparison with the other anomaly detectors that are based on this model. This paper proposes an anomaly detection algorithm that is based on a more general model than the MSM detector. The anomaly detector is also defined as the Mahalanobis distance of the resulting residual.

Attempts to perform object classification based on these observed radiances often produce poor results, grouping pixels under shaded areas as being a part of the same class. By fusing LiDAR and HSI data through a physical model, we develop a simple and efficient illumination correction method to remove the direct illumination component of the observed HSI radiance data. This correction then enables accurate object classification, regardless of whether spectral signatures are exposed directly to sunlight. In addition, methods for estimating the area under shadow and geometric parameters such as direct illumination factor and sky-view factor from LiDAR data are presented.","doi":"10.1109/WHISPERS.2013.8080730","publicationTitle":"2013 5th Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 5th Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8054774/8080590/08080730.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WHISPERS.2013.8080730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8080590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting objects under shadows by fusion of hyperspectral and LiDAR DATA: A physical model approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080730/","displayDocTitle":"Detecting objects under shadows by fusion of hyperspectral and LiDAR DATA: A physical model approach","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"17289089","htmlLink":"/document/8080730/","conferenceDate":"26-28 June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting objects under shadows by fusion of hyperspectral and LiDAR DATA: A physical model approach","confLoc":"Gainesville, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"whispers2013submission79.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046161S","chronDate":"26-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"8054774","isNumber":"8080590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8054774","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8080590","articleId":"8080730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8080814,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Xiao Sheng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Liu Xiao","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37086233855"},{"name":"Sun He","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Sun","lastName":"He","id":"37086232796"},{"name":"Gu Xuan Pu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Gu Xuan","lastName":"Pu","id":"37086241805"},{"name":"Xu Dian Guo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xu Dian","lastName":"Guo","id":"37086235579"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2894-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2895-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8080814","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Estimation","Low voltage","Mathematical model","Interpolation","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","channel estimation","error statistics","fading channels","least mean squares methods","multipath channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM","low voltage power line communication","frequency selective fading","multipath transmission","channel energy","rest N-L taps","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing technology","LMMSE channel estimation algorithm","linear minimum mean square error method","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LMMSE channel estimation algorithm","OFDM","low voltage power line"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technology is the preferred technique for low voltage power line communication because it can combat the frequency selective fading caused by multi-path transmission effectively.

From the simulation results of the BER and MSE performance, it can be concluded that the proposed method decreases the compute complexity but does not sacrifice the basic performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved LMMSE channel estimation algorithm for OFDM-based low voltage power line","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Transportation Electrification Conference and Expo, Asia-Pacific (ITEC Asia-Pacific)","doi":"10.1109/ITEC-AP.2017.8080814","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Transportation Electrification Conference and Expo, Asia-Pacific (ITEC Asia-Pacific)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067713/8080752/08080814.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITEC-AP.2017.8080814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8080752","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8080814/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"An improved LMMSE channel estimation algorithm for OFDM-based low voltage power line","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8080814/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290912","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved LMMSE channel estimation algorithm for OFDM-based low voltage power line","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"p333liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051813S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067713","isNumber":"8080752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067713","xplore-issue":"8080752","articleId":"8080814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8080844,"authors":[{"name":"Yinghao Jia","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yinghao","lastName":"Jia","id":"37086216244"},{"name":"Huimiao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huimiao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086174367"},{"name":"Jiaoyang Li","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiaoyang","lastName":"Li","id":"37086223872"},{"name":"Fang He","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"He","id":"37086221086"},{"name":"Meng Li","affiliation":["Department of Civil Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085881378"},{"name":"Zechun Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zechun","lastName":"Hu","id":"37900496100"},{"name":"Zuo-Jun Max Shen","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zuo-Jun Max","lastName":"Shen","id":"37086224143"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2894-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2895-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8080844","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":324},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Public transportation","Charging stations","Global Positioning System","Vehicles","Supply chains","Batteries","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery powered vehicles","data mining","Global Positioning System","pattern clustering","road vehicles","traffic information systems","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encouraging policies","data mining technology","Beijing","ET driving patterns","transport energy supply chain","Global Positioning System data","data-driven method","ET charging infrastructure","electric taxi charging system","big cities","electric taxis","purchasing subsidies","accessorial public facilities","real-time vehicle trajectory data","urban conventional taxis","suburban ET","GPS data","time 4.0 week"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric taxis","transport energy supply chain","charging station planning","data-driven approach"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8080844","abstract":"Administration in big cities is strongly promoting electric taxis (ETs) by providing purchasing subsidies, accessorial public facilities and many other encouraging policies.

The initial design dimensions are proposed by sizing equation and the 3D finite- element analysis (FEA).

This has resulted in the integration of renewable energy into the existing grids. With the developments in renewable energy sector taking mammoth steps, it is equally important to consider and enhance the transmission line capacities. Transmission of power to the consumer end is desirable to be done at high voltage levels to reduce the line losses that occur. But the transmission of power at higher voltages; in the magnitude of several hundreds of kilovolts, again pose a limiting factor in the design and useful life estimation of overhead transmission line insulators. In this paper, the life estimation of composite insulators used in overhead transmission lines is studied. The use of composite insulators for overhead transmission lines picked up momentum over the last few decades. Composite silicone insulators when being used as overhead transmission lines, are subjected to multiple stresses some of them being, wind, rain, ultra violet radiations, temperature, mechanical, thermal and electrical, which reduces their life drastically. Hence the prediction of life time of these insulators is of prime importance. In this paper a fuzzy logic controller is developed which is capable of predicting the life of composite insulators. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is used to enhance the accuracy of the model. Mamdani model of fuzzy logic controller is used, with a combination of Triangular and Gaussian membership functions. It is found that the particle swarm optimization tuned controller with multi membership function rule set gives lower error than a fuzzy logic controller without optimization. The result obtained from simulation with and without optimization is compared with the experimental data available to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system.","doi":"10.1109/ICPEDC.2017.8081075","startPage":"137","endPage":"141","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Power and Embedded Drive Control (ICPEDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPEDC.2017.8081075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081048","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Power and Embedded Drive Control (ICPEDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067314/8081048/08081075.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Remaining life estimation of a overhead composite insulator using particle swarm optimization technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081075/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Remaining life estimation of a overhead composite insulator using particle swarm optimization technique","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081075/","accessionNumber":"17289878","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remaining life estimation of a overhead composite insulator using particle swarm optimization technique","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"RP026079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067872S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067314","isNumber":"8081048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067314","xplore-issue":"8081048","articleId":"8081075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8081087,"authors":[{"name":"Nishant Kashyap","affiliation":["Dept of Electrical and Electronics engineering, Birla Institute of Technology, Ranchi, India"],"firstName":"Nishant","lastName":"Kashyap","id":"37089136096"},{"name":"Shivani Patidar","affiliation":["Dept of Electrical and Electronics engineering, RGPV, Bhopal, India"],"firstName":"Shivani","lastName":"Patidar","id":"37086228872"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4679-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4677-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4680-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8081087","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081087","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Torque","Switching loss","Stator windings","Inverters","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic distortion","induction motor drives","invertors","machine control","predictive control","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medium voltage drives","predefined prediction horizon","torque characteristics","drive structure","neutral point clamped induction drive","inverter fed induction drive","model predictive direct torque control","neutral point clamped inverter","THD reduction","multiple input multiple output system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["model predictive control (MPC)","Model predictive direct torque control(MPDTC)","Neutral point clamped (NPC)","space vector modulation(SVM)","total harmonic distortion(THD)"]}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on the modern approach for Model Predictive Direct Torque Control(MPDTC) concept using a neutral point clamped inverter fed induction drive.

The method can be further used for the controlling of various parameters together because of its multiple input multiple output system compatibility thereby compacting the drive structure.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPEDC.2017.8081087","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Power and Embedded Drive Control (ICPEDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Power and Embedded Drive Control (ICPEDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067314/8081048/08081087.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"207","doi":"10.1109/ICPEDC.2017.8081087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model predictive direct torque control of neutral point clamped induction drive","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2017","displayDocTitle":"Model predictive direct torque control of neutral point clamped induction drive","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081087/","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"17289925","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081087/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model predictive direct torque control of neutral point clamped induction drive","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"RP038137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044328S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067314","isNumber":"8081048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067314","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8081048","articleId":"8081087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8081101,"authors":[{"name":"Karan C.

NARX feedback NN is employed to implement the frequency independent RCG scheme. Usually, such schemes need to be individually implemented for each phase resulting in increased complexity. Alternately, NARX feedback NN processes the 3-phase current quantities and unit vector templates (UVT) for the estimation of fundamental active component of load current, compensating currents and consequently, reference source currents. The inputs for NARX feedback NN are the previous two sample of the estimated compensating current and fundamental active component of the load current, along with the present and the previous samples of load current and UVT. The control system ensures that the source currents match the respective reference values resulting in total harmonic distortion less than 5% and unity power factor at the supply end. Thus, with the proposed scheme, the SAF eliminates current harmonics, and compensates for the reactive power and load unbalancing. The performance of SAF with NARX feedback NN based RCG is analyzed under load variations, frequency variations, load unbalancing and distorted supply.","doi":"10.1109/ICPEDC.2017.8081101","startPage":"280","endPage":"285","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Power and Embedded Drive Control (ICPEDC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067314/8081048/08081101.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Power and Embedded Drive Control (ICPEDC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPEDC.2017.8081101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shunt active filtering with NARX feedback neural networks based reference current generation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Active filters","Phase locked loops","Logic gates","Steady-state","Power quality","Batteries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","feedback","harmonic distortion","power factor","power harmonic filters","power system harmonics","reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NARX feedback NN","active filtering","NARX feedback neural networks","3-phase shunt active filter","frequency independent RCG scheme","compensating currents","reference source currents","estimated compensating current","SAF eliminates current harmonics","nonlinear autoregressive exogenous feedback neural networks based reference current generation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active filters","nonlinear autoregressive exogenous feedback neural networks","power quality","shunt active filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081101/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2017","displayDocTitle":"Shunt active filtering with NARX feedback neural networks based reference current generation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081101/","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2017","accessionNumber":"17289927","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shunt active filtering with NARX feedback neural networks based reference current generation","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"RP052236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060178S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067314","isNumber":"8081048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067314","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8081048","articleId":"8081101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081115,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Manda","affiliation":["Department of EEE, VFSTR University, Vadlamudi, INDIA"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Manda","id":"37086233494"},{"name":"K.

Typically, the latter is accomplished via constraints relating the output and input interaural transfer functions (ITFs). The ITF is a function of the corresponding relative acoustic transfer function (RATF), which implies that RATF estimates of all sources in the acoustic scene are required. Here, we propose an alternative way to approximately preserve the binaural cues of the entire acoustic scene without estimating RATFs. We propose to preserve the binaural cues of all sources with a set of fixed pre-determined RATFs distributed around the head. Two recently proposed binaural BFs are evaluated in the context of using pre-determined RATFs and compared to the binaural minimum variance distrortionless response BF which can only preserve the binaural cues of the target.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081157","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081157.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081157","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Binaural beamforming using pre-determined relative acoustic transfer functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Binaural beamforming using pre-determined relative acoustic transfer functions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081157/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081157/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17289959","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binaural beamforming using pre-determined relative acoustic transfer functions","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055907S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081159,"authors":[{"name":"Mathieu Fontaine","affiliation":["Inria, Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Mathieu","lastName":"Fontaine","id":"37086245260"},{"name":"Charles Vanwynsberghe","affiliation":["Institut Jean Le Rond d\u2019 Alembert, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Vanwynsberghe","id":"37086245305"},{"name":"Antoine Liutkus","affiliation":["Inria, Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Antoine","lastName":"Liutkus","id":"38557427700"},{"name":"Roland Badeau","affiliation":["LTCI, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, France"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Badeau","id":"38556089800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081159","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","Time-frequency analysis","Microphone arrays","Acoustics","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","blind source separation","convolution","geometry","microphone arrays","statistical distributions","time-frequency analysis","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel \u03b1-stable distributions","sound source localization","microphone array","probabilistic techniques","Gaussian models","\u03b1-stable harmonizable processes","classical convolutive mixing model","microphones","scalable source localization","acoustic imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["source localization","acoustic modeling","\u03b1-stable random variables","spectral measure","sketching"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081159","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081159","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","abstract":"In this paper, we focus on the problem of sound source localization and we propose a technique that exploits the known and arbitrary geometry of the microphone array.

Specifically, our architecture combines i) a Haar wavelet-based tree-like convolutional neural network (CNN), ii) a random layer realizing a radial basis function kernel approximation, and iii) a linear classifier. While stages i) and ii) are completely pre-specified, only the linear classifier is learned from data. We apply the proposed architecture to outdoor scene and aerial image semantic segmentation and show that the accuracy of our architecture is competitive with conventional pixel classification CNNs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture is data efficient in the sense of matching the accuracy of pixel classification CNNs when trained on a much smaller data set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081169/","accessionNumber":"17290424","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081169/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Deep structured features for semantic segmentation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep structured features for semantic segmentation","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570342819.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050305S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081171,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Passalis","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Passalis","id":"37085793507"},{"name":"Anastasios Tefas","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Anastasios","lastName":"Tefas","id":"37299690600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081171","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081171","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Drones","Convolutional codes","Convolution","Histograms","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile robots","neural nets","pose estimation","remotely operated vehicles","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["different drone-related tasks","human concept detection","lightweight convolutional neural networks","steering drone video shooting","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","drones","video shooting tasks","deep learning techniques","memory constraints","face pose estimation","aerial shots","CNNs","feedforward speed"]}],"abstract":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, also known as drones, are becoming increasingly popular for video shooting tasks since they are capable of capturing spectacular aerial shots.

In situations of multiple microphone deployment, our method allows for the selection of the best microphone pair as part of the modeling and supports ad-hoc microphone placement.

The least mean square (LMS) class of algorithms is commonly used to mitigate this by providing adaptive feedback cancellation (AFC). The speech quality after AFC and the amount of added stable gain (ASG) with AFC are used to assess these algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a variant of the LMS that promotes sparsity in estimating the acoustic feedback path.

Popular strategies are cross-validation or Bayesian inference, yet it remains an active topic of research in order to offer better or faster algorithms. The models considered here are sparse regression models with convex or non-convex group-Lasso-like penalties. Following the recent work of Pereyra et al. [1] we study the fixed point iteration algorithm they propose and show that, while it may be suitable for an analysis prior, it suffers from limitations when using high-dimensional sparse synthesis models. The first contribution of this paper is to show how to overcome this issue. Secondly, we demonstrate how one can extend the model to estimate a vector of regularization parameters. We illustrate this on models with group sparsity reporting improved support recovery and reduced amplitude bias on the estimated coefficients. This approach is compared with an alternative method that uses a single parameter but a non-convex penalty. Results are presented on simulations and an inverse problem relevant for neuroscience which is the localization of brain activations using magneto/electroencephalography.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081206/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17290048","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081206/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Hyperparameter estimation in maximum a posteriori regression using group sparsity with an application to brain imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperparameter estimation in maximum a posteriori regression using group sparsity with an application to brain imaging","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094426S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8081213,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Barni","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Siena, Siena, Toscana, IT"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Barni","id":"37267303900"},{"name":"Ehsan Nowroozi","affiliation":["University of Siena Via Roma 56, Siena, ITALY"],"firstName":"Ehsan","lastName":"Nowroozi","id":"37545965500"},{"name":"Benedetta Tondi","affiliation":["University of Siena Via Roma 56, Siena, ITALY"],"firstName":"Benedetta","lastName":"Tondi","id":"38548597400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081213","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Detectors","Transform coding","Training","Support vector machines","Discrete cosine transforms","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","security of data","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adversary-aware double JPEG detector","JPEG compression steps","heterogeneous processing","SVM classifier","double JPEG detection","counter-forensic attacks","C-F attacks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081213","abstract":"In this paper we present an adversary-aware double JPEG detector which is capable of detecting the presence of two JPEG compression steps even in the presence of heterogeneous processing and counter-forensic (C-F) attacks. The detector is based on an SVM classifier fed with a large number of features and trained to recognise the traces left by double JPEG detection in the presence of attacks. Since it is not possible to train the SVM on all possible kinds of processing and C-F attacks, a selected set of images, manipulated with a limited number of attacks is added to the training set. The processing tools used for training are chosen among those that proved to be most effective in disabling double JPEG detection. Experimental results prove that training on such a kind of most powerful attacks allows good detection in the presence of a much wider variety of attacks and processing.

Our approach to the graph adjacency matrix learning takes into account both the image luminance and the spatial samples' distances, and leads to a flexible and computationally light parametric procedure. We show that, under mild conditions, the proposed procedure identifies a near optimal graph for Markovian fields; specifically, the links identified by the learning procedure minimize the potential energy of the Markov random field for the signal samples under concern. We also show, by numerical simulations, that the learned adjacency matrix leads to a higly compact spectral wavelet graph transform of the so obtained signal on graph and favourably compares to state-of-the-art graph learning procedures, definetly matching the intrinsic signal structure.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Potential energy","Signal processing","Laplace equations","Europe","Wavelet transforms","Markov random fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","image sampling","Markov processes","matrix algebra","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learned adjacency matrix","higly compact spectral wavelet graph","graph adjacency matrix learning","irregularly sampled Markovian natural images","signal processing","observed signal values","graph smoothness","irregularly sampled image values","spatial samples","computationally light parametric procedure","learning procedure","Markov random field","intrinsic signal structure"]}],"doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081232","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081232.pdf","startPage":"375","endPage":"379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph adjacency matrix learning for irregularly sampled Markovian natural images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Graph adjacency matrix learning for irregularly sampled Markovian natural images","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081232/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081232/","accessionNumber":"17290088","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph adjacency matrix learning for irregularly sampled Markovian natural images","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043413S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8081234,"authors":[{"name":"Jianshu Zhang","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Jianshu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085767790"},{"name":"Martin Haardt","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Haardt","id":"37285060400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081234","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":525},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Training","OFDM","MIMO","Discrete Fourier transforms","Frequency estimation","Precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","discrete Fourier transforms","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3-D standard ESPRIT","beamspace ESPRIT","frequency-selective channel","discrete Fourier transforms","channel estimation","DFT beamspace based channel estimation algorithm","decoding matrices","analog precoding","phase shift networks","analog processing","millimeter wave hybrid analog-digital MIMO system","CP-OFDM","cyclic prefix OFDM","hybrid multicarrier MmWave massive MIMO systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MmWave Massive MIMO","hybrid precoding and decoding","multi-dimensional harmonic retrieval","Standard ESPRIT in DFT beamspace"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the channel estimation problem for a cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) based millimeter wave (mmWave) hybrid analog-digital MIMO system, where the analog processing is achieved using only phase shift networks.

Therefore, arrays of vector sensors possess some desirable directional properties compared to conventional arrays of pressure sensors. In this paper, a modal beamformer for circular arrays of 1-D acoustic vectors sensors are presented. Arrays of both radially and circumferentially oriented vector sensors are considered. It is shown that the highly directional modes of the acoustic velocity field can be extracted from the sensor measurements using the spatial Fourier transform. These modes are weighted and combined to form narrow steerable beams. The highest order of mode that can be extracted is limited by the number of vector sensors utilized in the array. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations indicate that the proposed modal beamformer attains the same directivity performance as that of circular pressure sensor array beamformers but outperforms them in terms of white noise gain. In addition, it uses half the number of sensors to achieve the same directivity performance of a circular vector sensor array modal beamformer reported previously in the literature.

On the other hand, a frequently changing BS-user association renders considerable operational burden for network management, e.g., it consumes extra power to awaken the deactivated BSs and to support users' switching among BSs. This motivates us to balance the flexibility and stability of BS-user association, leading to a long-term BS association problem. In this paper, we address this by considering the green communication problem in a MISO network where multiple BSs cooperatively forward information to multiple users. We minimize total power consumption (including not only the transmit power and device maintenance power, but also the switching power consumed as the BS-user association changes) by joint long-term BS activation and beamforming, i.e., we jointly optimize the active BSs, the transmit beamformer and the user switching frequency among BSs. Due to the inherent causality constraints on channel state information (CSI), we develop an online algorithm for the optimization problem, utilizing the sample average approximation (SAA) method. To improve the algorithm's efficiency, we further fit the problem into the framework of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and finally design a low-complexity distributed online algorithm for the green communication problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17290449","htmlLink":"/document/8081240/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"An online algorithm for joint long-term base station activation and beamforming in green downlink MISO networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An online algorithm for joint long-term base station activation and beamforming in green downlink MISO networks","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570341616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066572S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081241,"authors":[{"name":"Eleftherios Kofidis","affiliation":["Computer Technology Institute & Press \u201cDiophantus\u201d (CTI), Patras, Greece","Department of Statistics and Insurance Science, University of Piraeus, Piraeus, Greece"],"firstName":"Eleftherios","lastName":"Kofidis","id":"37294376400"},{"name":"Christos Chatzichristos","affiliation":["National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athinon, GR"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Chatzichristos"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 L.

In particular, offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM)-based FBMC has received increasing attention due to, among other features, its potential for maximum spectral efficiency. It suffers, however, from an intrinsic self-interference effect, which complicates signal processing tasks at the receiver, including synchronization, channel estimation and equalization. In a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configuration, the multi-antenna interference has also to be taken into account. (Semi-)blind FBMC/OQAM receivers have been little studied so far and mainly for single-antenna systems. The problem of joint channel estimation and data detection in a MIMO-FBMC/OQAM system, given limited or no training information, is studied in this paper through a tensor-based viewpoint in the light of the success of such techniques in OFDM applications. Simulation-based comparisons with CP-OFDM are included, for realistic transmission models.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference

Despite various techniques have been proposed in the literature to detect and recognize buried objects, automatic and easy to use systems providing accurate performance are still under research. Given the incredible results achieved by deep learning in many detection tasks, in this paper we propose a pipeline for buried landmine detection based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to ground-penetrating radar (GPR) images. The proposed algorithm is capable of recognizing whether a B-scan profile obtained from GPR acquisitions contains traces of buried mines. Validation of the presented system is carried out on real GPR acquisitions, albeit system training can be performed simply relying on synthetically generated data. Results show that it is possible to reach 95% of detection accuracy without training in real acquisition of landmine profiles.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Landmine detection from GPR data using convolutional neural networks","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081259","startPage":"508","endPage":"512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081259.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Landmine detection from GPR data using convolutional neural networks","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081259/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290412","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Landmine detection from GPR data using convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067068S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081266,"authors":[{"name":"Hari Krishna Vydana","affiliation":["LTRC, KCIS, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Hari Krishna","lastName":"Vydana","id":"37085546041"},{"name":"Anil Kumar Vuppala","affiliation":["LTRC, KCIS, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Anil Kumar","lastName":"Vuppala","id":"38233259800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081266","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":404},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081266","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Hidden Markov models","Neural networks","Training","Speech","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["residual neural networks","deep learning methods","Hidden Markov model-Deep neural network based speech recognition system","deep neural network architectures","WSJ corpus","convergence","WER error rates"]}],"doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081266","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081266.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","startPage":"543","endPage":"547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Residual neural networks for speech recognition","abstract":"Recent developments in deep learning methods have greatly influenced the performances of speech recognition systems. In a Hidden Markov model-Deep neural network (HMM-DNN) based speech recognition system, DNNs have been employed to model senones (context dependent states of HMM), where HMMs capture the temporal relations among senones. Due to the use of more deeper networks significant improvement in the performances has been observed and developing deep learning methods to train more deeper architectures has gained a lot of scientific interest. Optimizing a deeper network is more complex task than to optimize a less deeper network, but recently residual network have exhibited a capability to train a very deep neural network architectures and are not prone to vanishing/exploding gradient problems. In this work, the effectiveness of residual networks have been explored for of speech recognition. Along with the depth of the residual network, the criticality of width of the residual network has also been studied. It has been observed that at higher depth, width of the networks is also a crucial parameter for attaining significant improvements. A 14-hour subset of WSJ corpus is used for training the speech recognition systems, it has been observed that the residual networks have shown much ease in convergence even with a depth much higher than the deep neural network. In this work, using residual networks an absolute reduction of 0.4 in WER error rates (8% reduction in the relative error) is attained compared to the best performing deep neural network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081266/","accessionNumber":"17290379","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081266/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Residual neural networks for speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Residual neural networks for speech recognition","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045744S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":8081267,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Braun","affiliation":["Institute of Neuroinformatics, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Braun","id":"37086212824"},{"name":"Daniel Neil","affiliation":["Institute of Neuroinformatics, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Neil","id":"37085557885"},{"name":"Shih-Chii Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Neuroinformatics, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Shih-Chii","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086227348"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081267","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":348},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Signal to noise ratio","Noise robustness","Training data","Noise measurement","Feature extraction","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","speech enhancement","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noisy training samples","training data","ACCAN","PEM methods","end-to-end speech recognition pipeline","curriculum learning method","improved noise robustness","automatic speech recognition systems","feature enhancement techniques","accordion annealing","multistage training schedule","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR value","per-epoch noise mixing","speech enhancement","curriculum training strategy","word error rate","noise figure 0.0 dB","noise figure 50.0 dB","noise figure 20.0 dB to -10 dB"]}],"abstract":"The performance of automatic speech recognition systems under noisy environments still leaves room for improvement. Speech enhancement or feature enhancement techniques for increasing noise robustness of these systems usually add components to the recognition system that need careful optimization. In this work, we propose the use of a relatively simple curriculum training strategy called accordion annealing (ACCAN). It uses a multi-stage training schedule where samples at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values as low as 0dB are first added and samples at increasing higher SNR values are gradually added up to an SNR value of 50dB. We also use a method called per-epoch noise mixing (PEM) that generates noisy training samples online during training and thus enables dynamically changing the SNR of our training data. Both the ACCAN and the PEM methods are evaluated on a end-to-end speech recognition pipeline on the Wall Street Journal corpus. ACCAN decreases the average word error rate (WER) on the 20dB to -10dB SNR range by up to 31.4% when compared to a conventional multi-condition training method.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081267","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081267.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","startPage":"548","endPage":"552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A curriculum learning method for improved noise robustness in automatic speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A curriculum learning method for improved noise robustness in automatic speech recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081267/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290101","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081267/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A curriculum learning method for improved noise robustness in automatic speech recognition","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570341635.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10526S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081281,"authors":[{"name":"Victor Monzon Baeza","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, University Carlos III of Madrid"],"firstName":"Victor Monzon","lastName":"Baeza","id":"37085511049"},{"name":"Ana Garcia Armada","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, University Carlos III of Madrid"],"firstName":"Ana Garcia","lastName":"Armada","id":"37281702200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081281","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Receiving antennas","Rician channels","Differential phase shift keying","Europe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential phase shift keying","error statistics","receiving antennas","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["M-DPSK","Rician fading","large-scale single input multiple output","noise ratio","receiver design","receive antennas","DPSK modulation","NC LS-SIMO","SIMO system","error probability","Rician-K fading channel"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the performance of a non-coherent large scale SIMO system based on M-DPSK under Rician fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081281","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081281","startPage":"618","endPage":"622","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081281.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","abstract":"In this paper we extend the analysis of the performance of a non-coherent large-scale single input multiple output (LS-SIMO) uplink system based on M-DPSK to consider Rician-K fading channel conditions. The interference is analyzed for a generalized k-factor and we provide analytical expressions of the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) for a single user. We demonstrate that for Rician fading our proposed system is independent of the channel statistics, which simplifies the receiver design. The performance is evaluated in terms of the required number of antennas and the error probability. Finally, we provide numerical results showing that our proposal require a lower number of receive antennas to achieve a given error probability than other non-coherent benchmark schemes available in the literature. As the results show an increase in the spectral efficiency using DPSK modulation combined with NC LS-SIMO, this makes it a good candidate for 5G and beyond.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081281/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081281/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17289979","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the performance of a non-coherent large scale SIMO system based on M-DPSK under Rician fading","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the performance of a non-coherent large scale SIMO system based on M-DPSK under Rician fading","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570346299.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055794S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8081282,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Pratschner","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory for Dependable Wireless Connectivity for the Society in Motion","Institute of Telecommunications, TU Wien, Austria"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Pratschner","id":"37085549311"},{"name":"Sebastian Caban","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory for Dependable Wireless Connectivity for the Society in Motion","Institute of Telecommunications, TU Wien, Austria"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Caban","id":"37300758800"},{"name":"Stefan Schwarz","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory for Dependable Wireless Connectivity for the Society in Motion","Institute of Telecommunications, TU Wien, Austria"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Schwarz","id":"37401877600"},{"name":"Markus Rupp","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, TU Wien, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Rupp","id":"37276736700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081282","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Couplings","Mutual coupling","Impedance","MIMO","Channel models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","matrix algebra","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mutual coupling model","massive MIMO","Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output","future mobile communication systems","unresolved implementation issues","antenna arrays","array coupling effects","matching network","universal coupling model","coupling matrix","3rd Generation Partnership Project 3D","3GPP 3D channel model","matrix model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["massive MIMO","mutual coupling","coupling model","large arrays"]}],"abstract":"Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) has become one of the key technologies for future mobile communication systems.

This coupling model is augmented by a matching network in order to provide a universal coupling model that is applicable to any channel model. Impact of array coupling is then shown by applying the coupling matrix on the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3D channel model.

Most ASD systems adopt outlier-detection techniques because it is difficult to collect a massive amount of anomalous sound data. To improve the performance of such outlier-detection-based ASD, it is essential to extract a set of efficient acoustic features that is suitable for identifying anomalous sounds. However, the ideal property of a set of acoustic features that maximizes ASD performance has not been clarified. By considering outlier-detection-based ASD as a statistical hypothesis test, we defined optimality as an objective function that adopts Neyman-Pearson lemma; the acoustic feature extractor is optimized to extract a set of acoustic features which maximize the true positive rate under an arbitrary false positive rate. The variational auto-encoder is applied as an acoustic feature extractor and optimized to maximize the objective function. We confirmed that the proposed method improved the F-measure score from 0.02 to 0.06 points compared to those of conventional methods, and ASD results of a stereolithography 3D-printer in a real-environment show that the proposed method is effective in identifying anomalous sounds.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081297","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081297.pdf","startPage":"698","endPage":"702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing acoustic feature extractor for anomalous sound detection based on Neyman-Pearson lemma","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081297/","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing acoustic feature extractor for anomalous sound detection based on Neyman-Pearson lemma","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290036","htmlLink":"/document/8081297/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing acoustic feature extractor for anomalous sound detection based on Neyman-Pearson lemma","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570341166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071829S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081298,"authors":[{"name":"Ganapati Hegde","affiliation":["Communication Systems Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Ganapati","lastName":"Hegde","id":"37085783665"},{"name":"Marius Pesavento","affiliation":["Communication Systems Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Pesavento","id":"37285062000"},{"name":"Marc E.

In this paper we develop this technique for complex domain, i.e. for application to complex-valued data. Sparsity as an approximation technique can be addressed directly to complex-valued variables or to real-valued pairs phase/amplitude and real/imaginary parts of complex-valued variables. As a result we arrive to various ways of development and obtain a set of quite different algorithms. The algorithms proposed in this paper are composed from two components: nonlocal patch-wise grouping and high-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) for grouped data processing. The latter gives data adaptive complex-valued bases for complex-valued data or real-valued bases for joint processing of the pairs phase/amplitude, real/imaginary parts of complex-valued variables. Comparative study of the developed algorithms is produced in order to select the most efficient ones.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081301","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081301.pdf","startPage":"718","endPage":"722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex domain nonlocal block-matching denoising based on high-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081301/","displayDocTitle":"Complex domain nonlocal block-matching denoising based on high-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290069","htmlLink":"/document/8081301/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex domain nonlocal block-matching denoising based on high-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD)","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570337362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056053S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081306,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Tzelepi","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Tzelepi","id":"37085385069"},{"name":"Anastasios Tefas","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Anastasios","lastName":"Tefas","id":"37299690600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081306","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":892},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human crowd detection for drone flight safety using convolutional neural networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081306.pdf","startPage":"743","endPage":"747","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081306","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Drones","Convolution","Computational modeling","Training","Safety","Europe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","neural nets","object detection","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human crowd detection","drone flight safety purposes","noncrowded scenes","crowd heatmaps","flight maps","pre-trained CNN","fully-convolutional network","drone dataset","deep convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Crowd detection","Drones","Safety","Convolutional Neural Networks","Deep Learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081306","abstract":"In this paper a novel human crowd detection method, that utilizes deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for drone flight safety purposes is proposed.

In this paper, we propose a user adaptation method using Learning Hidden Unit Contributions (LHUC) for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It inserts a special layer with a small number of free parameters between each of two CNN layers and estimates the free parameters using a small amount of data. We collected smartphone data of 43 hours from 9 users and utilized them to evaluate our method. It improved the recognition performance by 3.0% from a user-independent model on average.

These transforms are tested competitively inside a video encoder and the optimal transform is selected based on the Rate Distortion Optimization (RDO) cost. However, one needs to encode a syntax to indicate the chosen transform per residual block to the decoder for successful reconstruction of the pixels. Conventionally, the transform index is binarized using fixed length coding and a CABAC context model is attached to it. In this work, we provide a novel method that utilizes Convolutional Neural Network to predict the chosen transform index from the quantized coefficient block. The prediction probabilities are used to binarize the index by employing a variable length coding instead of a fixed length coding. Results show that by employing this modified transform index coding scheme inside HEVC, one can achieve up to 0.59% BD-rate gain.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290016","htmlLink":"/document/8081317/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"CNN-based transform index prediction in multiple transforms framework to assist entropy coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CNN-based transform index prediction in multiple transforms framework to assist entropy coding","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060384S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081318,"authors":[{"name":"Tae Young Han","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Tae Young","lastName":"Han","id":"37086114501"},{"name":"Yong Jun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Yong Jun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086229859"},{"name":"Byung Cheol Song","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Byung Cheol","lastName":"Song","id":"37274662900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081318","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":430},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081318","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hafnium","Convolution","Signal processing algorithms","Spatial resolution","Europe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","image resolution","infrared imaging","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural network","image super resolution","low light environment","CNN","near-infrared image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Near-infrared and visible images","super-resolution","convolutional neural networks","low light images"]}],"abstract":"Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been successfully applied to visible image super-resolution (SR) methods.

All signals are represented by a linear state space model (LSSM). The baseline model is driven by white Gaussian noise, but the other signal models are triggered by sparse inputs. Sparsity is achieved by normal priors with unknown variance (NUV) from sparse Bayesian learning. All signals and system parameters are jointly estimated with an efficient expectation maximization (EM) algorithm based on Gaussian message passing, which works both for known and unknown signal shapes. The proposed method outputs a sparse multi-channel representation of the given signal, which can be interpreted as a signal labeling.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081325.pdf","startPage":"838","endPage":"842","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised feature extraction, signal labeling, and blind signal separation in a state space world","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Message passing","Signal processing algorithms","Electrocardiography","Estimation","Gaussian noise","Dictionaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","blind source separation","compressed sensing","expectation-maximisation algorithm","feature extraction","Gaussian noise","learning (artificial intelligence)","message passing","signal representation","state-space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["white Gaussian noise","sparse Bayesian learning","sparse multichannel representation","signal labeling","unsupervised feature extraction","blind signal separation","joint signal separation","single-channel discrete-time signal","linear state space model","joint signal estimation","expectation maximization algorithm","Gaussian message passing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081325/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised feature extraction, signal labeling, and blind signal separation in a state space world","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081325/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17289980","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised feature extraction, signal labeling, and blind signal separation in a state space world","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570341584.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070466S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081327,"authors":[{"name":"Fl\u00e1vio R. \u00c1vila","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Departament (DETEL), Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ)"],"firstName":"Fl\u00e1vio R.","lastName":"\u00c1vila","id":"37658706500"},{"name":"Lisandro Lovisolo","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Departament (DETEL), Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ)"],"firstName":"Lisandro","lastName":"Lovisolo","id":"37331629100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081327","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Time-domain analysis","OFDM","Equalizers","Optical distortion","Nonlinear distortion","Nonlinear optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","free-space optical communication","interference (signal)","light emitting diodes","nonlinear distortion","OFDM modulation","optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised time domain nonlinear post-equalization","ACO-OFDM visible light communication systems","LED nonlinearity","time domain symbol","time domain OFDM signal","blind nonlinear post-equalization","asymmetrically clipped O-OFDM VLC systems","peak-to-average power ratio","optical-OFDM"]}],"abstract":"LED nonlinearity is an important issue limiting the performance of Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems.

By exploring the Gaussianity of the time domain OFDM signal and the idea of distribution equalization, we propose a semi-parametric approach to blind nonlinear post-equalization for asymmetrically clipped O-OFDM (ACO-OFDM) VLC systems.

The block diagonalization (BD) precoding scheme is used to cancel co-channel interference (CCI) in addition to exploiting its advantage of enhancing diversity. Since the BD scheme requires channel knowledge at the transmitter, we propose to use downlink spreading along with DM, which does not require channel knowledge neither at the transmitter nor at the receivers. The orthogonal spreading (OS) scheme is employed in order to separate the data streams of different users. As a space time block code, we use the Alamouti code that can be encoded/decoded using DM thereby eliminating the need for channel knowledge at the receiver.

Such a large antenna array has the potential to make the system achieve high channel capacity and spectral efficiency, but it also leads to high cost in terms of hardware complexity. In this paper, we consider a finite dimensional channel model in which finite distinct directions are applied with M angular bins. In massive multi-user MIMO systems, a hybrid precoding method is proposed to reduce the required number of radio frequency (RF) chains at the base station, employing a single antenna per mobile station. The proposed precoder is partitioned into a high-dimensional RF precoder and a low-dimensional baseband precoder. The RF precoder is designed to obtain power gain with phase-only control and the baseband precoder is designed to facilitate multi-stream processing. For realistic scenarios, we consider the situation where the RF phase control is quantized up to B bits of precision. Furthermore, an upper bound on spectral efficiency is derived with the proposed precoding scheme. The simulation results show that hybrid precoding achieves desirable performance in terms of spectral efficiency, which approaches the performance of zero-forcing precoding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity hybrid precoding in finite dimensional channel for massive MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081334","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081334.pdf","startPage":"883","endPage":"887","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity hybrid precoding in finite dimensional channel for massive MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081334/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290218","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity hybrid precoding in finite dimensional channel for massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087151S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081340,"authors":[{"name":"Johan Sw\u00e4rd","affiliation":["Centre for Mathematical Sciences, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Sw\u00e4rd","id":"37077969400"},{"name":"Filip Elvander","affiliation":["Centre for Mathematical Sciences, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Filip","lastName":"Elvander","id":"37085696937"},{"name":"Andreas Jakobsson","affiliation":["Centre for Mathematical Sciences, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Jakobsson","id":"37285012600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081340","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081340","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nuclear magnetic resonance","Optimization","Upper bound","Signal processing","Convex functions","Estimation","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal measurements","nonlinear functions","convex optimization problem","sensor selection problem","optimal sampling schemes"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we propose a method for finding an optimal, non-uniform, sampling scheme for a general class of signals in which the signal measurements may be non-linear functions of the parameters to be estimated. Formulated as a convex optimization problem reminiscent of the sensor selection problem, the method determines an optimal sampling scheme given a suitable estimation bound on the parameters of interest. The formulation also allows for putting emphasis on a particular set of parameters of interest by scaling the optimization problem in such a way that the bound to be minimized becomes more sensitive to these parameters. For the case of imprecise a priori knowledge of these parameters, we present a framework for customizing the sampling scheme to take such uncertainty into account. Numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081340","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081340.pdf","startPage":"912","endPage":"916","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing optimal sampling schemes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Designing optimal sampling schemes","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081340/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17289989","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081340/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing optimal sampling schemes","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570345475.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045904S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081348,"authors":[{"name":"Rig Das","affiliation":["Section of Applied Electronics, Roma Tre University, Roma, Italy"],"firstName":"Rig","lastName":"Das","id":"37085638528"},{"name":"Emanuele Maiorana","affiliation":["Section of Applied Electronics, Roma Tre University, Roma, Italy"],"firstName":"Emanuele","lastName":"Maiorana","id":"37392740300"},{"name":"Patrizio Campisi","affiliation":["Section of Applied Electronics, Roma Tre University, Roma, Italy"],"firstName":"Patrizio","lastName":"Campisi","id":"37269456300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081348","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":384},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visually evoked potential for EEG biometrics using convolutional neural network","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081348.pdf","startPage":"951","endPage":"955","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081348","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Biometrics (access control)","Feature extraction","Visualization","Convolution","Protocols","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","electroencephalography","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","visual evoked potentials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EEG biometrics","convolutional neural network","electroencephalographic signals","visual stimuli","biometric identification","deep learning method","automatic discriminative feature extraction","individual identification","visually evoked potential","longitudinal database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Visually evoked potential","Convolutional neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081348","abstract":"In this paper we investigate the performance of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, elicited by means of visual stimuli, for biometric identification.

Our evaluation focuses on finding good efficiency vs. accuracy tradeoffs by evaluating different network configurations and parameterizations. In particular, we investigate the use of different temporal subsampling strategies, and show that they can be used to effectively trade computational workload against classification accuracy. Using a subset of the YouTube-8M dataset, we demonstrate that workload reductions in the order of 10\u00d7, 50\u00d7 and 100\u00d7 can be achieved with accuracy reductions of only 1.3%, 6.2% and 10.8%, respectively.

By reducing the computational complexity of the decoder, drastic energy savings can be achieved without affecting the visual quality.

Simulation results show that the proposed weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm provides a substantial gain over existing algorithms in terms of sum data rates with moderate implementation cost.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081369","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081369.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081369","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","startPage":"1055","endPage":"1059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoder design in user-centric virtual cell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Precoder design in user-centric virtual cell networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081369/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081369/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17303399","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoder design in user-centric virtual cell networks","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347840.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068753S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081370,"authors":[{"name":"Pan Cao","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, The University of Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Cao","id":"38469398300"},{"name":"John Thompson","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, The University of Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Thompson","id":"37273630300"},{"name":"H.

This has motivated the development of methods to solve such problem in specific scenarios. However, due to the non-convex nature of the rank-one constraint, limited progress has been made in solving generic rank-one constrained optimization problems. In particular, the problem of efficiently finding a locally optimal solution to a generic rank-one constrained problem remains open. This paper focuses on solving general rank-one constrained problems via relaxation techniques. However, instead of dropping the rank-one constraint completely as is done in traditional rank-one relaxation methods, a novel algorithm that gradually relaxes the rank-one constraint, termed the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SROCR) algorithm, is proposed. Compared with previous algorithms, the SROCR algorithm can solve general rank-one constrained problems, and can find feasible solutions with favorable complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081370/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081370/","accessionNumber":"17290436","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A sequential constraint relaxation algorithm for rank-one constrained problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sequential constraint relaxation algorithm for rank-one constrained problems","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570346857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058608S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8081379,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Serbes","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ahmet","lastName":"Serbes","id":"38190392200"},{"name":"Omair Aldimashki","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Omair","lastName":"Aldimashki","id":"37086247576"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081379","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":357},"abstract":"In this work, a fast and accurate chirp-rate estimation algorithm is presented.

However, in a multi-speaker scenario the noise reduction algorithm has to determine which speaker the listener is focusing on, in order to enhance it while suppressing the other interfering sources. Recently, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to detect auditory attention using electroencephalography (EEG). In this paper, we use multi-channel Wiener filters (MWFs), to filter out each speech stream from the speech mixtures in the micro-phones of a binaural hearing aid, while also reducing background noise. From the demixed and denoised speech streams, we extract envelopes for an EEG-based auditory attention detection (AAD) algorithm. The AAD module can then select the output of the MWF corresponding to the attended speaker. We evaluate our algorithm in a two-speaker scenario in the presence of babble noise and compare it to a previously proposed algorithm. Our algorithm is observed to provide speech envelopes that yield better AAD accuracies, and is more robust to variations in speaker positions and diffuse background noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17290099","htmlLink":"/document/8081390/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"EEG-based attention-driven speech enhancement for noisy speech mixtures using N-fold multi-channel Wiener filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EEG-based attention-driven speech enhancement for noisy speech mixtures using N-fold multi-channel Wiener filters","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570343404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054406S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8081391,"authors":[{"name":"Nobutaka Ito","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobutaka","lastName":"Ito","id":"37077363400"},{"name":"Shoko Araki","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoko","lastName":"Araki","id":"37274774900"},{"name":"Tomohiro Nakatani","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Nakatani","id":"37342222600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081391","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Speech","Array signal processing","Probabilistic logic","Noise measurement","Microphones","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","dictionaries","direction-of-arrival estimation","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","probability","speaker recognition","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive beamforming","probabilistic spatial dictionary","dictionary models","feature distribution","online DOA detection","online diarization","physical model-based dictionary","data-driven dictionary","training data","online meeting diarization","automatic speech recognition"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we comparatively study alternative dictionary designs for recently proposed meeting diarization and adaptive beamforming based on a probabilistic spatial dictionary.

Based on the Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bound (BCRLB), we derive an estimation theoretic design rule for the Fourier coefficients of the analog transmit signal when violating the sampling theorem at the receiver through a wide analog pre-filtering bandwidth. For a wireless delay-Doppler channel, we obtain a system optimization problem which can be solved in compact form by using an Eigenvalue decomposition. The presented approach enables one to explore the Pareto region spanned by the optimized analog waveforms. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the framework can be used to reduce the sampling rate at the receiver while maintaining high estimation accuracy. Finally, we verify the practical impact by Monte-Carlo simulations of a channel estimation algorithm.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081399","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081399.pdf","startPage":"1205","endPage":"1209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog transmit signal optimization for undersampled delay-Doppler estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Analog transmit signal optimization for undersampled delay-Doppler estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081399/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17290132","htmlLink":"/document/8081399/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog transmit signal optimization for undersampled delay-Doppler estimation","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061718S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8081412,"authors":[{"name":"Qingju Liu","affiliation":["Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing, University of Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Qingju","lastName":"Liu","id":"38238563600"},{"name":"Wenwu Wang","affiliation":["Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing, University of Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Wenwu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086036794"},{"name":"Philip J B Jackson","affiliation":["Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing, University of Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Philip J B","lastName":"Jackson","id":"37281760600"},{"name":"Yan Tang","affiliation":["Acoustics Research Centre, University of Salford, UK"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37086229504"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081412","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":351},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Training","Speech enhancement","Distortion","Linear programming","Psychoacoustic models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","speech enhancement","speech intelligibility","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perceptually-weighted deep neural network","monaural speech enhancement","background noise conditions","DNN training process","perceptually-weighted objective function","feedforward DNN framework","speech quality","speech intelligibility"]}],"abstract":"Deep neural networks (DNN) have recently been shown to give state-of-the-art performance in monaural speech enhancement. However in the DNN training process, the perceptual difference between different components of the DNN output is not fully exploited, where equal importance is often assumed. To address this limitation, we have proposed a new perceptually-weighted objective function within a feedforward DNN framework, aiming to minimize the perceptual difference between the enhanced speech and the target speech. A perceptual weight is integrated into the proposed objective function, and has been tested on two types of output features: spectra and ideal ratio masks. Objective evaluations for both speech quality and speech intelligibility have been performed. Integration of our perceptual weight shows consistent improvement on several noise levels and a variety of different noise types.","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081412.pdf","startPage":"1270","endPage":"1274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A perceptually-weighted deep neural network for monaural speech enhancement in various background noise conditions","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081412","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"A perceptually-weighted deep neural network for monaural speech enhancement in various background noise conditions","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290410","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081412/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A perceptually-weighted deep neural network for monaural speech enhancement in various background noise conditions","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570346979.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062224S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081419,"authors":[{"name":"Gary Garcia-Molina","affiliation":["Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, USA","Philips Research North-America, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA"],"firstName":"Gary","lastName":"Garcia-Molina","id":"38274655200"},{"name":"Keith Baehr","affiliation":["Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, USA"],"firstName":"Keith","lastName":"Baehr","id":"37086241574"},{"name":"Brenda Steele","affiliation":["Wisconsin Sleep, University of Wisconsin Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA"],"firstName":"Brenda","lastName":"Steele","id":"37086234323"},{"name":"Tsvetomira Tsoneva","affiliation":["Philips Research Europe, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Tsvetomira","lastName":"Tsoneva","id":"37601408200"},{"name":"Stefan Pfundtner","affiliation":["Philips Research Europe, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Pfundtner","id":"37085712966"},{"name":"Brady Riedner","affiliation":["Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, USA"],"firstName":"Brady","lastName":"Riedner","id":"37680628900"},{"name":"David P.

The classification accuracy characterized by the Kappa value achieved in this study dataset was 0.63 (substantial agreement with manual staging) and the specificity/sensitivity for NREM detection were 0.87 and 0.8 respectively.

It was designed to enable cost-effective 3-D imaging and tracking of people in an indoor environment. This algorithm is able to image both sparse and cluttered environments, through the use of wavelet transforms and compressive sensing techniques. The main advantage of the proposed technique is that it enables the use of much sparser antenna arrays than is possible with the traditional range-migration algorithm, reducing the cost of microwave imaging systems. Experiments show that the compressive sensing algorithm produced high quality 3-D images using antenna arrays that are 90 to 96% sparse. This reduces the cost of the antenna array by a factor of 10 to 25, when compared to traditional dense arrays, without a loss in image resolution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing and sparse antenna arrays for indoor 3-D microwave imaging","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081421","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081421.pdf","startPage":"1314","endPage":"1318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081421/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing and sparse antenna arrays for indoor 3-D microwave imaging","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081421/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290031","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing and sparse antenna arrays for indoor 3-D microwave imaging","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570342751.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10533S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081422,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085652905"},{"name":"Wei Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Dai","id":"37555483600"},{"name":"Yonina C.

Thus the SNR decreases quadratically with the number of measurements. This model suggests an optimal operation point different from the common wisdom where more measurements always mean better performance. Our analysis shows that there is an optimal number of measurements, neither too few nor too many, to minimize the mean-squared error of the estimate. The analysis is based on a state evolution technique which is proposed for the approximate message passing algorithm. We consider the Gaussian, Bernoulli-Gaussian and least-favorite distributions in both real and complex domains. Numerical results justify the correctness of our analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081422.pdf","startPage":"1319","endPage":"1323","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal number of measurements for compressed sensing with quadratically decreasing SNR","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy measurement","Noise measurement","Approximation algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Mathematical model","Message passing","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","Gaussian processes","mean square error methods","message passing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","SNR","practical signal transmission application","fixed power budget","linear equation","signal energy","noise energy","mean-squared error","approximate message passing algorithm","optimal operation point","state evolution technique","Bernoulli-Gaussian distributions","least-favorite distributions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate message passing","compressed sensing","state evolution","signal recovery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimal number of measurements for compressed sensing with quadratically decreasing SNR","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081422/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290157","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal number of measurements for compressed sensing with quadratically decreasing SNR","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113838S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081425,"authors":[{"name":"Fahad Qureshi","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing and Electrical Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Fahad","lastName":"Qureshi","id":"37394392400"},{"name":"Jarmo Takala","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing and Electrical Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Jarmo","lastName":"Takala","id":"37275700700"},{"name":"Anastasia Volkova","affiliation":["UMR 7606, LIP6, UPMC Univ Paris 06, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Anastasia","lastName":"Volkova","id":"37085547125"},{"name":"Thibault Hilaire","affiliation":["UMR 7606, LIP6, UPMC Univ Paris 06, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Thibault","lastName":"Hilaire","id":"37396176200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081425","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081425","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Adders","Multiplexing","Hardware","Quantization (signal)","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","digital arithmetic","fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constant multiplication","radix-3 Wingorad Fourier transform","mixed radix core","mixed radix-2","multiplierless unified architecture","FFT sizes","3-point FFT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast Fourier transform (FFT)","Memory-based FFT","Mixed radix"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel runtime-reconfigurable, mixed radix core for computation 2-, 3-, 4- point fast Fourier transforms (FFT).

We also show that the proposed architecture has the same bound on the accuracy as the classical one.","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081425.pdf","startPage":"1334","endPage":"1338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081425","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiplierless unified architecture for mixed radix-2/3/4 FFTs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiplierless unified architecture for mixed radix-2/3/4 FFTs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081425/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081425/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290085","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiplierless unified architecture for mixed radix-2/3/4 FFTs","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570346780.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109363S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081428,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Knoop","affiliation":["Institute of Electrodynamics and Microelectronics (ITEM), University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Knoop","id":"38580402100"},{"name":"Liam Schwez","affiliation":["Institute of Electrodynamics and Microelectronics (ITEM), University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Liam","lastName":"Schwez","id":"37086233725"},{"name":"Dagmar Peters-Drolshagen","affiliation":["Institute of Electrodynamics and Microelectronics (ITEM), University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dagmar","lastName":"Peters-Drolshagen","id":"38329710200"},{"name":"Steffen Paul","affiliation":["Institute of Electrodynamics and Microelectronics (ITEM), University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Paul","id":"37285011000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081428","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Signal processing algorithms","Maximum likelihood decoding","Search problems","Algorithm design and analysis","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","high level synthesis","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parametrisable digital design","high-level synthesis","maximum likelihood detection","digitally modulated signals","MIMO communication systems","baseline digital hardware design","baseline Sphere Decoder","tree search algorithm","integer least squares minimisation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parametrisable digital design of a sphere decoder with high-level synthesis","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","endPage":"1353","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081428.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081428","startPage":"1349","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081428","abstract":"A Sphere Decoder is a popular tree search algorithm for the solution of integer least squares minimisation problems.

The observations are decomposed into signal and noise subspace components by unitary coordinate transformation under a presumptive number of sources. Only when there is no signal in the presumptive noise subspace components, the corresponding CRST statistic is asymptotic normal distribution. The CRST statistic of the presumptive noise subspace components also is a statistic of the sample eigenvalues, and can be used as the statistic in the GBIC for estimating the number of sources.

We consider different spatial/spectral sampling strategies and pare their performance for similar overall numbers of detected photons. For a regular spatial grid, the first strategy consists of sampling all the spatial locations of the grid for each of the wavelengths. Conversely, the three other strategies consist, for each spatial location, of acquiring a reduced number of wavelengths, chosen randomly or in a deterministic manner. We propose a fully automated computational method, adapted for the different sampling strategies in order to recover the target range profile, as well as the reflectivity profiles associated with the different wavelengths. The performance of the four sampling strategies is illustrated using a single photon MSL system with four wavelengths. The results presented demonstrate that although the first strategy usually provides more accurate results, the subsampling strategies do not exhibit a significant performance degradation, particularly for extremely photon-starved data (down to one photon per pixel on average).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081441/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290211","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian restoration of reflectivity and range profiles from subsampled single-photon multispectral Lidar data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian restoration of reflectivity and range profiles from subsampled single-photon multispectral Lidar data","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094779S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8081442,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Rusu","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Rusu","id":"37085393293"},{"name":"John Thompson","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Thompson","id":"38542873900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081442","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Europe","Signal processing","Noise measurement","Null space","Noise level","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor placement","time-of-arrival estimation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-difference of arrival localization","tight configuration","random tight frames","optimal accuracy","average localization accuracy","sensor network","Fisher information matrix","arrival measurements","noisy time-difference","optimal sensor placement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["time-difference of arrival localization","Fisher information matrix","finite frames","tight frames"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we analyze the use of tight frames for the problem of localizing a source from noisy time-difference of arrival measurements.

We connect our result to previous approaches from the literature and show experimentally that near optimal accuracy can also be provided by random tight frames.

Although our results hold for any dimension, for simplicity of exposition, the numerical experiments depicted are in the two dimensional case.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081442","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081442.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081442","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","startPage":"1415","endPage":"1419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of tight frames for optimal sensor placement in time-difference of arrival localization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"On the use of tight frames for optimal sensor placement in time-difference of arrival localization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081442/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081442/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17303379","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of tight frames for optimal sensor placement in time-difference of arrival localization","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570346743.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12536S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8081443,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE and Digital Tech.

It present an iterative denoising algorithm based on the 2-D windowed Fourier Transform. The algorithm is a new approach based on the SOS procedure recently proposed by Y. Romano and M. Elad adapted to phase processing. The approach is proposed in the case of the 2-D windowed Fourier Transform algorithm applied to phase maps which constitutes the state of the art in the field of digital holography. The reason is that the sum and difference operations used in the SOS procedure cannot be computed directly on phase maps but using a sine and cosine representation in order to avoid 2n phase jumps. Results on simulated phase maps including realistic noise conditions encountered in digital holography show the advantage of the proposed iterative approach. The paper proposes the application of the method to denoising of phase images from digital three color holography applied to cracks characterization of a composite materiel under mechanical strength test.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The iterative 2D windowed Fourier transform: A SOS approach to speckle noise reduction in digital holography","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081468","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081468.pdf","startPage":"1544","endPage":"1548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"The iterative 2D windowed Fourier transform: A SOS approach to speckle noise reduction in digital holography","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081468/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290307","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The iterative 2D windowed Fourier transform: A SOS approach to speckle noise reduction in digital holography","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570345517.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068778S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081474,"authors":[{"name":"S L Happy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"S L","lastName":"Happy","id":"38578291000"},{"name":"Ramanarayan Mohanty","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Development Center, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Ramanarayan","lastName":"Mohanty","id":"38232443500"},{"name":"Aurobinda Routray","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Aurobinda","lastName":"Routray","id":"38571794700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081474","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"abstract":"Feature selection has been studied widely in the literature. However, the efficacy of the selection criteria for low sample size applications is neglected in most cases. Most of the existing feature selection criteria are based on the sample similarity. However, the distance measures become insignificant for high dimensional low sample size (HDLSS) data. Moreover, the variance of a feature with a few samples is pointless unless it represents the data distribution efficiently. Instead of looking at the samples in groups, we evaluate their efficiency based on pair-wise fashion. In our investigation, we noticed that considering a pair of samples at a time and selecting the features that bring them closer or put them far away is a better choice for feature selection. Experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with low sample size, which outperforms many other state-of-the-art feature selection methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Euclidean distance","Europe","Signal processing","Electronic mail","Electrical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature selection","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high dimensional low sample size data","sample similarity","data distribution","feature selection methods","pairwise feature proximity","feature selection criteria","HDLSS data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feature selection","pair-wise feature proximity","high dimensional low sample size data"]}],"doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081474","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081474.pdf","startPage":"1574","endPage":"1578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An effective feature selection method based on pair-wise feature proximity for high dimensional low sample size data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An effective feature selection method based on pair-wise feature proximity for high dimensional low sample size data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081474/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081474/","accessionNumber":"17290248","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective feature selection method based on pair-wise feature proximity for high dimensional low sample size data","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047715S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8081486,"authors":[{"name":"Raziyeh Ranjbaryan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Dept., Yazd University, Yazd, Iran"],"firstName":"Raziyeh","lastName":"Ranjbaryan","id":"37086229894"},{"name":"Hamid Reza Abutalebi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Dept., Yazd University, Yazd, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamid Reza","lastName":"Abutalebi","id":"37264952400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081486","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-channel estimation of power spectral density matrix using inter-frame and inter-banc information","abstract":"In this paper, we address the estimation of power spectral density (PSD) matrix.

For large graphs, i.e., in cases where the graph's spectrum is not accessible, we investigate, both theoretically and empirically, a sub-optimal but much faster DPP based on loop-erased random walks on the graph. Preliminary experiments show promising results especially in cases where the number of measurements should stay as small as possible and for graphs that have a strong community structure.

Introducing a novel least mean square (LMS) estimation strategy with probabilistic sampling, we propose two different methods to select the sampling probability at each node, with the aim of optimizing the sampling rate, or the mean-square performance, while at the same time guaranteeing a prescribed learning rate. The resulting solutions naturally lead to sparse sampling probability vectors that optimize the tradeoff between graph sampling rate, steady-state performance, and learning rate of the LMS algorithm. Numerical simulations validate the proposed approach, and assess the performance of the proposed sampling strategies for adaptive learning of graph signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081496/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081496/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290187","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimal sampling strategies for adaptive learning of graph signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal sampling strategies for adaptive learning of graph signals","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347378.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061051S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081496","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8081497,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Berger","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Berger","id":"37085874082"},{"name":"Gabor Hannak","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Gabor","lastName":"Hannak","id":"37085494331"},{"name":"Gerald Matz","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Matz","id":"37284513500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081497","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081497","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","TV","Convergence","Noise measurement","Smoothing methods","Signal processing","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","graph theory","minimisation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal recovery","scale-free graphs","total variation minimization","smooth graph signals","noisy signal samples","nonsmooth convex optimization problem","coordinate descent accelerations","Nesterov smoothing technique"]}],"abstract":"We extend our previous work on learning smooth graph signals from a small number of noisy signal samples.

The simulation results show that LC-MAMPs outperform equivalent digital antenna arrays.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081504","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081504.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081504","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","startPage":"1224","endPage":"1228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large load-controlled multiple-active multiple-passive antenna arrays: Transmit beamforming and multi-user precoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Large load-controlled multiple-active multiple-passive antenna arrays: Transmit beamforming and multi-user precoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081504/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081504/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290350","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large load-controlled multiple-active multiple-passive antenna arrays: Transmit beamforming and multi-user precoding","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073066S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081505,"authors":[{"name":"Sharath Adavanne","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Sharath","lastName":"Adavanne","id":"37086184812"},{"name":"Konstantinos Drossos","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Drossos","id":"37076697900"},{"name":"Emre \u00c7akir","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Emre","lastName":"\u00c7akir","id":"37085628563"},{"name":"Tuomas Virtanen","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Tuomas","lastName":"Virtanen","id":"37285488100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081505","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Birds","Feature extraction","Training","Recurrent neural networks","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","biology computing","convolution","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","zoology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stacked convolutional networks","recurrent neural networks","bird audio detection","audio segments","data augmentation","test mixing","bird call detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081505","abstract":"This paper studies the detection of bird calls in audio segments using stacked convolutional and recurrent neural networks.

One difficulty of this task is that the bird sound datasets are weakly labelled, that is only the presence or absence of a bird in a recording is known, without knowing when the birds call. We propose to apply joint detection and classification (JDC) model on the weakly labelled data (WLD) to detect and classify an audio clip at the same time. First, we apply VGG like convolutional neural network (CNN) on mel spectrogram as baseline. Then we propose a JDC-CNN model with VGG as a classifier and CNN as a detector. We report the denoising method including optimally-modified log-spectral amplitude (OM-LSA), median filter and spectral spectrogram will worse the classification accuracy on the contrary to previous work. JDC-CNN can predict the time stamps of the events from weakly labelled data, so is able to do sound event detection from WLD. We obtained area under curve (AUC) of 95.70% on the development data and 81.36% on the unseen evaluation data, which is nearly comparable to the baseline CNN model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081509/","accessionNumber":"17290223","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081509/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Joint detection and classification convolutional neural network on weakly labelled bird audio detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint detection and classification convolutional neural network on weakly labelled bird audio detection","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570343626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069415S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8081512,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Grill","affiliation":["Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Wien, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Grill","id":"38201863000"},{"name":"Jan Schl\u00fcter","affiliation":["Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Wien, Austria"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Schl\u00fcter","id":"38241228800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081512","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":724},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Birds","Training","Spectrogram","Convolution","Training data","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio recording","audio signal processing","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural networks","bird detection","audio signals","bird calls","audio recordings","mel spectrograms","environmental recordings","supervised training","area under curve measure","AUC measure"]}],"abstract":"We present and compare two approaches to detect the presence of bird calls in audio recordings using convolutional neural networks on mel spectrograms.

The purpose of work is to contribute to a system for detecting drones used for malicious purposes, such as for terrorism. Specifically, we present a method capable of detecting the presence of commercial hobby drones as a binary classification problem based on sound event detection. We recorded the sound produced by a few popular commercial hobby drones, and then augmented this data with diverse environmental sound data to remedy the scarcity of drone sound data in diverse environments. We investigated the effectiveness of state-of-the-art event sound classification methods, i.e., a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), for drone sound detection. Our empirical results, which were obtained with a testing dataset collected on an urban street, confirmed the effectiveness of these models for operating in a real environment. In summary, our RNN models showed the best detection performance with an F-Score of 0.8009 with 240 ms of input audio with a short processing time, indicating their applicability to real-time detection systems.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081531","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081531.pdf","startPage":"1858","endPage":"1862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Empirical study of drone sound detection in real-life environment with deep neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Empirical study of drone sound detection in real-life environment with deep neural networks","htmlLink":"/document/8081531/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290024","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Empirical study of drone sound detection in real-life environment with deep neural networks","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570337347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104137S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081545,"authors":[{"name":"Abdollah Ajorloo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Abdollah","lastName":"Ajorloo","id":"37072702700"},{"name":"Arash Amini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Arash","lastName":"Amini","id":"37574464600"},{"name":"Mohammad Hassan Bastani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Hassan","lastName":"Bastani","id":"37297582300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081545","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Resource management","Coherence","Sparse matrices","MIMO radar","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Azimuth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","direction-of-arrival estimation","matrix algebra","MIMO radar","minimisation","radar antennas","radar signal processing","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation","sparse modeling","estimation performance","colocated MIMO radar","sparsity constraints","sparse recovery techniques","associated sensing matrix","coherence minimization problem","convex optimization","total power budget","optimal power distribution policy","direction of arrival"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we aim at improving the estimation performance of the direction of arrival (DOA) in a colocated MIMO radar through power allocation under the sparsity constraints.

However, the radar prior information obtained is limited under battlefield background. So it is difficult to model the radar operating modes and schedule schemes accurately, especially for the multi-function radars (MFRs) which are able to employ multiple modes flexibly. A novel method of reverse modelling for MFR is proposed. The information of the waveform is translated into grammar according to the theory of formal language, and the corresponding Finite-state Automaton (FSA) is composed as initialization. Then, according to the thought of data-driven, the transition relations and probabilities between MFR modes are yielded by analysing the intercepted signals. Finally, the stochastic finite automaton (SFA) is composed, achieving the MFR model by reverse modelling. Simulation with hypothetical MFR signal data is presented, showing that the proposed method is able to compose its SFA effectively, which can be used in MFR state recognition to support the adaptive radar countermeasures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081549/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290250","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven method of reverse modelling for multi-function radar","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven method of reverse modelling for multi-function radar","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065933S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8081550,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper, based on a Bayesian estimation framework, an optimal design method is presented for two-dimensional MIMO arrays in ultrawideband imaging. The optimality criterion is defined based on the image reconstruction quality obtained with the design, and the optimization is performed over all possible locations of antenna elements using an algorithm called clustered sequential backward selection algorithm. The designs obtained with this approach are compared with that of some commonly used sparse array configurations in terms of image reconstruction quality for various noise levels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081550.pdf","startPage":"1952","endPage":"1956","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal design of sparse MIMO arrays for near-field ultrawideband imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","MIMO","Image reconstruction","Imaging","Antenna measurements","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","Bayes methods","estimation theory","image reconstruction","MIMO communication","near-field communication","optimisation","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-field ultrawideband imaging","Bayesian estimation framework","optimal design method","two-dimensional MIMO arrays","optimality criterion","image reconstruction quality","sparse MIMO arrays","remote sensing technique","hardware complexity reduction","sparse multiple-input-multiple-output arrays","cost reduction","antenna elements","clustered sequential backward selection algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimal design of sparse MIMO arrays for near-field ultrawideband imaging","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081550/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290013","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal design of sparse MIMO arrays for near-field ultrawideband imaging","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065785S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081551,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Ulrich","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and System Theory, University of Stuttgart Pfaffenwaldring 47, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Ulrich","id":"37699980100"},{"name":"Yinglai Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and System Theory, University of Stuttgart Pfaffenwaldring 47, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Yinglai","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086215262"},{"name":"Bin Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and System Theory, University of Stuttgart Pfaffenwaldring 47, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37399884400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081551","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation","Radar","OFDM","Antenna arrays","MIMO","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","genetic algorithms","MIMO radar","radar antennas","radar signal processing","receiving antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-target CRB subject","single-carrier MIMO radar","multicarrier MIMO radar array","DOA estimation","carrier frequencies","MC-MIMO array optimization","Cramer-Rao bound","genetic algorithm","transmit antenna positions","receive antenna positions","multicarrier multiple-input multiple-output radar","direction of arrival estimation"]}],"abstract":"Multi-carrier (MC) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar offers an additional degree of freedom in the array optimization through the carrier frequencies.

While numerical experiments show a comparable performance between the convex and submodular relaxations, in terms of output signal-to-noise ratio, the latter finds a near-optimal solution with a significantly reduced computational complexity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","startPage":"1981","endPage":"1985","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081556.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-optimal greedy sensor selection for MVDR beamforming with modular budget constraint","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081556/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081556/","displayDocTitle":"Near-optimal greedy sensor selection for MVDR beamforming with modular budget constraint","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290347","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-optimal greedy sensor selection for MVDR beamforming with modular budget constraint","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570346790.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09142S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8081557,"authors":[{"name":"Wassim Suleiman","affiliation":["TU Darmstadt, Communication Systems Group, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Wassim","lastName":"Suleiman","id":"37085616561"},{"name":"Christian Steffens","affiliation":["TU Darmstadt, Communication Systems Group, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Steffens","id":"38242001900"},{"name":"Alexander Sorg","affiliation":["TU Darmstadt, Communication Systems Group, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Sorg","id":"37086062078"},{"name":"Marius Pesavento","affiliation":["TU Darmstadt, Communication Systems Group, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Pesavento","id":"37285062000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081557","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","Sensor arrays","Covariance matrices","Estimation","FAA","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","compressed sensing","covariance analysis","direction-of-arrival estimation","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gridless compressed sensing","fully augmentable arrays","direction-of-arrival estimation","nonuniform linear arrays","covariance lags","DOA estimation algorithm","sparse reconstruction","gridless SPARse ROW-norm reconstruction formulation","SPARROW formulation","Cramer-Rao bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fully augmentable arrays","Joint Sparsity","Grid-less Parameter Estimation","Direction-of-arrival estimation"]}],"abstract":"Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using non-uniform linear arrays is considered. We focus on the so called \"fully augmentable arrays\" (FAAs) with full set of covariance lags. In FAAs, the number of covariance lags is usually larger than the number of sensors in the array. Thus, with FAAs more sources than the number of sensors can be identified. Existing DOA estimation algorithms for FAAs are based on the assumption of uncorrelated sources. In this paper, based on compressed sensing, we present a DOA estimation algorithm for FAAs without assuming uncorrelated sources. The proposed algorithm is based on the newly introduced gridless SPARse ROW-norm reconstruction (SPARROW) formulation for the joint sparse reconstruction from multiple measurement vectors. By numerical experiments, we show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in the presence of correlated signals or small number of snapshots. Moreover, using simulations, the behavior of the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) for the case of correlated source is demonstrated and it is shown that, when the number of sources is larger than the number of sensors, the CRB for FAAs approaches zero at infinitely large signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) only if the sources are fully correlated.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081557","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081557.pdf","startPage":"1986","endPage":"1990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gridless compressed sensing for fully augmentable arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081557","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081557/","displayDocTitle":"Gridless compressed sensing for fully augmentable arrays","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290148","htmlLink":"/document/8081557/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gridless compressed sensing for fully augmentable arrays","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570346689.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084819S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081558,"authors":[{"name":"Grzegorz Cisek","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, AGH University of Science and Technology, Cracow, Poland","Nokia, Cracow, Poland"],"firstName":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Cisek","id":"37086248244"},{"name":"Tomasz Zieli\u0144ski","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, AGH University of Science and Technology, Cracow, Poland"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Zieli\u0144ski","id":"38529522300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081558","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":459},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Fading channels","Frequency-domain analysis","Time-domain analysis","Noise measurement","Computational modeling","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","fading channels","Fourier transforms","frequency-domain analysis","intercarrier interference","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","radio access networks","radio transmitters","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM transmitter","E-UTRAN baseband traffic generator","efficient 3GPP compliant method","multiple independent fading radio channels","frequency domain representation","transformation algorithms","Intercarrier Interference phenomenon","quasistationary model","TDL model","radio resources","Frequency domain multipath fading channel simulator","software defined Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network traffic generator","Tapped Delay Line model","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing transmitter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Multipath channels","Simulation"]}],"abstract":"The purpose of the study is to develop an efficient 3GPP compliant method to simulate multiple independent fading radio channels in software defined Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-EUTRAN) traffic generator.

At the same time, powering up mobile base stations contributes notably to CO2 footprint. To address these issues, we need to design energy efficient communication systems with higher data rates while considering practical limitations. As a solution, we design an optimal M-PSK directional modulation precoder with spatial peak power minimization where the communicated symbol on each receiving antenna is placed in the optimal location of a predefined region. Such an approach allows less stringent design and results in further energy efficiency. In this work, we characterize the relaxed region, formulate the optimal symbollevel precoder design problem, and transform it into a standard form. The simulation results show that the relaxed design reduces the consumed power while the symbol error rate increment at the receiver due to the relaxed phase design is negligible.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial peak power minimization for relaxed phase M-PSK MIMO directional modulation transmitter","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081562","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081562.pdf","startPage":"2011","endPage":"2015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Spatial peak power minimization for relaxed phase M-PSK MIMO directional modulation transmitter","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081562/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290419","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial peak power minimization for relaxed phase M-PSK MIMO directional modulation transmitter","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570348169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115118S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081575,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Hernando","affiliation":["Mar\u00eda Teresa Lozano and Montserrat Aiger, Centro Universitario de la Defensa (CUD), Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Hernando","id":"37085623743"},{"name":"Maria Dolores Pel\u00e1ez","affiliation":["Centro Universitario de la Defensa (CUD), Academia General Militar (AGM), Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Maria Dolores","lastName":"Pel\u00e1ez","id":"37086224476"},{"name":"Mar\u00eda Teresa Lozano","affiliation":["Centro Universitario de la Defensa (CUD), Academia General Militar (AGM), Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Mar\u00eda Teresa","lastName":"Lozano","id":"37086361102"},{"name":"Montserrat Aiger","affiliation":["Centro Universitario de la Defensa (CUD), Academia General Militar (AGM), Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Montserrat","lastName":"Aiger","id":"37086362330"},{"name":"Eduardo Gil","affiliation":["Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Arag\u00c3\u00b3n, ES"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Gil","id":"37409114700"},{"name":"Jes\u00fas L\u00e1zaro","affiliation":["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Flanders, BE"],"firstName":"Jes\u00fas","lastName":"L\u00e1zaro","id":"38239843800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081575","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":472},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forehead","Estimation","Fingers","Data mining","Europe","Signal processing","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical signal processing","patient monitoring","photoplethysmography","pneumodynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse amplitude variability","database recording finger","finger PAV signal","forehead PAV signal","nonrespiratory component","respiratory rate estimation","PPG signals","pulse photopletysmographic signal","PPG sensor","PPG sensor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081575","abstract":"Pulse photopletysmographic signal (PPG) is modulated by the respiratory rate, so there are some algorithms capable to extract respiratory information from the derived PPG signals, as the Pulse Amplitude Variability (PAV).

While most work in this direction has gone down the lines of improving optimisation schemes, in this paper we are proposing and investigating a different approach based on a multi denoising approximate message passing (MultiD-AMP) framework for Compressive Sensing (CS) image reconstruction which exploits an hierarchy of denoisers by starting with a low fidelity model and then using the estimate as starting point for a higher fidelity models through an iterative reconstruction algorithm. MultiD-AMP achieves lower time complexity and same accuracy compared to using the same most accurate denoiser as in D-AMP. The novelty of our approach is based on exploiting the deterministic state evolution of AMP, which means the predictability of the recovery performances, to design a strategy for selecting the denoiser from a set ordered by both computational complexity and statistical efficiency. We apply the MultiD-AMP framework for image reconstruction given noisy Gaussian random linear measurements. Furthermore, we extend and show the applicability of MultiD-AMP for CS to image reconstruction.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081586","startPage":"2131","endPage":"2135","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081586.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi denoising approximate message passing for optimal recovery with lower computational cost","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multi denoising approximate message passing for optimal recovery with lower computational cost","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081586/","accessionNumber":"17289972","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081586/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi denoising approximate message passing for optimal recovery with lower computational cost","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347684.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041353S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8081590,"authors":[{"name":"Qihua Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, P.R China"],"firstName":"Qihua","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086029834"},{"name":"Jin Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, P.R China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Liu","id":"38195416200"},{"name":"Xiaofeng Ai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, P.R China"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Ai","id":"38247049100"},{"name":"Feng Zhao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, P.R China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37595450600"},{"name":"Shunping Xiao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, P.R China"],"firstName":"Shunping","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37349575900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081590","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-frequency analysis","Compressed sensing","Radar","Signal processing algorithms","Nose","Microwave measurement","Microwave theory and techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ballistics","compressed sensing","missiles","radar resolution","radar target recognition","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["micromotion parameter extraction","micromotion information reconstruction method","precession ballistic targets","wideband radar system","stepped frequency signal","time-frequency analysis","signal generation equipment","ballistic target scatters","compressed sensing technique","precession target measurement experiment","middle circular ring","bottom circular ring","missile target","subfrequency echo","echo high resolution profile"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Micro-motion","Compressed sensing","Stepped frequency signal","Precession Ballistic targets"]}],"abstract":"For a wideband radar system adopting stepped frequency signal (SFS), the micro-motion parameter is usually obtained by time-frequency analysis of the echo HRRPs (high resolution profiles). The data to be collected mainly includes each sub-frequency echo in the slow-time domain, which brings a great burden to the signal generation equipment and data storage on the radar system. Because of the sparseness of the ballistic target scatters in high frequency area, this paper adopts the compressed sensing technique to reduce the sampling data by randomly transmitting the stepped frequency signal. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed by the precession target measurement experiment in the anechoic chamber. The experimental results show that for the nose cone, middle circular ring and bottom circular ring of experimental missile target, when the sampling rate is no less than 50%, 30% and 30% respectively, the reconstruction result is qualified for micro-motion parameter extraction.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081590","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081590.pdf","startPage":"2151","endPage":"2155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A micro-motion information reconstruction method based on compressed sensing for precession ballistic targets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081590","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081590/","displayDocTitle":"A micro-motion information reconstruction method based on compressed sensing for precession ballistic targets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290200","htmlLink":"/document/8081590/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A micro-motion information reconstruction method based on compressed sensing for precession ballistic targets","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570341972.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064127S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081593,"authors":[{"name":"Jingran Lin","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jingran","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085380773"},{"name":"Qiang Li","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37291114800"},{"name":"Jintai Yang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jintai","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086251087"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081593","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Security","OFDM","Frequency modulation","Phased arrays","Frequency diversity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","optimisation","radio transmitters","radiocommunication","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical-layer security","directionally-aligned legitimate user","artificial noise","highly directional transmission feature","mmWave transmissions","PHY security problem","directionally-aligned LU","frequency offsets","FDA beamforming","angle-range dependent beampattern","secrecy rate maximization problem","frequency diverse array beamforming","millimeter wave transmission"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081593","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081593","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","abstract":"The conventional physical-layer (PHY) security approaches, e.g., transmit beamforming and artificial noise (AN)-based design, may fail when the channels of legitimate user (LU) and eavesdropper (Eve) are close correlated. Due to the highly directional transmission feature of millimeter-wave (mmWave), this may occur in mmWave transmissions as the transmitter, Eve and LU are aligned in the same direction exactly. To handle the PHY security problem with directionally-aligned LU and Eve, we propose a novel frequency diverse array (FDA) beamforming approach to differentiating the LU and Eve. By intentionally introducing some frequency offsets across the antennas, the FDA beamforming generates an angle-range dependent beampattern. As a consequence, it can degrade the Eve's reception and thus achieve PHY security. In this paper, we maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the frequency offsets and the beamformer. This secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is hard to solve due to the tightly coupled variables. Nevertheless, we show that it can be reformulated into a form depending only on the frequency offsets. Building upon this reformulation, we identify some cases where the SRM problem can be optimally solved in closed form. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of FDA beamforming in achieving PHY security, even for aligned LU and Eve.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","startPage":"2166","endPage":"2170","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081593.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency diverse array beamforming for physical-layer security with directionally-aligned legitimate user and eavesdropper","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081593/","displayDocTitle":"Frequency diverse array beamforming for physical-layer security with directionally-aligned legitimate user and eavesdropper","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290396","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency diverse array beamforming for physical-layer security with directionally-aligned legitimate user and eavesdropper","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570341586.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065626S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8081602,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The presented approach exploits an apparently moving transmit platform or PCM due to spatio-temporal transmit array modulation. In particular, the work considers a framework utilizing a random PCM trajectory. The statistical characterization of the random PCM trajectory is devised, such that the PCM and the target motion coupling is minimal, while the angular resolution is increased by enabling the virtual MIMO concept. In more details, this paper discusses sidelobe suppression approaches within the angle-Doppler Ambiguity Function (AF) by introducing a phase center probability density function within the array. This allows for enhanced discrimination of multiple targets. Simulation results demonstrate the suppression angle-Doppler coupling by more than 30 dB, even though spatio-temporal transmit array modulation is done across chirps which leads usually to strong angle-Doppler coupling.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081604","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081604.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","startPage":"2221","endPage":"2225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random phase center motion technique for enhanced angle-Doppler discrimination using MIMO radars","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081604","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Random phase center motion technique for enhanced angle-Doppler discrimination using MIMO radars","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081604/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290378","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081604/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random phase center motion technique for enhanced angle-Doppler discrimination using MIMO radars","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347462.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130329S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081605,"authors":[{"name":"Tuomas Aittom\u00e4ki","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Tuomas","lastName":"Aittom\u00e4ki","id":"37391626000"},{"name":"Visa Koivunen","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Visa","lastName":"Koivunen","id":"37269798700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081605","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"abstract":"Cognitive and MIMO radars need to adapt the transmitted waveforms based on the radar task as well as the propagation and the target environments.

A Least Square Decision Feedback (LS-DF) semi-blind channel estimator is then considered showing that a reduction of 76% of the pilot's power is obtained compared to the LS pilot-based estimator for the same channel estimation performance.","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081611.pdf","startPage":"2254","endPage":"2258","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081611","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081611","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081611","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Signal processing algorithms","Training","Mathematical model","Equalizers","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","decision feedback equalisers","least squares approximations","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbol detection","semiblind channel estimator","multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","channel estimation","power resources","equalization","semiblind channel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081611/","displayDocTitle":"Toward green communications using semi-blind channel estimation","accessionNumber":"17303384","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081611/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward green communications using semi-blind channel estimation","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570342152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080537S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8081614,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Meier","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Meier","id":"38490713900"},{"name":"Daniel Gerber","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Gerber","id":"37086190999"},{"name":"Walter Kellermann","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Kellermann","id":"37274601000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081614","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081614","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphones","Training","Signal to noise ratio","Noise measurement","Speech","Robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","neural nets","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target activity detection","audio signal processing","precise identification","time frames","predefined target source","Artificial Neural Networks","ANN","crosscorrelation features","classical signal processing method","Signal-to-Noise Ratio conditions","detection thresholds"]}],"doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081614","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081614.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","startPage":"2269","endPage":"2273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the robustness of neural network-based target activity detection","abstract":"Many applications in audio signal processing require a precise identification of time frames where a predefined target source is active.

In this paper, the performance of ANN-based target activity detection is analyzed in more detail and compared with a well-performing \"classical\" signal processing method. On the one hand, the impact of the angular distance between target source and interferers is evaluated for both the neural network-based method and the classical one. On the other hand, the sensitivity of both methods to varying Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions is analyzed with respect to the importance of a proper choice of detection thresholds.

Finally, the receiver side range of each target is estimated by using the other three estimated location parameters in 2D MUSIC technique which also automatically pairs the location parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near field targets localization using bistatic MIMO system with symmetric arrays","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081641","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081641.pdf","startPage":"2403","endPage":"2407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Near field targets localization using bistatic MIMO system with symmetric arrays","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081641/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290359","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near field targets localization using bistatic MIMO system with symmetric arrays","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570341775.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053534S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081642,"authors":[{"name":"Parth Raj Singh","affiliation":["IETR, Polytech Nantes, France"],"firstName":"Parth Raj","lastName":"Singh","id":"37086219278"},{"name":"Yide Wang","affiliation":["IETR, Polytech Nantes, France"],"firstName":"Yide","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086225705"},{"name":"Pascal Charge","affiliation":["IETR, Polytech Nantes, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Charge","id":"38267385400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081642","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Antenna arrays","Receiving antennas","Antenna measurements","Covariance matrices","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","linear antenna arrays","MIMO radar","object detection","radar antennas","radar detection","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bistatic MIMO system","receiving arrays","Fresnel approximation","near field target localization method","spherical wavefront based model","uniform linear transmitting arrays","field source localization","near field source localization","carrier wavelength"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a subspace based near field targets localization method with bistatic MIMO system consisting of uniform linear transmitting and receiving arrays.

A recent trend in the design is to split the pre-coding at the transmitter and the combining at the receiver into a digital and analog part, with hybrid analog-digital schemes. In this paper the effect of phase noise is considered in the design of different hybrid analog-digital alternatives to implement massive MIMO, in particular at very high frequencies. Its effect depending on the number of RF chains, oscillators, and groups of antennas is analyzed providing some insights for the system design. In order to limit the penalty introduced by the phase noise to values below 6 dB, with a number of antennas around 64, the value of phase noise increment variance should be limited below 0.005. This limit is slightly lower in a simplified architecture with more blocks driven by independent oscillators.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081652.pdf","startPage":"2458","endPage":"2462","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of pre-coding and combining in hybrid analog-digital massive MIMO with phase noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Receivers","Phase noise","Transmitting antennas","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","MIMO communication","phase noise","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power consumption","hybrid analog-digital alternatives","hybrid analog-digital massive MIMO","pre-coding","phase noise increment variance","system design","hybrid analog-digital schemes","achievable rate","noise figure 6.0 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","hybrid pre-coding and combining MIMO","phase noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081652/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Design of pre-coding and combining in hybrid analog-digital massive MIMO with phase noise","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081652/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17289973","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of pre-coding and combining in hybrid analog-digital massive MIMO with phase noise","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570341780.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053213S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081654,"authors":[{"name":"R\u00e9mi Flamary","affiliation":["Lagrange OCA, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d\u2019 Azur, Nice, France"],"firstName":"R\u00e9mi","lastName":"Flamary","id":"37704077200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081654","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Neural networks","Convolution","Complexity theory","Training","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["astronomical image processing","astronomical techniques","image reconstruction","neural nets","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["astronomical image reconstruction","convolutional neural networks","regularized constrained optimization problem","computationally intensive tasks","superlinear complexity"]}],"abstract":"State of the art methods in astronomical image reconstruction rely on the resolution of a regularized or constrained optimization problem.

markets","abstract":"Forecasting financial time-series has long been among the most challenging problems in financial market analysis. In order to recognize the correct circumstances to enter or exit the markets investors usually employ statistical models (or even simple qualitative methods). However, the inherently noisy and stochastic nature of markets severely limits the forecasting accuracy of the used models. The introduction of electronic trading and the availability of large amounts of data allow for developing novel machine learning techniques that address some of the difficulties faced by the aforementioned methods. In this work we propose a deep learning methodology, based on recurrent neural networks, that can be used for predicting future price movements from large-scale high-frequency time-series data on Limit Order Books. The proposed method is evaluated using a large-scale dataset of limit order book events.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081663/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290284","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using deep learning to detect price change indications in financial markets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using deep learning to detect price change indications in financial markets","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570346870.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086722S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8081665,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelhamid Ladaycia","affiliation":["L2TI, Institut Galil\u00e9e, France"],"firstName":"Abdelhamid","lastName":"Ladaycia","id":"37086002901"},{"name":"Karim Abed-Meraim","affiliation":["PRISME, Universit\u00e9 d'Orl\u00e9ans, France"],"firstName":"Karim","lastName":"Abed-Meraim","id":"38273289600"},{"name":"Ahmed Bader","affiliation":["King Abdullah Univ. of Sci. & Technol.

Indeed, the outstanding performance of this multi-hop relaying scheme relies heavily on the channel and CFO estimation quality at the PHY layer.

The two solutions are analyzed and compared in terms of performance, cost and convergence rate.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081665","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081665.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","startPage":"2521","endPage":"2525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CFO and channel estimation for MISO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CFO and channel estimation for MISO-OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081665/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17289984","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081665/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CFO and channel estimation for MISO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347516.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051692S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081666,"authors":[{"name":"Atul Kumar","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Atul","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086005064"},{"name":"Maurizio Magarini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Magarini","id":"37268262100"},{"name":"Stefano Olivieri","affiliation":["Math Works Italia Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Olivieri","id":"37448788300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081666","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid prototyping and FPGA-in-the-Loop verification of a DFrFT-based OFDM system","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081666.pdf","startPage":"2526","endPage":"2530","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081666","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Kernel","Receivers","Quantization (signal)","Field programmable gate arrays","Software packages","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","error statistics","field programmable gate arrays","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rapid prototyping","OFDM system","lower sensitivity","synchronization errors","DFrFT hardware implementation","bit error rate","frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel","CFO","DFrFT-based OFDM system","BER","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","FPGA-in-the-loop verification","carrier frequency offset","field programmable gate array","discrete fractional Fourier transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","FPGA-in-the-Loop co-simulation","Rapid prototyping","carrier frequency offset (CFO)","discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFrFT)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081666","abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based on the use of discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFrFT) has recently gained interest due to its lower sensitivity to synchronization errors in comparison with conventional OFDM based on the use of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT).

For instance, a secondary unlicensed system can share resources with the cellular uplink of a primary licensed system for an improved spectral efficiency. This induces interference which has to be taken into account when designing such a system. A simple yet robust strategy is treating interference as noise (TIN), which is widely adapted in practice. It is thus important to study the capabilities and limitations of TIN in such scenarios. In this paper, we study this scenario modelled as multiple access channel (MAC) interfered by a Point-to-Point (P2P) channel, where we focus on the characterization of the rate region. We use improper Gaussian signaling (instead of proper) at the transmitters to increase the design flexibility, which offers the freedom of optimizing the transmit signal pseudo-variance in addition to its variance. We formulate the weighted max-min problem as a semidefinite program, and use semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to obtain a near-optimal solution. Numerical optimizations show that, by improper Gaussian signaling the achievable rates can be improved upto three times when compared to proper Gaussian signaling.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Tin","Receivers","Transmitters","Integrated circuits","Device-to-device communication","Europe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","Gaussian processes","interference (signal)","multi-access systems","Pareto optimisation","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication signalling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secondary unlicensed system","cellular uplink","primary licensed system","improved spectral efficiency","scenario modelled","multiple access channel","improper Gaussian signaling","transmit signal pseudovariance","interference MAC","rate region pareto boundary","point-to-point channel","5G communication","multiple access channel interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Improper Gaussian signaling","rate maximization","partial interference multiple access channel","Pareto boundary","augmented covariance matrix"]}],"doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081668","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081668.pdf","startPage":"2536","endPage":"2540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference MAC: Impact of improper Gaussian signaling on the rate region Pareto boundary","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference MAC: Impact of improper Gaussian signaling on the rate region Pareto boundary","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081668/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081668/","accessionNumber":"17290004","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference MAC: Impact of improper Gaussian signaling on the rate region Pareto boundary","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570346395.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062744S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081669,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Li","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, P.

In Khisti and Wornell's classical work [1], the optimal secure beamformer for MISOME has been derived under the total power constraint. In this work, we revisit the MISOME wiretap channel and focus on the large-scale transmit antenna regime and the constant modulus beamformer design. The former is motivated by the significant spectral efficiency gains provided by massive antennas, and the latter is due to the consideration of cheap hardware implementation of constant modulus beamforming. However, from an optimization point of view, the secrecy beamforming with constant modulus constraints is challenging, more specifically, NP-hard. In light of this, we propose two methods to tackle it, namely the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method and the ADMM-Dinkelbach method. Simulation results demonstrate that the ADMM-Dinkelbach method outperforms the SDR method, and can attain nearly optimal secrecy performance for the large-scale antenna scenario.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","startPage":"2541","endPage":"2545","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081669.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constant modulus beamforming for large-scale MISOME wiretap channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081669/","displayDocTitle":"Constant modulus beamforming for large-scale MISOME wiretap channel","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290249","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant modulus beamforming for large-scale MISOME wiretap channel","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570342239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072638S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081670,"authors":[{"name":"Zhirong Zeng","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhirong","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37086212853"},{"name":"Huiqin Du","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","College of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Huiqin","lastName":"Du","id":"37708277700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081670","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":438},"abstract":"This paper considers a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) visible light communication (VLC) interference channel.

However, the perfect information may not be available at transmitter, which will lead to severe interference and consequently degrade the system performance. Robust precoding design with the assist of block diagonalization (BD) scheme is proposed to minimize the mean square error (MMSE), which not only completely suppresses the MUI but also maximizes the sum rate of the MU VLC system. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081670.pdf","startPage":"2546","endPage":"2550","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust precoding scheme for multi-user MIMO visible light communication system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Robustness","Precoding","MIMO","Optical transmitters","Signal processing algorithms","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","free-space optical communication","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","light interference","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust precoding scheme","multiuser MIMO visible light communication system","channel state information","block diagonalization scheme","multiuser interference suppression","MUI suppression","system performance degradation","MU-MIMO VLC system","transmitter","mean square error minimization","MMSE","BD scheme","multiuser multiple input multiple-output visible light communication interference channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081670/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Robust precoding scheme for multi-user MIMO visible light communication system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081670/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290152","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust precoding scheme for multi-user MIMO visible light communication system","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073196S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081673,"authors":[{"name":"Fatimetou El Jili","affiliation":["CRESTIC, Reims University (URCA)"],"firstName":"Fatimetou El","lastName":"Jili","id":"37086227211"},{"name":"Ga\u00ebl Mah\u00e9","affiliation":["LIPADE, Paris Descartes University"],"firstName":"Ga\u00ebl","lastName":"Mah\u00e9","id":"37589735900"},{"name":"Mamadou Mboup","affiliation":["CRESTIC, Reims University (URCA)"],"firstName":"Mamadou","lastName":"Mboup","id":"37371311500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081673","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Decoding","Channel coding","Error correction codes","Quantization (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","block codes","error correction codes","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary vector weighted sum","error correction codes","error correcting codes","robust signal quantization system","correction powers","corresponding block code","binary decomposition","N"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose a robust representation of a digital signal based on error correction codes. For each frame of the signal (N successive samples) a binary decomposition, as a (successive power 2) weighted sum of binary vectors, is first considered. Then, each binary vector is projected into the set of codewords of a corresponding block code. The codes are designed so that their correction powers increases inversely to the weight of the binary vectors since the binary vectors with high weight are less sensitive to disturbance. The corresponding representation (decoding) thus appears as a form of signal quantization that can provide an interesting protection against noise and/or channel distorsion.

However, the large amount of data of spectral information that must be processed to identify and assign spectral resources increases the channel assignment times, therefore worsening the quality of service for the devices using the spectrum. Compressive Sensing (CS) is a digital processing technique that allows the reconstruction of sparse or compressible signals using fewer samples than those required traditionally. This paper presents a model that addresses the Spectral Sensing problem in Cognitive Radio using Compressive Sensing as an effective way of decreasing the number of samples required in the sensing process. This model is based on Compressive Spectral Imaging (CSI) architectures where a centralized spectrum manager selects what power data must be delivered by the different wireless devices using binary patterns, and builds a multispectral data cube image with the geographical and spectral data power information. The results show that this multispectral data cube can be built with only a 50% of the samples generated by the devices and, therefore reducing the data traffic dramatically.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081675/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17290356","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081675/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Compressive multispectral model for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive multispectral model for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570346685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099763S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081676,"authors":[{"name":"Wael Abd-Alaziz","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Wael","lastName":"Abd-Alaziz","id":"37085826270"},{"name":"Zhen Mei","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Mei","id":"37085769538"},{"name":"Martin Johnston","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Johnston","id":"37274107100"},{"name":"St\u00e9phane Le Goff","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"St\u00e9phane","lastName":"Le Goff","id":"37283397400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-7-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9928626-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0751-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"8081676","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":277},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Turbo codes","Probability density function","Attenuation","Convolutional codes","Convolution","Europe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","error correction codes","impulse noise","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM-PLC system","comparable binary turbo","additive Middleton Class A noise","nonbinary turbo-codes","nonbinary error-correcting codes","power-line communication channel","binary turbo codes","nonbinary turbo codes","extremely impulsive channels","impulsive noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["non-binary turbo codes","power-line communication","impulsive noise","Middleton Class A noise","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"The power-line communication (PLC) channel causes information-bearing signals to be affected by impulsive noise and the effects of the multipath fading.

In this paper, we investigate the performance of non-binary turbo-codes on PLC channels that exhibit frequency selectivity with additive Middleton Class A noise and compare with a comparable binary turbo-coded PLC system. In order to reduce the effect of multipath and impulsive noise, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) with non-linear receivers (blanking and clipping) have been employed. The system is examined on extremely impulsive channels where the value of the impulsive index (A) is 0.01 and the noise ratio (\u0393) is 0.01. The results show that non-binary turbo codes are very robust and achieve a large gain over binary turbo codes on PLC channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-binary turbo-coded OFDM-PLC system in the presence of impulsive noise","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081676","startPage":"2576","endPage":"2580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081676.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Non-binary turbo-coded OFDM-PLC system in the presence of impulsive noise","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081676/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17303375","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-binary turbo-coded OFDM-PLC system in the presence of impulsive noise","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075493S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081680,"authors":[{"name":"Orod Raeesi","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Orod","lastName":"Raeesi","id":"37085513668"},{"name":"Ahmet Gokceoglu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Ahmet","lastName":"Gokceoglu","id":"37658708500"},{"name":"Paschalis C.

Based on the assumed non-reciprocity model, it is shown that the effective downlink channel can be decomposed as a product of the uplink channel and another sparse matrix, referred to as the BS transceiver non-reciprocity matrix. Stemming from such modeling, we then propose an efficient estimator of the BS transceiver non-reciprocity matrix exploiting its sparse nature, combined with an appropriate formulation of the associated over-the-air pilot-signaling. The mean-squared error performance of the overall corresponding estimation method is finally evaluated using extensive computer simulations which indicate that the non-reciprocity characteristics can be estimated efficiently and accurately, thus potentially facilitating large system-level performance gains in multi-user massive MIMO systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067434/8081145/08081680.pdf","startPage":"2596","endPage":"2600","publicationTitle":"2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and estimation of massive MIMO channel non-reciprocity: Sparsity-aided approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transceivers","Estimation","Channel estimation","Mutual coupling","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","frequency response","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","precoding","radio transceivers","sparse matrices","time division multiplexing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparsity-aided approach","precoded time division duplexing","massive multiple-input multiple-output systems","effective downlink channel","uplink channel","nonreciprocity characteristics","multiuser massive MIMO systems","massive MIMO base station","estimation method","massive MIMO channel nonreciprocity estimation","massive MIMO channel nonreciprocity modelling","frequency-response","transmitter chains","receiver chains","sparse matrix decomposition","BS transceiver nonreciprocity matrix estimator","over-the-air pilot-signaling","mean-squared error performance","extensive computer simulations","system-level performance gains"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel non-reciprocity","frequency-response mismatch","massive MIMO","mutual coupling","sparsity","time division duplexing (TDD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and estimation of massive MIMO channel non-reciprocity: Sparsity-aided approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081680/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17290401","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and estimation of massive MIMO channel non-reciprocity: Sparsity-aided approach","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570346999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100665S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081681,"authors":[{"name":"Markus V.

While one utilizes engineered features such as mel-frequency-cepstral-coefficients (MFCCs), the other uses learned features that are the outcome of an optimization algorithm. I-vectors are the result of a modeling technique that usually takes engineered features as input. It has been shown that standard MFCCs extracted from monaural audio signals lead to i-vectors that exhibit poor performance, especially on indoor acoustic scenes. At the same time, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well known for their ability to learn features by optimizing their filters. They have been applied on ASC and have shown promising results. In this paper, we first propose a novel multi-channel i-vector extraction and scoring scheme for ASC, improving their performance on indoor and outdoor scenes. Second, we propose a CNN architecture that achieves promising ASC results. Further, we show that i-vectors and CNNs capture complementary information from acoustic scenes. Finally, we propose a hybrid system for ASC using multi-channel i-vectors and CNNs by utilizing a score fusion technique.

network approach for sound event detection in real life audio","abstract":"This paper presents and compares two algorithms based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) for sound event detection in real life audio. Both systems have been developed and evaluated with the material provided for the third task of the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2016 challenge. For the first algorithm, we make use of an ANN trained on different features extracted from the down-mixed mono channel audio. Secondly, we analyse a binaural algorithm where the same feature extraction is performed on four different channels: the two binaural channels, the averaged monaural signal and the difference between the binaural channels. The proposed feature set comprehends, along with mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and log-mel energies, also activity information extracted with two different voice activity detection (VAD) algorithms. Moreover, we will present results obtained with two different neural architectures, namely multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent neural networks. The highest scores obtained on the DCASE 2016 evaluation dataset are achieved by a MLP trained on binaural features and adaptive energy VAD; they consist of an averaged error rate of 0.79 and an averaged F1 score of 48.1%, thus marking an improvement over the best score registered in the DCASE 2016 challenge.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081712/","accessionNumber":"17290209","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081712/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach for sound event detection in real life audio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach for sound event detection in real life audio","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570347664.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056305S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067434","isNumber":"8081145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067434","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8081145","articleId":"8081712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8081731,"authors":[{"name":"Ling-Jyh Chen","affiliation":["Academia Sinica, Institute of Information Science, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8334665/8081731/chen-2766085-small.gif","p":["Ling-Jyh Chen (S\u201903\u2013M\u201905\u2013SM\u201912) received the B.Ed. degree in information and computer education from National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1998, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.","His current research interests include wireless networks, mobile computing, network measurements, and social computing."]},"firstName":"Ling-Jyh","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0001-5667-7764","id":"37085722433"},{"name":"Yao-Hua Ho","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8334665/8081731/ho-2766085-small.gif","p":["Yao-Hua Ho received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA, in 2001, 2002, and 2009, respectively.","He joined the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, University of Central Florida, in 2012.

Air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5), has raised a series of concerns for public health. As a result, a number of large-scale, low cost PM2.5 monitoring systems have been deployed in several international smart city projects. One of the major challenges for such environmental sensing systems is ensuring the data quality. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection framework (ADF) for large-scale, real-world environmental sensing systems. The framework is composed of four modules: 1) time-sliced anomaly detection (TSAD), which detects spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal anomalies in the real-time sensor measurement data stream; 2) real-time emission detection, which detects potential regional emission sources; 3) device ranking, which provides a ranking for each sensing device; and 4) malfunction detection, which identifies malfunctioning devices. Using real world measurement data from the AirBox project, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively identify outliers in the raw measurement data as well as infer anomalous events that are perceivable by the general public and government authorities. Because of its simple design, ADF is highly extensible to other advanced applications, and it can be exploited to support various large-scale environmental sensing systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081731/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081731/","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2018","accessionNumber":"17697422","volume":"5","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"ADF: An Anomaly Detection Framework for Large-Scale PM2.5 Sensing Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan","grantNumber":"105-2221-E-001-016-MY3, 106-3011-F-001-001 and 106-3114-E-001-004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001869","fundingName":"Academia Sinica","grantNumber":"AS-104-SS-A02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ADF: An Anomaly Detection Framework for Large-Scale PM2.5 Sensing Systems","sourcePdf":"jiot-chen-2766085-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103745S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8334665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8334665","articleId":"8081731","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8081735,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8081735/xu-2764474-small.gif","p":["Zhao Xu received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in automatic control from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in control and instrumentation from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2013.

Although the use of data-driven fault detection techniques have gained much interest, the main deterrent in using these approaches in detecting ITSC faults is in the generalization and robustness of the diagnosis. In this paper, a data-driven on-line fault detection framework, incorporated with multi-feature extraction/selection and multi-classifier ensemble is proposed, capable of detecting ITSC faults in induction motors (IMs) that subjected to variable operating conditions. By using the synchronous time series signals collected from the machines, multiple feature extraction/selection is explored to find the sensitive faulty features, and the different types of classification strategies is used to increase the diversity of single based models. With the increased diversity of the base learners, the fault detection accuracy is expected to be enhanced and the robustness can be guaranteed. The framework was implemented and tested using real data collected from a designed test bed, with the experimental results showing the effectiveness of the framework in detecting ITSC faults in IMs.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2764474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08081735.pdf","startPage":"25055","endPage":"25068","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2764474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Inter-Turn Short Circuit Fault Detection in Induction Machines","topic":"Data-Driven Monitoring, Fault Diagnosis and Control of Cyber-Physical Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Inter-Turn Short Circuit Fault Detection in Induction Machines","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8081735/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17381229","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081735/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61603303 and 61401363"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"G2017KY0008"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi","grantNumber":"2017JQ6005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2017M610650"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Development Foundation of Loving Students","grantNumber":"ASN-IF2015-1502"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Data-Driven Inter-Turn Short Circuit Fault Detection in Induction Machines","sourcePdf":"access-hu-2764474-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.188699S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Data-Driven Monitoring, Fault Diagnosis and Control of Cyber-Physical Systems"],"articleId":"8081735","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8081736,"authors":[{"name":"Dechuan Chen","affiliation":["Wuhan Zhong Yuan Electronics Group Company Ltd., Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8081736/chen-2762738-small.gif","p":["Dechuan Chen received the M.S. degree in information and communication engineering from the College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2017.

Specifically, we first examine the connection outage probability (COP) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) to investigate the reliability and security performance in two cases, where the secondary destination exploits the maximum ratio combining (MRC) scheme or the selection combining (SC) scheme. To characterize the tradeoff between reliability and security, we then investigate the effective secrecy throughput (EST) performance by including the COP and SOP in a unified manner. In order to gain additional insights from the performance evaluation, we also provide the asymptotic expressions for the COP, SOP, and EST in high signal-to-noise ratio region. It is demonstrated that the interference temperature constraint incurred from the primary network enables a tradeoff between reliability and security of the secondary network. Moreover, the resulting analysis shows that using the untrusted relay to forward the transmitted message is unnecessary when the secondary destination employs the SC scheme and the untrusted relay operates in half-duplex mode.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2762738","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08081736.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2762738","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","startPage":"7055","endPage":"7065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical Layer Security in Cognitive Untrusted Relay Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Physical Layer Security in Cognitive Untrusted Relay Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081736/","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8081736/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17612344","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771487, 61471393, 61371122 and 61501512"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Provincial National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"BK20150718"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2013T60912"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Physical Layer Security in Cognitive Untrusted Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"access-cheng-2762738-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132085S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8081736","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8081737,"authors":[{"name":"Xuhong Chen","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8081737/chen-2766157-small.gif","p":["Xuhong Chen received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Department of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2010 and 2013, respectively.

In the literature, the majority of previous works focused on how to optimize the beamforming scheme with traditional side information like perfect or imperfect channel state information (CSI) in non-mobile or low mobility scenarios. However, it is hard to either track the channel or obtain perfect CSI in the high mobility scenario without large online computation, because the wireless channel appears to be fast time varying and double-selective in the spatial-temporal domain. In this paper, by exploiting the special characters in the high mobility scenario, we introduce an applicable low-complexity beamforming scheme with transmit diversity in the high mobility scenario with the aid of location information. The beam is generated and selected mainly based on the location information, where the beam weight is optimized to maximize the total service that one BS can provide. Moreover, to guarantee a full diversity gain in this joint scheme, an optimal beam selection algorithm is proposed. Besides, to maximize the total service competence of one base station, a closed-form power allocation solution for the multi-user scenario is derived. To solve the potential inter-beam interference in massive MIMO system, a location-aided algorithm is proposed to eliminate the interference and maximize the mobile service of the whole train at the same time. Theoretical analysis and multiple simulation results show that our scheme approaches the theoretical performance bound of adaptive beamforming scheme but with much lower complexity.","topic":"High Mobility 5G LTE-V: Challenges and Solutions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081737/","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8081737/","accessionNumber":"17381169","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Massive MIMO Beamforming With Transmit Diversity for High Mobility Wireless Communications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB316100(2)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61171064 and 61321061"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Massive MIMO Beamforming With Transmit Diversity for High Mobility Wireless Communications","sourcePdf":"access-fan-2766157-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109445S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["High Mobility 5G LTE-V: Challenges and Solutions"],"articleId":"8081737","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8081750,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir V.

Its latency requirements, however, are determined by its ability to promptly exclude from the ML search (i.e., prune) large parts of the corresponding SD tree, without compromising the ML optimality. Traditional depth-first approaches initially find a \u201cpromising\u201d candidate solution and then prune parts of the tree that cannot result to a \u201cbetter\u201d solution. Still, if this candidate solution is far (in terms of Euclidean distance) from the ML one, pruning becomes inefficient and decoding latency explodes. To reduce this processing latency, an early termination approach is, first, introduced that exploits the binary nature of the transmitted information. Then, a simple but very efficient SD approach is proposed that performs multiple tree searches that perform decreasingly aggressive pruning. These searches are almost independent and can take place sequentially, in parallel, or even in a hybrid (sequential/parallel) manner. For Polar codes of 128 block size, both realizations can provide a latency reduction of up to four orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art Polar sphere decoders. Then, a further 50% latency reduction can be achieved by exploiting the parallel nature of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2761262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2761262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8290782/08081751.pdf","startPage":"1835","endPage":"1839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8290782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced Latency ML Polar Decoding via Multiple Sphere-Decoding Tree Searches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Reduced Latency ML Polar Decoding via Multiple Sphere-Decoding Tree Searches","volume":"67","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17577918","htmlLink":"/document/8081751/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/M029441/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced Latency ML Polar Decoding via Multiple Sphere-Decoding Tree Searches","sourcePdf":"tvt-husmann-2761262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063632S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8290782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8290782","articleId":"8081751","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8081752,"authors":[{"name":"Sophie Dupuis","affiliation":["LIRMM (University of Montpellier/CNRS)"],"bio":{"p":["Sophie Dupuis has been an Associate Professor with LIRMM, Montpellier, France, since 2011.

To reduce computational complexity, one important property of the array codes is that only exclusive OR operations are used in the encoding and decoding processes. Cauchy Reed-Solomon codes, Rabin-like codes, and circulant Cauchy codes are existing Cauchy maximum-distance separable (MDS) array codes that employ Cauchy matrices over finite fields, circular permutation matrices, and circulant Cauchy matrices, respectively. All these codes can correct any number of failures; however, a critical drawback of existing codes is the high decoding complexity. In this paper, we propose a new construction of Rabin-like codes based on a quotient ring with a cyclic structure. The newly constructed Rabin-like codes have more supported parameters (prime p is extended to an odd number), such that the world sizes of them are more flexible than the existing Cauchy MDS array codes. An efficient decoding method using LU factorization of the Cauchy matrix can be applied to the newly constructed Rabin-like codes. It is shown that the decoding complexity of the proposed approach is less than that of existing Cauchy MDS array codes. Hence, the Rabin-like codes based on the new construction are attractive to distributed storage systems.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2766140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8291762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2766140","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8291762/08081754.pdf","startPage":"521","endPage":"533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Construction and an Efficient Decoding Method for Rabin-Like Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"A New Construction and an Efficient Decoding Method for Rabin-Like Codes","volume":"66","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081754/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17577993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081754/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701115, 61671007 and 61671001"},{"fundingName":"National Keystone R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFB0803204 and 2016YFB0800101"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Research Program","grantNumber":"ZDSYS201603311739428"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Construction and an Efficient Decoding Method for Rabin-Like Codes","sourcePdf":"tcomm-han-2766140-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147615S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8291762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8291762","articleId":"8081754","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8081765,"authors":[{"name":"Yucen Nan","affiliation":["Centre for Distributed and High Performance Computing, School of Information Technologies, The University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8081765/nan-2766165-small.gif","p":["Yucen Nan (S\u201916) received the B.E. degree in computer science engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2015, and the M.Phil. degree from The University of Sydney in 2017.

However, limitations of the cloud model, such as the high transmission latency and high costs are giving birth to a new computing paradigm called edge computing (a.k.a fog computing). Fog computing aims to move the data processing close to the network edge so as to reduce Internet traffic. However, since the servers at the fog layer are not as powerful as the ones in the cloud, there is a need to balance the data processing in between the fog and the cloud. Moreover, besides the data offloading issue, the energy efficiency of fog computing nodes has become an increasing concern. Densely deployed fog nodes are a major source of carbon footprint in IoT systems. To reduce the usage of the brown energy resources (e.g. powered by energy produced through fossil fuels), green energy is an alternative option. In this paper, we propose employing dual energy sources for supporting the fog nodes, where solar power is the primary energy supply and grid power is the backup supply. Based on that, we present a comprehensive analytic framework for incorporating green energy sources to support the running of IoT and fog computingbased systems, and to handle the tradeoff in terms of average response time, average monetary, and energy costs in the IoT. This paper describes an online algorithm, Lyapunov optimization on time and energy cost (LOTEC), based on the technique of Lyapunov optimization. LOTEC is a quantified near optimal solution and is able to make control decision on application offloading by adjusting the two-way tradeoff between average response time and average cost. We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm by a number of experiments. Rigorous analysis and simulations have demonstrated its performance.","topic":"Green Cloud and Fog Computing: Energy Efficient and Sustainable Infrastructures, Protocols and Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081765/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","publicationDate":"2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081765/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2017","accessionNumber":"17381173","volume":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Energy-Aware Computation Offloading for Cloud of Things Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001774","fundingName":"Faculty of Engineering and IT Early Career Researcher scheme, The University of Sydney"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001774","fundingName":"Faculty of Engineering Information Technologies, The University of Sydney, under the Faculty Research Cluster Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001774","fundingName":"The University of Sydney DVC Research/Bridging Support"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council Discovery","grantNumber":"DP130104591"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"CNPq Fellowship"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1435219"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Adaptive Energy-Aware Computation Offloading for Cloud of Things Systems","sourcePdf":"access-nan-2766165-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117581S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Green Cloud and Fog Computing: Energy Efficient and Sustainable Infrastructures, Protocols and Applications"],"articleId":"8081765","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8081768,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoxi Fang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer, Zhejiang Wanli University, Ningbo, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8081768/fang-2766079-small.gif","p":["Zhaoxi Fang (M\u201915) received the B.

Practical scenarios are considered, where massive MIMO is deployed at the base station and the relay station. Based on generic relay modes, namely, antenna-selection-based decode-and-forward (DF) relay and signal-space alignment based amplify-and-forward (AF) relay, closed-form expressions for the asymptotic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) are derived. The difference between AF and DF in the FD mode is quantified, and so is that between FD and half-duplex (HD) under the two relay modes. With massive MIMO, the superiority of DF in the FD mode is confirmed in terms of spectral efficiency. The sufficient conditions for the FD mode to outperform the HD mode are identified. The effectiveness of massive MIMO in terms of self-loop interference cancellation and inter-user interference suppression is proved. All these insightful findings are corroborated by simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08081768.pdf","startPage":"23288","endPage":"23298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766079","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massive MIMO for Full-Duplex Cellular Two-Way Relay Network: A Spectral Efficiency Study","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Interference","Antennas","High definition video","Relay networks (telecommunications)","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["duplex modes","relay station","generic relay modes","FD mode","massive MIMO system","massive multiple-input-multiple-output system","full-duplex cellular two-way rrelay networks","DF relay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular two-way relay networks","massive MIMO","full-duplex","spectral efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Massive MIMO for Full-Duplex Cellular Two-Way Relay Network: A Spectral Efficiency Study","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8081768/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17381174","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"LY17F010002 and LY18F010001"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"2016C33036"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007834","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo City","grantNumber":"2016A610225 and 2017A610101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Massive MIMO for Full-Duplex Cellular Two-Way Relay Network: A Spectral Efficiency Study","sourcePdf":"access-fang-2766079-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150524S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8081768","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8081769,"authors":[{"name":"Shilie Zheng","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8081769/zheng-2766078-small.gif","p":["Shilie Zheng (M\u201915) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in materials science and the Ph.D. degree in physical electronics and optoelectronics from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1995, 1998, and 2003, respectively.

Two analytical models, known as specular reflection model and circular scattering model, are applied to evaluate the reflection and scattering effects of wave propagating in the NLoS channels. The performances of the PSOAM-MIMO system in the NLoS channel are compared with those of the conventional MIMO system and in LoS channel. It is found that the capacity gain of the PSOAM-MIMO over MIMO is mainly determined by a direct path. In the NLoS channel, the capacity gain of PSOAM-MIMO over MIMO decreases compared with that in LoS, however, the multi-path effects improve the absolute capacity of PSOAM-MIMO system, and the worst case are comparable with those in an MIMO system. As a result, the PSOAM-MIMO system demonstrates the strong robustness in wireless communications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766078","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08081769.pdf","startPage":"25377","endPage":"25384","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Line-of-Sight Channel Performance of Plane Spiral Orbital Angular Momentum MIMO Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Non-Line-of-Sight Channel Performance of Plane Spiral Orbital Angular Momentum MIMO Systems","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8081769/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17496761","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081769/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2014CB340005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571391 and 61371030"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Non-Line-of-Sight Channel Performance of Plane Spiral Orbital Angular Momentum MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"access-zheng-2766078-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071924S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8081769","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8081771,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Cheng","affiliation":["School of Communication Engineering and the Kangni Mechanical and Electrical Institute, Nanjing Institute of Technology, Nanjing, China","Jiangsu Key Laboratory Meteorological Observation and Information Processing, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China","Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing and Intelligent Control, Minjiang University, Fuzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8081771/cheng-2766128-small.gif","p":["Yong Cheng received the M.S. degree in computer science and technology from the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree in computer application technology from the Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China, in 2010.

Illumination estimation-based illumination invariant extraction is widely used to alleviate the adverse effects of illumination variation on face recognition. Most existing methods only used slowly changing characteristics of lighting to achieve illumination estimation, thus resulting in inaccurate illumination estimation and illumination invariant extraction under complex illumination conditions. To alleviate this issue, on the basis of the Lambertian reflectance model, we propose an innovative method of directional illumination estimation to extract directional illumination invariant sets from a facial image. The directional illumination invariant sets not only better preserve essential features of the face, but also largely reduce adverse effects of rapid light changes. Moreover, we propose a multilevel matching metric for category classification by using an inner product measure and residual matching.

To meet the increasing performance demand of modern applications, recent studies speed up flash accesses by exploiting access latency variations at the device level. Unfortunately, existing flash access schedulers are still oblivious to such variations, leading to suboptimal I/O performance improvements. In this paper, we propose DLV, a novel flash access scheduler for exploring scheduling opportunities due to device level access latency variations. DLV improves flash access speeds based on process variations and data retention time difference across flash blocks. More importantly, DLV integrates access speed optimization with access scheduling such that the average access response time can be effectively reduced on flash memory storage systems. Our experimental results show that DLV achieves an average of 41.5% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/43/8411796/8081787-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081787/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","volume":"37","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"17935330","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8081787/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"DLV: Exploiting Device Level Latency Variations for Performance Improvement on Flash Memory Storage Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB1000303 and 2016YFB0201800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1718080"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91630206 and 61672423"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council","grantNumber":"201606280098"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"DLV: Exploiting Device Level Latency Variations for Performance Improvement on Flash Memory Storage Systems","sourcePdf":"tcad-cui-2766156-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114337S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8411796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8411796","articleId":"8081787","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8081788,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Fei Shu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/8264903/8081788/shu-2756902-small.gif","p":["Yu-Fei Shu (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electronic and\n information engineering from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2014.

In some cases, an accurate phase measurement may not be practically feasible. A phase-retrieval method based on phaseless and single-plane near-field scanning is presented in this paper. By using an interpolation technique, the original data of field magnitude used for reconstruction can be divided into two groups: the sampling and interpolation groups. Subsequently, iteration algorithm together with the singular value decomposition method is employed to reconstruct the equivalent dipole model of the EMI source. Both numerical example and measurement example are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The major advantage of the proposed method is that it can save a half scanning time and still produces a valid EMI source model. It also shows an ability to reduce some measurement errors.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2017.2756902","pdfPath":"/iel7/15/8264903/08081788.pdf","startPage":"937","endPage":"944","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2017.2756902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8264903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Iterative Approach for EMI Source Reconstruction Based on Phaseless and Single-Plane Near-Field Scanning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"An Iterative Approach for EMI Source Reconstruction Based on Phaseless and Single-Plane Near-Field Scanning","volume":"60","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17535264","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8081788/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LGG18F010002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Iterative Approach for EMI Source Reconstruction Based on Phaseless and Single-Plane Near-Field Scanning","sourcePdf":"temc-wei-2756902-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053201S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"8264903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8264903","articleId":"8081788","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":8081790,"authors":[{"name":"Sihem Mesnager","affiliation":["University of Paris XIII, CNRS, LAGA UMR 7539, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, Villetaneuse, France","Department of Mathematics, University of Paris VIII, Saint-Denis, France","Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"bio":{"p":["Sihem Mesnager received the Ph.D. degree in Mathematics from the University of Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris VI), Paris, France, in 2002 and the Habilitation to Direct Theses (HDR) in Mathematics from the University of Paris VIII, France, in 2012.

LCD codes have been extensively studied in literature recently. In addition to their applications in data storage, communications systems, and consumer electronics, LCD codes have been employed in cryptography. More specifically, it has been shown that LCD codes can also help improve the security of the information processed by sensitive devices, especially against so-called sidechannel attacks (SCA) and fault non-invasive attacks. In this paper, we are interested in the construction of particular algebraic geometry LCD codes which could be good candidates to be resistant against SCA. We firstly provide a construction scheme for obtaining LCD codes from any algebraic curve. Then, some explicit LCD codes from elliptic curves are presented. Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes are of the most importance in coding theory due to their theoretical significance and practical interests. In this paper, all the constructed LCD codes from elliptic curves are MDS or almost MDS. Some infinite classes of LCD codes from elliptic curves are optimal due to the Griesmer bound. Finally, we also derive some explicit LCD codes from hyperelliptic curves and Hermitian curves.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2017.2766075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2766075","startPage":"2390","endPage":"2397","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/8318403/08081790.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complementary Dual Algebraic Geometry Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Complementary Dual Algebraic Geometry Codes","volume":"64","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2018","accessionNumber":"17633620","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8081790/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"SECODE European Project (Paris 8)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11401480, 11531002, 11701129 and 11371138"},{"fundingName":"14E013"},{"fundingName":"CXTD2014-4"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007433","fundingName":"Meritocracy Research Funds of China West Normal University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Zhejiang provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LQ17A010008 and LQ16A010005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complementary Dual Algebraic Geometry Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-tang-2766075-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090471S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8318403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8318403","articleId":"8081790","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8081795,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Mohammadnezhad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Mohammadnezhad","orcid":"0000-0002-3768-9046","id":"37085647032"},{"name":"Huan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0003-3254-7599","id":"37086494227"},{"name":"Payam Heydari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Payam","lastName":"Heydari","orcid":"0000-0002-1008-1559","id":"37274529000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8081795","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1341},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplings","Bandwidth","Resistors","Q-factor","Inductors","Circuits and systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["baluns","CMOS integrated circuits","field effect MIMIC"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-loss structure","full-wave EM-simulations","port-to-port isolation","CMOS process","differential 1-to-4 splitter","lumped double-tuned baluns","differential power splitter","multiple \u03bb/4 transmission-line sections","in-band insertion loss","low-loss balun","frequency 120.0 GHz","loss 8.3 dB","bandwidth 40.0 GHz","size 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mm-wave","high-speed","balun","transformer","differential","power splitter","wideband","compact"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081795","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8513902/08081795.pdf","startPage":"1629","endPage":"1633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2017.2766141","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2017.2766141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8513902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Design of a Wideband, Balun-Based, Differential Power Splitter at mm-Wave","abstract":"A wideband, low-loss balun-based differential power splitter is studied.

Spatial modeling of these nodules is essential to obtain a better scientific understanding about their formation and distribution, and conduct feasibility studies on their exploitation. However, data on the quantitative and qualitative distribution of nodules in CCZ are sparse and often not divulged, and the accuracy of conventional spatial modeling techniques is limited by this scarcity of data. We present an approach based on artificial neural networks for modeling nodule parameters in the CCZ using the limited data available in the open domain. Our model's predictions are comparable to benchmark predictions from the International Seabed Authority which used a more extensive data set. Moreover, our model can predict small as well as large-scale variations of nodules, which are essential in making evaluations for deep-sea harvesting. We discuss the contribution of each factor in the modeling, and show that small-scale nodule parameter variations can be effectively predicted by incorporating the local topography.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2017.2752757","startPage":"997","endPage":"1014","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/48/8490137/08081801.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2017.2752757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8490137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Modeling of Deep-Sea Ferromanganese Nodules With Limited Data Using Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Predictive models","Nickel","Oceans","Manganese","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial economics","manganese","mining industry","neural nets","oceanographic regions","oceanographic techniques","seafloor phenomena"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conventional spatial modeling techniques","qualitative distribution","quantitative distribution","Clarion-Clipperton zone","deep-sea ferromanganese nodules","small-scale nodule parameter variations","deep-sea harvesting","extensive data","modeling nodule parameters","artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clarion\u2013Clipperton zone (CCZ)","deep sea","manganese nodules","neural network","spatial model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081801/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Modeling of Deep-Sea Ferromanganese Nodules With Limited Data Using Neural Networks","volume":"43","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8081801/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18162050","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100011512","fundingName":"National Research Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Keppel Corporation"},{"fundingName":"National University of Singapore"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Modeling of Deep-Sea Ferromanganese Nodules With Limited Data Using Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"joe-hari-2752757-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135657S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"8490137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8490137","articleId":"8081801","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8081807,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxue Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8293879/8081807/jiang-2759767-small.gif","p":["Xiaoxue Jiang (S\u201916) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

Undesired charge transfer, which has a direction opposite to that of the intended current flow, presents a significant source of power loss in charge pumps. The proposed charge pump circuit utilizes charge transfer switches with a complementary branch scheme to significantly reduce undesired charge transfer, thereby improving power efficiency and increasing output voltage effectively. An optimized gate control strategy is applied to further decrease the power loss caused by undesired charge transfer. Simulations of 8-stage charge pumps in a $0.13~\\mu \\text{m}$ standard CMOS technology show that for an input supply voltage of 1.2 V, the proposed charge pump circuit reaches a power efficiency of 58.72% with an output voltage of 7.45 V, when delivering 5-mA load current, and is able to maintain a power efficiency of around 50% and an output voltage of over 5 V as the load current increases to 10 mA.

Taking the requirements of both efficiency and reliability in satellite communications into account, we propose an adaptive transmission scheme for the integrated network in this paper, where the satellite can communicate with the destination user either in direct mode or in cooperative mode. Specifically, we first investigate the symbol error rate (SER) performance of two transmission modes with co-channel interference under composite multipath/shadowing fading. Taking the derived SERs as constraints, we formulate the adaptive transmission scheme as an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing energy efficiency (EE) and discuss the trade-off among EE, spectral efficiency (SE), and SER. Furthermore, economic efficiency is also analyzed as a complementary performance measure to SE and EE. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can increase the attainable EE of satellite communications, which indicates that we should choose the transmission mode adaptively according to different interfering scenarios and shadowing degrees, rather than adopting cooperative transmission aggressively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficient Adaptive Transmissions in Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Networks With SER Constraints","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2764472","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8249510/08081808.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2764472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8249510","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081808/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Adaptive Transmissions in Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Networks With SER Constraints","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8081808/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17535354","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YF-B1200202"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771365"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007128","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2017JZ022"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B08038"},{"fundingName":"EU H2020 RISE TESTBED Project","grantNumber":"734325"},{"fundingName":"EU FP7 QUICK Project","grantNumber":"PIRSES-GA-2013-612652"},{"fundingName":"EPSRC TOUCAN Project","grantNumber":"EP/L020009/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient Adaptive Transmissions in Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Networks With SER Constraints","sourcePdf":"twc-ruan-2764472-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106747S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8249510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8249510","articleId":"8081808","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8081812,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohui Zhou","affiliation":["Research School of Engineering, College of Engineering and Computer Science, The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8291762/8081812/zhou-2766152-small.gif","p":["Xiaohui Zhou (S\u201915) received the B.Eng. degree (Hons.) from The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia, in 2014, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Research School of Engineering.

In this paper, we present a tractable model for PB-assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) wireless ad hoc networks, where each transmitter (TX) harvests energy from all PBs and then uses the harvested energy to transmit information to its desired receiver. Our model accounts for realistic aspects of WPT and mmWave transmissions, such as power circuit activation threshold, allowed maximum harvested power, maximum transmit power, beamforming, and blockage. Using stochastic geometry, we obtain the Laplace transform of the aggregate received power at the TX to calculate the power coverage probability. We approximate and discretize the transmit power of each TX into a finite number of discrete power levels in log scale to compute the channel and total coverage probability. We compare our analytical predictions to simulations and observe good accuracy. The proposed model allows insights into effect of system parameters, such as transmit power of PBs, PB density, main lobe beamwidth, and power circuit activation threshold on the overall coverage probability. The results confirm that it is feasible and safe to power TXs in an mmWave ad hoc network using PBs.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2766152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8291762/08081812.pdf","startPage":"830","endPage":"844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8291762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2766152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Beacon-Assisted Millimeter Wave Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Power Beacon-Assisted Millimeter Wave Ad Hoc Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081812/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17577983","htmlLink":"/document/8081812/","volume":"66","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP170100939 and DP140101133"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Beacon-Assisted Millimeter Wave Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zhou-2766152-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113819S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8291762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8291762","articleId":"8081812","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8081821,"authors":[{"name":"Weile Zhang","affiliation":["MOE Key Lab for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8249510/8081821/zhang-2764894-small.gif","p":["Weile Zhang received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in information and communication engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2006 and 2012, respectively.

Considering that the incident signal at BS from each user can be restricted within a certain angular spread, the proposed scheme could perform carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation for each user individually through a joint spatial-frequency alignment procedure and can be completed efficiently with the aid of fast Fourier transform. A multi-branch receive beamforming is further designed to yield an equivalent single user transmission model for which the conventional single-user channel estimation and data detection can be carried out. To make the study complete, theoretical performance analysis of the CFO estimation is also conducted. We further develop a user grouping scheme to deal with the unexpected scenarios that some users may not be separated well from the spatial domain.

Limits of Machine Learning-Based Neural Networks for Rotor Position Estimation in EV Traction Drives","abstract":"In this paper, a novel rotor position estimator for an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor is presented and evaluated. The proposed estimator lies on one of the most popular methods in the field of artificial intelligence: Machine learning-based neural networks algorithm. The main interest is to introduce a cost-efficient position estimator that is comparable to classic methods in terms of functional performances. The estimator model is built by learning from a dataset that associates phase currents and voltages to the rotor position. Learning signals are generated using a simulation model. This is primarily intended to save the resources invested in testbench trials. In this work, offline training steps and results are described and commented. The efficiency of the proposed position estimator is first verified by functional simulations. Second, real-time experiments are conducted on an actual scale testbench. The NN-based estimator covers a wide speed range and is implemented in the context of IPMSM-based EV traction drives. More broadly, these findings can also be applicable to the ac-based electric drives for the position estimation purpose.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081830/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17736634","volume":"14","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8081830/","publicationDate":"May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"04 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Interests and Limits of Machine Learning-Based Neural Networks for Rotor Position Estimation in EV Traction Drives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interests and Limits of Machine Learning-Based Neural Networks for Rotor Position Estimation in EV Traction Drives","sourcePdf":"tii-zine-2765398-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168554S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8353885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8353885","articleId":"8081830","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8081834,"authors":[{"name":"Evan Levine","affiliation":["Departments of Electrical Engineering and Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Evan","lastName":"Levine","orcid":"0000-0001-7585-2951","id":"38525732300"},{"name":"Brian Hargreaves","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Hargreaves","id":"37424256300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"8081834","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":519},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"abstract":"In high-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging applications, time-consuming, sequential acquisition of data samples in the spatial frequency domain (k-space) can often be accelerated by accounting for dependencies in linear reconstruction, at the cost of noise amplification that depends on the sampling pattern. Common examples are support-constrained, parallel, and dynamic MRI, and k-space sampling strategies are primarily driven by image-domain metrics that are expensive to compute for arbitrary sampling patterns. It remains challenging to provide systematic and computationally efficient automatic designs of arbitrary multidimensional Cartesian sampling patterns that mitigate noise amplification, given the subspace to which the object is confined. To address this problem, this paper introduces a theoretical framework that describes local geometric properties of the sampling pattern and relates them to the spread in the eigenvalues of the information matrix described by its first two spectral moments. This new criterion is then used for very efficient optimization of complex multidimensional sampling patterns that does not require reconstructing images or explicitly mapping noise amplification. Experiments with in vivo data show strong agreement between this criterion and traditional, comprehensive image-domain- and k-space-based metrics, indicating the potential of the approach for computationally efficient (on-the-fly), automatic, and adaptive design of sampling patterns.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Acceleration","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","image denoising","image reconstruction","image sampling","medical image processing","optimisation","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling pattern","dynamic MRI","image-domain metrics","arbitrary multidimensional Cartesian sampling patterns","spectral moments","complex multidimensional sampling patterns","k-space-based metrics","linear MRI reconstruction","high-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging applications","spatial frequency domain","linear reconstruction","comprehensive image-domain-based metrics","optimization","eigenvalues","parallel MRI","support-constrained MRI","moment-based spectral analysis","adaptive k -space sampling","noise amplification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["k-space sampling","image reconstruction","parallel MRI"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Knee","Magnetic Resonance Imaging"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMI.2017.2766131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/8278906/08081834.pdf","startPage":"557","endPage":"567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8278906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2017.2766131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-the-Fly Adaptive ${k}$ -Space Sampling for Linear MRI Reconstruction Using Moment-Based Spectral Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On-the-Fly Adaptive ${k}$ -Space Sampling for Linear MRI Reconstruction Using Moment-Based Spectral Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081834/","volume":"37","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8081834/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17574203","pubMedId":"29408784","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000070","fundingName":"NIH","grantNumber":"P41 EB015891 and R01 EB017739"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-the-Fly Adaptive ${k}$ -Space Sampling for Linear MRI Reconstruction Using Moment-Based Spectral Analysis","sourcePdf":"tmi-levine-2766131-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06343S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"8278906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8278906","articleId":"8081834","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8081837,"authors":[{"name":"Yuzhong Gong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Yuzhong Gong (S'13\u2013M\u201916) received the B.S. and Ph.D.\n degrees in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University of Technology and Zhejiang University in 2010 and 2015,\n respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of\n Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.

A set of wind power ramp limits (WPRLs) is proposed in this paper to evaluate the operational adequacy of power systems with high wind power penetration and to provide operating references to wind farms in the form of a ramp power limit (RPL) and ramp rate limit (RRL). The RPL is used to evaluate the minimum and maximum allowable generation of a wind farm by considering the power reserve capacities of generators and power flow constraints of transmission lines. A robust second-order cone programming RPLs formulation with AC power flow constraints and a column-and-constraint generation based solution method are proposed to maximize the total operating range of all wind farms. Meanwhile, a Pareto optimality based RPLs evaluation approach is proposed to handle the coupled relationship among the operating ranges of the wind farms to achieve a balanced RPLs solution for each wind farm. The RRL is used to evaluate the most rapid wind power ramp behavior that can be handled by system frequency regulation without exceeding the designated frequency range. A comprehensive criterion is proposed to evaluate the RRLs by considering primary and secondary frequency regulation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation approach is verified through case studies.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2764420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2764420","startPage":"2706","endPage":"2716","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/8340241/08081837.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8340241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power System Operational Adequacy Evaluation With Wind Power Ramp Limits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","displayDocTitle":"Power System Operational Adequacy Evaluation With Wind Power Ramp Limits","publicationDate":"May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2018","volume":"33","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081837/","accessionNumber":"17731284","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081837/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"},{"fundingName":"Saskatchewan Power Corporation (SaskPower)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power System Operational Adequacy Evaluation With Wind Power Ramp Limits","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-gong-2764420-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097817S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8340241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8340241","articleId":"8081837","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8081839,"authors":[{"name":"Peter H.

Despite its diagnostic and prognostic value, it is still widely measured by counting breaths manually. A plethora of algorithms have been proposed to estimate BR from the electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse oximetry (photoplethysmogram, PPG) signals. These BR algorithms provide opportunity for automated, electronic, and unobtrusive measurement of BR in both healthcare and fitness monitoring. This paper presents a review of the literature on BR estimation from the ECG and PPG. First, the structure of BR algorithms and the mathematical techniques used at each stage are described. Second, the experimental methodologies that have been used to assess the performance of BR algorithms are reviewed, and a methodological framework for the assessment of BR algorithms is presented. Third, we outline the most pressing directions for future research, including the steps required to use BR algorithms in wearable sensors, remote video monitoring, and clinical practice.","doi":"10.1109/RBME.2017.2763681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RBME.2017.2763681","startPage":"2","endPage":"20","publicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/4664312/8421106/08081839.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8421106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Breathing Rate Estimation From the Electrocardiogram and Photoplethysmogram: A Review","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Breathing Rate Estimation From the Electrocardiogram and Photoplethysmogram: A Review","volume":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","accessionNumber":"17955096","pubMedId":"29990026","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8081839/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)","grantNumber":"EP/H019944/1"},{"fundingName":"Oxford and King's College London Centres of Excellence in Medical Engineering"},{"fundingName":"Wellcome Trust and EPSRC","grantNumber":"WT88877/Z/09/Z and WT088641/Z/09/Z"},{"fundingName":"Wellcome EPSRC Centre for Medical Engineering at Kings College London","grantNumber":"WT 203148/Z/16/Z"},{"fundingName":"National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre"},{"fundingName":"NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London"},{"fundingName":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre Programme"},{"fundingName":"Royal Academy of Engineering Research"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Breathing Rate Estimation From the Electrocardiogram and Photoplethysmogram: A Review","sourcePdf":"rbme-charlton-2763681-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.348133S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"4664312","isNumber":"8421106","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4664312","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"8421106","articleId":"8081839","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8081849,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Leitner","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/8233344/8081849/leitn-2766040-small.gif","p":["Stefan Leitner received the B.S. degree in mechatronics and machinery construction from Management Center Innsbruck, Austria, in 2013, and the master\u2019s degrees in electrical and computer engineering and mathematics from Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

The existing research has employed reconfigurable computing to provide faster solutions compared with general-purpose processors, but they require low-level manual design by a hardware engineer, and can only solve American options. This paper presents a formal mathematical framework that captures a large class of binomial-tree problems, and provides a systolic data-movement template that maps the framework into digital hardware. This paper also presents a fully automated design flow, which takes C-level user descriptions of binomial trees, with custom data types and tree operations, and automatically generates fully pipelined reconfigurable hardware solutions in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) bit-stream files. On a Xilinx Virtex-7 xc7vx980t FPGA at a 100-MHz clock frequency, we require 54-\u03bcs latency to solve three 876-step 32-bit fixed-point American option binomial trees, with a pricing rate of 114k trees/s. From the same device and in comparison to the existing solutions with equivalent FPGA technology, we always achieve better throughput.

Transcoding is a computationally expensive and time-consuming operation. Therefore, streaming service providers have to store numerous transcoded versions of a given video to serve various display devices. With the sharp increase in video streaming, however, this approach is becoming cost-prohibitive. Given the fact that viewers' access pattern to video streams follows a long tail distribution, for the video streams with low access rate, we propose to transcode them in an on-demand (i.e., lazy) manner using cloud computing services. The challenge in utilizing cloud services for on-demand video transcoding, however, is to maintain a robust QoS for viewers and cost-efficiency for streaming service providers. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present the Cloud-based Video Streaming Services (CVS2) architecture. It includes a QoS-aware scheduling component that maps transcoding tasks to the Virtual Machines (VMs) by considering the affinity of the transcoding tasks with the allocated heterogeneous VMs. To maintain robustness in the presence of varying streaming requests, the architecture includes a cost-efficient VM Provisioner component. The component provides a self-configurable cluster of heterogeneous VMs. The cluster is reconfigured dynamically to maintain the maximum affinity with the arriving workload. Simulation results obtained under diverse workload conditions demonstrate that CVS2 architecture can maintain a robust QoS for viewers while reducing the incurred cost of the streaming service provider by up to 85 percent.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081853/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1 2018","publicationDate":"1 March 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081853/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2018","accessionNumber":"17580168","volume":"29","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cost-Efficient and Robust On-Demand Video Transcoding Using Heterogeneous Cloud Services","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006952","fundingName":"Louisiana Board of Regents","grantNumber":"LEQSF(2016-19)-RD-A-25"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-Efficient and Robust On-Demand Video Transcoding Using Heterogeneous Cloud Services","sourcePdf":"tpds-li-2766069-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116919S","chronDate":"March 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"8289387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8289387","articleId":"8081853","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8081895,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Lot of research work is being done in the field of image processing and video processing on FPGA. In this paper we specifically concentrate on working Background identification, moving object detection and tracking. Keeping in mind the previous work dons in this area we have selected Gaussian mixture model for the implementation. The main work carried out by Gaussian mixture model is to is a common feature in many video processing systems. The paper speaks about two block of implementation mainly the image block generation and the RGB to YCbCr conversion. It has been proved from the design that it is efficient for high definition (HD) video sequences with frame size 1920 \u00d7 1080.

SRAM cell is an important candidate in the design of memories and a significant amount of attention is being paid to its design due to the ever increasing demand in data handling. The submicron scaling of conventional CMOS devices affect their performance due to short channel effects and circuits become unreliable. Further below the sub-32nm regime, FinFETs are proposed to be the best possible substitutes for CMOS technology. In this paper, we have designed and analyzed the performance of CMOS and FinFET based 6T SRAM cells at 22nm technology and compared the performance metrics of SRAM cell. The design infers that while both the circuits offer stable SNM at a power supply of 1 V, the FinFET based SRAM cell yields superior read and write performances due to its high process variation tolerance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SRAM cells","FinFETs","CMOS technology","Logic gates","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","MOSFET","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short channel effects","CMOS technology","6T SRAM cells","FINFET technology nodes","CMOS devices","size 22.0 nm","voltage 1.0 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","6T SRAM CELL","FINFET","SNM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081898","doi":"10.1109/ICRAECT.2017.65","startPage":"38","endPage":"42","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Recent Advances in Electronics and Communication Technology (ICRAECT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Recent Advances in Electronics and Communication Technology (ICRAECT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8062974/8081873/08081898.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRAECT.2017.65","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081898/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Performance Analysis of 6T SRAM Cell in 22nm CMOS and FINFET Technology Nodes","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 March 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17289566","htmlLink":"/document/8081898/","conferenceDate":"16-17 March 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Performance Analysis of 6T SRAM Cell in 22nm CMOS and FINFET Technology Nodes","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"6701a038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066502S","chronDate":"16-17 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8062974","isNumber":"8081873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8062974","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8081873","articleId":"8081898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8081916,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The proposed architecture includes Line Buffers, PIPO and Lifting Block. This architecture works in non separable fashion using a lifting scheme and computes 2D-DWT at different resolution levels. The lifting scheme offers the fastest possible implementation of the DWT. The architecture has been coded using RTL Verilog and synthesized using Xilinx 14.4, targeted on Spartan 6- XC6SLX4L FPGA. A regular systolic structure has been proposed in this architecture with simple control flow for data extraction and small embedded buffers. The maximum frequency of operation reported by Place & Route tool is 254 MHz for 3-Level 2D-DWT.

In this paper, we introduce a modified scheme for face recognition based on the hybrid color model along with the Gabor Feature Extraction and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our algorithm is tested on two face databases namely, 'The MUCT Database' and 'The FEI Database' for recognition accuracy. In addition to the various issues posed by the database such as variations in expression, illumination, ethnicity etc. we have also considered tackling and alleviating the problem of small sample size by taking only one image per person for the training set. Recognition accuracies up to 100% are obtained for MUCT database and a maximum accuracy of 87.43% is obtained for FEI database. Through these results, it is justifiable that our methodology has performed better than many of the existing algorithms specific to the databases that are considered in our experiment.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Feature extraction","Face recognition","Image color analysis","Gabor filters","Principal component analysis","Face"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image colour analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gabor features","single sample face recognition","multicolor space domain","remarkable field","machine learning","artificial intelligence","modified scheme","hybrid color model","Gabor Feature Extraction","Principal Component Analysis","face databases","recognition accuracy","sample size","MUCT database","FEI database","PCA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","Hybrid Color Model","Gabor Feature Extraction","PCA","Small Sample Size"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICRAECT.2017.23","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Recent Advances in Electronics and Communication Technology (ICRAECT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Recent Advances in Electronics and Communication Technology (ICRAECT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8062974/8081873/08081930.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRAECT.2017.23","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gabor Features for Single Sample Face Recognition on Multicolor Space Domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Gabor Features for Single Sample Face Recognition on Multicolor Space Domain","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081930/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8081930/","accessionNumber":"17289573","conferenceDate":"16-17 March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 March 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gabor Features for Single Sample Face Recognition on Multicolor Space Domain","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"6701a211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046896S","chronDate":"16-17 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8062974","isNumber":"8081873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8062974","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8081873","articleId":"8081930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8081932,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This concept presents a wavelet transform based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (WTOFDM) approach that eliminates the need for these cyclic prefix and enhance the efficiency of the PLC transmission. The presented PLC model is designed for faster and efficient transmission over the power line. The obtained results indicate that the proposed approach improves the transmission throughput; provides better performance for impulsive noise, and increases the efficiency of the PLC system as a whole.

However, due to resource constraints, these tasks are facing challenges to execute on mobile devices. As a solution to this problem, cloud migration has been introduced to execute a task on the cloud and then to return the results to the user mobile device. In this paper, a cloud migration decision-making algorithm for compute-intensive tasks has been proposed to determine the feasibility of execution on a cloud server instead of a mobile device. Furthermore, the performances between mobile and cloud executions have been investigated which show that the task completion time can be reduced by a factor of 6 to 8 of mobile service when a cloud server is utilised.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective task migration to reduce execution time in mobile cloud computing","publicationTitle":"2017 23rd International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)","doi":"10.23919/IConAC.2017.8081998","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 23rd International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067274/8081956/08081998.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/IConAC.2017.8081998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8081998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8081998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Effective task migration to reduce execution time in mobile cloud computing","conferenceDate":"7-8 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8081998/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17289729","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective task migration to reduce execution time in mobile cloud computing","confLoc":"Huddersfield, UK","sourcePdf":"p131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063991S","chronDate":"7-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067274","isNumber":"8081956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067274","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8081956","articleId":"8081998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chinese Automation and Computing Society in the UK -

This work develops an adaptive model-based optimal control algorithm based on Sub-Structured Neural Network (SSANN), Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms (GA), Multi-Objective Dragonfly Algorithm (MODA) and a fuzzy based inference system. The SSANN based on an individual engine speed are combined into a SSANN, whose output is connected to a fuzzy based inference system which extrapolates between trained engine speeds. The SSANN outputs are then used to evaluate the objective function of the optimisation process, which is performed using GA and MODA. The SSANN is retrained if the error is out of defined limit, which allows the system to adapt with engine ageing. The purpose of this work is to contribute to online engine calibration and control to improve engine performance and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082008/","accessionNumber":"17289701","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8082008/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"7-8 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive engine optimisation using NSGA-II and MODA based on a sub-structured artificial neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive engine optimisation using NSGA-II and MODA based on a sub-structured artificial neural network","confLoc":"Huddersfield, UK","sourcePdf":"p85.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095157S","chronDate":"7-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067274","isNumber":"8081956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067274","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8081956","articleId":"8082008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chinese Automation and Computing Society in the UK - CACSUK","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8082035,"authors":[{"name":"Joy Eze","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Research, University of Bedfordshire UK, Luton, England"],"firstName":"Joy","lastName":"Eze","id":"37085746681"},{"name":"Sijing Zhang","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Research, University of Bedfordshire UK, Luton, England"],"firstName":"Sijing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38238864500"},{"name":"Enjie Liu","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Research, University of Bedfordshire UK, Luton, England"],"firstName":"Enjie","lastName":"Liu","id":"37528490100"},{"name":"Elias Eze","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Research, University of Bedfordshire UK, Luton, England"],"firstName":"Elias","lastName":"Eze","id":"37085565020"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7017-0260-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-7017-0261-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5040-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8082035","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":969},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Bandwidth","Wireless communication","Roads","Safety","Wireless sensor networks","Vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","telecommunication network management","telecommunication security","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicular communication efficiency","privacy","security","message routing","CR-VANTs","vehicular networks test-beds","spectrum management","spectrum sensing","CR-VANETs","CR technologies","opportunistic spectrum access","scarce spectrum","intelligent vehicles","wireless communication systems","CR concept","wireless networking","emerging technologies","cognitive radio network","VANET","cognitive radio technology assisted vehicular ad-hoc networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CR-VANETs","WAVE","Cognitive Radio","Spectrum Sensing","Control Channel","V2I","V2V","service channel"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive radio technology assisted vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs): Current status, challenges, and research trends","doi":"10.23919/IConAC.2017.8082035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081956","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 23rd International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 23rd International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067274/8081956/08082035.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/IConAC.2017.8082035","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082035","abstract":"VANET and cognitive radio network (CRN) are both new emerging technologies in wireless networking.

Fault diagnosis deliveries significant benefits to machines with rolling element bearings by finding the faults at early period and taking corrective actions to enhance safe and high performance operations. However, multiple sensor usages and high rate data acquisition involved in a monitoring system have considerable drawbacks of high system cost involved in purchasing hardware for data transfer, storage and processing. To reduce these shortages, this paper investigates compressive sensing (CS) techniques for the fault detection of rolling element bearings. Based on the frequency shift and envelope analysis, a CS scheme is developed for monitoring the bearing. The number of data transmitted and stored can be reduced by several thousands of times. The simulation and the experimental results demonstrate that the compressed vibration signals of rolling element bearings are effective to detect bearing faults at the total compressing ratio up to several thousand with the corresponding maximum compression ratio (CR) of CS process at nearly 100. In addition, several performance measures are applied to evaluate the reconstructed signals and show approximately the information about the noise level of the system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 23rd International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067274/8081956/08082063.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 23rd International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)","doi":"10.23919/IConAC.2017.8082063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/IConAC.2017.8082063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault detection of rolling element bearings using the frequency shift and envelope based compressive sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Vibrations","Rolling bearings","Fault detection","Compressed sensing","Noise measurement","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","fault diagnosis","machine bearings","mechanical engineering computing","rolling bearings","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault detection","rolling element bearings","bearing faults","fault diagnosis","compressive sensing","frequency shift","rotating machines","data acquisition","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rolling element bearings","compressive sensing","frequency shift","reconstruction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Fault detection of rolling element bearings using the frequency shift and envelope based compressive sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8082063/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17289779","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"7-8 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault detection of rolling element bearings using the frequency shift and envelope based compressive sensing","confLoc":"Huddersfield, UK","sourcePdf":"p94.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053199S","chronDate":"7-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067274","isNumber":"8081956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067274","xplore-issue":"8081956","articleId":"8082063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chinese Automation and Computing Society in the UK -

Most of state-of-the-art methods use hand-crafted features and bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) to tackle this problem. Recent development in deep learning indicates that CNN features significantly outperform hand-crafted features for image representation. This advanced technology has not been fully exploited in robotics, especially in visual SLAM systems. We propose a loop closure detection method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Images are fed into a pre-trained CNN model to extract features. We pre-process CNN features instead of using them directly as most of the presented approaches did before they are used to detect loops. The workflow of extracting CNN features, processing data, computing similarity score and detecting loops is presented. Finally the performance of proposed method is evaluated on several open datasets by comparing it with Fab-Map using precision-recall metric.","publicationTitle":"2017 23rd International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 23rd International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067274/8081956/08082072.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Loop closure detection for visual SLAM systems using convolutional neural network","doi":"10.23919/IConAC.2017.8082072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/IConAC.2017.8082072","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082072/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Loop closure detection for visual SLAM systems using convolutional neural network","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17289782","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-8 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8082072/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Loop closure detection for visual SLAM systems using convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Huddersfield, UK","sourcePdf":"p48.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105037S","chronDate":"7-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067274","isNumber":"8081956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067274","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8081956","articleId":"8082072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chinese Automation and Computing Society in the UK - CACSUK","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8082075,"authors":[{"name":"Lu-jun Cui","affiliation":["Zhongyuan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lu-jun","lastName":"Cui","id":"37086220813"},{"name":"Yan-long Cao","affiliation":["Zhongyuan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yan-long","lastName":"Cao","id":"37086098192"},{"name":"Hui-chao Shang","affiliation":["Zhongyuan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hui-chao","lastName":"Shang","id":"37086227398"},{"name":"Hong-hong Guo","affiliation":["Zhongyuan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hong-hong","lastName":"Guo","id":"37086221757"},{"name":"Cheng-yin Wang","affiliation":["Zhongyuan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Cheng-yin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086222320"},{"name":"Qiang Guo","affiliation":["Zhongyuan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37086212748"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7017-0260-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-7017-0261-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5040-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8082075","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082075","abstract":"Through analyzing the optical time offset in optical fiber, the paper presented a new method that using optical fiber sensing technology for monitoring the temperature.

This problem arises significantly in the next-generation system, as the trend of deployment is with high densification, which yields an ultra-dense network (UDN). One of the challenges in UDN is the dramatic increase of ICI from surrounding cells. A common technique to minimize ICI is interference coordination techniques. In this context, the most efficient ICI coordination is fractional frequency reuse (FFR). This paper investigates the FFR in UDN millimeter wave network at 26-GHz band. The focus is on dense network with short inter site distance, and higher order sectorisation (HOS). The metrics used in frequency reuse is the signal to interference plus noise ratio rather than the distance, as the line of sight in millimeter wave can be easily blocked by obstacles even if they are in close proximity to the serving base station. This paper shows that FFR can improve the network performance in terms of per user cell-edge data throughput and average cell throughput, and maintain the peak data throughput at a certain threshold. Furthermore, HOS has a potential gain over default sectored cells when the interference is carefully coordinated. The results show optimal values for bandwidth split per each scenario in FFR scheme to give the best tradeoff between inner and outer zone users performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2762338","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08082102.pdf","startPage":"10924","endPage":"10932","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2762338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Capacity Optimisation in Millimetre Wave Band Using Fractional Frequency Reuse","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Network Capacity Optimisation in Millimetre Wave Band Using Fractional Frequency Reuse","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8082102/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17627842","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082102/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, University of Anbar, Iraq"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Network Capacity Optimisation in Millimetre Wave Band Using Fractional Frequency Reuse","sourcePdf":"access-alfalahy-2762338-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074468S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8082102","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8082108,"authors":[{"name":"Lichao Mou","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center, Remote Sensing Technology Institute, Wessling, Germany","Signal Processing in Earth Observation, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8240806/8082108/mou-2748160-small.gif","p":["Lichao Mou (S\u201916) received the bachelor\u2019s degree in automation from the Xi\u2019an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2012, and the master\u2019s degree in signal and information processing from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2015.

The collection of such samples is expensive and time demanding. Hence, unsupervised feature learning, which has a quick access to arbitrary amounts of unlabeled data, is conceptually of high interest. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture, fully Conv-Deconv network, for unsupervised spectral-spatial feature learning of hyperspectral images, which is able to be trained in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, our network is based on the so-called encoder-decoder paradigm, i.e., the input 3-D hyperspectral patch is first transformed into a typically lower dimensional space via a convolutional subnetwork (encoder), and then expanded to reproduce the initial data by a deconvolutional subnetwork (decoder). However, during the experiment, we found that such a network is not easy to be optimized. To address this problem, we refine the proposed network architecture by incorporating: 1) residual learning and 2) a new unpooling operation that can use memorized max-pooling indexes. Moreover, to understand the \u201cblack box,\u201d we make an in-depth study of the learned feature maps in the experimental analysis. A very interesting discovery is that some specific \u201cneurons\u201d in the first residual block of the proposed network own good description power for semantic visual patterns in the object level, which provide an opportunity to achieve \u201cfree\u201d object detection. This paper, for the first time in the remote sensing community, proposes an end-to-end fully Conv-Deconv network for unsupervised spectral-spatial feature learning. Moreover, this paper also introduces an in-depth investigation of learned features. Experimental results on two widely used hyperspectral data, Indian Pines and Pavia University, demonstrate competitive performance obtained by the proposed methodology compared with other studied approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2017.2748160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2748160","startPage":"391","endPage":"406","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8240806/08082108.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8240806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised Spectral\u2013Spatial Feature Learning via Deep Residual Conv\u2013Deconv Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Spectral\u2013Spatial Feature Learning via Deep Residual Conv\u2013Deconv Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification","volume":"56","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17468508","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8082108/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005156","fundingName":"Alexander von Humboldt Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council (ERC)"},{"fundingName":"European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No, Acronym: So2Sat)","grantNumber":"ERC-2016-StG-714087"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001656","fundingName":"Helmholtz Association under the framework of the Young Investigators Group \u201cSiPEO\u201d (VH-NG-1018, www.sipeo.bgu.tum.de)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Unsupervised Spectral\u2013Spatial Feature Learning via Deep Residual Conv\u2013Deconv Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhu-2748160-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142006S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8240806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"8240806","articleId":"8082108","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8082110,"authors":[{"name":"Mar\u00eda D\u00edaz","affiliation":["Institute for Applied Microelectronics, University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8271875/8082110/diaz-2761019-small.gif","p":["Mar\u00eda D\u00edaz was born in Lanzarote, Spain in 1990.

In this paper, a novel algorithm for an accurate detection of anomalies in hyperspectral images with a low computational complexity, named ADALOC\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, is proposed. It is based on two main processing stages. First, a set of characteristic pixels that best represent both anomaly and background classes are extracted applying orthogonal projection techniques. Second, the abundance maps associated to these pixels are estimated. Under the assumption that the anomaly class is composed of a scarce group of image pixels, rare targets can be identified from abundance maps characterized by a representation coefficient matrix with a large amount of almost zero elements. Unlike the other algorithms of the state of the art, the ADALOC\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n algorithm has been specially designed for being efficiently implemented into parallel hardware devices for applications under real-time constraints. To achieve this, the ADALOC\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n algorithm uses simple and highly parallelized operations, avoiding to perform complex matrix operations such as the computation of an inverse matrix or the extraction of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. An extensive set of simulations using the most representative state-of-the-art AD algorithms and both real and synthetic hyperspectral data sets have been conducted. Moreover, extra assessment metrics apart from classical receiver operating characteristic curves have been defined in order to make deeper comparisons. The obtained results clearly support the benefits of our proposal, both in terms of the accuracy of the detection results and the processing power demanded.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2017.2761019","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8271875/08082110.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2761019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8271875","startPage":"1159","endPage":"1176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Algorithm for an Accurate Detection of Anomalies in Hyperspectral Images With a Low Computational Complexity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Algorithm for an Accurate Detection of Anomalies in Hyperspectral Images With a Low Computational Complexity","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082110/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17535500","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8082110/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010661","fundingName":"European Commission through the ECSEL Joint Undertaking under ENABLE-S3","grantNumber":"692455"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007136","fundingName":"Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of the Spanish Government under ENABLE-S3","grantNumber":"PCIN-2015-225"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007136","fundingName":"Resilient Embedded Electronic systems for Controlling Cities under Atypical situations","grantNumber":"TEC2014-58036-C4-4-R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Algorithm for an Accurate Detection of Anomalies in Hyperspectral Images With a Low Computational Complexity","sourcePdf":"tgrs-lopez-2761019-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074364S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8271875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8271875","articleId":"8082110","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8082112,"authors":[{"name":"Deqiang Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8082112/yang-2766184-small.gif","p":["Deqiang Yang received the B.E., M.E., and D.E. degrees from the School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), in 1992, 2006, and 2012, respectively.

Existing approaches, however, are limited in adequately exploiting latent relationships between scene images. Aiming to decrease the distances between intraclass images and increase the distances between interclass images, we propose a latent relationship learning framework that integrates an adaptive graph with the constraints of the feature space and label propagation for high-resolution aerial image classification. To describe the latent relationships among scene images in the framework, we construct an adaptive graph that is embedded into the constrained joint space for features and labels. To remove redundant information and improve the computational efficiency, subspace learning is introduced to assist in the latent relationship learning. To address out-of-sample data, linear regression is adopted to project the semisupervised classification results onto a linear classifier. Learning efficiency is improved by minimizing the objective function via the linearized alternating direction method with an adaptive penalty. We test our method on three widely used aerial scene image data sets. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method over the state-of-the-art algorithms in aerial scene image classification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082116/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17535490","htmlLink":"/document/8082116/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2018","volume":"56","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"LRAGE: Learning Latent Relationships With Adaptive Graph Embedding for Aerial Scene Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41371324 and 41401532"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016M600953"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LRAGE: Learning Latent Relationships With Adaptive Graph Embedding for Aerial Scene Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhang-2752217-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109148S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8271875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8271875","articleId":"8082116","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8082123,"authors":[{"name":"Honggui Han","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology and the Beijing Key Laboratory of Computational Intelligence and Intelligent System, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8576800/8082123/han-2762521-small.gif","p":["Honggui Han (M\u201910\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.S. degree in automatic from the Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China, in 2005, the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees from the Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2007 and 2011, respectively.","He has been with the Beijing University of Technology, since 2011, where he is currently a Professor.

In this paper, an efficient learning mechanism is developed for building self-organizing fuzzy neural networks (SOFNNs), where a second-order algorithm (SOA) with adaptive learning rate is employed, the network size and the parameters can be determined simultaneously in the learning process. First, all parameters of SOFNN are adjusted by using the SOA strategy to achieve fast convergence through a powerful search scheme. Second, the structure of SOFNN can be self-organized using the relative importance index of each rule. The fuzzy rules used in SOFNN with SOA (SOA-SOFNN) are generated or pruned automatically to reduce the computational complexity and potentially improve the generalization power. Finally, a theoretical analysis on the learning convergence of the proposed SOA-SOFNN is given to show the computational efficiency. To demonstrate the merits of our proposed approach for data modeling, several benchmark datasets, and a real world application associated with nonlinear systems modeling problems are examined with comparisons against other existing methods. The results indicate that our proposed SOA-SOFNN performs favorably in terms of both learning speed and prediction accuracy for online data modeling.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2017.2762521","startPage":"14","endPage":"26","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8576800/08082123.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2017.2762521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8576800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Second-Order Algorithm for Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Algorithm design and analysis","Convergence","Neurons","Approximation algorithms","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","data analysis","fuzzy neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","nonlinear systems","self-adjusting systems","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient second-order algorithm","intelligent computing technologies","online data modeling","system dynamics","efficient learning mechanism","building self-organizing fuzzy neural networks","adaptive learning rate","network size","learning process","SOA strategy","fast convergence","powerful search scheme","relative importance index","fuzzy rules","computational complexity","generalization power","learning convergence","computational efficiency","SOA-SOFNN performs","nonlinear system modeling problems","prediction accuracy","learning speed"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive learning rate strategy","nonlinear systems modeling","second-order algorithm","self-organizing fuzzy neural networks (SOFNNs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082123/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Second-Order Algorithm for Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Networks","volume":"49","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8082123/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18325559","pubMedId":"29990034","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61622301, 51609258 and 61533002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"4172005"},{"fundingName":"Major National Science and Technology Project","grantNumber":"2017ZX07104"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Second-Order Algorithm for Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tcyb-han-2762521-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129811S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8576800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8576800","articleId":"8082123","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8082130,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Zhou","affiliation":["School of Computing Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/8368205/8082130/zhou-2740303-small.gif","p":["Yi Zhou received the B.Eng. degree in electronic information engineering from Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, China, in 2012, and the M.Sc. degree in electronic and electrical engineering from University of Sheffield, U.K., in 2014.

In this paper, we present a fast algorithm: detection and annotation for vehicles (DAVE), which effectively combines vehicle detection and attributes annotation into a unified framework. DAVE consists of two convolutional neural networks: a shallow fully convolutional fast vehicle proposal network (FVPN) for extracting all vehicles' positions, and a deep attributes learning network (ALN), which aims to verify each detection candidate and infer each vehicle's pose, color, and type information simultaneously. These two nets are jointly optimized so that abundant latent knowledge learned from the deep empirical ALN can be exploited to guide training the much simpler FVPN. Once the system is trained, DAVE can achieve efficient vehicle detection and attributes annotation for real-world traffic surveillance data, while the FVPN can be independently adopted as a real-time high-performance vehicle detector as well. We evaluate the DAVE on a new self-collected urban traffic surveillance data set and the public PASCAL VOC2007 car and LISA 2010 data sets, with consistent improvements over existing algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082130/","volume":"19","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8082130/","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17801562","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Fast Automatic Vehicle Annotation for Urban Traffic Surveillance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Automatic Vehicle Annotation for Urban Traffic Surveillance","sourcePdf":"tits-shao-2740303-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088878S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"8368205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8368205","articleId":"8082130","onlineDate":"24 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8082158,"authors":[{"name":"Arun Manickam","affiliation":["InSilixa, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8081776/8082158/manic-2754363-small.gif","p":["Arun Manickam received the B.E. degree in electronics and computer engineering from the College of Engineering, Guindy, Anna University, Chennai, India, in 2002, and the M.S.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA, in 2008 and 2012, respectively.","He has held engineering positions at Qualcomm, San Diego, CA, USA, Silicon Laboratories, Austin, and the Bosch Research and Technology Center, Palo Alto, CA, USA, in 2007, 2008, and 2010, respectively.

Each biosensing element is capable of having unique DNA probe sequences, wavelength-selective multi-dielectric emission filter (OD of 3.6), resistive heater for thermal cycling, and a high performance and programmable photodetector.

Identification of plane of symmetry is a critical step in brain image analysis. Brain symmetry gives two hemispheres. This paper proposes a new method for evaluating best symmetry plane of brain images using Genetic Algorithm (GA) from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). MRI scan is the best modality for brain images, which helps to look for tumors and other diseases in the brain. Symmetry can be reflected in MR image representing axial/horizontal and coronal slices of the brain. Genetic algorithm is an optimization technique which helps to find the optimized solutions/feasible solutions. GA adopted to achieve better results, faster processing times and it is used in more applications. The GA optimization is performed using the selection, mutation and crossover. Major operations are preprocessing, random selection of coordinates and genetic algorithm. Morphological operators help to extract the region of interest from brain image and unwanted portions of MRI images are removed. This proposed method provides better symmetry value with an accuracy of 90%. This performance leads to good approximation of brain tumor segmentation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082280/","accessionNumber":"17291133","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8082280/","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of symmetry plane using genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of symmetry plane using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"ICBSII2017IM21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035902S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067743","isNumber":"8082258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067743","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8082258","articleId":"8082280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8082290,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Particularly in speech-based human machine interaction it is used for improving the naturalness. Speech based emotion recognition is done in two steps namely Gender Recognition and Emotion Recognition. Gender Recognition will give the information about the gender (Male or Female) of the speaker and Emotion Recognition extracts the emotion (happy, sad, angry, and lazy etc.) of the speaker. In emotion recognition step back propagation algorithm under ANN is used as a classifier for classifying the emotions. In this paper, proposes emotion recognition from speech signal using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and implemented on FPGA device. The results using ANN are compared with the existing method and observed that ANN has lesser space utilization and improved speed than LDA.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Third International Conference on Biosignals, Images and Instrumentation (ICBSII)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067743/8082258/08082290.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 Third International Conference on Biosignals, Images and Instrumentation (ICBSII)","doi":"10.1109/ICBSII.2017.8082290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBSII.2017.8082290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8082258","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA based emotions recognition from speech signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Emotion recognition","Speech recognition","Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Conferences","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emotion recognition","field programmable gate arrays","gender issues","human computer interaction","neural nets","pattern classification","speaker recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based emotion recognition","human machine interaction","speaker gender recognition","emotion extraction","back propagation algorithm","artificial neural networks","classifier","emotion classification","speech based emotion recognition","speech signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)","Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2017","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based emotions recognition from speech signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8082290/","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"17291124","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based emotions recognition from speech signals","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"ICBSII2017OT06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063789S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067743","isNumber":"8082258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067743","xplore-issue":"8082258","articleId":"8082290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8082394,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-8328"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0806"}],"articleNumber":"8082394","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082394","abstract":"These instructions give guidelines for preparing papers for this publication.

Under the individualized designing demands, more realistic virtual models mirroring the real worlds of production lines are essential to bridge the gap between design and operation. This paper presents a digital twin-based approach for rapid individualized designing of the hollow glass production line. The digital twin merges physics-based system modeling and distributed real-time process data to generate an authoritative digital design of the system at pre-production phase. A digital twin-based analytical decoupling framework is also developed to provide engineering analysis capabilities and support the decision-making over the system designing and solution evaluation. Three key enabling techniques as well as a case study in hollow glass production line are addressed to validate the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08082476.pdf","startPage":"26901","endPage":"26911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Digital Twin-Based Approach for Designing and Multi-Objective Optimization of Hollow Glass Production Line","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082476","topic":"Key Technologies for Smart Factory of Industry 4.0","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"A Digital Twin-Based Approach for Designing and Multi-Objective Optimization of Hollow Glass Production Line","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082476/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17496792","htmlLink":"/document/8082476/","volume":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51675108 and 51705091"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007162","fundingName":"Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province of China","grantNumber":"2015B010128007 and 2016A010106006"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2015ZZ079"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Digital Twin-Based Approach for Designing and Multi-Objective Optimization of Hollow Glass Production Line","sourcePdf":"access-leng-2766453-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094105S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Key Technologies for Smart Factory of Industry 4.0"],"articleId":"8082476","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8082479,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8124123/8082479/wu-2766456-small.gif","p":["Qi Wu (S\u201915) was born in 1993.

First, the stacked curl element is aperture-fed, using the substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) feeding network. This element is designed under a specific boundary condition, which leads to an excellent agreement of impedance bandwidth and axial ratio (AR) bandwidth between the designed element and the corresponding antenna array. Simulation results show that the antenna element achieves 35.8% impedance bandwidth and 37.8% 3 dB AR bandwidth with a maximum gain of 8.2 dBic. Then, a 2 \u00d7 2 subarray is designed to achieve 33.1% impedance bandwidth. Next, the full-corporate SIW feeding scheme is utilized to construct the 8\u00d78 broadband antenna array. Finally, the 8\u00d78 antenna array is fabricated and its performance is evaluated. Measurement results show that its impedance bandwidth is 35.4%, 3 dB AR bandwidth is 33.8%, and 3 dB gain bandwidth is 32.2% with a peak gain of 23.5 dBic. Considering these three types of bandwidth together, its overall bandwidth is 30.6%. Good efficiency of about 70% is obtained because of the low-loss full-corporate SIW feeding scheme. A 4 \u00d7 4 multibeam array is also simulated to verify the multibeam potential of the proposed antenna array.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and

It is well acknowledged that the estimation of the noise-clutter covariance matrix is a fundamental step in adaptive radar detection. In this paper, we consider regularized estimation methods that force by construction the eigenvalues of the covariance estimates to be greater than a positive regularization parameter \u03c1. This makes them more suitable for high-dimensional problems with a limited number of secondary data samples than traditional sample covariance estimates. The motivation behind this paper is to understand the effect and properly set the value of \u03c1 that improves estimate conditioning while maintaining a low-estimation bias. More specifically, we consider the design of the ANMF detector for two kinds of regularized estimators, namely the regularized sample covariance matrix, the regularized Tyler estimator (RTE). The rationale behind this choice is that the RTE is efficient in mitigating the degradation caused by the presence of impulsive noises while inducing little loss when the noise is Gaussian. Based on asymptotic results brought by recent tools from random matrix theory, we propose a design for the regularization parameter that maximizes the asymptotic detection probability under constant asymptotic false alarm rates. Provided simulations support the efficiency of the proposed method, illustrating its gain over conventional settings of the regularization parameter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082486/","volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8082486/","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17684597","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Design of the Adaptive Normalized Matched Filter Detector Using Regularized Tyler Estimators","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ANR Project RMT4GRAPH","grantNumber":"ANR-14-CE28-0006"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Design of the Adaptive Normalized Matched Filter Detector Using Regularized Tyler Estimators","sourcePdf":"taes-kammoun-2766538-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149957S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"8336511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8336511","articleId":"8082486","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8082496,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Antonelli","affiliation":["Department of Physical and Chemical Sciences, University of L\u2019Aquila, L\u2019Aquila, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Antonelli","id":"37278163200"},{"name":"Antonio Mecozzi","affiliation":["Department of Physical and Chemical Sciences, University of L\u2019Aquila, L\u2019Aquila, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Mecozzi","id":"37278165700"},{"name":"Mark Shtaif","affiliation":["Department of Physical Electronics, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Shtaif","id":"37278050900"},{"name":"Xi Chen","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs, Holmdel, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37856179800"},{"name":"Sethumadhavan Chandrasekhar","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs, Holmdel, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Sethumadhavan","lastName":"Chandrasekhar","id":"37278536100"},{"name":"Peter J.

One of the schemes relies on the Stokes receiver and allows for complex-valued polarization multiplexed transmission without using a local oscillator, and active polarization control at the receiver. It uses three photodiodes and requires three analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The other scheme uses a local oscillator, and its implementation is suitable in all cases where the transmitter and the receiver operate at the same wavelength, so that the local oscillator signal can be extracted from the transmit laser. It uses only two photodiodes and two ADCs, and does not require optical hybrids. The performance of the first (Stokes-based) scheme is studied numerically, whereas that of the second scheme is studied both numerically and experimentally.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2765240","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8226886/08082496.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2765240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8226886","startPage":"5418","endPage":"5424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarization Multiplexing With the Kramers-Kronig Receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082496","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Polarization Multiplexing With the Kramers-Kronig Receiver","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082496/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"24","publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2017","accessionNumber":"17482465","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8082496/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Italian Government","grantNumber":"135"},{"fundingName":"INnovating City Planning through Information and Communication Technologies (INCIPICT)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003977","fundingName":"Israel Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1401/16"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization Multiplexing With the Kramers-Kronig Receiver","sourcePdf":"jlt-antonelli-2765240-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102795S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8226886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8226886","articleId":"8082496","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8082497,"authors":[{"name":"Jixin Guo","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8124123/8082497/guo-2766444-small.gif","p":["Jixin Guo was born in Chengdu, China, in 1989.

To achieve accurate fault detection results, the proposed CI is monitored by probability principal component analysis. Moreover, the concept of weighted average value is introduced to identify fault propagation path based on reconstruction-based contribution and causality graph after detecting a fault. Finally, the new proposed scheme would be practiced with real industrial HSMP data, where the individual steps as well as the complete framework were extensively tested.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Fault diagnosis","Monitoring","Indexes","Mathematical model","Fault detection","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault location","principal component analysis","probability","process monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint data-driven fault diagnosis","causality graph","complex industrial processes","integrated fault diagnosis method","fault location","propagation path identification","correlation index","CI","partial correlation coefficient","fault propagation path","industrial HSMP data","real industrial HSMP data","reconstruction-based contribution","probability principal component analysis","statistical process monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Joint data-driven","fault location","propagation path identification","causality graph","PPCA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08082503.pdf","startPage":"25217","endPage":"25225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Data-Driven Fault Diagnosis Integrating Causality Graph With Statistical Process Monitoring for Complex Industrial Processes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082503","topic":"Data-Driven Monitoring, Fault Diagnosis and Control of Cyber-Physical Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Data-Driven Fault Diagnosis Integrating Causality Graph With Statistical Process Monitoring for Complex Industrial Processes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082503/","volume":"5","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/8082503/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17381334","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473033 and 61773053"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the China Central Universities of USTB, China","grantNumber":"FRF-BD-16-005A"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000287","fundingName":"Newton Research Collaboration Award of the Royal Academy of Engineering, U.K.","grantNumber":"R33265"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint Data-Driven Fault Diagnosis Integrating Causality Graph With Statistical Process Monitoring for Complex Industrial Processes","sourcePdf":"access-peng-2766235-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087818S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Data-Driven Monitoring, Fault Diagnosis and Control of Cyber-Physical Systems"],"articleId":"8082503","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8082505,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Yang","affiliation":["Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Medical Image Processing, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"p":["Wei Yang received the B.Sc. degree in automation from the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2001, the M.Sc. degree in control theory and control engineering from Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in biomedical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2009.

The first step of a visual traffic surveillance system usually needs to correctly detect objects from images or videos and classify them into different categories (e.g., car, truck, and bus). This paper aims to introduce a new vehicle type classification scheme on the images acquired from multi-view visual traffic surveillance sensors. Most image classification algorithms focus on maximizing the percentage of the correct predictions, which have a deficiency that the images from minority categories are prone to be misclassified as the dominant categories. To address this challenge of classifying imbalanced data acquired from visual traffic surveillance sensors, we propose a method, which integrates deep neural networks with balanced sampling in this paper. The proposed method consists of two main stages. In the first stage, data augmentation with balanced sampling is applied to alleviate the unbalanced data set problem. In the second stage, an ensemble of convolutional neural network models with different architectures is constructed with parameters learned on the augmented training data set. Experiments on the MIOvision traffic camera dataset classification challenge data set demonstrate that the proposed method is able to enhance the mean precision of all categories, in the condition of high overall accuracy, compared with the baseline algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766203","startPage":"24417","endPage":"24425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08082506.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Ensemble Deep Learning Method for Vehicle Type Classification on Visual Traffic Surveillance Sensors","topic":"Visual Surveillance and Biometrics: Practices, Challenges, and Possibilities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082506/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Ensemble Deep Learning Method for Vehicle Type Classification on Visual Traffic Surveillance Sensors","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8082506/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17381234","publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61662024 and 61602220"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004479","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province","grantNumber":"20171BAB212013, 20161BBI90004 and 20161BAB212057"},{"fundingName":"Open Fund of the Hubei Province Key Laboratory","grantNumber":"2016KLA03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Ensemble Deep Learning Method for Vehicle Type Classification on Visual Traffic Surveillance Sensors","sourcePdf":"access-liu-2766203-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07063S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Visual Surveillance and Biometrics: Practices, Challenges, and Possibilities"],"articleId":"8082506","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8082507,"authors":[{"name":"Insun Jang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8165922/8082507/jang-2760162-small.gif","p":["Insun Jang received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Korea University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2011 and 2017, respectively.

We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the acceptable flow rate and to minimize the energy cost for multiple service chains. We transform the multi-objective optimization problem into a single-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, and prove that the problem is NP-hard. We propose a polynomial time algorithm based on linear relaxation and rounding to approximate the optimal solution of the MILP. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the effects of the energy budget, the network topology, and the amount of server resources on the acceptable flow rate. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance and can significantly increase the acceptable flow rate and the service capacity compared to other algorithms under an energy cost budget.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082507/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","volume":"35","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"17397770","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8082507/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint Optimization of Service Function Placement and Flow Distribution for Service Function Chaining","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NRF of Korea Grant"},{"fundingName":"Korean Government (MSIT)","grantNumber":"NRF-2014R1A2A1A12066986"},{"fundingName":"IITP Grant"},{"fundingName":"Korea government (MSIT)","grantNumber":"2017-0-00195"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Optimization of Service Function Placement and Flow Distribution for Service Function Chaining","sourcePdf":"jsac-jang-2760162-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162193S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8165922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"8165922","articleId":"8082507","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8082509,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Hu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8082509/hu-2766231-small.gif","p":["Jun Hu (S\u201917) received the B.S. degree in electronics and information engineering from Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China, in 2012, and the M.S. degree in electromagnetic field and microwave technology from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electronic science and technology.","His recent research interests include the design of tunable devices, passive components, reconfigurable antennas, and antenna array."]},"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Hu","id":"37309334700"},{"name":"Guo Qing Luo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Institute of Antennas and Microwave Technology, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8082509/luo-2766231-small.gif","p":["Guo Qing Luo (M\u201908) received the B.S. degree from the China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, in 2000, the M.S. degree from Northwest Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2007.","Since 2007, he has been with the faculty of the School of Electronics and Information, Hangzhou Dianzi University, as a Lecturer, and was promoted to Professor in 2011.

The proposed metasurface antenna is composed of a square patch, a metasurface formed by a lattice of 4 \u00d7 4 periodic metal plates, and four switchable feeding probes connected with two designed single-pole double-throws switches. By properly selecting the feeding probes, the polarization of the metasurface antenna can be dynamically reconfigured among four polarization states, i.e., x-direction linear polarization, y-direction linear polarization, left-hand circular polarization, and right-hand circular polarization.

However, these vehicles failed in satisfying the variance of human intentions. Recently, the strategy of collaborating brain-computer interface (BCI) controlling and automatic driving receives attention. Since the BCI system remained some limitation in real-time controlling, a fusion method has been proposed to explore and verify the feasibility of human-vehicle collaborative driving in this paper. A hybrid BCI was developed to interpret human intentions. In addition, a computer vision-based automatic driving component was developed to maintain the vehicle on the road. A system for fusing these two kinds of vehicle driving decisions was first proposed in this paper. This system can simultaneously obtain the visual data and the hybrid electroencephalograph (EEG) signals. The hybrid EEG signals consist of steady-state visual evoked potentials and motor imagery. The obtained multisource information can be fused to make the final decision to drive a simulated vehicle. The proposed system was evaluated with different destinations. The experimental results verify the feasibility of fusing both human intention and computer vision. The task success rate reached 91.1% and the information transfer rate was 85.80 bit/min.","doi":"10.1109/TCDS.2017.2766258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCDS.2017.2766258","startPage":"810","endPage":"822","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7274989/8457402/08082510.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8457402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Human-Vehicle Collaborative Simulated Driving System Based on Hybrid Brain\u2013Computer Interfaces and Computer Vision","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Human-Vehicle Collaborative Simulated Driving System Based on Hybrid Brain\u2013Computer Interfaces and Computer Vision","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2018","accessionNumber":"18077786","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8082510/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61673224"},{"fundingName":"Tianjin Research Program of Application Foundation and Advanced Technology","grantNumber":"14JCYBJC18300"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Human-Vehicle Collaborative Simulated Driving System Based on Hybrid Brain\u2013Computer Interfaces and Computer Vision","sourcePdf":"tcds-duan-2766258-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139192S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7274989","isNumber":"8457402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7274989","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8457402","articleId":"8082510","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8082521,"authors":[{"name":"Matteo Lodi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications Engineering and Naval Architecture, University of Genoa, Genova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8293879/8082521/lodi-2759320-small.gif","p":["Matteo Lodi was born in Genoa, Italy, in 1991.

How to integrate the channel coding into heterogeneous modulation PNC (HePNC), where the sources apply different modulations, is an open issue. In this paper, we propose a channel coded HePNC (CoHePNC) scheme under asymmetric TWRC. For repeat-accumulate (RA) codes applied at the sources, a full-state sum-product decoding algorithm is proposed which enables the relay to decode the superimposed signals from the sources to the raw decoding results firstly, and then re-encode and obtain the network-coded codewords by mapping the raw decoding results according to the proposed bit-level mapping functions. We further optimized the bit-level mapping functions according to the two source-relay channel conditions. Extensive simulation results demonstrated that the proposed CoHePNC outperforms the existing channel coded PNC schemes in terms of the relay decoding error rate and the end-to-end bit error rate under asymmetric TWRC scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082522/","volume":"67","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8082522/","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17633301","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Design of Channel Coded Heterogeneous Modulation Physical Layer Network Coding","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Channel Coded Heterogeneous Modulation Physical Layer Network Coding","sourcePdf":"tvt-cai-2766209-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117191S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8318405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8318405","articleId":"8082522","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8082524,"authors":[{"name":"Vinay K.

Through its structural risk minimization, it has enjoyed a good reputation in effectively reducing overfitting, avoiding dimensional disaster, and not falling into local minima. Nevertheless, existing SVMs do not perform well when facing class imbalance and large-scale samples. Undersampling is a plausible alternative to solve imbalanced problems in some way, but suffers from soaring computational complexity and reduced accuracy because of its enormous iterations and random sampling process. To improve their classification performance in dealing with data imbalance problems, this work proposes a weighted undersampling (WU) scheme for SVM based on space geometry distance, and thus produces an improved algorithm named WU-SVM. In WU-SVM, majority samples are grouped into some subregions (SRs) and assigned different weights according to their Euclidean distance to the hyper plane. The samples in an SR with higher weight have more chance to be sampled and put to use in each learning iteration, so as to retain the data distribution information of original data sets as much as possible. Comprehensive experiments are performed to test WU-SVM via 21 binary-class and six multiclass publically available data sets. The results show that it well outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of three popular metrics for imbalanced classification, i.e., area under the curve, F-Measure, and G-Mean.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082535/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18042986","pubMedId":"29990027","volume":"29","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/8082535/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Distance-Based Weighted Undersampling Scheme for Support Vector Machines and its Application to Imbalanced Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51775385, 71371142 and 61703279"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006469","fundingName":"Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ci\u00eancias e da Tecnologia","grantNumber":"119/2014/A3"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distance-Based Weighted Undersampling Scheme for Support Vector Machines and its Application to Imbalanced Classification","sourcePdf":"tnnls-zhou-2755595-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133587S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8440865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8440865","articleId":"8082535","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8082536,"authors":[{"name":"Jorge Iscar","affiliation":["SolVIS Inc., Knoxville, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida International University, Miami, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8338166/8082536/iscar-2766226-small.gif","p":["Jorge Iscar received the B.S. degree in telecommunications\n engineering from the University of Cantabria, Cantabria, Spain, in 2013, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering\n from Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA, in 2016.

One of the major challenges in massive MIMO systems is the accurate joint estimation of the channel and noise variance, which significantly affects the performance of wireless communications in practical scenarios. In this paper, we first derive a novel maximum likelihood estimator for the noise variance at the receiver of massive MIMO systems considering practical impairments such as pilot contamination. Then, this estimate is used to compute the minimum mean square error estimate of the channel. In order to measure the performance of the proposed noise variance estimator, we derive the corresponding Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Simulation results show that the estimator is efficient in certain scenarios, outperforming existing approaches in the literature. Furthermore, we develop the estimator and the CRLB for equal and different noise variance at the receive antennas. Although the proposed estimator is valid for all antenna array sizes, its use is particularly effective for massive MIMO systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Noise Variance Estimation Under Pilot Contamination for Massive MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2766226","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8338166/08082536.pdf","startPage":"2982","endPage":"2996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2766226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338166","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082536","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/25/8338166/8082536-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082536/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Noise Variance Estimation Under Pilot Contamination for Massive MIMO Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8082536/","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699054","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1406968 and CNS-1453678"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Efficient Noise Variance Estimation Under Pilot Contamination for Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-iscarvergara-2766226-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108773S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8082536","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8082545,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The schedule ensures the MG normal operation prior to the windstorm while reducing the MG vulnerability at the event onset. The proposed method makes benefit of network reconfiguration, generation reschedule, conservation voltage regulation, optimal parameter settings of droop-controlled units, demand-side resources, and backup generation capacity. A vulnerability index is defined to assess the effectiveness of the proposed proactive management in reducing the MG vulnerability at the event onset. The proposed model is linearized that guarantees simplicity, robustness, and computational efficiency of the solution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on a real-scale MG against a windstorm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resilience-Oriented Proactive Management of Microgrids Against Windstorms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2765600","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/8387923/08082545.pdf","startPage":"4275","endPage":"4284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2765600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387923","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082545/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","displayDocTitle":"Resilience-Oriented Proactive Management of Microgrids Against Windstorms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8082545/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17857540","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003968","fundingName":"Iran National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"95834085"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resilience-Oriented Proactive Management of Microgrids Against Windstorms","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-aminifar-2765600-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079109S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8387923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"8387923","articleId":"8082545","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8082548,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Fern\u00e1ndez Molanes","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Technology, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8260593/8082548/molan-2766581-small.gif","p":["Roberto Fern\u00e1ndez Molanes (S\u201914) received the M.Sc.\n degree in electrical engineering and M.Sc. degree in advanced technologies and processes in industry from University\n of Vigo, Vigo, Spain, in 2012 and 2013, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the\n Department of Electronic Technology.","His research interests include the design of hardware/software coprocessing systems and high-performance\n instrumentation using FPSoC platforms."]},"firstName":"Roberto Fern\u00e1ndez","lastName":"Molanes","id":"37085449409"},{"name":"Juan J.

Despite these very useful characteristics, the penetration of FPSoCs in digital designs for industrial electronics applications is very limited. There is a general agreement among researchers in the area that one of the main reasons for this is the lack of knowledge about the best way to interconnect the processors and the FPGA fabric in these devices.

AF relaying is adopted due to its simplicity and ease of implementation, and both cases of fixed- and variable-gain AF protocols are addressed. Unlike the classical approach where a number of subcarriers are solely dedicated to pilots, partial data-dependent superimposed training is considered here, which preserves the spectral efficiency. Assuming a bit-interleaved coded modulation OFDM system at the source, a modified formulation of VBA is proposed, which is, in fact, a Bayesian framework of turbo data detection of OFDM under channel estimation errors. More precisely, by an appropriate exploitation of the inherent \u201csoft\u201d information on channel and data available from the VBA formalism, we derive a modified iterative receiver, which reduces the impact of channel uncertainty by averaging the \u201csoft data decision\u201d over the posterior distribution of the unknown channel at each decoding iteration. The proposed modified VBA approach is contrasted to the conventional VBA and to the mismatched VBA approach, where, in the latter, the unknown channel is just replaced by its imperfect estimate. We show that conventional and mismatched VBA are suboptimal and can be viewed as a particular case of the proposed VBA method. In addition, we show that the VBA approach makes a nice connection between the classical techniques such as pilot-only channel estimation and the expectation-maximization algorithm, which can be viewed as a special case of VBA. By comparison with state-of-the-art VBA-based estimators through numerical analysis, we highlight the superiority of our modified VBA method and demonstrate a notable performance improvement in terms of the bit error rate.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2766285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8318405/08082549.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2766285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318405","startPage":"2243","endPage":"2253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Variational Inference Approach to Iterative OFDM Receiver Design for Superimposed Training-Based AF Relay Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Variational Inference Approach to Iterative OFDM Receiver Design for Superimposed Training-Based AF Relay Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082549/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17633288","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8082549/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Variational Inference Approach to Iterative OFDM Receiver Design for Superimposed Training-Based AF Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-sadough-2766285-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117061S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8318405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8318405","articleId":"8082549","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8082551,"authors":[{"name":"Yujie Lin","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8318405/8082551/lin-2766282-small.gif","p":["Yujie Lin received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering\n from Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, in 2011.

Existing algorithms encode different antenna elements' radiation with orthogonal signature codes, but these algorithms are far from desired for large-scale spaceborne antenna arrays. Considering the strictly limited resources on satellites, to improve the hardware efficiency of large-scale spaceborne antenna arrays, in this paper inspired by the idea of nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) we design a series of nonorthogonal signature codes for different antenna elements by cyclically shifting an m-sequence (CSmS) with different offsets named CSmS-NOMA signaling. This design can strike an elegant balance between the performance and complexity and is very suitable for large-scale spaceborne antenna arrays. It is shown that no matter how many antenna elements are to be calibrated simultaneously, CSmS-NOMA signaling needs only one calibrating waveform generator and one matched filter. Hence, it is much more efficient than the existing fully orthogonal schemes. In order to evaluate the achievable calibration accuracy, a unified theoretical framework is developed based on which the relationship between calibration accuracy and signal-to-noise ratio has been clearly revealed. Furthermore, a hardware experiment platform is also built to assess the theoretical work. For all the considered scenarios, it can be concluded that the theoretical, simulated, and experimental results coincide with each other perfectly.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NOMA-Based Calibration for Large-Scale Spaceborne Antenna Arrays","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2766282","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8318405/08082551.pdf","startPage":"2231","endPage":"2242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2766282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318405","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082551/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"NOMA-Based Calibration for Large-Scale Spaceborne Antenna Arrays","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8082551/","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17633277","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Joint Foundation of NSFC and Fundamental Research for General Purpose Technologies","grantNumber":"U1636125"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NOMA-Based Calibration for Large-Scale Spaceborne Antenna Arrays","sourcePdf":"tvt-lin-2766282-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086242S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8318405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8318405","articleId":"8082551","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8082554,"authors":[{"name":"Luoqing Li","affiliation":["Hubei Key Laboratory of Applied Mathematics, Faculty of Mathematics and Statistics, Hubei University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8440865/8082554/lli-2757140-small.gif","p":["Luoqing Li received the B.Sc. degree from Hubei University, Wuhan, China, the M.Sc. degree from Wuhan University, Wuhan, and the Ph.D. degree from Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.","He is currently with the Hubei Key Laboratory of Applied Mathematics, Faculty of Mathematics and Statistics, Hubei University, where he became a Full Professor in 1994.

One of the core problems in big data learning is how to extract effective information from the huge data. In this paper, we propose a Markov resampling algorithm to draw useful samples for handling coefficient-based regularized regression (CBRR) problem. The proposed Markov resampling algorithm is a selective sampling method, which can automatically select uniformly ergodic Markov chain (u.e.M.c.) samples according to transition probabilities. Based on u.e.M.c. samples, we analyze the theoretical performance of CBRR algorithm and generalize the existing results on independent and identically distributed observations. To be specific, when the kernel is infinitely differentiable, the learning rate depending on the sample size m can be arbitrarily close to O(m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n) under a mild regularity condition on the regression function.

Our previous study presented a lightweight prosthesis with damping behaviors, which can adapt to different terrains. However, the proposed prosthesis cannot provide push-off during the stance phase. In this paper, we redesigned the mechanical structure, combining push-off and damping behaviors. The Peking University Robotic Trantibial Prosthesis (PKU-RoboTPro-) II makes a trade-off between push-off power and lightweight. Three unilateral transtibial subjects participated in the study. Gait symmetry and metabolic cost of walking with the proposed prosthesis were evaluated under conditions of three terrains and four walking speeds. The gait symmetry of the subjects using the prosthesis combining push-off and damping behaviors in stance time and ground reaction force distribution are improved. Meanwhile, the PKU-RoboTPro-II with a push-off mode can reduce energy expenditure, with an average 14% \u00b1 8% reduction and a maximal 31% reduction under different conditions, compared with a non-push-off mode. When the weight of the lithium-ion rechargeable battery is 0.28 kg (2.6 Ah), it enables the new prosthesis combining push-off and damping behaviors to walk approximately 10 000 strides, on average.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prosthetics","Legged locomotion","DC motors","Damping","Assistive technologies","AC motors","Medical robotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","gait analysis","medical robotics","prosthetics","secondary cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["push-off power","robotic trantibial prosthesis","lithium-ion rechargeable battery","lightweight motor-driven transtibial prosthesis","ground reaction force distribution","lightweight prosthesis","below-knee amputees","nonlinear damping behaviors","nonpush-off mode","PKU-RoboTPro-II","gait symmetry","unilateral transtibial subjects"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Damping behaviors","gait symmetry","metabolic cost","push-off","robotic prosthesis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2017.2766205","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/8196978/08082555.pdf","startPage":"2512","endPage":"2523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8196978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2017.2766205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining Push-Off Power and Nonlinear Damping Behaviors for a Lightweight Motor-Driven Transtibial Prosthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Combining Push-Off Power and Nonlinear Damping Behaviors for a Lightweight Motor-Driven Transtibial Prosthesis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082555/","volume":"22","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8082555/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17398681","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91648207 and 61533001"},{"fundingName":"National Program for Support of Top-Notch Young Professionals"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005090","fundingName":"Beijing Nova Program","grantNumber":"Z141101001814001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining Push-Off Power and Nonlinear Damping Behaviors for a Lightweight Motor-Driven Transtibial Prosthesis","sourcePdf":"tmech-wang-2766205-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107124S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"8196978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8196978","articleId":"8082555","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8082557,"authors":[{"name":"Ritesh Pradhan","affiliation":["The University of Alabama in Huntsville, AL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/8103362/8082557/pradh-2766358-small.gif","p":["Ritesh Pradhan received the B.E. degree in computer engineering from the Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University, Nepal, and the M.S. degree in computer science from The University of Alabama, Huntsville.

As a conventional solution, the Jacobian-matrix-pseudo-inverse (JMPI) method suffers from two major limitations: one is the requirement on known information of the robot model such as parameter and structure; the other is the position error accumulation phenomenon caused by the open-loop nature. To overcome such two limitations, this paper proposes a novel Jacobian-matrix-adaption (JMA) method for the tracking control of robot manipulators via the zeroing dynamics. Unlike existing works requiring the information of the known robot model, the proposed JMA method uses only the input-output information to control the robot with unknown model. The solution based on the JMA method transforms the internal, implicit, and unmeasurable model information to the external, explicit, and measurable input-output information. Moreover, simulation studies including comparisons and tests substantiate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed JMA method for the tracking control of robot manipulators subject to unknown models.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2017.2766455","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8402070/08082558.pdf","startPage":"3044","endPage":"3053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8402070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2017.2766455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking Control of Robot Manipulators with Unknown Models: A Jacobian-Matrix-Adaption Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082558","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","displayDocTitle":"Tracking Control of Robot Manipulators with Unknown Models: A Jacobian-Matrix-Adaption Method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082558/","publicationDate":"July 2018","dateOfInsertion":"03 July 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17895212","htmlLink":"/document/8082558/","volume":"14","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473323 and 61401385"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China","grantNumber":"2014J4100057"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research Grants Council Early Career Scheme","grantNumber":"25214015"},{"fundingName":"Departmental General Research Fund of Hong Kong Polytechnic University","grantNumber":"G.61.37.UA7L"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking Control of Robot Manipulators with Unknown Models: A Jacobian-Matrix-Adaption Method","sourcePdf":"tii-li-2766455-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121297S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8402070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"8402070","articleId":"8082558","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8082561,"authors":[{"name":"Mingxing Duan","affiliation":["College of Information and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China","Collaborative Innovation Center of High Performance Computing, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/8225765/8082561/duan-2766583-small.gif","p":["Mingxing Duan is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, China.

At the same time, performing age estimation for a narrow age range may lead to better results. In this paper, to achieve robust age estimation, an ensemble structure referred to as CNN2ELM, which includes convolutional neural network (CNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM), is proposed for age estimation. The three-level system includes feature extraction and fusion, age grouping via an ELM classifier, and age estimation via an ELM regressor. Age-Net, Gender-Net, and Race-Net are trained using different targets, such as age class, gender class, and race class, respectively, and the three networks are used to extract features corresponding to age, gender, and race from the same image of a person during validation and test stages. Features related to the age property are enhanced by fusing these of race and gender properties. Then, to achieve a narrow age range, the ELM classifies the fusion results into one of the age groups. Afterward, an age decision is made using an ELM regressor. Our network is pretrained on an ImageNet database and then fine-tuned on the IMDB-WIKI database. The recently released Adience benchmark, ChaLearn Looking at People 2016 (LAP-2016), and MORPH-II are used to verify the performance of \u201cRace-Net + Age-Net + Gender-Net + ELM classifier + ELM regressor (RAGN).\u201d RAGN outperforms the existing state-of-the-art age estimation methods. The mean absolute error of the age estimation of RAGN for MORPH-II is determined to be 2.61 years; the accuracy of the age estimation for the Adience benchmark is 0.6649; and the normal score (\u03f5) for the sequestered test set of the LAP-2016 data set is 0.3679.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082561/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17481792","htmlLink":"/document/8082561/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","volume":"13","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Ensemble CNN2ELM for Age Estimation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Outstanding Youth Science Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61625202"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"International (Regional) Cooperation and Exchange Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61661146006"},{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YT80201900"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Ensemble CNN2ELM for Age Estimation","sourcePdf":"tifs-li-2766583-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120947S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"8225765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8225765","articleId":"8082561","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8082562,"authors":[{"name":"Lei M.

A spatially coupled split-component ensemble is defined, generalizing from the most important codes of this class, staircase codes and braided block codes, and preserving a deterministic partitioning of component-code bits over code blocks. Our analysis focuses on low-complexity iterative algebraic decoding, which, for the binary erasure channel, is equivalent to a generalization of the peeling decoder. Using the differential equation method, we derive a vector recursion that tracks the expected residual graph evolution throughout the decoding process. The threshold of the recursion, for asymptotically long component codes, is found using potential function analysis. We generalize the analysis to mixture ensembles consisting of more than one type of component code. We give an example of a mixture ensemble consisting of two component codes, which has better performance than spatially-coupled split-component ensembles consisting of only one component code. The analysis extends to the binary symmetric channel by assuming miscorrection-free component-code decoding. Simple upper bounds on the number of errors correctable by the ensemble are derived. Finally, we analyze the threshold of spatially coupled split-component ensembles under beyond bounded-distance component decoding.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082562/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","volume":"64","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17466851","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8082562/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spatially Coupled Split-Component Codes With Iterative Algebraic Decoding","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially Coupled Split-Component Codes With Iterative Algebraic Decoding","sourcePdf":"tit-zhang-2766238-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129878S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8232491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8232491","articleId":"8082562","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8082581,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuhide Nakajima","affiliation":["NTT Corporation"],"bio":{"p":["Kazuhide Nakajima [M] (nakajima.kazuhide@lab.ntt.co.jp) received M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Nihon University, Chiba, Japan, in 1994 and 2005, respectively.

This article describes the potential of space-division multiplexing as regards optical fiber and cable technology. We focus on the potential of multi-core fiber and investigate the reality of multi-core-fiber-based space-division multiplexing optical wiring as the first example of a space-division multiplexing application taking the latest research and development into consideration. Finally, we show that the key technology behind multi-core-fiber-based space-division multiplexing optical wiring is ready for discussion as a near future standard.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Standards Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/7886829/8077815/08082581.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"45","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Standards Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOMSTD.2017.1700017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOMSTD.2017.1700017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8077815","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Core Fiber Technology: Next Generation Optical Communication Strategy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Optical fiber cables","Crosstalk","Optical fiber networks","Optical imaging","5G mobile communication","Multiplexing","Information and communication technology","Sustainable development"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical cables","optical fibre communication","optical fibre networks","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicore fiber technology","single mode fiber","space division multiplexing","optical communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"SEPTEMBER  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Core Fiber Technology: Next Generation Optical Communication Strategy","volume":"1","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8082581/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"SEPTEMBER 2017","accessionNumber":"17284788","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Core Fiber Technology: Next Generation Optical Communication Strategy","sourcePdf":"016NAKAJIMA_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046998S","chronDate":"SEPTEMBER  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7886829","isNumber":"8077815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7886829","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8077815","articleId":"8082581","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8082583,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Chiaraviglio","affiliation":["Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni, University of Rome Tor Vergata"],"bio":{"p":["Luca Chiaraviglio [SM'16] is a tenure track assistant professor at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy, and a research associate with CNIT, Italy.

These users live in rural areas and low-income regions, where network operators are not keen to invest, mainly due to high capital expenditure and operational expenditure costs, as well as the scarcity of electricity from the grid. We tackle this challenge by proposing a 5G network explicitly designed to serve rural and low-income areas. Our solution investigates the possibility of mounting remote radio heads on top of unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as large cells (LCs) to increase the coverage range. In addition, 5G nodes are powered by solar panels and batteries. Preliminary results, obtained over three representative case studies located in Italy, Cook Islands, and Zimbabwe, show that providing connectivity in rural and low-income areas by means of the proposed 5G architecture is feasible. At the same time, we also show that the monthly subscription fee paid by the users can be kept sufficiently low, that is, less than \u20ac1/month in low-income areas, and around \u20ac11/month in rural regions.","doi":"10.1109/MCOMSTD.2017.1700023","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Standards Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Standards Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/7886829/8077815/08082583.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8077815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOMSTD.2017.1700023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bringing 5G into Rural and Low-Income Areas: Is It Feasible?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082583","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"SEPTEMBER  2017","displayDocTitle":"Bringing 5G into Rural and Low-Income Areas: Is It Feasible?","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082583/","publicationDate":"SEPTEMBER 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17284787","htmlLink":"/document/8082583/","volume":"1","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bringing 5G into Rural and Low-Income Areas: Is It Feasible?","sourcePdf":"018CHIARAVIGLIO_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097132S","chronDate":"SEPTEMBER  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7886829","isNumber":"8077815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7886829","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"8077815","articleId":"8082583","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8082626,"authors":[{"name":"Akanksha Sharma","affiliation":["MACERC, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India"],"firstName":"Akanksha","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37086243114"},{"name":"Somesh Sharma","affiliation":["E.C.E Deptt., MACERC, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India"],"firstName":"Somesh","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37085884786"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1144-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1145-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7555"}],"articleNumber":"8082626","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Radio frequency","Receivers","Energy harvesting","Throughput","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","energy harvesting","mobile radio","multi-access systems","probability","radio spectrum management","radio transmitters","stochastic processes","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless energy harvesting","cognitive radio networks","PSA","wireless networks","secondary transmitters","radio frequency signal","primary networks","RF signal energy","self-sustained networks","low-powered wireless elements","primary transmitter","homogenous Poisson point processes","HPPP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","energy harvesting","opportunistic spectrum access","wireless power transfer","stochastic geometry"]}],"abstract":"As the wireless networks has the capability toharvest RF signal's energy and therefore can be referred as selfsustained networks.

The growth in the number of images that are being uploaded has brought a need to develop systems that can store, process and organize them as how and when needed. A survey conducted on working ability of famous e-commerce systems has brought into light the need for semantic integration in recommendation systems. This paper proposes a framework in which images are recommended to users based on their semantic integration. This integration is made possible by using tags and surrounding text of an image to determine their semantic association. In this paper four semantic relatedness methods are used. The methods are Jaccard similarity of sets, Dice, edit distance and Overlap, these techniques are compared to find the best semantic recommendation. The proposed system has wide application in recommendation systems such as image recommendation in social networking, books recommendation, movie recommendation and product recommendation in e-commerce websites.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IRuSL: Image Recommendation Using Semantic Link","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN)","doi":"10.1109/CICN.2016.66","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8049191/8082586/08082656.pdf","startPage":"305","endPage":"308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2016.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8082586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082656","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082656/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"IRuSL: Image Recommendation Using Semantic Link","conferenceDate":"23-25 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8082656/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"17288882","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IRuSL: Image Recommendation Using Semantic Link","confLoc":"Tehri, India","sourcePdf":"1144a305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061482S","chronDate":"23-25 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"8049191","isNumber":"8082586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8049191","xplore-issue":"8082586","articleId":"8082656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8082704,"authors":[{"name":"Mitali Garg","affiliation":["VLSI Design CDAC, Mohali"],"firstName":"Mitali","lastName":"Garg","id":"37086246196"},{"name":"Anurag","lastName":"Anurag","id":"37085802224"},{"name":"Balwinder Singh","affiliation":["VLSI Design CDAC, Mohali"],"firstName":"Balwinder","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085514836"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1144-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1145-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7555"}],"articleNumber":"8082704","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":345},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["FinFETs","Logic gates","Delays","CMOS technology","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit reliability","MOSFET circuits","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FinFET based voltage mode sense amplifier","CMOS based voltage mode sense amplifier","power delay product reduction","short channel effect reduction","leakage power reduction","size 16.0 nm","size 22.0 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Voltage mode sense amplifier","Bulk CMOS","fin shaped field effect transistor","Delay","Average power consumed","PDP"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082704","abstract":"FinFETs are the devices which replaced bulk MOSFETS because of its surpassing quality of minimizing leakage power and reducing short channel effects occurring in MOSFETS due to decrease in channel length.

In order it helps in ideal use of resource and as a consequence enhancing the performance of the system, we need an efficient task scheduling algorithm. The Min-Min algorithm is simple that produce a schedule that minimize the makespan but this algorithm does not make use of resource effectively.

It has vital applications in the field of fraud detection, network robustness analysis, Insider Trading Detection, email spam detection, Medical and Public Health Outlier Detection, Industrial Damage Detection, Image processing fraud detection, marketing, network sensors and intrusion detection. In this paper, we propose a kmean clustering and neural network as novel to detect the outlier in network analysis. Especially in a social network, k means clustering and neural network is used to find the community overlapped user in the network as well as it finds more kclique which describe the strong coupling of data. In this paper, we propose that this method is efficient to find out outlier in social network analyses. Moreover, we show the effectiveness of this new method using the experiments data.","doi":"10.1109/CICN.2016.142","startPage":"693","endPage":"696","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8049191/8082586/08082734.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2016.142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8082586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outlier Detection Using Kmeans and Fuzzy Min Max Neural Network in Network Data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Anomaly detection","Neural networks","Clustering algorithms","Complex networks","Genetic algorithms","Matrix converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","minimax techniques","pattern clustering","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy min max neural network","network data","network sensors","intrusion detection","network analysis","social network analyses","outlier elimination","k means clustering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Outlier Detection","Network Data","Adjacency Matrix","Kmeans Clustering","Neural Network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082734/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Outlier Detection Using Kmeans and Fuzzy Min Max Neural Network in Network Data","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8082734/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"23-25 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"17288758","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outlier Detection Using Kmeans and Fuzzy Min Max Neural Network in Network Data","confLoc":"Tehri, India","sourcePdf":"1144a693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031902S","chronDate":"23-25 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"8049191","isNumber":"8082586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8049191","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8082586","articleId":"8082734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8082745,"authors":[{"name":"Minglei Yang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Minglei","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-9637-8088","id":"37595836900"},{"name":"Lei Sun","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086239335"},{"name":"Xin Yuan","affiliation":["Bell Labs, Murray Hill, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37961748900"},{"name":"Baixiao Chen","affiliation":["Bell Labs, Murray Hill, USA"],"firstName":"Baixiao","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0001-7320-327X","id":"37292995400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"8082745","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1073},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"We propose anew antenna array design approach for a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) radar, which has closed-form expressions for the sensor locations and the number of achievable degrees of freedom (DOFs).

We employ the difference coarray of the sum coarray (DCSC) of the MIMO radar to obtain more DOFs for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. Via properly designing the interelement spacings of the transmitting and receiving arrays, we can obtain a hole-free DCSC. The characteristics of array geometries are analyzed and the optimal numbers of sensors in transmitting/receiving antenna array are derived when given the total number of physical sensors. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed array in terms of the number of DOFs, the number of resolvable sources, and the DOA estimation performance over the coprime MIMO array.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/8105926/08082745.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"44","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2017.2766294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2017.2766294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8105926","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Nested MIMO Array With Increased Degrees of Freedom and Hole-Free Difference Coarray","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO radar","Array signal processing","Sensor arrays","MIMO","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Geometry","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO communication","MIMO radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical sensors","closed-form expressions","MIMO radar","direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO array","DCSC","antenna array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Difference coarray","minimum redundancy array (MRA)","multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) radar","nested array","sensor arrays","sum coarray"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"A New Nested MIMO Array With Increased Degrees of Freedom and Hole-Free Difference Coarray","volume":"25","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8082745/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17372647","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571344"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Nested MIMO Array With Increased Degrees of Freedom and Hole-Free Difference Coarray","sourcePdf":"lsp-yang-2766294-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055874S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"8105926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8105926","articleId":"8082745","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8082747,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Price","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8241022/8082747/price-2752838-small.gif","p":["Michael Price (M\u201915) received the M.Eng. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA, in 2009, with a focus on high-speed serial links, and the Ph.D. degree from MIT in 2016, focusing on the work described in this paper.","From 2009 to 2011, he was an Electrical Engineer with Aurora Flight Sciences, Cambridge, MA, where he was involved in developing electronics and control systems for unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites.

Most conventional signal processing methods lack adaptability, thus being unable to well extract the embedded meaningful information. Adaptive mode decomposition methods have excellent adaptability and high flexibility in describing arbitrary complicated signals, and are free from the limitations imposed by conventional basis expansion, thus being able to adapt to the signal characteristics, extract rich characteristic information, and therefore reveal the underlying physical nature. This paper presents a systematic and up-to-date review on adaptive mode decomposition in two major topics, i.e., mono-component decomposition algorithms (such as empirical mode composition, local mean decomposition, intrinsic time-scale decomposition, local characteristic scale decomposition, Hilbert vibration decomposition, empirical wavelet transform, variational mode decomposition, nonlinear mode decomposition, and adaptive local iterative filtering) and instantaneous frequency estimation approaches (including Hilbert-transform-based analytic signal, direct quadrature, and normalized Hilbert transform based on empirical AM-FM decomposition, as well as generalized zero-crossing and energy separation) reported in more than 80 representative articles published since 1998. Their fundamental principles, advantages and disadvantages, and applications to signal analysis in machinery fault diagnosis, are examined. Examples are provided to illustrate their performance.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766232","startPage":"24301","endPage":"24331","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

Nonexistence of collaborative systems between VRUs and vehicles was the main reason for this lack of attention. Recent developments in Wi-Fi Direct and DSRC-enabled smartphones are changing this perspective. Leveraging the existing V2V platforms, we propose a new framework using a DSRC-enabled smartphone to extend safety benefits to VRUs. The interoperability of applications between vehicles and portable DSRC enabled devices is achieved through the SAE J2735 Personal Safety Message (PSM). However, considering the fact that VRU movement dynamics, response times, and crash scenarios are fundamentally different from vehicles, a specific framework should be designed for VRU safety applications to study their performance. In this article, we first propose an end-to-end Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) framework to provide situational awareness and hazard detection based on the most common and injury-prone crash scenarios. The details of our VRU safety module, including target classification and collision detection algorithms, are explained next. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate a mitigating solution for congestion and power consumption issues in such systems. Finally, the whole system is implemented and analyzed for realistic crash scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/MITS.2017.2743201","publicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/5117645/8082769/08082781.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MITS.2017.2743201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8082769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation and Evaluation of a Cooperative Vehicle-to-Pedestrian Safety Application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082781/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"winter  2017","displayDocTitle":"Implementation and Evaluation of a Cooperative Vehicle-to-Pedestrian Safety Application","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"winter 2017","accessionNumber":"17284391","htmlLink":"/document/8082781/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation and Evaluation of a Cooperative Vehicle-to-Pedestrian Safety Application","sourcePdf":"09mits04-tahmasbi-sarvestani-2743201-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078813S","chronDate":"winter  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5117645","isNumber":"8082769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5117645","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8082769","articleId":"8082781","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8082783,"authors":[{"name":"Fangbo Qin","affiliation":["Research Center of Precision Sensing and Control, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","School of Computer and Control Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8999828/8082783/qin-2754863-small.gif","p":["Fangbo Qin received the B.Sc. degree in automation from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2013.

This paper proposes a model learning method that is suitable for both forward and inverse PEA models. The hysteresis property is learned based on least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs). A larger dataset is used for training LS-SVM to guarantee a good generalization performance. Support vectors pruning is utilized to reduce the model complexity. The rate-dependent property of PEA is identified as a linear dynamic submodel. Moreover, a pointing control system with two dualPEA-axis steering mirrors is developed, which can regulate the 4-degree-of-freedom pose of a laser beam. The coordinated control of four PEAs is realized based on the Jacobian matrix. The learned inverse PEA models are used for the feedforward compensation of each PEA's nonlinearity. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed method's effectiveness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082783/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19377930","volume":"50","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8082783/","publicationDate":"March 2020","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Laser Beam Pointing Control With Piezoelectric Actuator Model Learning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61227804, 61421004, 61673383 and 61303177"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Laser Beam Pointing Control With Piezoelectric Actuator Model Learning","sourcePdf":"tsmc-xu-2754863-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108795S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8999828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8999828","articleId":"8082783","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8082787,"authors":[{"name":"Jubin Mitra","affiliation":["Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Kolkata, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8240812/8082787/mitra-2758807-small.gif","p":["Jubin Mitra (S\u201915) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata, India, in 2011 and the M.Tech. degree from Bengal Engineering and Science University, Kolkata, in 2013.

Traditional electronic systems used for time measurement are designed using a classical mixed-signal approach. With the advent of reconfigurable hardware such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), it is more advantageous for designers to opt for all-digital architecture. Most high-speed serial transceivers of the FPGA circuitry do not ensure the same chip latency after each power cycle, reset cycle, or firmware upgrade. These cause uncertainty of phase relationship between the recovered signals. To address the need to register minute phase shift changes inside an FPGA, we propose a design for phase measurement logic core having resolution and precision in the range of a few picoseconds. The working principle is based on subsample accumulation using systematic sampling over the phase detector signal. The phase measurement logic can operate over a wide range of digital clock frequencies, ranging from a few kilohertz to the maximum frequency that is supported within the FPGA fabric. A mathematical model is developed to illustrate the operating principle of the design. The VLSI architecture is designed for the logic core. We also discussed the procedure of the phase measurement system, the calibration sequence involved, followed by the performance of the design in terms of accuracy, precision, and resolution.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2758807","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8240812/08082787.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8240812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2758807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-Based Phase Measurement System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082787","supplementGroup":[{"repository":"code-ocean","type":"algorithm","badge":"Available","badgeMsg":"This document includes code submitted by the author.","supplement":[{"doi":"10.24433/CO.774e1b2a-a1fa-4347-a2d1-a31b1903bb5e","uri":"https://codeocean.com/2017/11/07/an-fpga-based-phase-measurement-system","name":"An FPGA-Based Phase Measurement System","language":"C/C++","widgetUrl":"https://codeocean.com/widget.js?id=774e1b2a-a1fa-4347-a2d1-a31b1903bb5e","badgeType":"Code-Available"}]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-Based Phase Measurement System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082787/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17468592","htmlLink":"/document/8082787/","volume":"26","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012470","fundingName":"CERN"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An FPGA-Based Phase Measurement System","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-mitra-2758807-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118692S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8240812","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8240812","articleId":"8082787","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8082790,"authors":[{"name":"Yanzhi Wu","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8839652/8082790/wu-2761362-small.gif","p":["Yanzhi Wu received the B.S. degree in applied mathematics from Taiyuan Normal University, Taiyuan, China, in 2013, and the M.S. degree in computational mathematics from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2015, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Automation Engineering.","Her current research interests include multiagent systems and social dynamics."]},"firstName":"Yanzhi","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0003-2707-0079","id":"37085845632"},{"name":"Yiyi Zhao","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8839652/8082790/zhao-2761362-small.gif","p":["Yiyi Zhao received the master\u2019s degree in region economics from Yunnan Minzu University, Kunming, China, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Economics and Management, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2014.","She is currently a Lecturer with the School of Business Administration, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Chengdu.

In this paper, we propose a sequence learning model that can predict future taxi requests in each area of a city based on the recent demand and other relevant information. Remembering information from the past is critical here, since taxi requests in the future are correlated with information about actions that happened in the past. For example, someone who requests a taxi to a shopping center, may also request a taxi to return home after few hours. We use one of the best sequence learning methods, long short term memory that has a gating mechanism to store the relevant information for future use. We evaluate our method on a data set of taxi requests in New York City by dividing the city into small areas and predicting the demand in each area. We show that this approach outperforms other prediction methods, such as feed-forward neural networks. In addition, we show how adding other relevant information, such as weather, time, and drop-offs affects the results.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2017.2755684","startPage":"2572","endPage":"2581","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2017.2755684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8425132","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/8425132/08082792.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Prediction of Taxi Demand Using Recurrent Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082792/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Prediction of Taxi Demand Using Recurrent Neural Networks","volume":"19","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8082792/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17974419","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Prediction of Taxi Demand Using Recurrent Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tits-xu-2755684-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087222S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"8425132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"8425132","articleId":"8082792","onlineDate":"25 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-08"},{"_id":8082802,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Braunagel","affiliation":["RD/FAV Team \u201cCamera Systems\u201d, Daimler AG, Sindelfingen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5117645/8082769/8082802/8082802-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Braunagel received his M.Sc. degree in communications and computer engineering from the University of Ulm, Germany, in 2013.

However, there has been little effort made to transfer and integrate these findings into an automated system which classifies the driver's take-over readiness and derives the expected take-over quality. This study now introduces a new advanced driver assistance system to classify the driver's takeover readiness in conditionally automated driving scenarios. The proposed system works preemptively, i.e., the driver is warned in advance if a low take-over readiness is to be expected. The classification of the take-over readiness is based on three information sources: (i) the complexity of the traffic situation, (ii) the current secondary task of the driver, and (iii) the gazes at the road. An evaluation based on a driving simulator study with 81 subjects showed that the proposed system can detect the take-over readiness with an accuracy of 79%. Moreover, the impact of the character of the take-over intervention on the classification result is investigated. Finally, a proof of concept of the novel driver assistance system is provided showing that more than half of the drivers with a low take-over readiness would be warned preemptively with only a 13% false alarm rate.","doi":"10.1109/MITS.2017.2743165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MITS.2017.2743165","startPage":"10","endPage":"22","publicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/5117645/8082769/08082802.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8082769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ready for Take-Over?

This paper presents a novel coordination method for intersection management in a connected vehicle environment. The road network is divided into three logical sections, namely, buffer area, core area and free driving area. In addition, a buffer-assignment mechanism is developed to cooperatively assign a specific crossing span for an individual AV and guide each AV to adjust its entry time and corresponding speed in the core area. A set-projection algorithm and a three-segment linear speed profile are employed to control the trajectories of the AVs in the buffer area. Furthermore, the assignment failure handling process and the crossing rule for human-driven vehicles are advanced to enhance the practicability and reliability of the buffer-assignment mechanism. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by simulating various traffic conditions on an actual urban network. The simulation experiments and sensitivity analyses demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce 24.2%-77.1% of travel delays, decrease almost 99% of number of stops and improve the sustainability of the traffic system by saving 22.1%-52% of fuel consumption.","doi":"10.1109/MITS.2017.2743167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/5117645/8082769/08082807.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8082769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MITS.2017.2743167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous Vehicle-Intersection Coordination Method in a Connected Vehicle Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8082807","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"winter  2017","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous Vehicle-Intersection Coordination Method in a Connected Vehicle Environment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082807/","publicationDate":"winter 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17284389","htmlLink":"/document/8082807/","volume":"9","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous Vehicle-Intersection Coordination Method in a Connected Vehicle Environment","sourcePdf":"09mits04-lin-2743167-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150619S","chronDate":"winter  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5117645","isNumber":"8082769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5117645","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8082769","articleId":"8082807","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8082810,"authors":[{"name":"Dongkui Tan","affiliation":["Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5117645/8082769/8082810/8082810-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dongkui Tan received the B.Tech. and M.S. degrees from the Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

Firstly, a closed-loop driver-vehicle-road (DVR) system model is built up and the parameters of the system, consisting of vehicle states, positioning and road conditions, are initialized by random sampling. After simulating a large number of DVR systems with random parameters, the obtained results are used as samples to train a DFNN which predicts the forthcoming maximum lateral deviation and is optimized by employing deep learning method. Then, a LDP strategy is proposed by combining the DFNN with a driver activity index, which takes driver adaptation into consideration. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed lane departure warning algorithm can predict the lane departure event in time and reduce the false-warning rate of existing methods in a significant way. More importantly, the proposed technique enhances the system's functions of over-speed warning on curved road and over-steer warning on low-adhesion road.","doi":"10.1109/MITS.2017.2743204","startPage":"76","endPage":"90","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/5117645/8082769/08082810.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MITS.2017.2743204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8082769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Use of Monte-Carlo Simulation and Deep Fourier Neural Network in Lane Departure Warning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Monte Carlo methods","Prediction models","Road traffic","Vehicle dynamics","Vehicle driving","Closed loop systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alarm systems","computer vision","curve fitting","driver information systems","fuzzy neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","Monte Carlo methods","road safety","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lane departure prediction method","DFNN","closed-loop driver-vehicle-road system model","positioning","Monte-Carlo simulation","deep Fourier neural network","vision-based lane departure warning systems","LDP","DVR system model","road conditions","random sampling","maximum lateral deviation","driver activity index","driver adaptation","overspeed warning","curved road","oversteer warning","low-adhesion road","lane departure event","lane departure warning algorithm","deep learning method","DVR systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8082810/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"winter  2017","displayDocTitle":"On the Use of Monte-Carlo Simulation and Deep Fourier Neural Network in Lane Departure Warning","volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8082810/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"winter 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17284383","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Use of Monte-Carlo Simulation and Deep Fourier Neural Network in Lane Departure Warning","sourcePdf":"09mits04-tan-2743204-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06545S","chronDate":"winter  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5117645","isNumber":"8082769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5117645","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8082769","articleId":"8082810","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8083126,"authors":[{"name":"William J.

When multiple users are transmitting in the same environment, this detection becomes more difficult as the different signals can interfere with each other. To overcome this issue, CodeDivision Multiple Access (CDMA) can be used to obtain good auto-correlation and cross-correlation properties. In this work, a CDMA scheme is used to identify two Autonomous Underwater Vehicles by modulating a companion pair of Complementary Set of Sequences (CSS) in Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM). The detection is performed in two steps to obtain robustness against interferences, as well as to save computing time in a practical system. First, frame synchronization is obtained with a preamble, and next the arrival is validated and the emitter identified with the CSS, which is attached to the preamble. The results show that the correlation peaks of the CSS are easily detected even in challenging conditions of multipath, Doppler, noise and interference.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084574","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067435/8084562/08084574.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8084562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of acoustic signals based on OFDM modulated complementary set of sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8084574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8084574/","displayDocTitle":"Detection of acoustic signals based on OFDM modulated complementary set of sequences","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17290600","htmlLink":"/document/8084574/","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of acoustic signals based on OFDM modulated complementary set of sequences","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"161118003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052343S","chronDate":"19-22 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067435","isNumber":"8084562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067435","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8084562","articleId":"8084574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8084585,"authors":[{"name":"Xionghou Liu","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Electronic Information Control Laboratory, Chengdu, China","School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Poly technical University, China"],"firstName":"Xionghou","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085785695"},{"name":"Chao Sun","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Poly technical University, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086215177"},{"name":"Yixin Yang","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Poly technical University, China"],"firstName":"Yixin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085345483"},{"name":"Guangyu Jiang","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Poly technical University, China"],"firstName":"Guangyu","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086221154"},{"name":"Dezhi Kong","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Poly technical University, China"],"firstName":"Dezhi","lastName":"Kong","id":"37086222599"},{"name":"Lu Wang","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Poly technical University, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Wang","id":"38580797000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2111-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5279-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8084585","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"abstract":"The frequency diverse multiple-input multiple-output (FD-MIMO) sonar can use a group of small-bandwidth FD pulses to synthesize a large bandwidth signal, which brings a higher range resolution than traditional methods. However the range sidelobe level (SLL) is high due to the cross-correlation function (CCF) interferences and the spectrum leakage between auto-correlation functions (ACFs) of transmitting waveforms. To suppress the range SLL, we propose a multi-ping amplitude weighting method using a set of FD continuous wave (FDCW) pulses. In our method these FDCW pulses are divided into several groups, and each group is emitted in the corresponding ping. To suppress CCFs, the band gap between FDCW pulses transmitted in a ping is set to be relatively large. Furthermore, to suppress the spectrum leakage, the amplitude weights calculated via an optimization problem are applied to ACFs of all FDCW pulses. Via numerical simulations, we show the proposed method can suppress the range SLL of FD-MIMO sonar effectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067435/8084562/08084585.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8084562","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8084585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Range sidelobe suppression for FD-MIMO sonar imaging using multi-ping amplitude weighting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging","Bandwidth","Transmitters","Sonar equipment","Matched filters","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic wave interference","correlation methods","interference suppression","optimisation","sonar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDCW pulses","range sidelobe suppression","FD-MIMO sonar imaging","range sidelobe level","cross-correlation function interferences","frequency diverse multiple-input multiple-output sonar","cross-correlation function interference","autocorrelation functions spectrum leakage","multiping amplitude weighting method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sonar imaging","multiple-input multiple-output sonar","frequency diverse","range sidelobe suppression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8084585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Range sidelobe suppression for FD-MIMO sonar imaging using multi-ping amplitude weighting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8084585/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17290765","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Range sidelobe suppression for FD-MIMO sonar imaging using multi-ping amplitude weighting","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"161124007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076986S","chronDate":"19-22 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067435","isNumber":"8084562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067435","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8084562","articleId":"8084585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8084586,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Ifremer (French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea) and Institut Fresnel research lab have been investigating appropriate alternative solutions for PMTs in the context of underwater optical communications, and have for the first time used these new photodetector components for signal detection. A novel prototype of an optical modem based on SiPM receivers was realized with support from Osean SAS Co., a French instrumentation company. A number of lab experiments and sea trials in turbid waters and clear open sea were conducted using this modem to evaluate the practical interest of SiPMs. This paper studies the feasibility of using SiPMs for underwater optical communications. It outlines the description of the transmitter and the receiver of the modem prototype, the different techniques used to take advantage of this new technology and solutions to possible practical challenges. It also presents the methodology of the conducted sea trials and the performance evaluations in terms of range and data rate.","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067435/8084562/08084586.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8084562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084586","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084586","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8084586","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modems","Optical transmitters","Prototypes","Optical fiber communication","Photodetectors","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modems","oceanographic equipment","optical communication","optical variables measurement","photodetectors","photomultipliers","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater optical modem","highly sensitive silicon Photomultipliers","SiPMs","photomultiplier tubes","PMTs","time resolution","quantum-limited sensitivity","weak optical signals","French Research Institute","Institut Fresnel research lab","underwater optical communications","signal detection","SiPM receivers","French instrumentation company","clear open sea","modem prototype","conducted sea trials","French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea","hotodetector components","Co"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optical communications","underwater communications","Silicon photomultipliers","photomultiplier tubes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8084586/","displayDocTitle":"A new underwater optical modem based on highly sensitive Silicon Photomultipliers","accessionNumber":"17290778","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8084586/","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new underwater optical modem based on highly sensitive Silicon Photomultipliers","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"161125001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06351S","chronDate":"19-22 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067435","isNumber":"8084562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067435","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8084562","articleId":"8084586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8084589,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Xie","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Xie","id":"37086251827"},{"name":"Jiang Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37292438400"},{"name":"Shiliang Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology"],"firstName":"Shiliang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086252776"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2111-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5279-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8084589","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"abstract":"Communication security is a critical and increasingly challenging issue in wireless networks. Signals have the risk of being intercepted in traditional wireless communication because of the wireless propagation characteristics. There is also the same problem for ship satellite communication. The direct antenna modulation (DAM) is a promising secure communication technique, which scrambles signals in unwanted transmit spatial directions and can be implemented by phased array. As the DAM system model is established for the line of sight(LOS) propagation, it can also be applied to ship satellite communication. A two-dimension model is established in this paper. It is assumed that the DAM transmitter is mounted in the geostationary satellite. Usually, we expect that the legitimate receiver in the cooperative ship has a good demodulation performance while the illegitimate receiver in other places can hardly decrypt the data symbols correctly. A synthesis approach of direct phased array modulation based on NSGA-II algorithm is proposed in this paper. With the knowledge of legitimate and illegitimate receiver's directions, appropriate phase shifts can be synthesized for the secure communication scene mentioned above.

However, the array gain of the DAS method is limited, and is restricted to the array aperture. To tackle this problem, we propose a DAS method based on the diagonal reducing method in the data covariance matrix. Firstly, a reducing value is subtracted from the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix, so as to reduce the noise. As a consequence, a new covariance matrix includes less noise component. Then, the DAS method is applied using this new covariance matrix to obtain the beam output, and we can obtain high array gain when compared with the traditional DAS method. The analytic solution and approximate solution of reducing value are obtained under the constraint condition that the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) attains its maximum. The simulation and the experimental results show that the diagonal reducing method reduces some ambient noise, the output array gain is increased.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8084592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17290664","htmlLink":"/document/8084592/","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Delay-and-sum beamforming based on the diagonal reducing method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-and-sum beamforming based on the diagonal reducing method","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"161128001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049573S","chronDate":"19-22 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067435","isNumber":"8084562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067435","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8084562","articleId":"8084592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8084623,"authors":[{"name":"Xuan Li","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustics, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Li","id":"37086223252"},{"name":"Xiaochuan Ma","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustics, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaochuan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085444918"},{"name":"Mojiang Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustics, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mojiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086215753"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2111-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5279-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8084623","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Sonar","Array signal processing","Direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO radar","Estimation","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","MIMO radar","radar antennas","radar receivers","radar transmitters","sonar signal processing","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receiver","closely spaced antennas","multiple independent waveforms","subarray number","wave diversity","direction index","bistatic MIMO sonar system","subarrary waveform diversity","MIMO radar","sonar transmitter","transmitting array","SNR","beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","transmitting beamforming","subarray"]}],"abstract":"A design for MIMO sonar system based on subarrary and waveform diversity is proposed in this paper. Similar to co-located MIMO radar, the sonar transmitter and receiver are both closely spaced antennas. Different from the original co-located MIMO sonar, our scheme partitions the transmitting array into several subarrays. Multiple independent waveforms would be transmitted by each subarray, and the system's orthogonal dimension would decrease from element number to subarray number. In an appropriate steering range, a bank of transmitting beamforming in each subarray is operated to obtain array gain. It's a balanced construction by taking a compromise between wave diversity and direction index.

With large datasets, deep learning methods have been applied with great success to the image recognition of objects in the air. However, it has been observed that deep neural networks (DNNs) easily suffer from overfitting with small samples. Underwater image acquisition always requires much manpower and costs a lot, which makes it difficult to obtain enough sample images for training DNNs. Besides, images captured by underwater cameras are usually deteriorated by noise. Taking live fish recognition as an example, we proposed a framework for underwater image recognition in small sample size situations. First, a novel improved median filter was utilized to suppress noise of fish images. Then, a convolutional neural network was employed and pre-trained with images from the world's largest image recognition database-ImageNet. Finally, preprocessed fish images were used to fine tune the pre-trained neural network and test the classification performance. Experimental results showed that the approach is capable of recognizing fish species, which provides an effective way for solving recognition tasks in small sample size situations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8084645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17303438","htmlLink":"/document/8084645/","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Deep learning for underwater image recognition in small sample size situations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep learning for underwater image recognition in small sample size situations","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"161130028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033703S","chronDate":"19-22 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067435","isNumber":"8084562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067435","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8084562","articleId":"8084645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8084693,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 A.

Among them is the strict limited communication ability of local sensors due to constrained bandwidth as well as energy, and the severe synchronization error among sensors which makes data fusion in the fusion center (FC) difficult. To solve the above problems to some extent, a sequential distributed detection (SDD) scheme based on level-triggered sampling (LTS) mechanism is proposed. In the LTS-SDD scheme, sequential test method is applied in both sensors and the FC, then the distributed detection system works with asynchronous sampling among sensors and low-speed communication between sensors and the FC. Though potential, the proposed scheme faced some unaddressed challenges when used in practical underwater distributed detection system, which are also discussed in the paper. To validate the suggested scheme, distributed detection of weak single frequency signal via UWSN is studied under some assumptions. Corresponding simulation results show that the LTS-SDD scheme works well and its error performance as well as average decision delay performance is superior to sequential detection (SD) scheme with single sensor.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084700","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067435/8084562/08084700.pdf","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8084562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential distributed detection via level-triggered sampling in underwater wireless sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Sequential distributed detection via level-triggered sampling in underwater wireless sensor networks","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8084700/","accessionNumber":"17290524","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8084700/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential distributed detection via level-triggered sampling in underwater wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"161130113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057686S","chronDate":"19-22 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067435","isNumber":"8084562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067435","xplore-issue":"8084562","articleId":"8084700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8084706,"authors":[{"name":"Takuya Shimura","affiliation":["Acoustics and telecommunication group, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuya","lastName":"Shimura","id":"37415552300"},{"name":"Yukihiro Kida","affiliation":["Acoustics and telecommunication group, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukihiro","lastName":"Kida","id":"37086251989"},{"name":"Mitsuyasu Deguchi","affiliation":["Acoustics and telecommunication group, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Mitsuyasu","lastName":"Deguchi","id":"37085460157"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2111-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5279-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8084706","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":302},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","OFDM","MIMO","Receivers","Underwater acoustics","Signal to noise ratio","Focusing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","equalisers","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","MIMO communication","space division multiplexing","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output communication","channel equalization","intersymbol interference compensation","space division multiplexing","underwater acoustic channel","underwater acoustic communication","MIMO underwater communication","high-rate MIMO communication","adaptive time reversal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["time reversal","phase conjugate","underwater acoustic communication","MIMO","spatial division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"Time reversal is an effective method for channel equalization in underwater acoustic communication.

Results of this study include power budget and channel impulse response estimated using different phase functions (Petzold, OTHG, TTHG and SS) and other optical parameters for the cases of harbor waters. Comparison of these results establishes the importance of using an accurate phase function in channel modeling of UOWC systems. Furthermore, comparison with the model based on Beer's law establishes the advantage of considering the finite probability of receiving scattered photons at the receiver end. Our finding reveals that estimation of power loss considering extinction coefficient as in Beer's law severely underestimates the received power, leading to shorter communication range especially in turbid harbor waters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on the effect of scattering properties of marine particles on underwater optical wireless communication channel characteristics","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084720","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067435/8084562/08084720.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8084562","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8084720","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8084720/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"A study on the effect of scattering properties of marine particles on underwater optical wireless communication channel characteristics","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8084720/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17303454","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on the effect of scattering properties of marine particles on underwater optical wireless communication channel characteristics","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"161201015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072818S","chronDate":"19-22 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067435","isNumber":"8084562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067435","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8084562","articleId":"8084720","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8084727,"authors":[{"name":"Per Zetterberg","affiliation":["FOI, Swedish Defence Research Agency, Stockholm, SWEDEN"],"firstName":"Per","lastName":"Zetterberg","id":"37270124800"},{"name":"Magnus Lundberg Nordenvaad","affiliation":["FOI, Swedish Defence Research Agency, Stockholm, SWEDEN"],"firstName":"Magnus Lundberg","lastName":"Nordenvaad","id":"37391956100"},{"name":"Bernt Nilsson","affiliation":["FOI, Swedish Defence Research Agency, Stockholm, SWEDEN"],"firstName":"Bernt","lastName":"Nilsson","id":"37902467000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2111-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5279-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8084727","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Synchronization","Doppler effect","Channel estimation","Demodulation","Payloads","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","frequency modulation","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation","synchronisation","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["null subcarriers","signal acquisition","channel estimation","hyperbolic frequency modulated signal","ICI","inter-carrier interference","OFDM","null subcarreries"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose and analyze a new approach for synchronization of OFDM based underwater communication systems with significant Doppler spread. In order to keep cyclic prefix overhead low - long OFDM symbols are needed which in turn leads to significant inter-carrier interference (ICI). For signal acquisition and synchronization we propose the use of a special OFDM symbol which has regions of null subcarriers i.e. subcarriers where no power is transmitted but also still has subcarriers for channel estimation and payload data. By estimating the signal to noise ratio on candidate demodulation positions we can calculate a \u201cwould-be\u201d signal to noise ratio by adding up the power on the active subcarriers and dividing it by the power in the null subcarriers. By only using the inner subcarriers in a region of null subcarreries resistance against Doppler spread is achieved. We optimize and compare the proposed solution against a base-line solution which uses a pre-amble with a hyperbolic frequency modulated signal. We find our solution to compare well and present bit error rate and frame error rate results on a complete system which uses our proposed acquisition and synchronization scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization of OFDM with null subcarriers in channels with significant ICI","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084727","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067435/8084562/08084727.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8084562","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8084727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8084727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization of OFDM with null subcarriers in channels with significant ICI","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8084727/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17290815","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization of OFDM with null subcarriers in channels with significant ICI","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"161201027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050498S","chronDate":"19-22 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067435","isNumber":"8084562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067435","xplore-issue":"8084562","articleId":"8084727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8084732,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Michael Wolff","affiliation":["University of Applied Sciences Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Lars Michael","lastName":"Wolff","id":"38468062400"},{"name":"Sabah Badri-Hoeher","affiliation":["University of Applied Sciences Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Sabah","lastName":"Badri-Hoeher","id":"38182754800"},{"name":"Sebastian Noack","affiliation":["University of Applied Sciences Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Noack","id":"37086243037"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2111-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5279-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8084732","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8084732","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Discrete Fourier transforms","Niobium","Distance measurement","Frequency shift keying","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic transducers","frequency hop communication","frequency shift keying","software radio","system-on-chip","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["severe multipath propagation","FH-FSK","acoustic transducers","bitwise ranging","underwater acoustic communication","Goertzel algorithm","autonomous underwater vehicle","communication channel","world coordinates","vehicles dead reckoning","relative position","frequency hopped frequency shift keying","software defined radio","SDR","system on chip","frequency hopped FSK"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Underwater acoustics","Underwater communication","Frequency shift keying","Software radio"]}],"doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084732","endPage":"6","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067435/8084562/08084732.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8084562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bitwise ranging through underwater acoustic communication with frequency hopped FSK utilizing the Goertzel algorithm","abstract":"Acoustic communication is the most common technique to communicate with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) during its mission.

In this work, a version of FH-FSK is realized as a software defined radio (SDR) on a system on chip, that is connected to the peripherals necessary to transmit and receive signals via acoustic transducers. Besides the communication capabilities, we demonstrate the application of this modulation scheme to ranging for each transmitted data bit.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8084732/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8084732/","accessionNumber":"17290536","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Bitwise ranging through underwater acoustic communication with frequency hopped FSK utilizing the Goertzel algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bitwise ranging through underwater acoustic communication with frequency hopped FSK utilizing the Goertzel algorithm","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"161201037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049195S","chronDate":"19-22 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067435","isNumber":"8084562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067435","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8084562","articleId":"8084732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8084760,"authors":[{"name":"R.

These nodules possess high economic potential as they are rich in minerals such as manganese, nickel, copper and rare earth elements. Quantification of nodule coverage is important for economic feasibility studies and planning of effective exploitation strategies. Traditional methods for nodule quantification are highly labour and time intensive as they rely on freefall box corer measurements and/or image processing of seabed photographs. Using sidescan sonar data and geotagged photographs collected from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in our region of interest at CCFZ, we propose a novel technique based on artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate PMN abundance using texture variations from sidescan sonar data. Compared to an optical camera, the sidescan sonar provides a much larger area of coverage, which in effect can drastically increase the area surveyed by an AUV in a given amount of time. Till date, this is the first known published work to elaborate on a data-driven approach in estimating PMN abundance using sidescan sonar backscatter data. Our network yielded a test accuracy of 84%, which shows that it can be used as an effective tool in estimating nodule abundance from sidescan sonar. This approach allows faster evaluation of nodule abundance for future exploration without the need for an underwater camera.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8084857/","accessionNumber":"17290463","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8084857/","publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Polymetallic nodules abundance estimation using sidescan sonar: A quantitative approach using artificial neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polymetallic nodules abundance estimation using sidescan sonar: A quantitative approach using artificial neural network","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"170113001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053197S","chronDate":"19-22 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067435","isNumber":"8084562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067435","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8084562","articleId":"8084857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8084858,"authors":[{"name":"Shaohao Zhu","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Shaohao","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085808818"},{"name":"Yixin Yang","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Yixin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085345483"},{"name":"Yong Wang","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Wang","id":"38241244600"},{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Li","id":"37085770067"},{"name":"Huijun Xia","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Huijun","lastName":"Xia","id":"37085775563"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2111-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5279-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8084858","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Array signal processing","Covariance matrices","Robustness","Wideband","Sonar equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","hydrophones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circular hydrophone array","direction-of-arrival estimation","eigenbeam decomposition","synthesis theory","frequency-invariant beampatterns","robust DOA estimations","low order ones","DOA method","high-order superdirective beamforming","reduced-rank technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","eigenbeam decomposition and synthesis","high angular resolution"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a method of direction-of-arrival estimation using the high-order superdirective beamforming for a circular hydrophone array. The weighting vectors with different orders used for DOA estimation can be obtained using the previously proposed eigenbeam decomposition and synthesis theory, which can provide frequency-invariant beampatterns in a wide frequency band. The DOA estimation result of this method is the sum of estimations with different orders and the robustness decreases with an increase of the number of order. The reduced-rank technique is applied to achieve robust DOA estimations by truncating some error-intolerable high order estimation results and reserving the low order ones. Simulation results show that the DOA method proposed in this paper can improve the angular resolution (when the sensor space to wavelength ratio is smaller than 1/2) compared to the conventional beamforming (CBF) method. An experiment was conducted in the South China Sea with a 12-hydrophone circular array, and the results show effectiveness and validity of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084858","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067435/8084562/08084858.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8084562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084858","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direction-of-arrival estimation using high-order superdirective beamforming for a circular hydrophone array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8084858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Direction-of-arrival estimation using high-order superdirective beamforming for a circular hydrophone array","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8084858/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8084858/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17303443","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction-of-arrival estimation using high-order superdirective beamforming for a circular hydrophone array","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"170113002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074846S","chronDate":"19-22 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067435","isNumber":"8084562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067435","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8084562","articleId":"8084858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8084863,"authors":[{"name":"Pierre-Jean Bouvet","affiliation":["ISEN / YNCREA Ouest, SEACom lab, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Pierre-Jean","lastName":"Bouvet","id":"37270330700"},{"name":"Yves Auffret","affiliation":["ISEN / YNCREA Ouest, SEACom lab, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Auffret","id":"37887808900"},{"name":"Clement Aubry","affiliation":["ISEN / YNCREA Ouest, SEACom lab, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Clement","lastName":"Aubry","id":"37086227252"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2111-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5279-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8084863","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":459},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8084863","abstract":"This paper describes the use of the novel Orthogonal Chirp Division Multiplex (OCDM) waveform for an end-to-end high data rate underwater acoustic transmission system.

In recent years, vector sensors have been widely used in sonar equipment. Compared with sound pressure array, vector array can be used to expand array aperture to improve processing gain, and overcome the problem of left and right ambiguity. Adaptive beamforming (MVDR) has good resolution and interference suppression if the steering vector of the acoustic array is unbiased and a sufficient \u201csnapshot\u201d can be obtained for covariance matrix estimation. In practice, for a long array sonar observation data it is often inadequate (especially in the fast-moving target detection at close range should be chosen to make short-term window integral). In addition, the steering vector error caused by various causes will also degrade the performance of the adaptive beamforming algorithm. RCB is a promising robust adaptive beamforming algorithm. The algorithm directly links the calculation of adaptive diagonal element loading factor with the error of steering vector, which is easy to be operated and avoids the arbitrariness of other tolerance algorithms in the calculation of loading. In this paper, an improved RCB algorithm based on vector long linear array is proposed based on RCB algorithm. The algorithm performs the singular value decomposition of the data matrix, avoids the covariance matrix of the incomplete rank, and reduces the amount of computation and storage. The algorithm is insensitive to the steering vector mismatch and can estimate the target azimuth rapidly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8084891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17303433","htmlLink":"/document/8084891/","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Study on robust adaptive beamforming based on acoustic vector sensor array","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on robust adaptive beamforming based on acoustic vector sensor array","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"170115011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101614S","chronDate":"19-22 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067435","isNumber":"8084562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067435","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8084562","articleId":"8084891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8084921,"authors":[{"name":"B.-S.

The proposed scheme first chooses a number G, (e.g. G = 4, 6, 8) as the size of each group and then conducts the MMSE detectors to facilitate symbol detection group by group. In particular, instead of directly using huge computational complexity to compute the MMSE detectors, the proposed scheme recursively finds the corresponding assistant matrices to determine the groups and calculate the MMSE detectors. As a result, the transmitted symbols can be recursively estimated group by group. Finally, simulation results and complexity analysis show the proposed scheme outperforms the existing methods, while using lower computational complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067435/8084562/08084921.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8084562","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8084921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Symbol Detection for Massive G-STBC MIMOs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Computational complexity","Detectors","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","least mean squares methods","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast symbol detection scheme","massive G-STBC MIMO systems","MMSE detectors","symbol detection group","transmitted symbols","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8084921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Fast Symbol Detection for Massive G-STBC MIMOs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8084921/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17290523","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Symbol Detection for Massive G-STBC MIMOs","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"170116005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078006S","chronDate":"19-22 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067435","isNumber":"8084562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067435","xplore-issue":"8084562","articleId":"8084921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8084961,"authors":[{"name":"Xiu Li","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen"],"firstName":"Xiu","lastName":"Li","id":"38667875300"},{"name":"Youhua Tang","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen"],"firstName":"Youhua","lastName":"Tang","id":"37086065965"},{"name":"Tingwei Gao","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen"],"firstName":"Tingwei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37086060147"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2111-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5279-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8084961","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":686},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Fish","Proposals","Training","Convolution","Neural networks","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","neural nets","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fish detection","underwater images","automatic accurate object detection","lightweight neural network","faster R-CNN network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fish detection","PVA net","deep learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8084961","abstract":"The explosive growth of the underwater images make the demand for automatic accurate object detection more and more urgent.

As a critical technique, accurate attitude control is challenging due to the highly nonlinear, heavily coupled system model of an underwater glider with uncertain hydrodynamic parameters and suffering from environmental disturbances. To investigate this problem, a dynamic inversion-based nonlinear model reference adaptive controller is designed in this paper. The pseudo control, as the desired acceleration, is constructed by a proportional-derivative (PD) controller and an adaptive controller, and a single-hidden layer (SHL) neural network is employed to compensate for dynamic uncertainties of gliders. The actual control signal is derived by the pseudo control through the dynamic inversion of the approximate model. The attitude tracking error is proved to be ultimately uniformly bounded using a Lyapunov-based method. To avoid the possible failure of neural network training caused by actuator saturation and inner dynamics, a pseudo control hedging signal is added to the reference model as the amount of the pseudo control that cannot be achieved due to actuator saturation and dynamics. Finally, the diving and surfacing maneuvering of a glider is simulated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive neural network attitude controller.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084963","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067435/8084562/08084963.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8084562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pseudo control hedging-based adaptive neural network attitude control of underwater gliders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8084963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Pseudo control hedging-based adaptive neural network attitude control of underwater gliders","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17290475","publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8084963/","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pseudo control hedging-based adaptive neural network attitude control of underwater gliders","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"170116070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061129S","chronDate":"19-22 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067435","isNumber":"8084562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067435","xplore-issue":"8084562","articleId":"8084963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8084964,"authors":[{"name":"Caijie Qian","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Caijie","lastName":"Qian","id":"37086253149"},{"name":"Zhenduo Wang","affiliation":["Ocean College, Zhejiang University, Zhoushan, China"],"firstName":"Zhenduo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085374760"},{"name":"Xuesong Lu","affiliation":["Ocean College, Zhejiang University, Zhoushan, China"],"firstName":"Xuesong","lastName":"Lu","id":"37086259768"},{"name":"Yezhou Wu","affiliation":["Ocean College, Zhejiang University, Zhoushan, China"],"firstName":"Yezhou","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086253800"},{"name":"Fengzhong Qu","affiliation":["Ocean College, Zhejiang University, Zhoushan, China"],"firstName":"Fengzhong","lastName":"Qu","id":"37410299300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2111-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5279-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8084964","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8084964","abstract":"Underwater acoustic (UWA) communications are major tools for wireless data transmission in underwater environment. In recent years, multicarrier modulation has become one of the dominating methods in mitigating the time-delay and Doppler doubly-spread UWA acoustic channel. In this paper, one of the multicarrier modulations called filtered multitone (FMT) is proposed for UWA communications which splits the transmission bandwidth into several subbands with negligible inter-carrier interference (ICI). Considering the UWA channel model, a sparse structure that parameterizing the amplitude variation and delay variation of each path with polynomial approximation is investigated. Based on this structure, the channel estimation problem is transformed into estimating the parameter sets, e.g., delay spread and Doppler sc for each path, which characterize the UWA channel. After the construction of the estimation templates, orthogonal matching pursuits (OMP) algorithm which belongs to compressive sensing is adopt in this work for sparse channel estimation. The performance of the FMT sparse channel estimation for UWA communications is evaluated via numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8084562","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067435/8084562/08084964.pdf","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse channel estimation for filtered multitone in underwater communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Doppler effect","Delays","Modulation","OFDM","Matching pursuit algorithms","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","compressed sensing","Doppler shift","filtering theory","intercarrier interference","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","polynomial approximation","underwater acoustic communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler doubly-spread UWA acoustic channel","orthogonal matching pursuits algorithm","OMP algorithm","polynomial approximation","delay variation","amplitude variation","sparse structure","UWA channel model","negligible inter-carrier interference","transmission bandwidth","time-delay","multicarrier modulation","underwater environment","wireless data transmission","underwater acoustic communications","filtered multitone","UWA communications","FMT sparse channel estimation","estimation templates","delay spread","channel estimation problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Underwater acoustic (UWA) communications","filtered-multiton (FMT)","sparse channel estimation","parameterization","orthogonal matching pursuits (OMP)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Sparse channel estimation for filtered multitone in underwater communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8084964/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8084964/","accessionNumber":"17303434","publicationDate":"June 2017","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse channel estimation for filtered multitone in underwater communications","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"170116073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074555S","chronDate":"19-22 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067435","isNumber":"8084562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067435","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8084562","articleId":"8084964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8084965,"authors":[{"name":"Naushad Ansari","affiliation":["Deptt. of ECE, IIIT-Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Naushad","lastName":"Ansari","id":"37085472266"},{"name":"Ananya Sen Gupta","affiliation":["Deptt. of ECE, University of Iowa, USA"],"firstName":"Ananya Sen","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37085556287"},{"name":"Anubha Gupta","affiliation":["Deptt. of ECE, IIIT-Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Anubha","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37085376557"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2111-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5279-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8084965","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8084965","abstract":"This paper proposes estimation of underwater acoustic channel in the delay-Doppler domain under dynamic sea conditions.

Two of the most prevalent toxins from fresh and brackish water blooms are the cyclic peptide toxins of the microcystin family, formed from cyanobacterial, and the kainic acid analog neurotoxin known as domoic acid. There is therefore a significant need for constant and cost-effective `on-site' algal-toxin monitoring to respond to constantly increasing demand for safe and `toxin-free' freshwater, shellfish and fish stocks. Herein, we describe a Lab-On-A-Disc (LOAD) platform which was developed to assess microcystin and domoic acid concentration levels in-situ.

Understanding the physical processes which drive ultrasound transducer self heating requires characterisation of the internal energy loss mechanisms. This study focuses on the energy loss mechanisms of the active part of the transducer, the piezoelectric component. A method which involves a 3D FEM model nested within an iterative simulated annealing scheme which determines the material parameters, including the energy loss parameters, is used to characterise a piezoelectric rod. This type of piezoelectric structure is commonly used in underwater transducers. A cost function is used to compare the difference between the measured electrical admittance and the modelled electrical admittance. The choice of the cost function used has an impact on which material parameters the method is able to optimise efficiently. In the case of the cost function used in this study, the method is successful at characterising the real values of the material constants. However, a more tailored cost function is needed to characterise the loss tangents successfully.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","pdfPath":"/iel7/8067435/8084562/08084983.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen","doi":"10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8084562","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8084983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterising piezoelectric material parameters through a 3D FEM and optimisation algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cost function","Transducers","Admittance","Tensile stress","Finite element analysis","Dielectric losses","Piezoelectric materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric admittance","finite element analysis","piezoelectric materials","piezoelectric transducers","piezoelectricity","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["piezoelectric material parameters","optimisation algorithm","underwater transducers","ultrasound transducer","internal energy loss mechanisms","3D FEM model","annealing scheme","energy loss parameters","piezoelectric rod","loss tangents","electrical admittance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8084983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Characterising piezoelectric material parameters through a 3D FEM and optimisation algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8084983/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17290825","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterising piezoelectric material parameters through a 3D FEM and optimisation algorithm","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"170116102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047236S","chronDate":"19-22 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067435","isNumber":"8084562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067435","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8084562","articleId":"8084983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8085004,"authors":[{"name":"T.

To achieve this goal, one milestone is to give the AUV the capability to track the diver's whereabouts at all times. Inertial sensors are mounted on the diver's body to transmit acoustically his relative position and orientation to the AUV using an Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL) system. However, the acoustic system is prone to give erroneous data depending on the surrounding geography, modems alignment and sensors calibration, plus its low transmission rate does not allow real time performance. To overcome these drawbacks and complement the acoustic set-up, this paper presents a general framework to detect and estimate the diver's body pose based on generated point clouds from a stereo camera. Our method is based on a Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) that captures the temporal relations between global point cloud descriptors as they change with the diver movements. Since the analysis is made on time sequences rather than on one-shot visual information, the framework is robust against the distortions and poor quality typical in underwater while still providing real time performance. We focus on the description of the image-processing and LSTM-RNN pipeline, as well on its validation with a dataset created during several field trial experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17303467","htmlLink":"/document/8085020/","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Stereo-vision based diver pose estimation using LSTM recurrent neural networks for AUV navigation guidance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stereo-vision based diver pose estimation using LSTM recurrent neural networks for AUV navigation guidance","confLoc":"Aberdeen, UK","sourcePdf":"170117004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080273S","chronDate":"19-22 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8067435","isNumber":"8084562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8067435","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8084562","articleId":"8085020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8085055,"authors":[{"name":"Tri Duong","affiliation":["Department of Natural Science and Mathematics, University of Houston, Houston, Texas, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Tri","lastName":"Duong","id":"37086217158"},{"name":"Michael McGuigan","affiliation":["Computational Science Initiative, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"McGuigan","id":"37275865800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3161-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3162-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8085055","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Carbon","Persistent currents","Graphene","Entropy","Solid modeling","Three-dimensional displays","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C++ language","carbon","data visualisation","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","entropy","magnetic flux","materials science computing","matrix algebra","molecular dynamics method","nanostructured materials","nanotechnology","persistent currents","tight-binding calculations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacency matrix","nanomaterials properties","finite temperature","flux potential","free energy","nanomaterial structures","higher genus carbon nanomaterials","computational nanoscience","electrical properties","chemical properties","toroidal topology","magnetic flux","molecular editing","visual molecular dynamics","visualization","persistent current","entanglement entropy","quantum structures","C++ code","eigenvalues"]}],"abstract":"The goal of this project is to explore computational nanoscience.

To further improve the performance of HDD/SSD hybrid storage systems, data migration schemes have been put forward to migrate the sequential data between HDD and SSD. However, the existing schemes cannot be aware of dirty data in the buffer and then incur a large number of unnecessary page migrations. In this paper, we devise an efficient data migration scheme considering dying data for HDD/SSD hybrid storage systems. In this scheme, a new liveness state, called the dying state, is utilized to identify the live data, which will become dead shortly due to its corresponding dirty version in the buffer. To decrease the page migration count, this scheme uses the benefit-to-cost ratio to select a block for data migration and copies the up-to-date version of dying data into the free space instead of migrating the dying data. Our experimental results show that our proposed scheme can perform better than existing data migration schemes that are not aware of dying data under various benchmarks.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766667","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08085094.pdf","startPage":"23366","endPage":"23373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Sequential Data Migration Scheme Considering Dying Data for HDD/SSD Hybrid Storage Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8085094","topic":"Sequential Data Modeling and Its Emerging Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Sequential Data Migration Scheme Considering Dying Data for HDD/SSD Hybrid Storage Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085094/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17381177","htmlLink":"/document/8085094/","volume":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61502102 and 61402109"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003392","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Fujian province, China","grantNumber":"2016J05149 and 2015J05120"},{"fundingName":"Distinguished Young Scientific Research Talent Training Plan in Universities of Fujian province (2017, 2015)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Efficient Sequential Data Migration Scheme Considering Dying Data for HDD/SSD Hybrid Storage Systems","sourcePdf":"access-lin-2766667-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106456S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Sequential Data Modeling and Its Emerging Applications"],"articleId":"8085094","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8085096,"authors":[{"name":"Min-Ki Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8085096/jeon-2766671-small.gif","p":["Min-Ki Jeon received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2010, 2012, and 2017, respectively, all in electronic engineering.

Most indoor localization schemes focus on determining the exact position of these sensors. This paper presents a zoning-based tracking technique that works efficiently in indoor environments. The targeted area is composed of several zones, the objective being to determine the zone of the mobile sensor in a real time tracking process. The proposed method creates a belief functions framework that combines evidence using the sensors mobility and observations. To do this, a mobility model is proposed by using the previous state of the sensor and its assumed maximum speed. Also, an observation model is constructed based on fingerprints collected as Wi-Fi signals strengths received from surrounding access points. This model can be extended via hierarchical clustering and access point selection. Real experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and its competence compared with state-of-the-art methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking of Mobile Sensors Using Belief

The best possible tradeoff in terms of cost-effectiveness, nonlinearity, pumping efficiency, optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR), and tolerance to relative intensity noise transfer varies depending on characteristics, such as total transmission length, desirable number of spans or power budget requirements. Here, we perform a thorough experimental and theoretical study of the best performing configurations for second-order amplification over a broad range of applications, with span lengths ranging from 10 to 150 km. Results highlight the presence of different regimes in which different contributions to noise become dominant. We find that ultralong Raman fiber laser cells with high forward pumping are to be preferred in unrepeatered transmission applications, whereas in long-haul transmission a shorter cell based on random distributed feedback lasing can be a better option as it enables low relative intensity noise transfer with a higher output OSNR at the cost of a reduced pumping efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2766685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2766685","startPage":"4967","endPage":"4972","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8093713/08085102.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8093713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission Span Optimization in Fiber Systems With Cavity and Random Distributed Feedback Ultralong Raman Laser Amplification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15, 15 2017","displayDocTitle":"Transmission Span Optimization in Fiber Systems With Cavity and Random Distributed Feedback Ultralong Raman Laser Amplification","publicationDate":"15 Nov.15, 2017","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2017","volume":"35","issue":"22","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8085102/","accessionNumber":"17352822","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085102/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7","grantNumber":"608099"},{"fundingName":"Programme H2020","grantNumber":"748767"},{"fundingName":"Spanish MINECO","grantNumber":"TEC2015-71127-C2"},{"fundingName":"Comunidad de Madrid","grantNumber":"S2013/MIT-2790-SINFOTON-CM"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission Span Optimization in Fiber Systems With Cavity and Random Distributed Feedback Ultralong Raman Laser Amplification","sourcePdf":"jlt-rizzelli-2766685-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060967S","chronDate":"Nov.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8093713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8093713","articleId":"8085102","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8085104,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Sheikh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Alireza Sheikh (S\u201915) was born in Mashhad, Iran, in 1989.

In particular, we consider hard decision decoding, which is the preferable option for fiber-optic communication systems where decoding complexity is a concern. Recently, Liga et al. analyzed the AIRs for bitwise and symbolwise decoders considering what the authors called hard decision decoder, which, however, exploits soft information of the transition probabilities of discrete-input discrete-output channel resulting from the hard detection. As such, the complexity of the decoder is essentially the same as the complexity of a soft decision decoder. In this paper, we analyze instead the AIRs for the standard hard decision decoder, commonly used in practice, where the decoding is based on the Hamming distance metric. We show that if standard hard decision decoding is used, bitwise decoders yield significantly higher AIRs than the symbolwise decoders. As a result, contrary to the conclusion by Liga et al., binary decoders together with the BICM paradigm are preferable for spectrally efficient fiber-optic systems. We also design binary and nonbinary staircase codes and show that, in agreement with the AIRs, binary codes yield better performance.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2766978","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8114351/08085104.pdf","startPage":"5069","endPage":"5078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2766978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8114351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achievable Information Rates for Coded Modulation With Hard Decision Decoding for Coherent Fiber-Optic Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8085104","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1, 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085104/","displayDocTitle":"Achievable Information Rates for Coded Modulation With Hard Decision Decoding for Coherent Fiber-Optic Systems","volume":"35","issue":"23","publicationDate":"1 Dec.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"17372093","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8085104/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004063","fundingName":"Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Swedish Research Council","grantNumber":"2016-04253"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable Information Rates for Coded Modulation With Hard Decision Decoding for Coherent Fiber-Optic Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-sheikh-2766978-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071637S","chronDate":"Dec.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8114351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8114351","articleId":"8085104","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8085106,"authors":[{"name":"Jinho Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8225762/8085106/choi-2766778-small.gif","p":["Jinho Choi (SM\u201902) was born in Seoul, South Korea.

Thus, NOMA is usually employed for coordinated transmissions and mostly applied to downlink transmissions where a base station performs coordination for downlink transmissions with full channel state information. In this paper, however, we show that NOMA can also be employed for non-coordinated transmissions such as random access for uplink transmissions. We apply a NOMA scheme to multichannel ALOHA and show that the throughput can be improved.

In this paper, we derive simplified and unified mathematical formulations for inter-modulo operations, such as sign detection, magnitude comparison, scaling signed integers, and signed reverse conversion, grounded on the pillars of reverse conversion. These formulations, which cover a whole range of sets, with 3 to 5 moduli, are used to design components that when integrated allow the design of efficient complete multifunctional units, reusing blocks to perform several RNS intermodulo operations. Not only have the proposed individual components been compared with related art, but a configuration of the proposed multifunctional unit has also been implemented in application specific integrated circuits. Experimental results show that the multifunctional unit is significantly more area and power effective than the other solutions proposed in the state of the art, and the performance of the individual components compare well with dedicated ones. The novel multifunctional units are thus a further step toward the integration of RNS systems on constrained systems.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766841","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08085113.pdf","startPage":"25972","endPage":"25986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multifunctional Unit for Designing Efficient RNS-Based Datapaths","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Multifunctional Unit for Designing Efficient RNS-Based Datapaths","volume":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8085113/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17496762","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085113/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Funds through FCT","grantNumber":"UID/CEC/50021/2013"},{"fundingName":"FCT for the Ph.D. Scholarship","grantNumber":"SFRH/BD/103791/2014"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Multifunctional Unit for Designing Efficient RNS-Based Datapaths","sourcePdf":"access-sabbaghmolahosseini-2766841-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151846S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8085113","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8085115,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan T.

We show that the primary sources of computational errors that arise from the use of the NFT is the finite eigenvalue resolution of the left and the right reflection spectra. We show that this effect and, consequently, the computational cost of the NFT as a nonlinear mitigation technique in the normal dispersion regime increases exponentially or faster with both the channel power and the number of symbols per data frame even using the most efficient NFT algorithms that are currently known. We find that the computational cost of this approach becomes unacceptably large at data frame lengths and powers that are too small for this approach to be competitive with standard transmission methods. We explain the physical reasons for these limits.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2766622","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8114351/08085115.pdf","startPage":"5056","endPage":"5068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2766622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8114351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Compensation in Optical Communications Systems With Normal Dispersion Fibers Using the Nonlinear Fourier Transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085115/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1, 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Compensation in Optical Communications Systems With Normal Dispersion Fibers Using the Nonlinear Fourier Transform","volume":"35","issue":"23","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Dec.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"17372092","htmlLink":"/document/8085115/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ciena Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Compensation in Optical Communications Systems With Normal Dispersion Fibers Using the Nonlinear Fourier Transform","sourcePdf":"jlt-lima-2766622-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087842S","chronDate":"Dec.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8114351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8114351","articleId":"8085115","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8085118,"authors":[{"name":"Bienvenu Ndagano","affiliation":["School of Physics, University of the Witwatersrand, Wits, South Africa"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Bienvenu","lastName":"Ndagano","orcid":"0000-0002-8063-6185","id":"37086292208"},{"name":"Isaac Nape","affiliation":["School of Physics, University of the Witwatersrand, Wits, South Africa"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Isaac","lastName":"Nape","id":"37086287599"},{"name":"Mitchell A.

Here, we outline recent progress in our understanding of these modes, from their creation to their characterization and detection. We then use these tools to study their propagation behavior in free-space and optical fiber and show that modal cross-talk results in a decay of vector states into separable scalar modes, with a concomitant loss of information. We present a comparison between probabilistic and deterministic detection schemes showing that the former, while ubiquitous, negates the very benefit of increased dimensionality in quantum communication while reducing signal in classical communication links.

First, the design problem of pilot pattern is casted as a convex optimization. From the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, the optimal analytical expression is derived when source and RS powers are given or fixed. Second, under the total transmit power sum constraint of source node and RS, an optimal power allocation (OPA) strategy is proposed to further alleviate the effect of Sum-MSE. Simulation results show that the proposed OPA performs better than equal power allocation (EPA) in terms of Sum-MSE, and the Sum-MSE performance gain increases with deviating \u03c1 from the value of \u03c1\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">o</sup>\n minimizing the Sum-MSE, where \u03c1 is defined as the average ratio of the residual SI channel gain at RS to the intended channel gain from source to RS. For example, the OPA achieves approximately 5-dB signal-to-noise ratio gain over EPA by shrinking or stretching \u03c1 with a factor 4. More importantly, the more \u03c1 decreases or increases, the more the performance gain becomes significant.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08085119.pdf","startPage":"24344","endPage":"24352","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8085119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot Optimization and Power Allocation for OFDM-Based Full-Duplex Relay Networks With IQ-Imbalances","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Resource management","Relay networks (telecommunications)","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","channel estimation","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot optimization","full-duplex relay networks","IQ-imbalances","orthogonal frequency division","quadrature imbalances","full-duplex relay station","mean square errors","frequency-domain least-squares channel estimator","self-interference cancellation","convex optimization","Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions","optimal analytical expression","optimal power allocation strategy","equal power allocation","residual SI channel gain","intended channel gain","sum-MSE performance gain","signal-to-noise ratio gain","transmit power sum constraint","SI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Full-duplex","IQ imbalances","relay","pilot optimization","power allocation"]}],"topic":"High Mobility 5G LTE-V: Challenges and Solutions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Pilot Optimization and Power Allocation for OFDM-Based Full-Duplex Relay Networks With IQ-Imbalances","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8085119/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17381247","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472190, 61771244 and 61702258"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of National Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Environment, China Research Institute of Radiowave Propagation","grantNumber":"201500013"},{"fundingName":"open research fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, China","grantNumber":"2013D02"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"20113219120019"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Cloud Computing and Big Data for Agriculture and Forestry","grantNumber":"117-612014063"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Pilot Optimization and Power Allocation for OFDM-Based Full-Duplex Relay Networks With IQ-Imbalances","sourcePdf":"access-shu-2766703-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081417S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["High Mobility 5G LTE-V: Challenges and Solutions"],"articleId":"8085119","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8085125,"authors":[{"name":"Yunlong Cai","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/8302422/8085125/cai-2766698-small.gif","p":["Yunlong Cai (S\u201907\u2013M\u201910\u2013SM\u201916) received the B.S. degree in computer science from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2004, the M.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K., in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the University of York, York, U.K., in 2010.

As this research space is ever increasing, it becomes more important to analyze the various approaches, therefore, in this paper we present a comprehensive overview of the most promising modulation and MA schemes for 5G networks. Unlike other surreys of 5G networks, this paper focuses on multiplexing techniques, including modulation techniques in orthogonal MA (OMA) and various types of non-OMA (NOMA) techniques. Specifically, we first introduce different types of modulation schemes, potential for OMA, and compare their performance in terms of spectral efficiency, out-of-band leakage, and bit-error rate. We then pay close attention to various types of NOMA candidates, including power-domain NOMA, code-domain NOMA, and NOMA multiplexing in multiple domains. From this exploration, we can identify the opportunities and challenges that will have the most significant impacts on modulation and MA designs for 5G networks.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2017.2766698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2017.2766698","startPage":"629","endPage":"646","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/8302422/08085125.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8302422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation and Multiple Access for 5G Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Modulation and Multiple Access for 5G Networks","volume":"20","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","accessionNumber":"17599751","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8085125/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471319"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000761","fundingName":"Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, U.K"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Modulation and Multiple Access for 5G Networks","sourcePdf":"comst-qin-2766698-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.325385S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"8302422","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"8302422","articleId":"8085125","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8085126,"authors":[{"name":"Onurcan \u0130\u015fcan","affiliation":["European Research Center, Huawei Technologies Duesseldorf GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Onurcan","lastName":"\u0130\u015fcan","orcid":"0000-0003-0073-9414","id":"37972928300"},{"name":"Ronald B\u00f6hnke","affiliation":["European Research Center, Huawei Technologies Duesseldorf GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Ronald","lastName":"B\u00f6hnke","orcid":"0000-0002-5240-0212","id":"37270656500"},{"name":"Wen Xu","affiliation":["European Research Center, Huawei Technologies Duesseldorf GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Xu","orcid":"0000-0003-0142-5230","id":"37086297913"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8085126","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1360},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8085126","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Transforms","AWGN channels","Encoding","Amplitude shift keying","Labeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","channel coding","error statistics","interleaved codes","modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["higher order modulation","polar coding scheme","encoding method","channel input symbols","nonuniform distribution","shaping gain","shaped polar codes","gray labeled amplitude shift keying","bit-interleaved coded modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polar coding","probabilistic shaping","coded modulation"]}],"abstract":"A new polar coding scheme for higher order modulation is presented.

With comparisons to other computing technologies, the definition and architecture of FC are presented in this paper. The framework of resource allocation for latency reduction combined with reliability, fault tolerance, privacy, and underlying optimization problems are also discussed. We then investigate an application scenario and conduct resource optimization by formulating the optimization problem and solving it via a genetic algorithm. The resulting analysis generates some important insights on the scalability of the FC systems.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766923","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08085127.pdf","startPage":"25445","endPage":"25454","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework of Fog Computing: Architecture, Challenges, and Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8085127","topic":"Cyber-Physical-Social Computing and Networking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085127/","displayDocTitle":"A Framework of Fog Computing: Architecture, Challenges, and Optimization","volume":"5","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17381335","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8085127/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/P020224/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100011102","fundingName":"EU FP7 QUICK Project","grantNumber":"PIRSES-GA-2013-612652"},{"fundingName":"Chinese Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Framework of Fog Computing: Architecture, Challenges, and Optimization","sourcePdf":"access-liu-2766923-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076489S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Cyber-Physical-Social Computing and Networking"],"articleId":"8085127","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8085128,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad-Ali Khalighi","affiliation":["Aix Marseille University, CNRS, Centrale Marseille, Institut Fresnel, Marseille, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8085128/khali-2765181-small.gif","p":["Mohammad-Ali Khalighi (M\u201997\u2013SM\u201907) is currently an Associate Professor with the Ecole Centrale Marseille and a Head of the Telecommunications and Antenna Processing Team, Fresnel Institute Research Laboratory.

One of the main limitations for high data-rate transmission in VLC systems is the limited modulation bandwidth of commercial light emitting diodes. To circumvent this limitation, spectrally efficient modulation schemes should be used. Optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (O-OFDM)-based schemes have become very popular and several proofs of concept have shown their ability to attain over gigabits per second transmission rates. We consider here the use of pulse amplitude modulation and carrier-less amplitude and phase modulation schemes together with frequency-domain equalization (FDE) at the receiver as interesting alternatives to O-OFDM.

In order to mitigate the deleterious effects of impulsive noise, the conventional automatic repeat request invokes cyclic redundancy checking (CRC) in order to estimate the existence of impulsive noise and then triggers retransmission, which degrades the spectral efficiency attained. More straightforward techniques of mitigating impulsive noise, such as blanking and clipping, require specific design, which increases the implementation complexity. Against the background, we propose a novel two-stage joint impulsive noise estimation and data detection scheme conceived for low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded discrete multitone (DMT)-based DSL systems. More explicitly, first of all, we propose a semi-blind estimation method, which is capable of estimating the arrival of impulsive noise without using CRC and additionally evaluating the power of impulsive noise with an adequate accuracy. Second, in order to improve the accuracy of impulsive noise estimation in more advanced LDPC-coded DMT-based DSL systems, we propose a decision-directed method for the second stage of channel decoding and data detection with the aid of extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts. Our proposed two-stage scheme is capable of approaching the performance of the idealistic scenario of perfectly knowing both the arrival time and the instantaneous power of impulsive noise. Moreover, we analyze the mean square error of the proposed schemes in order to quantify the estimation accuracy and to reduce the estimation complexity. Our simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is capable of achieving a near-capacity performance to using our LDPC coded DMT-based DSL system in the presence of impulsive noise.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08085129.pdf","startPage":"23133","endPage":"23145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Impulsive Noise Estimation and Data Detection Conceived for LDPC-Coded DMT-Based DSL Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint Impulsive Noise Estimation and Data Detection Conceived for LDPC-Coded DMT-Based DSL Systems","volume":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8085129/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17381180","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085129/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EPSRC projects","grantNumber":"EP/N004558/1 and EP/N023862/1"},{"fundingName":"European Research Council\u2019s Advanced Fellow Grant through the Beam-Me-Up Project"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society\u2019s Wolfson Research Merit Award"},{"fundingName":"RAEng Industrial Fellow Grant"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000739","fundingName":"University of Southampton ePrints research repository"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint Impulsive Noise Estimation and Data Detection Conceived for LDPC-Coded DMT-Based DSL Systems","sourcePdf":"access-hanzo-2766603-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.202888S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8085129","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8085132,"authors":[{"name":"Jiayi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiayi","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0003-2434-4329","id":"37601187300"},{"name":"Wen Zeng","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37086344459"},{"name":"Xu Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Li","id":"37086031094"},{"name":"Qiang Sun","affiliation":["School of Electronic and information, Nantong University, Nantong, China","National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Sun","orcid":"0000-0002-6484-4531","id":"37709690700"},{"name":"Kostas P.

Specifically, the limited bandwidth constraint is considered when state observation is exchanged over shared communication networks. Each area controller uses the explicit models of its own and neighboring areas to predict state observations when the actual one is not available. At each transmission instant, the state observation of the scheduled area is broadcasted to the relevant areas and the model-based controllers are partially updated. By properly scheduling the transmission sequence and intervals, the stability of the power system can be guaranteed with a substantial reduction of the bandwidth usage and this is proven by performing a thorough theoretical analysis. Simulation results of a four-area power system verify that the proposed distributed model-based control scheme integrated with a proper scheduling strategy can greatly enhance the performance and the resiliency to parameter uncertainty in large-scale power systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Model-Based Control and Scheduling for Load Frequency Regulation of Smart Grids Over Limited Bandwidth Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2017.2766666","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8353885/08085144.pdf","startPage":"1814","endPage":"1823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2017.2766666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8353885","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8085144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085144/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Model-Based Control and Scheduling for Load Frequency Regulation of Smart Grids Over Limited Bandwidth Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8085144/","dateOfInsertion":"03 May 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"17750586","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61773051, 61703031 and 51705016"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds"},{"fundingName":"Central Universities"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4172048"},{"fundingName":"Jiangxi Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"20171ACB20007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Model-Based Control and Scheduling for Load Frequency Regulation of Smart Grids Over Limited Bandwidth Networks","sourcePdf":"tii-liu-2766666-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094799S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8353885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8353885","articleId":"8085144","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8085145,"authors":[{"name":"Fatemeh Akbar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Akbar","orcid":"0000-0001-9135-5672","id":"37085530273"},{"name":"Amir Mortazawi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Mortazawi","id":"37268771000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8085145","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2649},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase shifters","Gain","CMOS technology","Transistors","Transconductance","Voltage control","Phased arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","field effect MMIC","gain control","MMIC amplifiers","MMIC phase shifters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current mode R-C poly phase filter","current steering variable gain amplifiers","vector generation","gain control","vector summation","phase shifter core","continuous phase tuning","on-chip area","analog CMOS phase shifter","power 27.0 mW","noise figure 0.31 dB","frequency 26.0 GHz to 28.0 GHz","bandwidth 3.0 GHz","size 130 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adjustable gain","analog phase shifter","CMOS","frequency tunable","vector sum"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents a new vector sum phase shifter topology utilizing a current mode R-C poly phase filter along with several current steering variable gain amplifiers. The phase shifter performs all the tasks of vector generation, gain control, and vector summation in a single block (phase shifter core) to save power and area. The phase shifter core provides 360\u00b0 of continuous phase tuning with an adjustable amplitude while consuming only 0.063 mm2 of on-chip area. The phase shifter can generate a signal with a tunable phase and magnitude in a phased array, thereby providing a better control over the beamwidth and sidelobe levels. The circuit is frequency reconfigurable, and its center frequency can be tuned within 26-28 GHz with an instantaneous bandwidth of 3 GHz. The phase shifter, fabricated in 130-nm CMOS technology, occupies an area of 0.284 mm2 (excluding the pads) and consumes 27 mW of power. The phase shifter's RMS phase and gain errors for 64 measured phase states are less than 2.6\u00b0 and 0.31 dB, respectively, within the 3-dB bandwidth. The measured IP1dB and IIP3 are larger than -9.8 and 0 dBm, respectively. This phase shifter is a good candidate for automotive radar as well as 5G applications.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2017.2766662","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8118325/08085145.pdf","startPage":"1427","endPage":"1431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8118325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2017.2766662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Frequency Tunable 360\u00b0 Analog CMOS Phase Shifter With an Adjustable Amplitude","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8085145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Frequency Tunable 360\u00b0 Analog CMOS Phase Shifter With an Adjustable Amplitude","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085145/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17390400","htmlLink":"/document/8085145/","volume":"64","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Frequency Tunable 360\u00b0 Analog CMOS Phase Shifter With an Adjustable Amplitude","sourcePdf":"tcsii-akbar-2766662-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051005S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8118325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8118325","articleId":"8085145","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8085146,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad M.

The current solution requires increasing the number of measurements to achieve accurate signal recovery, otherwise recovery performance is jeopardized. We study the performance impact of prefiltering the acquired measurements by detecting and omitting potentially invalid measurements prior to signal recovery. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that this approach significantly reduces the number of measurements required for accurate recovery, which leads to overall improvement of recovery performance, especially when a large fraction of measurements is invalid.

superior electro-thermal properties of silicon carbide (SiC) power devices permit higher temperature of operation and enable higher power density compared with silicon devices. Nevertheless, the reliability of SiC power modules has been identified as a major area of uncertainty in applications which require high reliability. Traditional power module packaging methods developed for silicon chips have been adopted for SiC and the different thermomechanical properties cause different fatigue stresses on the solder layer of the chip. In this paper, a 2-D finite element model has been developed to evaluate the stress performance and lifetime of the solder layer for Si devices, which has been validated using accelerated power cycling tests on Si IGBTs. The proposed model was extrapolated for SiC devices of the same voltage and current rating using the same solder material and the results show that under the same cyclic power loss profile the induced stress and strain energy in the die attach layer is much higher and concentrates on the die/solder interfacial area for SiC chips. Using the validated stress-based model, the lifetime can be quantified when SiC chips are used. This ability to extrapolate the available power cycling and lifetime data of silicon chips to SiC chips would be a key element for developing reliable packaging methods for SiC devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085168/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","volume":"17","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"17446629","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8085168/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Failure and Reliability Analysis of a SiC Power Module Based on Stress Comparison to a Si Device","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFB0102303"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51607016"},{"fundingName":"Graduate Scientific Research and Innovation Foundation of Chongqing","grantNumber":"CYB17008"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"U.K. EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/K036327/1"},{"fundingName":"Underpinning Power Electronics Components Theme","grantNumber":"EP/K034804/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure and Reliability Analysis of a SiC Power Module Based on Stress Comparison to a Si Device","sourcePdf":"tdmr-hu-2766692-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102192S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"8169690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"8169690","articleId":"8085168","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8085171,"authors":[{"name":"Da Tong","affiliation":["VMware Inc., Palo Alto, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/8314284/8085171/tong-2766633-small.gif","p":["Da Tong received the BS degree in physics from Shanghai Jiao Tong\n University, and the PhD degree in computer engineering from the University of Southern California, in 2009 and 2016.\n His current research includes online traffic classification for network routers and streaming algorithm and\n architecture for network anomaly detection.

Because of its sub-linear memory complexity, Sketch-based techniques consume significantly less memory than the traditional per-item-state techniques for processing high throughput data streams. One of the major applications of Sketch is in network anomaly detection, which is critical for network management and security in both Internet and data centers. In these applications, throughput is a key performance metric. Due to the low memory complexity, Sketch-based techniques can be supported by the fast onchip storage of the state-of-the-art computing platforms to achieve high throughput. In this work, we first propose a generic architecture on FPGA to accelerate Sketch and adopt it to 2 widely used Sketches: Count-min Sketch and K-ary Sketch. We propose online Sketchbased algorithms for 2 key network anomaly detection tasks: heavy hitter detection and heavy change detection. We adopt the proposed generic architecture for Sketch to accelerate these online algorithms. The post place-and-route results on a state-of-the-art FPGA show that our generic architecture can accelerate both Count-min Sketch and K-ary Sketch to over 150Gbps, demonstrating significant throughput performance improvements compared with other Sketch acceleration techniques. Our architectures for online anomaly detection tasks sustain 100-150 Gbps throughput for various system configurations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sketch Acceleration on FPGA and its Applications in Network Anomaly Detection","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2017.2766633","startPage":"929","endPage":"942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2017.2766633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8314284","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/8314284/08085171.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8085171","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/71/8314284/8085171-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"Sketch Acceleration on FPGA and its Applications in Network Anomaly Detection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8085171/","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2018","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 April 2018","accessionNumber":"17633547","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"ACI-1339756, CNS-1643351 and CCF-1320211"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Sketch Acceleration on FPGA and its Applications in Network Anomaly Detection","sourcePdf":"tpds-tong-2766633-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083007S","chronDate":"April 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"8314284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8314284","articleId":"8085171","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8085173,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Miguel Antonio","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, CINVESTAV-IPN, Mexico City, Mexico"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/8552518/8085173/migue-2767023-small.gif","p":["Luis Miguel Antonio received the bachelor\u2019s degree in computer systems from the Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional, Escuela Superior de C\u00f3mputo, Mexico City, M\u00e9xico, in 2011, and the master\u2019s degree in computer science from the Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional, Mexico City, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include evolutionary multiobjective optimization, large-scale multiobjective optimization, and machine learning."]},"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Miguel Antonio","orcid":"0000-0001-7530-4701","id":"37086525493"},{"name":"Carlos A.

Due to their population-based nature, multiobjective EAs (MOEAs) are able to generate a set of tradeoff solutions (called nondominated solutions) in a single algorithmic execution instead of having to perform a series of independent executions, as normally done with mathematical programming techniques. Additionally, MOEAs can be successfully applied to problems with difficult features such as multifrontality, discontinuity and disjoint feasible regions, among others. On the other hand, coevolutionary algorithms (CAs) are extensions of traditional EAs which have become subject of numerous studies in the last few years, particularly for dealing with large-scale global optimization problems. CAs have also been applied to the solution of MOPs, motivating the development of new algorithmic and analytical formulations that have advanced the state-of-the-art in CAs research, while simultaneously opening a new research path within MOEAs. This paper presents a critical review of the most representative coevolutionary MOEAs (CMOEAs) that have been reported in the specialized literature. This survey includes a taxonomy of approaches together with a brief description of their main features. In the final part of this paper, we also identify what we believe to be promising areas of future research in the field of CMOEAs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085173/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2018","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18285746","htmlLink":"/document/8085173/","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coevolutionary Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms: Survey of the State-of-the-Art","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CONACyT through a Ph.D. scholarship"},{"fundingName":"CONACyT","grantNumber":"221551"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coevolutionary Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms: Survey of the State-of-the-Art","sourcePdf":"tevc-miguelantonio-2767023-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12313S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"8552518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8552518","articleId":"8085173","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8085174,"authors":[{"name":"Shiqing Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Media, School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, China","Institute of Intelligent Information Processing, Taizhou University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/8359225/8085174/zhang-2766843-small.gif","p":["Shiqing Zhang received the Ph.D. degree from the School of\n Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China,\n in 2012.

Integrating multilevel feature learning and model training, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) has exhibited remarkable success in bridging the semantic gap in visual tasks like image classification, object detection. This paper explores how to utilize a DCNN to bridge the affective gap in speech signals. To this end, we first extract three channels of log Mel-spectrograms (static, delta, and delta delta) similar to the red, green, blue (RGB) image representation as the DCNN input. Then, the AlexNet DCNN model pretrained on the large ImageNet dataset is employed to learn high-level feature representations on each segment divided from an utterance. The learned segment-level features are aggregated by a discriminant temporal pyramid matching (DTPM) strategy. DTPM combines temporal pyramid matching and optimal Lp-norm pooling to form a global utterance-level feature representation, followed by the linear support vector machines for emotion classification. Experimental results on four public datasets, that is, EMO-DB, RML, eNTERFACE05, and BAUM-1s, show the promising performance of our DCNN model and the DTPM strategy. Another interesting finding is that the DCNN model pretrained for image applications performs reasonably good in affective speech feature extraction. Further fine tuning on the target emotional speech datasets substantially promotes recognition performance.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2017.2766843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2017.2766843","startPage":"1576","endPage":"1590","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/8359225/08085174.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8359225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech Emotion Recognition Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Discriminant Temporal Pyramid Matching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085174/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Speech Emotion Recognition Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Discriminant Temporal Pyramid Matching","volume":"20","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2018","accessionNumber":"17766478","publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8085174/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572050, LY16F020011, 91538111 and 61620106009"},{"fundingName":"National 1000 Youth Talents Plan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech Emotion Recognition Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Discriminant Temporal Pyramid Matching","sourcePdf":"tmm-zhang-2766843-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167392S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"8359225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"8359225","articleId":"8085174","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8085178,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Zeng","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8318405/8085178/zeng-2766887-small.gif","p":["Rong Zeng was born in Jiangsu, China in 1976.

In this paper, a joint frequency offset and Doppler shift estimation algorithm in high mobility environment based on orthogonal angle domain subspace projection is proposed, which can track the fast time-varying Doppler shift and separate the Doppler shift from the frequency offset. First, an orthogonal angle domain subspace projection algorithm is proposed to project the Doppler spread caused by high mobility into equivalent Doppler shifts in each orthogonal subspace. Second, it utilizes equivalent Doppler shift of all orthogonal subspaces to jointly estimate the maximal Doppler shift and frequency offset. Finally, the estimates are used to compensate the frequency error in the received signal. Moreover, the maximum Doppler shift estimation, together with the projection vectors and the received power on each orthogonal subspace, is fed back and exploited in the subsequent transmitted signal. Simulation results show that the proposed method can estimate the two parameters accurately and eliminate almost all the errors on the Doppler rapidly changing area when SNR is up to 15 dB. Compared with the conventional receiver with automatic frequency control, the receiver with our proposed method achieves better system performance even on the Doppler rapidly changing area.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2766887","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8318405/08085178.pdf","startPage":"2254","endPage":"2266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2766887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318405","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Estimation of Frequency Offset and Doppler Shift in High Mobility Environments Based on Orthogonal Angle Domain Subspace Projection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint Estimation of Frequency Offset and Doppler Shift in High Mobility Environments Based on Orthogonal Angle Domain Subspace Projection","volume":"67","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2018","accessionNumber":"17633268","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8085178/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085178/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Plan","grantNumber":"2016YFB0502202"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571105 and 61601153"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Foundation of Electronics Science and Technology"},{"fundingName":"top-ranking discipline A Class in Zhejiang Province"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Estimation of Frequency Offset and Doppler Shift in High Mobility Environments Based on Orthogonal Angle Domain Subspace Projection","sourcePdf":"tvt-zeng-2766887-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084119S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8318405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8318405","articleId":"8085178","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8085179,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangbin Zhang","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Digital Design and Software Technology, Wuxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/8424402/8085179/zhang-2767025-small.gif","p":["Jiangbin Zhang received the Master's degree in Computer\n Application from the School of Digital Media, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China, in 2016.","His research interests include fuzzy modeling, fuzzy machine learning, and intelligent computation and their\n applications."]},"firstName":"Jiangbin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086430369"},{"name":"Zhaohong Deng","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Digital Design and Software Technology, Wuxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/8424402/8085179/deng-2767025-small.gif","p":["Zhaohong Deng (M\u201912\u2013SM'14) received the B.S. degree\n in physics from Fuyang Normal College, Fuyang, China, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in information technology and\n engineering from Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China, in 2008.

However, this approach still faces critical challenges, including the difficulty in obtaining concise models for high-dimensional data and generating accurate fuzzy rules to simulate human inference mechanism. To tackle these issues, a new FLS modeling framework called data-driven elastic FLS (DD-EFLS) is proposed in this paper. The DD-EFLS has two key characteristics. First, the fuzzy rules in the rule base can use different feature subspaces that are extracted from the original high-dimensional space to yield simple and accurate rules in feature spaces of lower dimensionality. Second, fuzzy inferences from various views are implemented by embedding different rules in the corresponding subspaces to imitate human inference mechanism. Based on the DD-EFLS framework, an elastic Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) FLS modeling method (ETSK-FLS) is proposed to train the elastic TSK FLS using the concise rules and a more human-like inference mechanism for modeling tasks based on high-dimensional datasets. The characteristics and advantages of the proposed framework and the ETSK-FLS method are validated experimentally using both synthetic and real-world datasets.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8424402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2767025","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/8424402/08085179.pdf","startPage":"2160","endPage":"2173","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2767025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Elastic Fuzzy Logic System Modeling: Constructing a Concise System With Human-Like Inference Mechanism","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Elastic Fuzzy Logic System Modeling: Constructing a Concise System With Human-Like Inference Mechanism","volume":"26","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8085179/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17973493","dateOfInsertion":"02 August 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085179/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Outstanding Youth Fund of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20140001"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772239 and 61272210"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JUSRP41704"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research Grants Council","grantNumber":"PolyU 152040/16E"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University","grantNumber":"G-UA68 and G-UA3W"},{"fundingName":"Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing and Intelligent Control (Minjiang University)","grantNumber":"MJUKF201725"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Elastic Fuzzy Logic System Modeling: Constructing a Concise System With Human-Like Inference Mechanism","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-deng-2767025-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165706S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"8424402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8424402","articleId":"8085179","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":8085187,"authors":[{"name":"Liwei An","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Liwei","lastName":"An","orcid":"0000-0002-9184-9848","id":"37086108120"},{"name":"Guang-Hong Yang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Guang-Hong","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-8911-0112","id":"37085392421"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"8085187","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1995},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Switches","Adaptive systems","Cyber-physical systems","Adaptation models","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","asymptotic stability","continuous time systems","control system synthesis","cyber-physical systems","discrete time systems","linear matrix inequalities","linear systems","observers","optimisation","performance index","switching systems (control)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure state estimation","sparse sensor attacks","adaptive switching mechanism","cyber-physical systems","discrete-time linear systems","state observer","attack tolerance principle","switching function matrix","observer design","observation error system","cyber attacks","adaptive observer","performance index","linear matrix inequalities","performance estimation","continuous-time linear systems","injection channels","entry mode","sparse detectability","asymptotic stability","complex static batch optimization algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive switching mechanism","cyber-physical systems (CPSs)","linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)","sparse sensor attacks"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the problem of secure state estimation for cyber-physical systems modeled by continuous or discrete-time linear systems when some sensors are corrupted by an attacker. A novel state observer is proposed with adaptive switching mechanism. Attack tolerance principle is established based on adaptively truncating the injection channels of attacks. To implement it, a switching function matrix is introduced into the observer design. Driven by a well-defined performance index, the switching function matrix automatically reaches and remains in the desired entry mode and turns off the input channels of attacks. Based on the equivalence between $s$-strong detectability of the observation error system and $2s$-sparse detectability of the original system, the observation error system is proven to be asymptotically stable even under the cyber attacks. Compared with the existing complex static batch optimization algorithms, the proposed adaptive observer can be derived only by offline solving a set of simple linear matrix inequalities. Simulation examples are given to illustrate the estimation performance and the computational efficiency of the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure State Estimation Against Sparse Sensor Attacks With Adaptive Switching Mechanism","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2017.2766759","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/8421109/08085187.pdf","startPage":"2596","endPage":"2603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2017.2766759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8421109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8085187","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085187/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Secure State Estimation Against Sparse Sensor Attacks With Adaptive Switching Mechanism","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8085187/","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17955296","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61621004 and 61420106016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011248","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries","grantNumber":"2013ZCX01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure State Estimation Against Sparse Sensor Attacks With Adaptive Switching Mechanism","sourcePdf":"tac-yang-2766759-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104713S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"8421109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8421109","articleId":"8085187","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":8085190,"authors":[{"name":"Jiawen Gu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiawen","lastName":"Gu","orcid":"0000-0002-9433-4698","id":"37086035773"},{"name":"Minhao Tang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Minhao","lastName":"Tang","orcid":"0000-0002-5421-1116","id":"37085359972"},{"name":"Jiangtao Wen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiangtao","lastName":"Wen","id":"37291696100"},{"name":"Yuxing Han","affiliation":["Department of Automation, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuxing","lastName":"Han","orcid":"0000-0003-2558-8966","id":"37406874100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"8085190","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":896},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Intra Candidate Selection With Early Depth Decision for Fast Intra Prediction in HEVC","abstract":"To better exploit spatial correlations in a video frame, the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard has adopted a great many more intra prediction modes than H.264/AVC.

The module integrates a superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) mixer with a 3- 21-GHz cryogenic low-noise preamplifier (CLNA). The utilization of high current density SIS junctions offers wide RF bandwidth and facilitates better matching between SIS junctions and the CLNA. Based on an equivalent circuit of the SIS mixer chip, we calculate the IF output impedance and simulate how different matching conditions affect the performance of the CLNA. Simulations predict that low-noise module performance can be obtained over a 3-18GHz IF range, limited mainly by parasitic elements in theSIS mixer chip. The measurement results of the heterodyne module demonstrate flat gain and a typical noise temperature of 70-80 K over the 3-18-GHz IF range, at local oscillator frequencies of 400-480 GHz. Mixer chip output impedance and CLNA input impedance have been directly measured by recording S-parameters at cryogenic temperatures. The results enabled us to quantify the contribution of various parasitic elements in the mixer IF circuitry. Calculations based on our model are in good agreement with measurements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8085193/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17340097","volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance and Characterization of a Wide IF SIS-Mixer-Preamplifier Module Employing High-J c SIS Junctions","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI","grantNumber":"15K18057, 16K13789 and 25108005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance and Characterization of a Wide IF SIS-Mixer-Preamplifier Module Employing High-J c SIS Junctions","sourcePdf":"tthz-kojima-2758260-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082393S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5503871","isNumber":"8101573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503871","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8101573","articleId":"8085193","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8085196,"authors":[{"name":"Sen Hu","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/8329400/8085196/hu-2766634-small.gif","p":["Sen Hu received the BS degree in computer science and technology from\n the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2015.

To answer a natural language question, the existing work takes a two-stage approach: question understanding and query evaluation. Their focus is on question understanding to deal with the disambiguation of the natural language phrases. The most common technique is the joint disambiguation, which has the exponential search space. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to answer natural language questions over RDF repository (RDF Q/A) from a graph data-driven perspective. We propose a semantic query graph to model the query intention in the natural language question in a structural way, based on which, RDF Q/A is reduced to subgraph matching problem. More importantly, we resolve the ambiguity of natural language questions at the time when matches of query are found. The cost of disambiguation is saved if there are no matching found. More specifically, we propose two different frameworks to build the semantic query graph, one is relation (edge)-first and the other one is node-first. We compare our method with some state-of-the-art RDF Q/A systems in the benchmark dataset. Extensive experiments confirm that our method not only improves the precision but also speeds up query performance greatly.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource description

DRAM cells with one transistor, one capacitor (1T1C) struggle to maintain refresh time [5-6]. Efforts have been made to find new memory solutions, such as one transistor (1T) solutions [7-9]. Floating body based memory structures are among the potential candidates, but impact ionization or band-to-band tunnelling (B2BT) limits their refresh time [10]. A recently proposed zero impact ionization and zero subthreshold swing device named Z2FET [9, 11-12] has been demonstrated and is a promising candidate for 1T DRAM memory cell due to technology advantages such as CMOS technology compatibility, novel capacitor-less structure and sharp switching characteristics. In the Z2FET memory operation, refresh frequency is determined by data retention time. Previous research [11-12] is lacking systematic simulation analysis and understanding on the underlying mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a new simulation methodology to accurately extract retention time in Z2FET devices and understand its dependency on applied biases, temperatures and relevant physical mechanisms. Since the stored `1' state in Z2FET is an equilibrium state [9, 11-12] and there is no need to refresh, we will concentrate on state `0' retention. Two types of `0' retention time: HOLD `0' and READ `0' retention time will be discussed separately.","doi":"10.23919/SISPAD.2017.8085330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/SISPAD.2017.8085330","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Simulation of Semiconductor Processes and Devices (SISPAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Simulation of Semiconductor Processes and Devices (SISPAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8068290/8085242/08085330.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8085242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085330/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"2D-TCAD simulation on retention time of Z2FET for DRAM application","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17291206","htmlLink":"/document/8085330/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2D-TCAD simulation on retention time of Z2FET for DRAM application","confLoc":"Kamakura, Japan","sourcePdf":"82.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074649S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8068290","isNumber":"8085242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8068290","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8085242","articleId":"8085330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"The Japan Society of Applied Physics","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8085357,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Xu","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085445378"},{"name":"Ying-Ning Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ying-Ning","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085587775"},{"name":"Xiang-Gen Xia","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Xiang-Gen","lastName":"Xia","id":"37274950600"},{"name":"Alfonso Farina","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Alfonso","lastName":"Farina","id":"37274494900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8985"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-959X"}],"articleNumber":"8085357","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1567},"abstract":"During the World War II (WWII), radar was invented as an all-day, all-weather, long-range sensor. Over the past 75 years or so, radar has acted as the clairvoyance and clairaudience of humans and has had wide applications in both defense and civilian fields, e.g., surveillance, reconnaissance, fire control, border monitoring, collision avoidance, and traffic control. Along with radar development, radar signal processing (RSP) always plays an important role. In 1943, North pointed out that the matched filter should be the foundation of radar to detect targets from echoes generated by the known transmitting waveform. In 1950, Woodward and Davies introduced the Bayesian statistics theory into the RSP field and proposed the constant false alarm ratio (CFAR) rule for target detection. Based on matched filtering and the CFAR rule, the embryonic framework of classic RSP has been formed and used thus far. In 1953, Woodward further proposed an ambiguity function as a useful tool to evaluate the range and Doppler discrimination abilities of a transmitting waveform, which paves the foundation for radar waveform design. Furthermore, to deal with the tradeoff between large transmitting energy and high range resolution, the early unmodulated rectangular waveform has been replaced by more waveforms with a large time-bandwidth product (TBP), such as linear frequency modulation (LFM) and phase-coded waveforms. These waveforms with large TBP have been widely used to realize the range compression via matched filter.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/62/8085343/08085357.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"59","publicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MAES.2017.160142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAES.2017.160142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8085343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8085357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Focus-before-detection radar signal processing: part i\u2014challenges and methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar cross-sections","Clutter","Spaceborne radar","Object detection","Radar detection","Radar antennas","Traffic control","Radar signal processing","Radar applications","Surveillance","Reconnaissance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matched filters","radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["focus-before-detection radar signal processing","matched filter","radar target detection","radar echoes","Bayesian statistics theory","constant false alarm ratio rule","radar waveform design","range compression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Focus-before-detection radar signal processing: part i\u2014challenges and methods","volume":"32","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/8085357/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 2017","accessionNumber":"17288604","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Focus-before-detection radar signal processing: part i\u2014challenges and methods","sourcePdf":"48-59_aesm-32-09-48.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130327S","chronDate":"September  2017","xplore-pub-id":"62","isNumber":"8085343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"62","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8085343","articleId":"8085357","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8085393,"authors":[{"name":"Wanying Song","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8271875/8085393/song-2756621-small.gif","p":["Wanying Song was born in 1988.

However, due to the complexity of natural scene and the influence of coherent wave, the WG\u0393 model still needs to be improved to fully consider the polarimetric information. Then, we propose the WG\u0393 mixture model (WG\u0393MM) for PolSAR data to maintain the correlations among statistics in PolSAR data. To further consider the spatial-contextual information in PolSAR image classification, we propose a novel mixture model, named mixture WG\u0393-Markov random field (MWG\u0393MRF) model, by introducing the MRF to improve the WG\u0393MM model for classification. In each law of the MWG\u0393-MRF model, the interaction term based on the edge penalty function is constructed by the edge-based multilevel-logistic model, while the likelihood term being constructed by the WG\u0393 model, so that each law of the MWG\u0393-MRF model can achieve an energy function and has its contribution to the inference of attributive class. Then, the mixture energy function of the MWG\u0393-MRF model has the fusion of the weighted component, given the energy functions of every law. The mixture coefficient and the corresponding mean covariance matrix of the MWG\u0393-MRF model are estimated by the expectation-maximization algorithm, while the parameters of the WG\u0393 model being estimated by the method of matrix log-cumulants. Experiments on simulated data and real PolSAR images demonstrate the effectiveness of the MWG\u0393-MRF model and illustrate that it can provide strong noise immunity, get smoother homogeneous areas, and obtain more accurate edge locations.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2017.2756621","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8271875/08085393.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2756621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8271875","startPage":"905","endPage":"920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixture WG $\\Gamma$ -MRF Model for PolSAR Image Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8085393","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mixture WG $\\Gamma$ -MRF Model for PolSAR Image Classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085393/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17535503","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8085393/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772390 and 61271297"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004750","fundingName":"Aeronautical Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2016081011"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China","grantNumber":"2017JM4022"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Aerospace Science and Technology Innovation Fund","grantNumber":"SAST2016092"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixture WG $\\Gamma$ -MRF Model for PolSAR Image Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-li-2756621-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131897S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8271875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8271875","articleId":"8085393","onlineDate":"26 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8085396,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Zhang","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Automatic Target Recognition Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China","Center of TH Satellite, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0001-6791-5748","id":"37085636699"},{"name":"Gongjian Wen","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Automatic Target Recognition Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Gongjian","lastName":"Wen","id":"37840641100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"8085396","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":326},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"abstract":"In our previous work, a tensor decomposition-based anomaly detection algorithm has been proposed.

Moreover, significant information is extracted from geology reports which are saved in scanned PDF files and well logs. By using the extracted information, long short-term memory (LSTM) model which could take the special-temporal changes of DSUs into consideration is employed to predict the DSUs' productivity.

Since DMFC performance characteristics are inherently complex, it can be postulated that artificial neural networks (ANN) represent a marked improvement in prediction capabilities. However, very little investigation has been done to develop dynamic ANN to predict transient behavior of DMFCs. This paper predicts the dynamic performance of a DMFC stack under changes in operating conditions including step change in current. Input variables for the analysis consist of methanol concentration, temperature and current. The performances of the ANN models of four different approaches are judged based on stack voltage, which was shown to be predicted.

Generally pre-measured solution can provide high quality data but it needs lots of labor and time. Different from pre-measured solution, crowdsourcing is an economic and efficient way to obtain location information. WFP based on Clustering (WFP-C) in mobile crowdsourcing system is proposed to improve positioning accuracy and reduce computation complexity. WFP-C includes three phases: offline database building, dataset preprocessing and online positioning. In offline database building phase, Android-based APP is developed to collect crowdsourcing data. In dataset preprocessing phase, according to some clustering algorithm, the geography area is divided into several fingerprint clusters which are identified by Position Feature Vectors (PFVs). In online positioning phase, two-stage matching method is proposed. Firstly, the WiFi signal vector is used to match some cluster according to PFVs. And then, the accurate position is calculate using the WiFi signal vector of the cluster. The Android-based APP is installed in smart phones which are carried by ten volunteers. The collected data is used to evaluated our proposal. The experiment compares WFP-C, grid-based WFP and non-cluster WFP. The evaluation results indicate that WFP-C can achieve higher positioning accuracy and low computation complexity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless fidelity","Fingerprint

data traffic and network capacity. However, UDN deployment brings about many problems such as frequent handover, decreasing Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE). The access points' selection and handover decisions making always affected by several factors no matter we consider from the user side or from the network side. A scientific and effective execution scheme has direct influence on the overall network performance enhancement and high users' satisfaction especially in the context of ultra-dense network, where one user usually has many potentially achievable access points and the mobility is complex there. In this paper, we propose a kind of improved nonstochastic learning approach suits for the multi-objective optimization to achieve the goal of high performance and low frequency handover, by which the handover decision executes once after a given period and the user could learn the dynamic contextual competitive score (CCS) recorded during the period. We evaluate the results of the scheme by two parameters called satisfaction-ratio and handover times. The results show that users could connect to theirs reasonable access points soon without a lot of handover happens.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085502/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17314844","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","conferenceDate":"22-25 Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8085502/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A contextual awareness-learning approach to multi-objective mobility management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A contextual awareness-learning approach to multi-objective mobility management","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"27715892.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045091S","chronDate":"22-25 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8070113","isNumber":"8085451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8070113","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8085451","articleId":"8085502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":8085504,"authors":[{"name":"Caidan Zhao","affiliation":["Dept. of CE, Xi amen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Caidan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37396944800"},{"name":"Mingxian Shi","affiliation":["Dept. of CE, Xi amen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Mingxian","lastName":"Shi","id":"37086239021"},{"name":"Zhibiao Cai","affiliation":["Dept. of CE, Xi amen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Zhibiao","lastName":"Cai","id":"37085878678"},{"name":"Caiyun Chen","affiliation":["Dept. of CE, Xi amen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Caiyun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086245516"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2508-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2507-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2509-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-9464"}],"articleNumber":"8085504","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":440},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Wireless communication","Histograms","Gaussian mixture model","Fractals","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","Gaussian processes","mixture models","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal data characteristics","wireless signal","unmanned aerial vehicle signal","remote control","low-altitude environment","Gaussian mixture model","UAV technology","UAV signal detection","GMM","adaptive threshold","noise environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UAV signal","start-point detection","self-adaptive threshold","Gaussian mixture model"]}],"abstract":"With the innovation and development of unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) technology, small UAV has also begun to attract the people's attention. Because of its characteristic of remote control, small size, low cost and other advantages, it already has a wide range of applications. However, the management of UAV has become a common problem throughout the world. It is a prerequisite which is how to detect UAV. Nowadays, the wireless signal of the UAV can help us detect it. In the low-altitude environment, due to the impact of noise, the first step is to identify the start-point of its single accurately. A detection algorithm for UAV signals with an adaptive threshold based on Gaussian mixture model(GMM) is proposed in this paper. The algorithm makes full use of the signal data characteristics, calculates the threshold using the GMM. Meanwhile, it does not need to set the fixed threshold manually. That means it can adaptively detect the wireless signal in a different noise environment.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSE.2017.8085504","publicationTitle":"2017 12th International Conference on Computer Science and Education (ICCSE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 12th International Conference on Computer Science and Education (ICCSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8070113/8085451/08085504.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSE.2017.8085504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8085451","startPage":"289","endPage":"293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of unmanned aerial vehicle signal based on Gaussian mixture model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8085504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detection of unmanned aerial vehicle signal based on Gaussian mixture model","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085504/","conferenceDate":"22-25 Aug. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17314843","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8085504/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of unmanned aerial vehicle signal based on Gaussian mixture model","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"28915700.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.226529S","chronDate":"22-25 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8070113","isNumber":"8085451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8070113","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8085451","articleId":"8085504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8085515,"authors":[{"name":"Da Huo","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, P.

Based on the modality-convolution, we describe a modality-CNN for multi-modal gesture recognition. For extracting the features in RGB-D images, the modality-CNN is adopted in the gesture recognition framework. The framework use DBN to present the skeleton data. Then, the probability obtained by the two networks are fused and put into the HMM to carry out dynamic gestures classification. We use the Jaccar Index to calculate the accuracy of gesture recognition. A comparative experiment on ChaLearn LAP 2014 gesture datasets shows that the modality-convolution is able to extract the inter- and intra-modality information effectively, which is helpful to improve the accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSE.2017.8085515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSE.2017.8085515","publicationTitle":"2017 12th International Conference on Computer Science and Education (ICCSE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 12th International Conference on Computer Science and Education (ICCSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8070113/8085451/08085515.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8085451","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Modality-convolutions: Multi-modal gesture recognition based on convolutional neural network","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17314831","htmlLink":"/document/8085515/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modality-convolutions: Multi-modal gesture recognition based on convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"34915842.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055437S","chronDate":"22-25 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8070113","isNumber":"8085451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8070113","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8085451","articleId":"8085515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8085644,"authors":[{"name":"Prasad Rayi","affiliation":["Dept. of E.C.E, Nagarjuna university, Kakinada, india"],"firstName":"Prasad","lastName":"Rayi","id":"37085526379"},{"name":"M.

Where pilot contamination and inter-cell interference have been considered as basic limiting factors to achieve high data rate. These parameters will saturate the SE and truncate to a constant value. In this work, we explore the effective evaluation of SE and EE of the M-MIMO antenna system with optimal users. In this work, we basically considered linear processing algorithms such as zero-forcing (ZF), maximum ratio combing (MRC) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) for the analysis SE for the both single and multi-cell scenario in M-MIMO systems. In this paper, we provide a platform to improve the SE and EE with a variation of base station (BS) antennas M and pilot reuse factor \u03bb. We also derived the explicit and exact expressions for the analysis of SE and EE with perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI). Which are very tight and tractable approximations in the prospective of realistic system scenario. We mainly focused on the asymptotic limit of SE and also obtain optimal user terminals K. It has been noticed that the SE performance greatly depends on the receiving combined scheme. We compared the simulation results for SE based the parameters such as varying antennas at the BS M, optimal UTs K and finally pilot reuse factors \u03bb=4 and \u03bb=7. Here, the simulation results of the BS antennas per-user (M/K) and optimal users K, highly depend on the receive technique and the BS antennas M. We also demonstrated the simulation results with the variation of per-user SE versus the BS antennas. The simulation results were performed by using Matlab 2015b.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Fourth International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8074809/8085405/08085644.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 Fourth International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","doi":"10.1109/ICSCN.2017.8085644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCN.2017.8085644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8085405","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8085644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancement of spectral and energy efficiency in massive MIMO systems with linear schemes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Interference","Antennas","Uplink","Coherence","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cellular radio","diversity reception","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO systems","inter-cell interference","M-MIMO antenna system","multicell scenario","base station antennas","BS antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SE","EE","MIMO","CSI","ZF","MMSE","MRC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2017","displayDocTitle":"Enhancement of spectral and energy efficiency in massive MIMO systems with linear schemes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8085644/","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"17315369","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancement of spectral and energy efficiency in massive MIMO systems with linear schemes","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"ICSCN12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062157S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074809","isNumber":"8085405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074809","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8085405","articleId":"8085644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8085645,"authors":[{"name":"Gopi Chand Naguboina","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics Engineering, Pondicherry University, Pondicherry, India"],"firstName":"Gopi Chand","lastName":"Naguboina","id":"37086137160"},{"name":"K.

It is used to access the stored data in bit cell during read cycle. Sense intensifier enhances the little distinction between bit lines to the full swing level. Its execution influences the get to time and power dissemination of memory and henceforth by lessening the detecting deferral and power utilization of sense speaker the execution of memory makes strides. Since the majority of the memory related operations are perused operations, this causes a vast sparing in the general power scattered by the memory. Additionally as sense intensifiers scatters extensive amount of short out power instead of the dynamic power disseminated by the cell exhibit, substantial power is spared. The requirement for the hearty outline of low power fast CMOS simple VLSI circuits is developing immensely. This development is because of the innovative drive that originates from the decrease of the base component size to downsize the chip zone. Downsizing the transistor size can then coordinate more circuit segments are solitary chip zone and bring down the cost. Likewise littler geometry normally brings down the parasitic capacitances, which implies higher working pace and lower control utilization. For a comparative analysis, we will be cataloguing the different sense amplifiers in use currently, using various nanometer technologies such as 180nm, 90nm and 45nm. We will then be providing an extensive comparison using these technologies in order to provide a clear picture about the best technology to be used. The comparison will provide information regarding various parameters such as sensing delay and power consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8085666/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"17315409","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of sense amplifier circuits in nanometer technologies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of sense amplifier circuits in nanometer technologies","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"ICSCN143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040688S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074809","isNumber":"8085405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074809","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8085405","articleId":"8085666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8085667,"authors":[{"name":"C Pavan Kumar","affiliation":["VIT University, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, IN"],"firstName":"C Pavan","lastName":"Kumar"},{"name":"R Selvakumar","affiliation":["VIT University, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, IN"],"firstName":"R","lastName":"Selvakumar"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4740-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4741-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8085667","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8085667","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Maximum likelihood decoding","Complexity theory","Signal processing","Encoding","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated codes","error statistics","trellis codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated kernel code","digital communication","trellis representation","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Kernel Codes","Concatenated Kernel Codes","Group Codes","Trellis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSCN.2017.8085667","publicationTitle":"2017 Fourth International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Fourth International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8074809/8085405/08085667.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCN.2017.8085667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8085405","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of concatenated kernel codes","abstract":"Concatenated codes proposed by Forney are used extensively in digital communication.

In recent years, plant species recognition is carried out based on the shape, geometry and texture of various plant parts such as leaves, stem, flowers etc. Flower based plant species identification systems are widely used. While modern search engines provide methods to visually search for a query image that contains a flower, it lacks in robustness because of the intra-class variation among millions of flower species around the world. Hence in this proposed research work, a Deep learning approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is used to recognize flower species with high accuracy. Images of the plant species are acquired using the built-in camera module of a mobile phone. Feature extraction of flower images is performed using a Transfer Learning approach (i.e. extraction of complex features from a pre-trained network). A machine learning classifier such as Logistic Regression or Random Forest is used on top of it to yield a higher accuracy rate. This approach helps in minimizing the hardware requirement needed to perform the computationally intensive task of training a CNN. It is observed that, CNN combined with Transfer Learning approach as feature extractor outperforms all the handcrafted feature extraction methods such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Color Channel Statistics, Color Histograms, Haralick Texture, Hu Moments and Zernike Moments. CNN combined with Transfer Learning approach yields impressive Rank-1 accuracies of 73.05%, 93.41% and 90.60% using OverFeat, Inception-v3 and Xception architectures, respectively as Feature Extractors on FLOWERS102 dataset.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"17315343","htmlLink":"/document/8085675/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Flower species recognition system using convolution neural networks and transfer learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flower species recognition system using convolution neural networks and transfer learning","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"ICSCN161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073885S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074809","isNumber":"8085405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074809","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8085405","articleId":"8085675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8085687,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Pricing is both an art and science that requires an experimental and statistical formula for creating a profile for the brand and the product in the market. There are minimalistic approaches used for pricing the products and to consider what will work for your business. Neural networks are a computational approach which is more promising in making a better decision among large volume of data. Combination of Machine learning with neural networks forms a new dimension in decision making. Though, it provides more accuracy than regression techniques, they aren't able to keep up with the dynamic growth of the data. Thus, an additional technique is required to handle this dynamic growth. Henceforth, sentimental analysis and Neural networks are combined together in order to provide better precision in decision making. Here, Back propagation neural network classification algorithm is used to classify the data. This approach would be more efficient in decision making in perspective of selling the products.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085696/","accessionNumber":"17315393","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8085696/","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Retail price analytics using backpropogation neural network and sentimental analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Retail price analytics using backpropogation neural network and sentimental analysis","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"ICSCN196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047317S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074809","isNumber":"8085405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074809","xplore-issue":"8085405","articleId":"8085696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":8085706,"authors":[{"name":"G.

By manipulating droplets with negligible volumes, the DMFB provides susceptibility with comparatively less human errors than the former routing methods. When two droplets are sharing a same routing path, the second droplet may be contaminated due to the leftovers of the first droplet which affects the assay. To avoid cross contamination 1. A DMFB need to be periodically washed out. 2. Contamination aware routing path need to be calculated. This work attends to utilize both the modified version of the solution. This project work attempts to propose a simultaneous wash out routing algorithm for dynamic parallel droplet testing with reduced timing overhead. A reconfigurable DMFB (Digital Microfluidic Biochip) test bed architecture with N \u00d7 N pin structure will be designed using HDL. Parallel droplets will be introduced using different input pin channels with addition to that a wash out droplet will also be introduced and kept idle initially. When the destination pins for the actual droplets is configured, shortest path routing prediction will take place in parallel with a multi-objective modified swarm intelligence algorithm which is initiated to predict the routing path of the wash droplet to avoid cross contamination possibilities for the testing droplets. The second routing algorithm is dedicated for wash droplet through which is analyzes the first (droplet) routing result to find possible cross contamination. The modified swarm routing will be gated in case of non-contaminated routing path is already predicted in the first routing which saves the circuit power dissipation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8085405","publicationTitle":"2017 Fourth International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Fourth International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8074809/8085405/08085706.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICSCN.2017.8085706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCN.2017.8085706","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic washout multiple droplet lab on chip routing: Dynamic washing technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085706/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic washout multiple droplet lab on chip routing: Dynamic washing technique","htmlLink":"/document/8085706/","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17315341","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic washout multiple droplet lab on chip routing: Dynamic washing technique","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"ICSCN214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066188S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074809","isNumber":"8085405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074809","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8085405","articleId":"8085706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8085719,"authors":[{"name":"B R Deepak","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Technology Madras Institute of Technology, Anna University, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"B R","lastName":"Deepak","id":"37086256323"},{"name":"P.

Many anti-jamming schemes available to protect the Cognitive Radio Networks from jamming attack uses frequency hopping techniques which are deterministic in nature. The deterministic frequency hopping technique is vulnerable to attack at some stage in the real-world scenario. The proposed anti-jamming system for cognitive radio network with adaptive frequency hopping technique efficiently thwarts the RF jamming attack. In the presences of a reactive jammer, two techniques are used to achieve the adaptive frequency hopping: (i) when channel availability reduces below 75 % the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm is used, (ii) when the system is in critical state (i.e. channel availability reduces further below 25 %) the interaction between Cognitive radio node and the jammer is modelled using Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT). The results obtained from both models are improved further to find most suitable channel. The simulation results show that the anti-jamming system significantly decreases the probability of bit error to about 48% in the presences of reactive jammer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17315368","htmlLink":"/document/8085719/","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2017","displayDocTitle":"Radio frequency anti-jamming capability improvement for cognitive radio networks: An evolutionary game theoretical approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio frequency anti-jamming capability improvement for cognitive radio networks: An evolutionary game theoretical approach","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"ICSCN39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045133S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074809","isNumber":"8085405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074809","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8085405","articleId":"8085719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8085720,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In this paper, performance analysis of single precision floating point multiplier is done by using Karatsuba algorithm with Vedic technique for multiplication and different Parallel Prefix adders like Sklansky, Brent-Kung and Knowles adders for exponent addition. This combination provides lesser area to compute multiplication compared to that existing multipliers. Further, the performance parameters comparison is done in terms of area and delay.

A T-shaped slot is etched in the monopole to improve the wideband characteristics and also to improve the isolation. The proposed antenna covers the frequency range from 3.1 to 8.6 GHz at -10 dB with a bandwidth of 5.5 GHz. The fractional bandwidth obtained is 94%. The isolation obtained is greater than 17 dB. The envelope correlation coefficient of the proposed dual port UWB MIMO antenna is 60% better than the antennas reported in literature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of orthogonal dual port UWB MIMO antenna with IEEE 802.11ac band notch characteristic","publicationTitle":"2017 Fourth International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","doi":"10.1109/ICSCN.2017.8085730","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Fourth International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8074809/8085405/08085730.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCN.2017.8085730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8085405","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8085730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2017","displayDocTitle":"Design of orthogonal dual port UWB MIMO antenna with IEEE 802.11ac band notch characteristic","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8085730/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"17315434","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of orthogonal dual port UWB MIMO antenna with IEEE 802.11ac band notch characteristic","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"ICSCN69.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052554S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074809","isNumber":"8085405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074809","xplore-issue":"8085405","articleId":"8085730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8085736,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The work in this paper employs multi-objective optimization (MOO) based on archived multi-objective simulated annealing in order to obtain a diverse set of Pareto optimal solutions. The analysis formulates the siting and sizing optimization problem considering a MG with a Fast Direct Current Charging Station (FDCCS). The results of the simulation have revealed that the optimal solution results in a trade-off between increasing SAI and increased TAC. Finally, it was seen that the optimal siting and sizing of the WDGs are highly affected by the location of the FDCCS.","doi":"10.1109/ISGT.2017.8085960","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGT.2017.8085960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8085952","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8070902/8085952/08085960.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective optimization of energy storage and wind DGs for self-adequacy of microgrid equipped with fast DC charging station","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085960/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective optimization of energy storage and wind DGs for self-adequacy of microgrid equipped with fast DC charging station","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8085960/","accessionNumber":"17315137","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","conferenceDate":"23-26 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 April 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective optimization of energy storage and wind DGs for self-adequacy of microgrid equipped with fast DC charging station","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"ISGT2017000138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076418S","chronDate":"23-26 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8070902","isNumber":"8085952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8070902","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8085952","articleId":"8085960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8085971,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Hosein","affiliation":["The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Hosein","id":"37085722356"},{"name":"Patrick Hosein","affiliation":["The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Hosein","id":"37085618795"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2890-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2889-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2891-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8152"}],"articleNumber":"8085971","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1490},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Computer architecture","Load forecasting","Forecasting","Machine learning","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","load forecasting","neural nets","power engineering computing","power grids","pricing","smart meters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning techniques","periodic smart meter energy usage reports","peak loading","power grid","short-term load forecasting","DNN","shallow neural networks","power industry","power companies","short-term electricity demand prediction","deep neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Neural Networks","Machine Learning","Smart Grid","Load Forecasting"]}],"abstract":"Short-term electricity demand prediction is of great importance to power companies since it is required to ensure adequate capacity when needed and, in some cases, it is needed to estimate the supply of raw material (e.g., natural gas) required to produce the required capacity. The deregulation of the power industry in many countries has magnified the importance of this need. Research in this area has included the use of shallow neural networks and other machine learning algorithms to solve this problem. However, recent results in other areas, such as Computer Vision and Speech Recognition, have shown great promise for Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Unfortunately, far less research exists on the application of DNN to short-term load forecasting. In this paper, we apply DNN as well as other machine learning techniques to short-term load forecasting in a power grid. The data used is taken from periodic smart meter energy usage reports. Our results indicate that DNN performs quite well when compared to traditional approaches. We also show how these results can be used if dynamic pricing is introduced to reduce peak loading.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load forecasting using deep neural networks","doi":"10.1109/ISGT.2017.8085971","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGT.2017.8085971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8085952","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8070902/8085952/08085971.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8085971","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085971/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Load forecasting using deep neural networks","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8085971/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17315157","conferenceDate":"23-26 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load forecasting using deep neural networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"ISGT2017000036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053124S","chronDate":"23-26 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8070902","isNumber":"8085952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8070902","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8085952","articleId":"8085971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8085974,"authors":[{"name":"Muthanna Al-Sarray","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, Arkansas, USA"],"firstName":"Muthanna","lastName":"Al-Sarray","id":"37085778742"},{"name":"Roy A.

As the one of the most important missions, BTM-EMSs are responsible to reduce the customers' monthly demand peaks which is rewarded by significant decrease in the monthly demand charge. However, the unpredicted behavior of individual electricity loads casts a shadow over the profitability of installing BTM storage units. In this paper, a data driven demand charge management solution (DCMS) is proposed to find and realize the minimum achievable monthly demand peak, also called demand charge threshold (DCT), by appropriate battery storage charging and discharging. The proposed approach uses the last few months load profile to calculate time series of DCTs and then searches for the similar DCT time series of other observed loads stored in the data set. Finally, the obtained similar time series are employed to forecast the DCT of the coming month. The efficiency of the proposed approach is validated through the simulation studies on the real value load data.","doi":"10.1109/ISGT.2017.8085985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGT.2017.8085985","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8070902/8085952/08085985.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8085952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A data-driven demand charge management solution for behind-the-meter storage applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"A data-driven demand charge management solution for behind-the-meter storage applications","conferenceDate":"23-26 April 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8085985/","accessionNumber":"17315140","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8085985/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A data-driven demand charge management solution for behind-the-meter storage applications","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"ISGT2017000208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048997S","chronDate":"23-26 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8070902","isNumber":"8085952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8070902","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8085952","articleId":"8085985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8085988,"authors":[{"name":"Fathalla Eldali","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Co, USA"],"firstName":"Fathalla","lastName":"Eldali","id":"37085888528"},{"name":"Thomas Kirk","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Co, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Kirk","id":"37085989767"},{"name":"David Pinney","affiliation":["Business and Technology strategies, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, Arlington, VA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Pinney","id":"37085887500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2890-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2889-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2891-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8152"}],"articleNumber":"8085988","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Anomaly detection","Load flow","Meters","Information management","Detectors","Smart grids","System analysis and design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electricity supply industry","load flow","metering","power system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic power flow analysis","AMI data","theft detection","anomaly detection","Advanced Metering Infrastructure","rural electric cooperatives","data source","National Rural Electric Cooperative Association","open source computer software","consumer owned not-for-profit utilities","technical loss estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AMI","anomaly detection","distribution system","dynamic power flow"]}],"abstract":"Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) has been deployed at over 70% of rural electric cooperatives, and this new data source offers opportunities for valuable applications beyond billing.

With the advent of IEC 61850, contemporary Substation Automation Systems (SAS) are utilizing electronic instrument transformers and merging units to transmit current and voltage measurements over Ethernet as Sampled Measured Values (SMV). However, if a substation's network resources are not properly managed, the high transmission rate of SMV would make them prone to packet loss. Also, the strict 4ms time constraint imposed on SMVs makes encrypting these messages nearly impossible. As such, this paper presents an online device level fake data detection system for detecting fake SMV messages without violating the 4ms time constraint set forth by IEC 61850. In order to ensure a reliable SAS operation, this paper also presents a coupled neural network - time series method for forecasting lost SMV packets. The proposed algorithm was implemented in a system composed of merging units and intelligent electronic devices developed for this purpose.

At the same time, the abundance of renewable resources such as solar and wind coupled with constantly improving technologies to harvest them favor microgrid usage. On the other hand, the deployment of these resources throughout the electric grid has led to a more complex grid networks and cascaded converters at the microgrid level. However, interconnected converters create electrical resonances from conventional LCL filters which create stability concerns. This paper presents the results of using statistical data from a renewable energy solar PV source to design a network-based linear quadratic Gaussian optimal controller (LQG) to minimize resonance effects in a cascaded multi-converter microgrid system. The comparison of its performance with that of an open-loop uncompensated system indicates improvement with inclusion of the LQG controller thus improving generation capacity and reliability. Results are given with respect to an ac microgrid testbed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 April 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8086017/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17315148","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Linear quadratic Gaussian control for resonance damping in microgrids with cascaded converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear quadratic Gaussian control for resonance damping in microgrids with cascaded converters","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"ISGT2017000216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052857S","chronDate":"23-26 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8070902","isNumber":"8085952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8070902","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8085952","articleId":"8086017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8086020,"authors":[{"name":"Abdullah Alfadda","affiliation":["Virginia Tech-Advanced Research Institute, Arlington, VA"],"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Alfadda","id":"37086235074"},{"name":"Rajendra Adhikari","affiliation":["Virginia Tech-Advanced Research Institute, Arlington, VA"],"firstName":"Rajendra","lastName":"Adhikari","id":"37086143188"},{"name":"Murat Kuzlu","affiliation":["Virginia Tech-Advanced Research Institute, Arlington, VA"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Kuzlu","id":"37670307200"},{"name":"Saifur Rahman","affiliation":["Virginia Tech-Advanced Research Institute, Arlington, VA"],"firstName":"Saifur","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37288706000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2890-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2889-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2891-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8152"}],"articleNumber":"8086020","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":763},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solar energy","Forecasting","Photovoltaic systems","Support vector machines","Indexes","Linear regression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photovoltaic power systems","power grids","regression analysis","solar power","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hour-ahead solar PV power forecasting","SVR based approach","solar photovoltaic","solar output power","stable power grid","SVR forecasting model","support vector regression","polynomial regression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Solar Forecasting","Machine Learning","Support Vector Regression","Lasso"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8086020","abstract":"The use of solar photovoltaic (PV) in power generation has grown in the last decade. Unlike the traditional power generation methods (i.e. oil and gas), the solar output power is fluctuating and uncertain, mainly due to clouds movement and other weather factors. Therefore, in order to have a stable power grid, the electricity utilities need to forecast the solar output power, so they can prepare ahead adequately. In this work, hour-ahead solar PV power forecasting is performed using Support Vector Regression (SVR), Polynomial Regression and Lasso. The implemented regression models were tested under different feature selection schemes. These features include weather conditions (i.e. sky condition, temperature, etc.), power generated in the last few hours, day and time information. Based on the comparative results obtained, the SVR forecasting model outperforms the other two models in terms of accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ISGT.2017.8086020","pdfPath":"/iel7/8070902/8085952/08086020.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGT.2017.8086020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8085952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hour-ahead solar PV power forecasting using SVR based approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Hour-ahead solar PV power forecasting using SVR based approach","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17315174","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8086020/","conferenceDate":"23-26 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hour-ahead solar PV power forecasting using SVR based approach","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"ISGT2017000116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075383S","chronDate":"23-26 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8070902","isNumber":"8085952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8070902","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8085952","articleId":"8086020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":8086048,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Farajollahi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Farajollahi","id":"37085553689"},{"name":"Alireza Shahsavari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Shahsavari","id":"37072184000"},{"name":"Hamed Mohsenian-Rad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Mohsenian-Rad","id":"38283303100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2890-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2889-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2891-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8152"}],"articleNumber":"8086048","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":398},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Phasor measurement units","Power system harmonics","Impedance","Fault currents","Current measurement","Voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault location","phasor measurement","power distribution faults","power system harmonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution level phasor measurement units","synchronized harmonic phasors","power distribution system","harmonic synchrophasors","high impedance fault location identification","IEEE 33 bus test system","PSCAD"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8086048","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel method to identify the location of a high-impedance fault (HIF) in a power distribution system. The developed method uses synchronized harmonic phasors with focus on the third harmonic component. Such harmonic synchrophasors could be provided in practice, e.g., by distribution level phasor measurement units, a.k.a, \u03bcPMUs. In this regard, the location of the fault can be estimated based on the impedance that is calculated from the third harmonic voltage and current synchrophasors produced by the fault and captured by the \u03bcPMUs. In this method, both resistance and inductance are estimated, to allow fault location identification even in a network with multiple type conductors. Note that, the fault does not need to be fully observable. As few as two \u03bcPMUs would be sufficient to estimate the HIF location at least to certain accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulating the IEEE 33 bus test system in PSCAD.","doi":"10.1109/ISGT.2017.8086048","pdfPath":"/iel7/8070902/8085952/08086048.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGT.2017.8086048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8085952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Location identification of high impedance faults using synchronized harmonic phasors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086048/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Location identification of high impedance faults using synchronized harmonic phasors","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17315200","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8086048/","conferenceDate":"23-26 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location identification of high impedance faults using synchronized harmonic phasors","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"ISGT2017000261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054556S","chronDate":"23-26 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8070902","isNumber":"8085952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8070902","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8085952","articleId":"8086048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":8086078,"authors":[{"name":"Shuva Paul","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD, United States of America"],"firstName":"Shuva","lastName":"Paul","id":"37062093900"},{"name":"Zhen Ni","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD, United States of America"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Ni","id":"37085836160"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2890-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2889-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2891-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8152"}],"articleNumber":"8086078","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":413},"abstract":"Power grid infrastructures have been exposed to several terrorists and cyber attacks from different perspectives and have resulted in critical system failures. Among different attack strategies, simultaneous attack is feasible for the attacker if enough resources are available at the moment. In this paper, vulnerability analysis for simultaneous attack is investigated, using a modified cascading failure simulator with reduced calculation time than the existing methods. A new damage measurement matrix is proposed with the loss of generation power and time to reach the steady-state condition. The combination of attacks that can result in a total blackout in the shortest time are considered as the strongest simultaneous attack for the system from attacker's viewpoint. The proposed approach can be used for general power system test cases. In this paper, we conducted the experiments on W&W 6 bus system and IEEE 30 bus system for demonstration of the result. The modified simulator can automatically find the strongest attack combinations for reaching maximum damage in terms of generation power loss and time to reach black-out.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8070902/8085952/08086078.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)","doi":"10.1109/ISGT.2017.8086078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGT.2017.8086078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8085952","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8086078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vulnerability analysis for simultaneous attack in smart grid security","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart grids","Security","Malware","Generators","Power system stability","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","power system measurement","power system security","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vulnerability analysis","smart grid security","power grid infrastructures","reduced calculation time","general power system test cases","generation power loss","modified cascading failure simulator","damage measurement matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Simultaneous attack","smart grid security","total blackout","cascaded outage","cascaded failure simulator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086078/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Vulnerability analysis for simultaneous attack in smart grid security","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8086078/","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17315167","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","conferenceDate":"23-26 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vulnerability analysis for simultaneous attack in smart grid security","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"ISGT2017000065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070915S","chronDate":"23-26 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8070902","isNumber":"8085952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8070902","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8085952","articleId":"8086078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8086089,"authors":[{"name":"I.L.

The usual technique is to utilize a power system stabilizer to generate a control signal that is applied to the excitation of a large synchronous generator. In this paper, a different approach is taken: a control signal is obtained using estimated signals from a `dynamic state estimator', and the supplementary control is implemented using a static VAr compensator in the transmission circuit adjacent to a synchronous generator. The details of the design of the dynamic state estimator are given. A simple example is used to illustrate the concept. The paper is intended to show feasibility of a dynamic state estimator to provide a control signal for damping enhancement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086089/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 April 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8086089/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17315230","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic state estimator for the development of a control signal for power system damping enhancement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic state estimator for the development of a control signal for power system damping enhancement","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"ISGT2017000050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058113S","chronDate":"23-26 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8070902","isNumber":"8085952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8070902","xplore-issue":"8085952","articleId":"8086089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8086092,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Hahn","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Hahn","id":"37086248794"},{"name":"Rajveer Singh","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington"],"firstName":"Rajveer","lastName":"Singh","id":"37086250255"},{"name":"Chen-Ching Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington"],"firstName":"Chen-Ching","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086252686"},{"name":"Sijie Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Minhang, Qu, China"],"firstName":"Sijie","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085881015"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2890-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2889-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2891-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8152"}],"articleNumber":"8086092","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":2687},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Contracts","Transactive energy","Bitcoin","Pricing","Meters","Smart meters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","electronic money","power markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transactive agents","auctions operations","smart contract-based campus demonstration","cryptocurrencies","transactive energy auction","Vickrey second price auction","distributed ledger","distributed trust problem","transactive environments","distributed markets","distributed energy resources","transactive energy paradigms","decentralized transactive energy auctions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transactive Energy","Prosumers","Markets","Auctions","Blockchains","Smart Contracts"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8086092","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8070902/8085952/08086092.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGT.2017.8086092","doi":"10.1109/ISGT.2017.8086092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8085952","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart contract-based campus demonstration of decentralized transactive energy auctions","abstract":"Transactive energy paradigms will enable the exchange of energy from a distributed set of prosumers. While prosumers have access to distributed energy resources, these resources are intermittently available. There is a need for distributed markets to enable the exchange of energy in transactive environments, however, the large number of potential prosumers introduces challenges in the establishment of trust between prosumers. Markets for transactive environments create other challenges, such as establishing clearing prices for energy and exchanging money between prosumers. Blockchains provide a unique technology to address this distributed trust problem through the use of a distributed ledger, cryptocurrencies, and the execution of smart contracts. This paper introduces a smart contract that implements a transactive energy auction that operates without the need for a trusted entitys oversight. The auction mechanism implements a Vickrey second price auction, which guarantees bidders will submit honest bids. The contract is implemented on transactive agents on the WSU campus interacting with a 72kW PV array and the Ethereum blockchain. The contract is then used to execute auctions based on the energy from the the PV array and simulated building loads to demonstrate the auctions operations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086092/","conferenceDate":"23-26 April 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 April 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17315159","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8086092/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Smart contract-based campus demonstration of decentralized transactive energy auctions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart contract-based campus demonstration of decentralized transactive energy auctions","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"ISGT2017000275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061763S","chronDate":"23-26 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8070902","isNumber":"8085952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8070902","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"8085952","articleId":"8086092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8086100,"authors":[{"name":"Fengxiang Wang","affiliation":["Quanzhou Institute of Equipment Manufacturing, Haixi Institutes, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Jinjiang, 362200, China"],"firstName":"Fengxiang","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Xuezhu Mei","affiliation":["Institute for Electrical Drive Systems and Power Electronics, Technical University of Munich, Munich, 80333, Germany"],"firstName":"Xuezhu","lastName":"Mei"},{"name":"Jose Rodriguez","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Universidad Andr\u00e9s Bello, Santiago, 8370146, Chile"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Rodriguez"},{"name":"Ralph Kennel","affiliation":["Institute for Electrical Drive Systems and Power Electronics, Technical University of Munich, Munich, 80333, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralph","lastName":"Kennel"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2096-3564"}],"articleNumber":"8086100","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1372},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8086100","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cost function","Predictive control","Magnetic materials","Photonic crystals","Pulse width modulation","Switches","Inverters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Disturbance observer","electrical drive","encoderless control","predictive control"]}],"doi":"10.23919/TEMS.2017.8086100","endPage":"230","startPage":"219","publicationTitle":"CES Transactions on Electrical Machines and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"CES Transactions on Electrical Machines and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7873789/8086099/08086100.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/TEMS.2017.8086100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8086099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model predictive control for electrical drive systems-an overview","abstract":"This paper reviews the classification and application of the model predictive control (MPC) in electrical drive systems.

In recent years, convolutional neural networks have become a hot research topic in the remote sensing community, and have made great achievements in scene classification.

To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel scene classification method via triplet networks, which use weakly labeled images as network inputs. Besides, we initiate a theoretical study on the three existing loss functions for triplet networks, analyzing their different underlying mechanisms for dealing with \u201chard\u201d and/or \u201ceasy\u201d triplets during training. Furthermore, four new loss functions are constructed, aiming at laying more stress on \u201chard\u201d triplets to improve classification accuracy.

In this paper, we investigate the power-efficient transmissions with security concerns in the presence of a full-duplex (FD) active eavesdropper. With FD capability, the eavesdropper can launch jamming attacks while eavesdropping, which affects the legitimate transmissions, such that the legitimate power allocation becomes more favorable for eavesdropping. However, the jamming attacks require additional power consumption and result in self-interference at the eavesdropper itself. The legitimate user intends for a power-efficient manner to effectively guarantee the secure transmissions to defend against the simultaneous eavesdropping and jamming attacks. We formulate the problem within a Stackelberg game framework, where the eavesdropper takes action first as the leader and the legitimate user acts as the follower. We analyze the security game model for both single-channel and multi-channel cases. Furthermore, by exploring the properties of the game equilibrium, we propose the optimal transmission strategy and jamming strategy for the legitimate transmission and eavesdropping, respectively. Finally, we provide extensive simulation results to corroborate our theoretical analysis and evaluate the security performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2767283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","startPage":"24632","endPage":"24645","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08086124.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-Efficient Secure Transmission Against Full-Duplex Active Eavesdropper: A Game-Theoretic Framework","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6287639/7859429/8086124-aam.pdf","topic":"Recent Advances on Radio Access and Security Methods in 5G Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8086124/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Power-Efficient Secure Transmission Against Full-Duplex Active Eavesdropper: A Game-Theoretic Framework","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17381249","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61431011"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2016ZX03001016-005"},{"fundingName":"Key Research and Development Program of Shannxi Province","grantNumber":"2017ZDXM-GY-012"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"CNS-1717454, CNS-1731424, CNS-1702850, CNS-1646607, ECCS-1547201, CMMI-1434789, CNS-1443917 and ECCS-1405121"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Power-Efficient Secure Transmission Against Full-Duplex Active Eavesdropper: A Game-Theoretic Framework","sourcePdf":"access-tang-2767283-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.176351S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Recent Advances on Radio Access and Security Methods in 5G Networks"],"articleId":"8086124","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8086126,"authors":[{"name":"Adel Nazemi Babadi","affiliation":["K.

These types of topologies may require large number of switches and power supplies. This leads to higher cost and volume of the converter along with complicated control algorithms. Recently, a branch of multilevel converters is emerged as compact power conversion units, in which their \u201creduced-structure\u201d topologies use lower number of active and passive devices compared with the available topologies. Packed U-cell (PUC), a new reduced-structure multilevel converter, has been recently reported in the literature to reduce component count. PUC requires lesser active switches as compared to the existing counterparts. However, there are some drawbacks associated with this topology such as restricted maximum output voltage, high-voltage stress on switches, and limited performance to low-voltage applications. The available literature presents generalization of the topology with special asymmetrical source ratio, but no sufficient and effective investigations have been made for modified structures or other symmetrical or asymmetrical source ratio with cascaded configurations. In this paper, the issues associated with PUC are addressed and two approaches as remedy are presented. The first approach presents a comprehensive analysis of cascaded topologies with the proposed basic units, and the second approach is related to a new modified configuration on the basis of the conventional converter for improving the performance of the PUC in terms of total blocking voltage, switch ratings, and extending its performance to high-voltage applications. Moreover, the design of a novel 49-level modified structure and 147-level cascade inverter based on conventional PUC is analyzed under optimal number of dc sources and power switches to get the best possible topology as a solution. Finally, the experimental validations were performed by implementing laboratory prototypes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/8353171/08086126.pdf","startPage":"874","endPage":"887","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2017.2767499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2017.2767499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8353171","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8086126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Multilevel Inverters With Reduced Structures Based on PackedU-Cell","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Topology","Capacitors","Stress","Maintenance engineering","Power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cascade systems","harmonic distortion","invertors","switches","switching convertors","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PackedU-cell","complicated control algorithms","compact power conversion units","reduced-structure topologies","reduced-structure multilevel converter","cascaded topologies","total blocking voltage","switch ratings","power switches","total harmonic distortion","cascade inverter","high-quality staircase pseudosinusoidal voltage waveform","asymmetrical source ratio","voltage level reduction","power electronics components"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymmetrical dc sources","modified structure","multilevel inverter","packed U-cell (PUC)","reduced structures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Modified Multilevel Inverters With Reduced Structures Based on PackedU-Cell","volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8086126/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17736801","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Multilevel Inverters With Reduced Structures Based on PackedU-Cell","sourcePdf":"jestpe-nazemibabadi-2767499-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113155S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"8353171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8353171","articleId":"8086126","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8086130,"authors":[{"name":"Hailiang Xiong","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/8169217/8086130/xiong-2767066-small.gif","p":["Hailiang Xiong (M\u201911) received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in communication and information systems from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2005 and 2011, respectively.

Recently, Kalman filtering technique has become a standard approach for reducing errors in a least squares sense and is widely applied in navigation and positioning fields. Unfortunately, the traditional KF needs accurate statistical information about mobile terminal; otherwise, it will result in lower precision and even divergence. To make up for the deficiency of KF algorithm, this paper presents a novel robust single global position system (GPS) navigation algorithm based on dead reckoning and strong tracking filter (STF), which still has strong tracking ability even when precise knowledge of the system models is not available. The proposed algorithm utilizes adaptive fading factor to adjust the gain matrix in real time to satisfy the orthogonality principle (OP), which indicates all useful information has been extracted from residual. Furthermore, we define residual covariance (RC) as an important index to evaluate the performance of the filtering algorithm and deduce the closed relationship of RCs in KF under the case of: 1) inaccurate system model; 2) erroneous initial value; and 3) abrupt change of states, respectively. We find that the RCs of the KF algorithm under all three above-mentioned cases have a bias compared with desired ones; as a result, they do not conform to the OP and have poor tracking ability, while the RC of STF conforms to the OP due to the fading factor which indicates the tracking performance is greatly improved in the proposed algorithm. The theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed single GPS navigation algorithm based on STF outperforms that of the traditional KF algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2017.2767066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8169217","startPage":"290","endPage":"298","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/8169217/08086130.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust Single GPS Navigation and Positioning Algorithm Based on Strong Tracking Filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8086130/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Robust Single GPS Navigation and Positioning Algorithm Based on Strong Tracking Filtering","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2018","accessionNumber":"17414887","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"1","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401253, 61771292 and 61371110"},{"fundingName":"Key Research and Development Program of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"2017GGX201003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007129","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"ZR2016FM29 and ZR2015FM026"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Single GPS Navigation and Positioning Algorithm Based on Strong Tracking Filtering","sourcePdf":"jsen-xiong-2767066-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093334S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8169217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"8169217","articleId":"8086130","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8086132,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyu Lu","affiliation":["China National Digital Switching System Engineering and Technological Research and Development Center, Zhengzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8086132/lu-2766632-small.gif","p":["Zhiyu Lu was born in Qinhuangdao, China, in 1989.

DPD algorithms can make full use of the characteristics of signals to improve positioning performance. Using this localization mechanism as basis, this study develops a novel DPD algorithm that profits from the characteristics of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals based on the time and angle of arrival. First, the DPD optimization model is constructed based on maximum likelihood criterion and the characteristic of multiple carrier modulation technique of OFDM signals. Then, an extended subspace data fusion-based DPD algorithm is developed by constructing and decomposing the extended covariance matrices. The algorithm fuses the extended subspace data to estimate the target position without calculating the intermediate variables, which is less complex and more efficient. These properties can avoid the limitations of two-step algorithms. The last but important result is a derivation of the closed-form expression of Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on the position estimation variance for OFDM sources. Simulation results show that, the algorithm proposed in this paper outperforms existing DPD algorithms and conventional two-step localization algorithms. Especially under the condition of low signal-to-noise ratio, its localization accuracy is close to the CRLB.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08086132.pdf","startPage":"25312","endPage":"25321","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8086132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Direct Position Determination Algorithm for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Signals Based on the Time and Angle of Arrival","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Receivers","Transmitters","Estimation","Algorithm design and analysis","Wireless LAN","Position measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","direction-of-arrival estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","sensor fusion","sensor placement","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals","high estimation accuracy","DPD algorithm","positioning performance","DPD optimization model","OFDM signals","position estimation variance","signal-to-noise ratio","CRLB","Cramer-Rao lower bound","closed-form expression","extended covariance matrices","extended subspace data fusion","multiple carrier modulation technique","maximum likelihood criterion","target position calculuation","localization parameter estimation","direct position determination algorithm","angle-of-arrival estimation","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","direct position determination","maximum likelihood","Cramer-Rao lower bound"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Direct Position Determination Algorithm for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Signals Based on the Time and Angle of Arrival","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8086132/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17381337","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401513"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Novel Direct Position Determination Algorithm for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Signals Based on the Time and Angle of Arrival","sourcePdf":"access-lu-2766632-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080438S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8086132","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8086133,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Shickel","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Shickel","orcid":"0000-0002-5304-7027","id":"37085898901"},{"name":"Patrick James Tighe","affiliation":["Department of Anesthesiology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Patrick James","lastName":"Tighe","orcid":"0000-0002-1881-9941","id":"37085899385"},{"name":"Azra Bihorac","affiliation":["Department of Nephrology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Azra","lastName":"Bihorac","orcid":"0000-0002-5745-2863","id":"37086064194"},{"name":"Parisa Rashidi","affiliation":["J.

While primarily designed for archiving patient information and performing administrative healthcare tasks like billing, many researchers have found secondary use of these records for various clinical informatics applications. Over the same period, the machine learning community has seen widespread advances in the field of deep learning. In this review, we survey the current research on applying deep learning to clinical tasks based on EHR data, where we find a variety of deep learning techniques and frameworks being applied to several types of clinical applications including information extraction, representation learning, outcome prediction, phenotyping, and deidentification. We identify several limitations of current research involving topics such as model interpretability, data heterogeneity, and lack of universal benchmarks. We conclude by summarizing the state of the field and identifying avenues of future deep EHR research.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086133/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","volume":"22","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"18007301","pubMedId":"29989977","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8086133/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Deep EHR: A Survey of Recent Advances in Deep Learning Techniques for Electronic Health Record (EHR) Analysis","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000151","fundingName":"Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships","grantNumber":"1631871"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000057","fundingName":"National Institute of General Medical Sciences","grantNumber":"1R01GM114290 and R01GM-110240"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep EHR: A Survey of Recent Advances in Deep Learning Techniques for Electronic Health Record (EHR) Analysis","sourcePdf":"jbhi-shickel-2767063-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148298S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"8432070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"8432070","articleId":"8086133","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8086134,"authors":[{"name":"Massimiliano Guasoni","affiliation":["Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Massimiliano","lastName":"Guasoni","id":"37085469781"},{"name":"Francesca Parmigiani","affiliation":["Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Francesca","lastName":"Parmigiani","id":"37281529100"},{"name":"Peter Horak","affiliation":["Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Horak","id":"37283671600"},{"name":"Julien Fatome","affiliation":["Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire Carnot de Bourgogne, UMR 6303 CNRS\u2014Universit\u00e9 Bourgogne Franche-Comt\u00e9, Dijon, France"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Fatome","id":"37284903900"},{"name":"David J.

The power splitting (PS) scheme is adopted at FD-B to receive information and energy concurrently. In order to maximize the energy harvested by FD-B while considering the constraints of signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) and maximum transmit power at both nodes, we jointly design the optimal transmit power of FD-A and FD-B, as well as the PS ratio of FD-B. Unfortunately, the primal problem is non-convex and is not always feasible with different parameters. Thus, we first present a set of conditions, under which the feasibility of the primal problem is guaranteed. Then, we derive the closed form of the optimal solution with the aid of analyzing the feasible region of the problem. Furthermore, the influences of the parameters on the maximum harvested energy are theoretically analyzed.

In order to achieve a good trade-off between the energy consumption and the total capacity, we investigate the joint downlink power and time-slot allocation problem, taking into account the limitation of resource, collaborative coverage of multi-satellite, and dynamism, which is proved to be a Pareto optimization and NP-hard problem. Different from the existing 1-D multi-objective optimization algorithm (1D-MOA) based on meta-heuristics, such as immune clonal algorithm (ICA), we propose an improved 2-D dynamic immune clonal algorithm (TDICA) to search the solution space for approaching the Pareto front. From simulation results, several important concluding remarks are obtained as follows: 1) the proposed TDICA can obtain more non-dominated solutions in each iteration with better accuracy than existing algorithms; 2) with inter-satellite resource optimization, the total capacity can be improved; 3) compared with 1D-MOAs, the 2D-MOA can save more energy and achieve higher total capacity; d) MOAs can be transferred into multiple single-objective optimization algorithms (SOAs) under certain conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086140/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17381275","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8086140/","publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Joint Downlink Power and Time-Slot Allocation for Distributed Satellite Cluster Network Based on Pareto Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61231011 and 91338021"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint Downlink Power and Time-Slot Allocation for Distributed Satellite Cluster Network Based on Pareto Optimization","sourcePdf":"access-zhong-2767061-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100343S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8086140","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8086146,"authors":[{"name":"Giacomo Tanganelli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8288638/8086146/tanga-2767381-small.gif","p":["Giacomo Tanganelli received the master\u2019s and Ph.D. degrees in computer systems engineering from the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in 2012 and 2016, respectively.","He is a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa.

In this context, Fog/Edge computing will represent an opportunity to deploy IoT gateways in proximity of IoT domains, meeting the requirements of applications needing low-latency interactions with devices. In this paper, we present an edge-centric distributed architecture to provide resource discovery and access services to IoT applications. The proposed approach leverages the CoRE Resource Directory interface and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to expose a standard interface for global discovery and access. Multiple IoT gateways are federated through a peer-to-peer overlay implemented by a distributed hash table, which is exploited to share the information on IoT resources available across multiple domains. The proposed solution is validated by means of a small-scale prototype, and extensively evaluated through emulation in large scale deployment in comparison to a centralized Cloud-based approach. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach guarantees lower latencies than a centralized solution and can ensure scalability for small to medium sized deployments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8288638/08086146.pdf","startPage":"425","endPage":"438","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things

division multiplexing (PDM) doubles the bitrate of flexible transponders, whereas the joint effects of fast state of polarization (SOP) rotations, first-order polarization mode dispersion (PMD), and second-order PMD (SOPMD) would severely degrade the system performance. In this paper, we propose and experimentally validate a novel dynamic polarization demultiplexing scheme using extended Kalman filter (EKF) in digital signal processing of flexible receivers. The idea comes from two-stage PMD compensator in optical domain to perform SOP tracking and equalization of first-order PMD and SOPMD. After parameters optimization of EKF, the scheme can track up SOP rotations more than 35 times and 50 times faster than that of constant modulus algorithm (CMA) and CMA/multiple modulus algorithm (MMA), respectively. More importantly, when SOP keeps a fast rotation of 1.00, 10.00, or 20.02 Mrad/s, the system tolerances of first-order PMD and SOPMD that the joint scheme achieves are 28.57 ps and 793 ps\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n for 28 GBaud PDM-QPSK at optical signal-to-noise rate (OSNR) of 17 dB, and 50 ps and 4836 ps\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n for 10 GBaud PDM-16 quadratic-amplitude modulation (QAM) at OSNR of 23 dB, respectively. In addition, the proposed scheme has a fast convergence speed of about 50 symbols (equal to 5 ns). The calculation complexities of each symbol that the proposed scheme consumes are just about 44% of CMA for PDM-QPSK, and 31% of CMA/MMA for PDM-16 QAM.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2767032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8080089","startPage":"1","endPage":"15","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/8080089/08086147.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2767032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Scheme of Dynamic Polarization Demultiplexing and PMD Compensation Up To Second Order for Flexible Receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber communication","Optical polarization","Optical fiber polarization","Optical fiber dispersion","Transponders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","Kalman filters","nonlinear filters","quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","transponders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic polarization demultiplexing","polarization division multiplexing","PMD compensation","flexible receivers","flexible transponders bitrate","state of polarization rotations","SOP rotations","first-order polarization mode dispersion","extended Kalman filter","EKF","digital signal processing","two-stage PMD compensator","optical domain","SOP tracking","SOP equalization","PDM-QPSK","optical signal-to-noise rate","OSNR","PDM-16 quadratic-amplitude modulation","QAM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polarization demultiplexing","PMD compensation","flexible receivers","optical fiber communication."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint Scheme of Dynamic Polarization Demultiplexing and PMD Compensation Up To Second Order for Flexible Receivers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086147/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2017","externalId":"7204615","volume":"9","issue":"6","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8086147/","impactStatement":"Borrowing the idea of two-stage optical PMD compensator, we propose a novel dynamic polarization demultiplexing scheme based on extended Kalman filter in DSP of flexible receivers.

However, fitting complete neural networks into multiple, uniformly sized crossbars often results in poor memristor and neuron utilization. In this paper, we propose the use of smaller crossbar tiles that can be flexibly combined to create a variety of crossbar sizes and aspect ratios to more closely fit the ideal sizes required. We examine the throughput/power and throughput/area metrics of custom versus tiled designs for three different neural network applications, representing widely differing design points. We demonstrate that a general purpose neural processor, using a single tile size, compares reasonably with highly specialized neural processor designs using multiple, optimally sized custom crossbars. These results indicate that general purpose memristive crossbar-based neural processors are practical.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086156/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","volume":"8","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17669807","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8086156/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Memristor Crossbar Tiles in a Flexible, General Purpose Neural Processor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memristor Crossbar Tiles in a Flexible, General Purpose Neural Processor","sourcePdf":"jetcas-mountain-2767024-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113433S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"8330765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8330765","articleId":"8086156","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8086163,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Taghi Teimoori","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Taghi","lastName":"Teimoori","orcid":"0000-0002-4660-7460","id":"37086373266"},{"name":"Alireza Ejlali","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Ejlali","orcid":"0000-0001-6451-0526","id":"37318161300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0663"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0671"}],"articleNumber":"8086163","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Instruction-Level Quality-Aware Method for Exploiting STT-RAM Read Approximation Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8086163","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Random access memory","Energy consumption","Magnetic tunneling","Approximation algorithms","Radiation detectors","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate read","incorrect read decision approximation technique","instruction-level quality-aware method","STT-RAM read approximation techniques","read disturb spin-transfer torque RAM approximation technique","approximate write","application QoR","quality of result","spin transfer torque random access memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate memories","memory systems","read disturb (RD)"]}],"abstract":"Although the read disturb spin-transfer torque RAM approximation technique improves performance, it may consist of an approximate read plus an approximate write both at the same time.

In this context, we extend the analysis performed for SI-IT2-FPID controllers by providing the effect of the FOU parameters on control surface (CS) generation. We show that, by only adjusting a single parameter that shapes the FOU, it is possible to generate commonly employed CSs without a requirement of an optimization assistance. In order to validate our theoretical analysis, we present comparative real world quadcopter flight tests. The real-time experimental results show that the SI-IT2-FPID controller can achieve better control performance in the presence of uncertainties and strong wind conditions when compared to its type-1 and conventional counterparts. We believe that the results of this study will open the doors to a wider use of SI-IT2-FPID controllers in real world control applications as the proposed structure is easy to design and feasible to deploy, especially in real-time control systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8291767/08086165.pdf","startPage":"5069","endPage":"5077","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2767546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2767546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8291767","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8086165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controllers Made Even Simpler: From Design to Deployment for UAVs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Uncertainty","Real-time systems","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Trajectory tracking","Fuzzy sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","control system analysis","control system synthesis","fuzzy control","fuzzy set theory","helicopters","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uncertainty parameters","control signal generation","specially structured interval type-2 fuzzy logic controllers","IT2 fuzzy PID","SI-IT2-FPID controller","control surface generation","control performance","real-time control systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design and deployment","interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy logic control","three-dimensional (3-D) trajectory tracking","unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086165/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controllers Made Even Simpler: From Design to Deployment for UAVs","volume":"65","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8086165/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17578093","dateOfInsertion":"15 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ST Engineering\u2013NTU Corporate Lab"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controllers Made Even Simpler: From Design to Deployment for UAVs","sourcePdf":"tie-kayacan-2767546-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111269S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8291767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8291767","articleId":"8086165","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8086168,"authors":[{"name":"Yunkai Wu","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering and Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Internet of Things and Control Technologies, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8839652/8086168/wu-2757264-small.gif","p":["Yunkai Wu was born in Jiangsu, China, 1989.

Compared with traditional land-fixed cranes, offshore cranes work in noninertial (ship) frames and their movements are significantly influenced by such complicated disturbances as sea waves, etc. Hence, the control issue of offshore cranes presents much more challenges. At present, existing controllers for offshore cranes are designed based upon linearized dynamics, and they need the accurate values of the plant parameters. However, the values of the parameters, including cargo/jib masses, are usually difficult to measure or even unknown, which makes exact gravitational force compensation difficult and unavoidably results in positioning errors for luffing and hoisting/lowering control. To deal with these practical issues, we suggest a novel model-parameter-free control approach to achieve effective control for underactuated offshore crane systems. By constructing an elaborate storage function, we provide a complete Lyapunov-based stability analysis. As far as we know, this paper provides the first control strategy to asymptotically regulate an offshore crane system subject to parametric uncertainties and ship-induced perturbations, which is developed without simplifying the original nonlinear dynamic equations. At last, a series of experimental results, carried out on a self-built offshore crane hardware platform, are presented to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the presented control scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086171/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17447575","volume":"65","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8086171/","publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Antiswing Control of Offshore Cranes With Unknown Parameters and Persistent Ship-Induced Perturbations: Theoretical Design and Hardware Experiments","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61503200"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006606","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin","grantNumber":"15JCQNJC03800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016M600186 and 2017T100153"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Antiswing Control of Offshore Cranes With Unknown Parameters and Persistent Ship-Induced Perturbations: Theoretical Design and Hardware Experiments","sourcePdf":"tie-sun-2767523-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134758S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8214929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8214929","articleId":"8086171","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8086176,"authors":[{"name":"Rajshekhar Vishweshwar Bhat","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7511293/8318827/8086176/bhat-2767202-small.gif","p":["Rajshekhar Vishweshwar Bhat (S\u201915) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical and communication engineering from the National Institute of Technology, India, in 2010 and the M.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India, in 2012.

The transmitter has access to the channel statistics, but does not know the exact channel state. In layered coding, the codewords are first designed for a given finite set of channel states at different rates, and then the codewords are either time-multiplexed or superimposed before the transmission, leading to two transmission strategies. The receiver then decodes the information adaptively based on the realized channel state. The transmitter is equipped with a finite-capacity battery having non-zero internal resistance. In each of the transmission strategies, we first formulate and study an average rate maximization problem with non-causal knowledge of the harvested power variations. We also highlight the structural properties of the optimal solutions. Further, assuming statistical knowledge and causal information of the harvested power variations, we propose a sub-optimal algorithm, and compare it with the stochastic dynamic programming-based solution and a greedy policy. By numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the average rate decreases by approximately 20% when the internal resistance of the battery is increased from 0 \u03a9 to 50 \u03a9 in all the policies.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/7511293/8318827/08086176.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"142","doi":"10.1109/TGCN.2017.2767202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGCN.2017.2767202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Harvesting Communications Without Transmitter Channel State Information Using Layered Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086176/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Energy Harvesting Communications Without Transmitter Channel State Information Using Layered Coding","htmlLink":"/document/8086176/","publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 March 2018","accessionNumber":"17633690","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Harvesting Communications Without Transmitter Channel State Information Using Layered Coding","sourcePdf":"tgcn-bhat-2767202-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117479S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7511293","isNumber":"8318827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7511293","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8318827","articleId":"8086176","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8086177,"authors":[{"name":"Haichao Wang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7511293/8318827/8086177/hwang-2767203-small.gif","p":["Haichao Wang received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from the College of Communications Engineering, Nanjing, China, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in communications and information system.

The goal is to maximize the average throughput within a time horizon while satisfying the energy causality constraint under a generalized harvest-transmit-store model, which results in a non-convex problem. By introducing the Lagrangian relaxation method, we analytically show that the behavior of all D2D pairs at each time slot is exclusive: harvesting energy or transmitting information signals. The formulated non-convex optimization problem is thus transformed into a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINIP). We then design an efficient resource allocation algorithm to solve this MINIP, where D.C. (difference of two convex functions) programming and golden section method are combined to achieve a suboptimal solution. Furthermore, we provide an idea to reduce the computational complexity for facilitating the application in practice.

The advantages are that dual-side wireless communication for real-time charging current/voltage adjustment is avoided as well as it is suitable for different charging modes, e.g., constant voltage (CV) and constant current (CC) charging defined by the battery charging profile. The load identification approach, which utilizes reflected impedance theory and quadrature transformation algorithm for calculating the active power, is proposed to estimate the equivalent load resistance of battery. Then, the CV/CC charging for both SS and SP compensation are achieved by the PI-controlled phase-shift H-bridge inverter. The simulation and experimental results validate the feasibility of proposed control method. During the CC charging, 3.01 and 3.03 A for SS and SP compensation with the error of 1.2% and 1.4% are achieved. During the CV charging, 25.8 and 25.7 V for SS and SP compensation with the error of 1.1% and 1.3% are realized.

Our design aims to maximize the number of scheduled non-prioritized links and their sum rate, while guaranteeing the minimum required rates of all active prioritized and non-prioritized links. We present the problem formulation as a single-stage optimization problem, which simultaneously maximizes the number of scheduled non-prioritized links and their sum rate. We propose a monotonic-based optimal approaching (MBOA) algorithm to solve this problem by employing the monotonic global optimization technique and an efficient rounding procedure. We prove that the MBOA algorithm can schedule the maximum number of non-prioritized links with slight and controllable degradation in the minimum required rates of non-prioritized links. For low-complexity design, we propose an iterative convex approximation algorithm, which sequentially performs power allocation and link removal in each iteration. We then describe how the proposed algorithms can be implemented in the standardized LTE-based cellular system. Finally, we conduct numerical studies for device-to-device communications underlaid cellular networks under perfect or imperfect channel state information (CSI). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can be applied to the imperfect CSI scenario with slight degradation in the network performance. Moreover, in the perfect CSI scenario, the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the conventional algorithms both in the number of scheduled non-prioritized links and their sum rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8249510/08086180.pdf","startPage":"310","endPage":"323","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2765309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2765309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8249510","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8086180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Prioritized Scheduling and Resource Allocation for OFDMA-Based Wireless Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Wireless communication","Algorithm design and analysis","Approximation algorithms","Device-to-device communication","Cellular networks","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","cellular radio","convex programming","frequency division multiple access","iterative methods","Long Term Evolution","OFDM modulation","radio links","resource allocation","telecommunication scheduling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless links","sum rate","single-stage optimization problem","monotonic global optimization technique","MBOA algorithm","nonprioritized links","iterative convex approximation algorithm","power allocation","link removal","device-to-device communications underlaid cellular networks","OFDMA-based wireless networks","rounding procedure","joint prioritized link scheduling and resource allocation","standardized LTE-based cellular system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Link scheduling","cellular networks","resource allocation","subchannel assignment","power allocation","monotonic optimization","convex approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint Prioritized Scheduling and Resource Allocation for OFDMA-Based Wireless Networks","volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8086180/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17535335","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Prioritized Scheduling and Resource Allocation for OFDMA-Based Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-le-2765309-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146158S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8249510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8249510","articleId":"8086180","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8086182,"authors":[{"name":"Guang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8291762/8086182/yang-2767041-small.gif","p":["Guang Yang received the B.E. degree in communication engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2010.

Results show that, under a sum-power constraint, the rate of FD-AF mm-wave relaying outperforms its HD counterpart only when antennas with narrower beamwidth and smaller self-interference coefficient are applied. However, when the sum-power budget is sufficiently high or the beamwidth of directional antenna is sufficiently small, direct transmission becomes the best strategy, rather than the AF relaying schemes.

Cloud-enabled radio access networks (CE-RANs) where intelligence is placed at the edge of the mobile network and in the proximity of end users emerge as a promising solution to improve online experience. To make CE-RAN more flexible and cost-effective, network functions virtualization and software defined networking technologies are employed, enabling features such as resource pooling, scalability, spectral efficiency, and multi tenancy. The accommodation of such technologies in the context of 5G requires multipronged efforts at various levels, in particular at the management and orchestration. Among all topics that falls into this subject, e.g., resource optimization and efficient lifecycle management, this paper focuses on two critical challenges, i.e., service mapping and quality of service assurance. Particularly, the proposed service placement solution takes into account two main constraints, i.e., quality of user experience and limited hardware capabilities available at the network edge. Simulation tools as well as the SESAME testbed have been used to extract results in this paper and a proof-of-concept evaluation is presented.","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2017.2767100","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel7/4275028/8170467/08086187.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2017.2767100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170467","startPage":"904","endPage":"919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Service Mapping and Orchestration Over Multi-Tenant Cloud-Enabled RAN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8086187","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Service Mapping and Orchestration Over Multi-Tenant Cloud-Enabled RAN","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086187/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415012","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8086187/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010661","fundingName":"H2020 5G-PPP project SESAME","grantNumber":"671596"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Service Mapping and Orchestration Over Multi-Tenant Cloud-Enabled RAN","sourcePdf":"tnsm-kourtis-2767100-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076129S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"8170467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8170467","articleId":"8086187","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8086193,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled A.

This paper proposes a new traveling-wave (TW)-based method to detect, classify, and locate different dc fault types in MVDC microgrids. Unlike the existing TW-based protection and fault location methods, the proposed technique: (1) utilizes only the first locally measured TW after the inception of a fault and (2) focuses on the waveshape properties and polarity of the TW, rather than its arrival time. Therefore, the proposed method is faster than the existing techniques, and also requires no form of communication. As a result, it can effectively operate as both primary and backup protection. The proposed method is robust against high-resistance faults, and has been tested for fault resistances of up to 200 \u03a9. The performance of the proposed scheme has been assessed using a \u00b12.5 kV TN-S grounded MVDC microgrid under various conditions. The results verify the scheme's ultra-high-speed, accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity, and independence from system configuration. The concepts discussed in this paper are independent of the voltage level.

However, since this type of protection differs from the available commercial relays, it is important to test the algorithm performance implemented in hardware. So, this paper presents a performance evaluation of the hardware implementation of an ANN-based algorithm for anti-islanding protection of distributed generators. For the evaluation process, a complete digital relay architecture is developed in LabVIEW, thus allowing its implementation in the commercial real-time platform cRIO-9025/cRIO-9018. The proposed scheme is tested under real conditions by means of the CMC-256-plus test set, as performed for conventional intelligent electronic devices. The proposed algorithm implemented in hardware shows high effectiveness, detecting all islanding conditions within 1 s, sharing the same good performance verified by computational simulations. The algorithm implementation shows robustness, as it remains blocked for other power grid disturbances, such as frequency variation in the grid utility, massive connection or load relief.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8291767/08086195.pdf","startPage":"5051","endPage":"5059","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

First, the two-dimensional (2-D) soft input and soft output (SISO) MMSE equalization intended for magnetic recording channels, i.e., 2-D intersymbol interference (ISI), is extended to the detection of MFTN signals. Although the 2-D MMSE turbo equalization exhibits an attractive bit-error-rate (BER) performance under certain time-frequency spacing packing between adjacent symbols/subcarriers, the BER performance will be degraded when introducing serious intercarrier interference. Second, a 1-D SISO MMSE equalization combined with soft successive interference cancellation (SIC) is further proposed for the detection of MFTN signals, and it shows that the MMSE equalization combined with SIC could asymptotically approach the maximum a posterior equalization combined with SIC with negligible BER performance loss. Our computational complexity analysis and numerous simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MMSE turbo equalization schemes may be more preferred choice in the practical detection of MFTN signals.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication system signaling","Time-frequency analysis","Silicon carbide","Interference","Phase shift keying","Complexity theory","Magnetic recording"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","equalisers","error statistics","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","maximum likelihood detection","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","radio spectrum management","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MFTN signals","2-D MMSE turbo equalization","time-frequency spacing packing","soft successive interference cancellation","SIC","maximum a posterior equalization","mean-squared error turbo equalization","magnetic recording channels","2-D intersymbol interference","bit-error-rate performance","BER performance loss","multicarrier faster-than-Nyquist signaling","2D intercarrier interference","1D SISO MMSE equalization","computational complexity analysis","spectral efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multicarrier modulation","faster-than-Nyquist signaling","intersymbol interference","intercarrier interference","minimum mean-squared error","turbo equalization"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2767035","startPage":"2267","endPage":"2275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8318405/08086198.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2767035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE Turbo Equalization and Detection for Multicarrier Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"MMSE Turbo Equalization and Detection for Multicarrier Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling","accessionNumber":"17633276","publicationDate":"March 2018","volume":"67","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8086198/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086198/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671476"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE Turbo Equalization and Detection for Multicarrier Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling","sourcePdf":"tvt-peng-2767035-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127125S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8318405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8318405","articleId":"8086198","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":8086201,"authors":[{"name":"Jason K.

Mitigation of sneak paths in the crossbar array, however, requires additional layers in fabrication technology to impede current flow in order to avoid undesired changes to the state when reading and writing to and from the array. This results in an unavoidable increase in the vertical stacking dimension of the array. With the recent emergence of bistable memristors under both dc and ac, by adopting their asymptotic dynamics, we realize a significant improvement in memory construct and spatial constraints of memristor crossbar arrays. In this brief, we formalize a method of configuring a whole array architecture to any permutation of states without sacrificing array density by using a rigorous theoretical analysis, and confirmed via simulation.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2017.2767078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8118325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2017.2767078","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8118325/08086201.pdf","startPage":"1402","endPage":"1406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximization of Crossbar Array Memory Using Fundamental Memristor Theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Maximization of Crossbar Array Memory Using Fundamental Memristor Theory","volume":"64","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8086201/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17390392","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086201/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea through the Korean Government","grantNumber":"NRF-2017R1D1A1A09000613"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000996","fundingName":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Australia\u2013Korea Foundation","grantNumber":"AKF00640"},{"fundingName":"RCA Grants"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100011264","fundingName":"People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under REA","grantNumber":"PCOFUND-GA-2012-600181"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximization of Crossbar Array Memory Using Fundamental Memristor Theory","sourcePdf":"tcsii-cho-2767078-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051827S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8118325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8118325","articleId":"8086201","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8086203,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Woon Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Military Information Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Woon","lastName":"Jeon","orcid":"0000-0002-0199-2254","id":"37292894500"},{"name":"Bang Chul Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bang Chul","lastName":"Jung","orcid":"0000-0002-4485-9592","id":"37289794700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8086203","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":366},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8086203","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor fusion","Fading channels","Wireless sensor networks","Estimation error","Encoding","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","multi-access systems","probability","sensor fusion","telecommunication network reliability","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["function estimation error","adaptive analog function computation","multiple sensors","fusion center","desired function","wireless channels","causal channel state information","outage probability","causal CSI","local CSI","superposition property","AFC","fading multiple-access channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Function computation","analog function computation","fading multiple-access channels","adaptive transmission","channel state information"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose an adaptive analog function computation (AFC) via fading multiple-access channels in which multiple sensors simultaneously send their observations and then the fusion center computes the desired function via the superposition property of wireless channels.

In this paper, we propose a downlink transmission scheme leveraging cooperative device-to-device (D2D) communications and network coding, which can largely reduce the cellular resource consumption and the total energy consumption. In the proposed scheme, the base station generates and broadcasts linear combinations based on the packets requested by different user equipments (UEs) until at least one mature UE can recover all the original packets. Then, a selected mature UE broadcasts new linear combinations based on the recovered original packets to neighbors via D2D until all UEs can decode their packets. A feasible and backward-compatible system design including the necessary revisions on the protocol stack based on the current cellular system architecture is also provided. Then, the closed-form probability mass functions of transmission times for both cellular and D2D transmissions are derived, where the error rates in both cellular and D2D transmissions have been considered. The feedback load is also analyzed. Simulation results with different block error rate (BLER) settings are given, which can be used as references for the cellular network to decide the target BLER and adapt the modulation and coding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Device-to-Device Communication With Network Coding for Machine Type Communication Devices","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2765306","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8249510/08086215.pdf","startPage":"296","endPage":"309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2765306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8249510","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8086215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086215/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Device-to-Device Communication With Network Coding for Machine Type Communication Devices","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8086215/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17535378","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61461035"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004763","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia","grantNumber":"2015MS0602"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Device-to-Device Communication With Network Coding for Machine Type Communication Devices","sourcePdf":"twc-cai-2765306-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092754S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8249510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8249510","articleId":"8086215","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8086216,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Ma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/8114348/8086216/ma-2750760-small.gif","p":["Ning Ma obtained the M.Sc. degree with distinction in advanced\n computer science in 2003 and the Ph.D. degree in hearing-inspired approaches to automatic speech recognition in 2008,\n both from the University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K. He has been a Visiting Research Scientist at the University of\n Washington, Seattle, WA, USA, and a Research Fellow at the MRC Institute of Hearing Research, Nottingham, U.K.,\n working on auditory scene analysis with cochlear implants.

DNNs are used to learn the relationship between the source azimuth and binaural cues, consisting of the complete cross-correlation function (CCF) and interaural level differences (ILDs). In contrast to many previous binaural hearing systems, the proposed approach is not restricted to localization of sound sources in the frontal hemifield. Due to the similarity of binaural cues in the frontal and rear hemifields, front-back confusions often occur. To address this, a head movement strategy is incorporated in the localization model to help reduce the front-back errors. The proposed DNN system is compared to a Gaussian-mixture-model-based system that employs interaural time differences (ITDs) and ILDs as localization features. Our experiments show that the DNN is able to exploit information in the CCF that is not available in the ITD cue, which together with head movements substantially improves localization accuracies under challenging acoustic scenarios, in which multiple talkers and room reverberation are present.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086216/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17390341","htmlLink":"/document/8086216/","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"12","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Deep Neural Networks and Head Movements for Robust Binaural Localization of Multiple Sources in Reverberant Environments","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union FP7 project","grantNumber":"618075"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Exploiting Deep Neural Networks and Head Movements for Robust Binaural Localization of Multiple Sources in Reverberant Environments","sourcePdf":"taslp-ma-2750760-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090509S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"8114348","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"8114348","articleId":"8086216","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8086218,"authors":[{"name":"Bingcheng Zhu","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8291762/8086218/zhu-2767039-small.gif","p":["Bingcheng Zhu received the B.A.Sc. degree in information engineering from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2015.

However, these techniques fail for lognormal fading channels because the Taylor series of the PDF of a lognormal random variable is zero at the origin and the MGF does not have an explicit form. Although lognormal fading model has been widely applied in wireless communications and free-space optical communications, few analytical tools are available to provide elegant performance expressions for correlated lognormal channels. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to analyze the asymptotic outage probabilities of selection combining (SC), equal-gain combining (EGC), and maximum-ratio combining (MRC) over equally correlated lognormal fading channels. Based on these closed-form results, we show: 1) the outage probability of EGC or MRC becomes an infinitely small quantity compared to that of SC at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); 2) channel correlation can cause an infinite performance loss at high SNR; and 3) negatively correlated lognormal channels can outperform the independent lognormal channels. The analyses reveal insights into the long-standing problem of asymptotic performance analyses over correlated lognormal channels, and circumvent the time-consuming Monte Carlo simulation and numerical integration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086218/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","volume":"66","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"17578003","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8086218/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A New Asymptotic Analysis Technique for Diversity Receptions Over Correlated Lognormal Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Asymptotic Analysis Technique for Diversity Receptions Over Correlated Lognormal Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tcomm-cheng-2767039-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18668S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8291762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8291762","articleId":"8086218","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8086220,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Elforjani","affiliation":["University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8307303/8086220/elfor-2767551-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Elforjani received the B.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering\n from Tripoli University, Tripoli, Libya, in 1991, the M.Sc. degree in process system engineering and the Ph.D. degree\n in condition monitoring of rotating machines from Cranfield University, Cranfield, U.K., in 2003 and 2010,\n respectively.","Since November 2016, he has been a Senior Lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, U.K., where he\n teaches Mechanical Vibration, Dynamics, and Condition Monitoring Techniques.

To keep machines function at optimal levels, fault prognosis model to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of machine components is required. This model is used to analyze the output signals of a machine whilst in operation and accordingly helps to set an early alarm tool that reduces the untimely replacement of components and the wasteful machine downtime. Recent improvements indicate the drive on the way towards incorporation of prognosis and diagnosis machine learning techniques in future machine health management systems. With this in mind, this work employs three supervised machine learning techniques; support vector machine regression, multilayer artificial neural network model and gaussian process regression, to correlate AE features with corresponding natural wear of slow speed bearings throughout series of laboratory experiments. Analysis of signal parameters such as signal intensity estimator and root mean square was undertaken to discriminate individual types of early damage. It was concluded that neural networks model with back propagation learning algorithm has an advantage over the other models in estimating the RUL for slow speed bearings if the proper network structure is chosen and sufficient data is provided.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2767551","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8307303/08086220.pdf","startPage":"5864","endPage":"5871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2767551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8307303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prognosis of Bearing Acoustic Emission Signals Using Supervised Machine Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8086220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086220/","displayDocTitle":"Prognosis of Bearing Acoustic Emission Signals Using Supervised Machine Learning","volume":"65","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17630175","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8086220/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prognosis of Bearing Acoustic Emission Signals Using Supervised Machine Learning","sourcePdf":"tie-elforjani-2767551-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100257S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8307303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8307303","articleId":"8086220","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8086379,"authors":[{"name":"Lianping Hou","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K."],"firstName":"Lianping","lastName":"Hou","id":"37287700900"},{"name":"Song Tang","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K."],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Tang","id":"37075766800"},{"name":"John H.

During the last decade reservoir computing (RC) has proven to be a powerful machine learning concept using recurrent networks to process sequential information streams [1]. Lately, the concept of RC was drastically simplified to reduce hardware requirements, thus making machine learning concepts more obtainable to apply in actual physical systems [2]. RC has been implemented in photonic configurations and has efficient\u00ecy processed analog optical signals following simple schemes and minimal training overhead. Especially the realization using a semiconductor laser with time-delayed optical feedback has shown the potential of all-optical machine learning, utilizing signals with transient states at the GHz regime [3].In this work we exploit the properties of a small-scale RC in order to improve the detection capabilities of lightwave communication signals of very low quality. The RC has a limited number of virtual nodes (N=33) and a total internal time-delay of 1.65ns in order to allow fast post-processing. Its design follows an all-optical configuration, including a discrete-mode semiconductor laser (SL) that emits at 1550nm and an optical feedback cavity, as presented in [3]. We numerically simulate the lightwave communication signals by considering an onoff keying modulated binary stream at 10Gb/s that has undergone 2000 km of fiber transmission (20 segments of 100-km spools including optical amplification and dispersion compensation). At such distances, direct threshold detection results in BER values higher than 0.1. Even when applying offline post-processing with a ridge regression training algorithm, which considers the patterns of the detected bits within the complete detection period, the detection BER value improves only slightly to 0.031. When we employ the RC, the transmitted signal is optically injected into the RC's SL, resulting in a nonlinearly transformed output which depends directly on the operating conditions of the reservoir. After training the reservoir with the previously considered regression algorithm, we find many operating conditions for which the bit stream recovery potential is improved significantly (Fig. 1a). Especially when the memory properties of the reservoir are incorporated in the training process - i.e. by taking into account the transformed patterns of the previous bits - BER values lower than 10-4 have been retrieved (Fig. 1b).","doi":"10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8086463","publicationTitle":"2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8068289/8086161/08086463.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8086161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8086463","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8086463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving detection in optical communications using all-optical reservoir computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Improving detection in optical communications using all-optical reservoir computing","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17314656","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","conferenceDate":"25-29 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8086463/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving detection in optical communications using all-optical reservoir computing","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"CD105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034852S","chronDate":"25-29 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8068289","isNumber":"8086161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8068289","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8086161","articleId":"8086463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8086563,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Lin","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Dublin City University, Dublin 9, Ireland"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086153262"},{"name":"Aravind P.

Information traffic demands have increased dramatically in recent years, leading to the so called \u201cCapacity Crunch\u201d in optical fiber. There are two possible ways to solve this problem. The first is using Space Division Multiplexing to increase the capacity. This requires setting up a completely new infrastructure with multimode fibers. The second is to improve the capacity of the current infrastructure with novel transmission techniques. A promising approach for the second solution is Nonlinear Frequency Division Multiplexing (NFDM) [1], see also 2] for an overview. This approach improves on Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) [3] by replacing the Fourier transform by the Nonlinear Fourier Transform (NFT). The NFT hinges on the crucial observation that a linear operator exists which is associated with the propagation equation and whose spectrum is invariant under propagation. In NFDM, information is encoded in the spectrum of this operator. In the absence of noise, the nonlinear fiber channel is decomposed into parallel independent scalar channels in the nonlinear Fourier domain. As a result, inter-symbol interference (ISI) is absent with nonlinear multiplexing. Previously, encouraging results have been found for normal dispersion fibers [4]. We present achievable rates for NFDM in standard fibers with anomalous dispersion.","doi":"10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8086929","publicationTitle":"2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8068289/8086161/08086929.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8086929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8086161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear fourier transform in optical communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8086929","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086929/","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear fourier transform in optical communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17332818","htmlLink":"/document/8086929/","conferenceDate":"25-29 June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear fourier transform in optical communications","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"CI13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110631S","chronDate":"25-29 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8068289","isNumber":"8086161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8068289","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8086161","articleId":"8086929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8086935,"authors":[{"name":"Tu T.

Reduced-guard-interval (RGI) coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) has been considered as a promising technique for high-speed optical fiber communication systems due to its simple equalization scheme and tolerance to residual chromatic dispersion (CD) [1]. However, one serious drawback of RGI OFDM is the high side lobes due to the `brick-wall' filtering, which leads to higher vulnerability to intercarrier interference (ICI) due to frequency offset, laser and nonlinear phase noise. As a result, RGI CO-OFDM transmission suffers seriously from equalization-enhanced phase noise (EEPN) which is a complicated interplay of laser phase noise, nonlinear phase noise and digital CD equalizer [2]. Here, we show, for the first time, that the impact of EEPN can be significantly mitigated by employing a specific version of OFDM called filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) in which the retangular pulse shape is replaced by a modified raised cosine function. Unlike OFDM signal, FBMC guarantees the orthogonality only in real fields where the receiverd signal is interfered by the so-called imaginary interference [3-4]. Therefore, the channel estimation and phase noise compensation in CO-FBMC are different from those of RGI CO-OFDM. In this work, we considered two equalization techniques (including both channel and phase noise estimations) for CO-FBMC, namely the auxiliary pilot (AP) and the coding pilot (CP). For RGI CO-OFDM transmission, the conventional pilot-aided equalization was applied.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equalization-enhanced phase noise suppression advantage of CO-FBMC over RGI CO-OFDM","publicationTitle":"2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","doi":"10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8086935","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8068289/8086161/08086935.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8086935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8086161","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8086935","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086935/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Equalization-enhanced phase noise suppression advantage of CO-FBMC over RGI CO-OFDM","conferenceDate":"25-29 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8086935/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17293547","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equalization-enhanced phase noise suppression advantage of CO-FBMC over RGI CO-OFDM","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"CI25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040805S","chronDate":"25-29 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8068289","isNumber":"8086161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8068289","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8086161","articleId":"8086935","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8086940,"authors":[{"name":"Amol Delmade","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Madras, Chennai-36, India"],"firstName":"Amol","lastName":"Delmade","id":"37086172867"},{"name":"Colm Browning","affiliation":["Rince Institute, DCU, Ireland"],"firstName":"Colm","lastName":"Browning","id":"37604050800"},{"name":"Arman Farhang","affiliation":["Trinity College Dublin, Dunlop Oriel House, Ireland"],"firstName":"Arman","lastName":"Farhang","id":"38272414200"},{"name":"Nicola Marchetti","affiliation":["Trinity College Dublin, Dunlop Oriel House, Ireland"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Marchetti","id":"37293742400"},{"name":"Linda E.

Multicarrier modulation based schemes - Universally Filtered Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (UF-OFDM) and Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) have emerged as potential candidate waveforms for 5G mobile communication [1].

Analog intermediate frequency over fiber (AIFoF) fronthauling technique provides more flexibility and uses lower bandwidth optical components compared to radio/mmW frequency signal over fiber techniques [2].

An optical frequency comb can generate hundreds of individual comb lines which can be employed in wavelength division multiplexing systems [1], thus reducing the cost, footprint, power consumption and system complexity when compared to using multiple lasers. However to date, comb-based communications have been limited to lower modulation formats more tolerant to phase noise, due to poor carrier to noise ratios resulting from high parametric noise in the comb. We recently proposed a technique [2], to regenerate a C-band optical frequency comb for transmission of 64 QAM signals. This was based on using a narrowband (~10 MHz) amplifier generated through stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in a 4.46-km standard single mode fibre to significantly suppress noise around the carrier thus increasing the carrier to noise power ratio. In this work, we present the regeneration of a C-band 40-GHz comb using SBS on a photonic chip, reducing the length of the SBS medium by more than 4 orders of magnitude and paving the way towards photonic integration and low-cost manufacturing. This work also represents the first-ever implementation of on-chip SBS in high-speed optical communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8068289/8086161/08086954.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","doi":"10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8086954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8086954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8086161","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8086954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-chip regeneration of a frequency comb for 64QAM communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Gain","Optical waveguides","Photonics","Optical noise","System-on-chip","Optical harmonic generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated optics","optical communication equipment","optical fibre communication","optical frequency combs","phase noise","quadrature amplitude modulation","stimulated Brillouin scattering","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-chip regeneration","64QAM communications","comb lines","wavelength division multiplexing systems","system complexity","multiple lasers","comb-based communications","modulation formats","phase noise","parametric noise","C-band optical frequency comb","64 QAM signal transmission","narrowband amplifier","stimulated Brillouin scattering","standard single mode fibre","carrier to noise power ratio","C-band comb","photonic chip","SBS medium","photonic integration","low-cost manufacturing","on-chip SBS","high-speed optical communications","frequency 10 MHz","size 4.46 km","frequency 40 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8086954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"On-chip regeneration of a frequency comb for 64QAM communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8086954/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17332797","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","conferenceDate":"25-29 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-chip regeneration of a frequency comb for 64QAM communications","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"CI64.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039416S","chronDate":"25-29 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8068289","isNumber":"8086161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8068289","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8086161","articleId":"8086954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8086974,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Low intensity noise laser sources are a fundamental prerequisite for demanding fundamental research such as interferometric gravitational-wave detection (GWD) [1], precision spectroscopy, LIDAR, and ultra-cold atom/molecular optical lattices. Besides, high power lasers with low intensity noise also attract great interest in the industry applications. Direct pump current control is the simplest method to suppress the laser intensity noise. However, the modulation of high current multi-mode pump diodes is not straightforward and achieving wide feedback control bandwidth beyond 200 kHz is challenging.

While conventional optical fibre couplers exhibit a wide spectral region of modal interference where two modes provide a continuous oscillatory behaviour associated to the large difference between phase constants of interfering supermodes [1], nanofiber couplers (NFC) exhibit an anomalous behaviour (Fig. 1) in close proximity to the supermodes cut-off wavelengths, where the high extinction ratio oscillations can exhibit a very slow oscillation. This region of interest exhibits flat transmission over nearly 20 nm and results from the variation of the supermodes dispersion near their cut-off. This hybrid behaviour, where a flat transmission region is proximal to rapid spectral oscillations, allows the NFC to operate at high sensitivity as well as large dynamic range for application related to optical detection.","doi":"10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8087154","publicationTitle":"2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8068289/8086161/08087154.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8087154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8086161","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous spectral behaviour of weakly-fused optical fibre couplers with sub-micron diameters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8087154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous spectral behaviour of weakly-fused optical fibre couplers with sub-micron diameters","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8087154/","conferenceDate":"25-29 June 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17350488","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8087154/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous spectral behaviour of weakly-fused optical fibre couplers with sub-micron diameters","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"CKP14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04701S","chronDate":"25-29 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8068289","isNumber":"8086161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8068289","xplore-issue":"8086161","articleId":"8087154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8087621,"authors":[{"name":"Dmitry Sivun","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Dmitry","lastName":"Sivun","id":"37086215462"},{"name":"Cynthia Vidal","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Cynthia","lastName":"Vidal","id":"37086220431"},{"name":"Battulga Munkhbat","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Battulga","lastName":"Munkhbat","id":"37086260202"},{"name":"Nikita Arnold","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Nikita","lastName":"Arnold","id":"37314845300"},{"name":"Thomas A.

The underlying mechanism of the PL is a subject of intensive debates, although there are numerous reports on single-photon and multi-photon-induced PL of plasmonic particles and nanoparticle systems. Here, we experimentally and numerically show that the hot-spot intensity between two gold bipyramids anticorrelates with the one-photon photoluminescence from the dimers, where the plasmonic coupling is adjusted mechanically by seesawing the bipyramids and by varying the interparticle distance with the tip of an atomic force microscope [2].

The use of webbrowsers for delivery is advantageous in educational settings such as distance learning, because the students lose no time to the potential inconvenience of downloading and installing native software. The use of graphics process units (GPU) for the calculation opens the opportunity to simultaneously post-process the fields for display to the user. This allows the evolution of the fields to be viewed as they are simulated. Since the fields are already calculated in the graphics processor unit, which also naturally handles the task of rendering to the display, then there is no loss of performance in displaying the fields to the monitor, during the calculation. This requires that the post-processing routine is also written to run in the GPU, placing some limits on the type of post-processing that is preferred, but also enabling the use of advanced 3D rendering techniques.A further intriguing possibility is the ability to manipulate the objects within the simulation domain while the simulation proceeds. This is equivalent to relativistic motion of the objects, and thus remains a physically valid simulation. The benefit to learners is that it reduces the cycle time between cause and effect, aiding the learning process. Such an approach may even yield benefits to experienced simulator users who are exploring a new application domain. A demonstration of the concept has been produced via a 2-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulator that renders the fields as a semi-transparent height map. In the demonstrator, which was originally developed with a public engagement focus, the fields were rendered as a 3-D representation of water in a swimming pool. This was to take advantage of the aesthetic qualities of a readily available WebGL demonstration programme. While the representation could be considered to imply the existence of an ether, it must be remembered that learners should grasp the most important principles first, before refining them. Thus a discussion with a student about the existence or otherwise of an ether can be left to a subsequent occasion.","doi":"10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8087726","publicationTitle":"2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8068289/8086161/08087726.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8087726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8086161","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WebGL-FDTD \u2014 Hardware-accelerated interactive electromagnetic solver tool for the web-browser","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8087726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"WebGL-FDTD \u2014 Hardware-accelerated interactive electromagnetic solver tool for the web-browser","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8087726/","conferenceDate":"25-29 June 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17293480","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8087726/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WebGL-FDTD \u2014 Hardware-accelerated interactive electromagnetic solver tool for the web-browser","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"EJ15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052874S","chronDate":"25-29 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8068289","isNumber":"8086161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8068289","xplore-issue":"8086161","articleId":"8087726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8087738,"authors":[{"name":"Marius Brehler","affiliation":["Chair for High Frequency Technology, TU Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Brehler","id":"37085850338"},{"name":"Peter M.

To simulate the nonlinear interaction between the channels in a mode-division multiplexed (MDM) transmission system, sufficiently long symbol sequences have to be simulated. Further, the number of samples per symbol has to be increased for the simulation of multiple wavelength channels [3]. However, the required memory for the simulation of MDM systems scales linearly with the number of modes. Thus, highly memory efficient split-step Fourier implementations are required. The iterative approach, described in [2], allows such a memory efficient implementation. However, the ability to simulate large scale MDM systems is still limited by the available GPU memory. Since most commonly all calculations are executed with double-precision, the question arises if single-precision is sufficient for parts of the calculations or, in the context of memory limitations, for saving intermediate results without introducing an unacceptable inaccuracy.","doi":"10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8087738","publicationTitle":"2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8068289/8086161/08087738.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8087738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8086161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU-accelerated mixed-precision simulation of the nonlinear signal propagation in multimode fibers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8087738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 June 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8087738/","displayDocTitle":"GPU-accelerated mixed-precision simulation of the nonlinear signal propagation in multimode fibers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17333188","htmlLink":"/document/8087738/","conferenceDate":"25-29 June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU-accelerated mixed-precision simulation of the nonlinear signal propagation in multimode fibers","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"EJP6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027524S","chronDate":"25-29 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8068289","isNumber":"8086161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8068289","xplore-issue":"8086161","articleId":"8087738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8087741,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Multiphoton microscopy, including two-photon laser scanning microscopy and second-harmonic generation is a unique technique for non-invasive imaging in biological samples. However, clinical translation and applications outside the laser laboratory have been hampered by the need to use bulky, expensive and environmentally sensitive lasers, that often require active water cooling and have high energy consumption. Femtosecond fiber lasers, which have relaxed cooling and energy consumption requirements, are very attractive as master sources for multiphoton microscopy [1]. A challenge for applications in nonlinear imaging in living tissue is to maximize the total fluorescent yield from each fluorophore. Excitation with a transform-limited pulse significantly increases the efficiency of excitation [2]. Transform limited pulses are also advantageous to minimize the thermal load in living tissue. Multiphoton microscopy would strongly benefit from the implementation of robust all-integrated fiber based concepts that allow for truly turn-key maintenance free operation.When developing high-peak power integrated fiber laser sources for multiphoton microscopy it is important to: (i) minimize the nonlinearities in the system; (ii) to implement suitable fiber-based stretching and compression schemes that will not trade-off pulse duration and pulse fidelity for all-fiber integration, and will instead allow to produce high fidelity pulses for compact multiphoton imaging systems. Ideally, the pulse duration from such a fiber source should be independent from the output pulse energy, to allow a fast change of the excitation power without the use of expensive electro-optic modulators. Hollow-core photonic bandgap fibers (HCPBF) are very attractive for the delivery of femtosecond pulses for applications in nonlinear optical microscopy. Two main approaches based on HCPBF compressors have been demonstrated: one uses a standard single mode fiber (SMF) stretcher [3,4], and the other concept is based on a DCF stretcher [5]. In this work, we compared the in-vivo imaging capabilities of two completely all-fiber single mode Yb-fiber lasers that use the above-mentioned stretcher-compressor concepts. The amplifier system consists of a broadband 76 MHz Yb-fiber oscillator, a fiber stretcher, and two single mode fiber amplifiers. Spectral filters are used after the oscillator and between the two amplifier stages. The first filter is used to tune the wavelength of the seed pulse and the second filter is used for ASE suppression. The output of the amplifier is spliced to a HCPBF compressor. For both stretcher configurations, the maximum output power at the output of the HCPBF compressor is about 120 mW. After this, the beam is guided into a fluorescence microscope adapted for laser scanning multiphoton imaging. We measured the second harmonic FROG traces of the pulses after passing through the microscope system and optimized the stretcher length for best compressibility in both cases. The system with a standard polarization maintaining SMF stretcher delivers 280 fs pulses with considerable satellites carrying more than 20% of the energy, and the system with the DCF stretcher delivers 260 fs pulses with only one small side pulse that carries less than 5% of the energy. Both systems have the same output spectrum, corresponding to a Fourier transform limited duration of 255 fs. Figure 1 shows a comparison of two imaged 2-color frames obtained with the two different configurations. For the same power and under the same imaging conditions, the fluorescence signal for the system that uses the DCF stretcher was ~45 % higher than the fluorescence signal that uses a standard SMF stretcher. This is to be expected due to the much better pulse compressibility achieved with the DCF stretcher. This result is consistent with the 50% fluorescent signal enhancement that is expected, based on the calculated second-order coherence factors of the pulses from the two different stretcher approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8087741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 June 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-29 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8087741/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17293526","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing the fluorescent signal for in-vivo nonlinear imaging in a completely all-fibered ytterbium chirped pulse amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing the fluorescent signal for in-vivo nonlinear imaging in a completely all-fibered ytterbium chirped pulse amplifier","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"JSECBOCLEOEurope2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054412S","chronDate":"25-29 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8068289","isNumber":"8086161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8068289","xplore-issue":"8086161","articleId":"8087741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8087944,"authors":[{"name":"Qiwu Wang","affiliation":["Laser Research Institute, Shandong Academy of Science, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Qiwu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086249898"},{"name":"Gangyang Nan","affiliation":["Laser Research Institute, Shandong Academy of Science, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Gangyang","lastName":"Nan","id":"37086252798"},{"name":"Moyu Hou","affiliation":["Laser Research Institute, Shandong Academy of Science, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Moyu","lastName":"Hou","id":"37088230569"},{"name":"Yang Ju","affiliation":["Laser Research Institute, Shandong Academy of Science, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Ju","id":"37086248702"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0484-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0483-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-0482-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0485-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8087944","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8087944","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber sensors","Clocks","Field programmable gate arrays","Temperature measurement","Temperature sensors","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","data acquisition","distributed sensors","fibre optic sensors","field programmable gate arrays","light scattering","low-pass filters","microprocessor chips","optical filters","signal sampling","temperature measurement","temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optic-fiber distributed temperature sensors","sample interleaving system","data acquisition platform","FPGA-ARM processors","input signal frequency","concurrent low-pass filter","backscattered signal","ADC channels","Stokes signal","antiStokes signals","quantization noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed fiber temperature senor","data acquisition","interleaved sampling","parallel computing"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an embedded solution of concurrent low-pass filter and sample interleaving system which process back-scattered signal of optic-fiber distributed temperature sensors at 250 MSPS.

It is fundamental for further processing steps like collision avoidance or path planning. This paper introduces a convolutional neural network- based vehicle detection and localization method using point cloud data acquired by a LIDAR sensor. Acquired point clouds are transformed into bird's eye view elevation images, where each pixel represents a grid cell of the horizontal x-y plane. We intentionally encode each pixel using three channels, namely the maximal, median and minimal height value of all points within the respective grid. A major advantage of this three channel representation is that it allows us to utilize common RGB image-based detection networks without modification. The bird's eye view elevation images are processed by a two stage detector. Due to the nature of the bird's eye view, each pixel of the image represent ground coordinates, meaning that the bounding box of detected vehicles correspond directly to the horizontal position of the vehicles. Therefore, in contrast to RGB-based detectors, we not just detect the vehicles, but simultaneously localize them in ground coordinates. To evaluate the accuracy of our method and the usefulness for further high-level applications like path planning, we evaluate the detection results based on the localization error in ground coordinates. Our proposed method achieves an average precision of 87.9% for an intersection over union (IoU) value of 0.5. In addition, 75% of the detected cars are localized with an absolute positioning error of below 0.2m.","doi":"10.1109/SSRR.2017.8088147","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security and Rescue Robotics (SSRR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security and Rescue Robotics (SSRR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8076857/8088129/08088147.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSRR.2017.8088147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle detection and localization on bird's eye view elevation images using convolutional neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088147/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle detection and localization on bird's eye view elevation images using convolutional neural network","htmlLink":"/document/8088147/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17315970","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle detection and localization on bird's eye view elevation images using convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063672S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8076857","isNumber":"8088129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8076857","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8088129","articleId":"8088147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8088163,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The review is motivated by the increasing use of small UAVs for inspecting critical infrastructures such as the electric utility transmission and distribution grid, which could be a target for terrorism. The paper presents a modified taxonomy to organize cyber attacks on UAVs and exploiting threats by Attack Vector and Target. It shows that, by Attack Vector, there has been one physical attack and ten remote attacks. By Target, there have been six attacks on GPS (two jamming, four spoofing), two attacks on the control communications stream (a deauthentication attack and a zero-day vulnerabilities attack), and two attacks on data communications stream (two intercepting the data feed, zero executing a video replay attack). The paper also divides and discusses the findings by large or small UAVs, over or under 25 kg, but concentrates on small UAVs. The survey concludes that UAV-related research to counter cybersecurity threats focuses on GPS Jamming and Spoofing, but ignores attacks on the controls and data communications stream. The gap in research on attacks on the data communications stream is concerning, as an operator can see a UAV flying off course due to a control stream attack but has no way of detecting a video replay attack (substitution of a video feed).","doi":"10.1109/SSRR.2017.8088163","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security and Rescue Robotics (SSRR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security and Rescue Robotics (SSRR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8076857/8088129/08088163.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSRR.2017.8088163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A review on cybersecurity vulnerabilities for unmanned aerial vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A review on cybersecurity vulnerabilities for unmanned aerial vehicles","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17315959","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8088163/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088163/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A review on cybersecurity vulnerabilities for unmanned aerial vehicles","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096269S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8076857","isNumber":"8088129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8076857","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"8088129","articleId":"8088163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8088192,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco Javier Mu\u00f1oz Cort\u00e9s","affiliation":["Facultad de Ingenier\u00eda, GITA Research Group, Medell\u00edn, Colombia"],"firstName":"Francisco Javier Mu\u00f1oz","lastName":"Cort\u00e9s","id":"38179699700"},{"name":"Jhon James Granada Torres","affiliation":["Facultad de Ingenier\u00eda, GITA Research Group, Medell\u00edn, Colombia"],"firstName":"Jhon James Granada","lastName":"Torres","id":"38252702700"},{"name":"Ana M.

Expanding system boundaries, tighter interconnections of functional elements, increasingly complex algorithms and an ever growing operational domain generate a multitude of different scenarios that require consideration during specification, design, implementation and testing. This paper reflects the current practice on the example of the Automotive SPICE process reference for system and software development in the automotive domain. It then contemplates on opportunities of consistent usage of recorded vehicle data throughout all phases of automotive development. Our concept of data-driven development is not intended to replace the current practice but to complement it. A summary of our previous work demonstrates the practicability of the concept on the basis of the development of a Predictive Cruise Control (PCC) feature.

For reliable condition monitoring, sensors should output same values under same conditions regardless of time, but the sensitivity of sensors is gradually changed due to several factors such as temperature, humidity, contamination, aging, and etc. This type of situation is called as sensor drift problem. To solve this, several methods such as auto-associative neural network, auto-associative support vector regression, and etc. have been developed to detect sensor drifts earlier by estimating new input based on historical data. This study applied the auto-associative kernel regression model into a synthetic natural gas plant which produces synthetic natural gas from coals to detect sensor drifts during operation phase. To validate the auto-associative kernel regression model in the synthetic natural gas plant, a real data collected from an experimental operation are used. Based on the experimental results, the auto-associative kernel regression model can rapidly detect the sensor drift in the synthetic natural gas plant.","doi":"10.1109/SysEng.2017.8088327","pdfPath":"/iel7/8076858/8088244/08088327.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Systems Engineering Symposium (ISSE)","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Systems Engineering Symposium (ISSE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SysEng.2017.8088327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor drift detection in SNG plant using auto-associative kernel regression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088327/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Sensor drift detection in SNG plant using auto-associative kernel regression","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17316018","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8088327/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor drift detection in SNG plant using auto-associative kernel regression","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"1570374463.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062501S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8076858","isNumber":"8088244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8076858","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8088244","articleId":"8088327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8088354,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Xuerong","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Xuerong","id":"38193033000"},{"name":"Chen Hao","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Hao","orcid":"0000-0001-6206-0277","id":"37086238906"},{"name":"Liang Huimin","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Huimin","orcid":"0000-0001-5138-8023","id":"37265339400"},{"name":"Chen Xinjun","affiliation":["ShanXi Qunli Electric Co., Ltd, Baoji, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Xinjun","id":"37706696700"},{"name":"You Jiaxin","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"You","lastName":"Jiaxin","id":"37085717188"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"8088354","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":495},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088354","abstract":"Electromagnetic devices containing permanent magnet (PM) are common and typical electromagnetic devices that have advantages of low-power consumption, small size, high sensitivity, and its optimization problem has aroused widespread concern. Calculation accuracy of electromagnetic properties and efficiency of optimization processes are two important factors that affect the optimization effect of electromagnetic devices. A fast calculation method was proposed in this paper that aimed at electromagnetic devices with PM characteristics of strong non-linearity and low solving precision. The response surface method was used to derive the basis function, and the error between actual measured values and calculated values was modified by the Kriging method. On the basis of the calculation model, the distributed collaborative strategy was adopted to fulfill the parallel execution of the fast computation. Simultaneously, the updating strategy of particles was improved, and the robustness of the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm in solving the optimization problem of electromagnetic devices with PM was enhanced. Effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper was verified by the case study of a specific type of electromagnetic relay with PM.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2017.2758818","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/8299599/08088354.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2017.2758818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8299599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Objective Optimization Design for Electromagnetic Devices With Permanent Magnet Based on Approximation Model and Distributed Cooperative Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Finite element analysis","Measurement uncertainty","Electromagnetic devices","Computational modeling","Prototypes","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic devices","particle swarm optimisation","permanent magnets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization design","response surface method","electromagnetic relay","updating strategy","distributed collaborative strategy","PM characteristics","approximation model","multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm","electromagnetic properties","optimization problem","distributed cooperative particle swarm optimization algorithm","permanent magnet","electromagnetic devices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximation model","design optimization","Kriging","particle swarm optimization (PSO)","response surface"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088354/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Objective Optimization Design for Electromagnetic Devices With Permanent Magnet Based on Approximation Model and Distributed Cooperative Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","volume":"54","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8088354/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2018","accessionNumber":"17596210","externalId":"8000604","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Objective Optimization Design for Electromagnetic Devices With Permanent Magnet Based on Approximation Model and Distributed Cooperative Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tmag-hao-2758818-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077957S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"8299599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8299599","articleId":"8088354","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8088356,"authors":[{"name":"Abdoulkadri Chama","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Stellenbosch University, Matieland, South Africa"],"firstName":"Abdoulkadri","lastName":"Chama","orcid":"0000-0001-5572-5250","id":"37086306001"},{"name":"Stiaan Gerber","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Stellenbosch University, Matieland, South Africa"],"firstName":"Stiaan","lastName":"Gerber","orcid":"0000-0001-5057-5185","id":"37585765800"},{"name":"Rong-Jie Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Stellenbosch University, Matieland, South Africa"],"firstName":"Rong-Jie","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0001-6582-9563","id":"37280232800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"8088356","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":874},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element analysis","Mathematical model","Magnetic hysteresis","Jacobian matrices","Permeability","Magnetization","Newton method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","Jacobian matrices","Newton method","Newton-Raphson method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element methods","nonlinear hysteresis models","nonlinear finite element problems","iterative method","Newton-Raphson solver","quadratic convergence","Jacobian functional","magnetization curves"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite element","hysteresis curve","Newton\u2013Raphson method","weak derivatives"]}],"abstract":"It is well known that the Newton-Raphson method is the most popular iterative method for nonlinear finite element problems. The method has a quadratic convergence. Under certain conditions on the Jacobian of the functional and the initial guess the Newton-Raphson method can converge very fast. However, standard evaluation of such Jacobian may not be possible for the solution of nonlinear hysteresis field problems. This is due to the nature of the magnetization curves that may not be differentiable or possess a very steep gradient. In this paper, an alternative finite element implementation using the Newton-Raphson method for hysteresis field problems is described in detail. To improve the convergence of the method, a method for evaluation of the initial guess is also proposed. It is shown that the Newton method can be reliably used for solving hysteresis field problems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Newton\u2013Raphson Solver for Finite Element Methods Featuring Nonlinear Hysteresis Models","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2017.2761319","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/8232484/08088356.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2017.2761319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8232484","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088356/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Newton\u2013Raphson Solver for Finite Element Methods Featuring Nonlinear Hysteresis Models","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8088356/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2017","externalId":"7400108","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17466863","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Newton\u2013Raphson Solver for Finite Element Methods Featuring Nonlinear Hysteresis Models","sourcePdf":"tmag-wang-2761319-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070201S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"8232484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8232484","articleId":"8088356","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8088357,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["College of Mathematics, Physics and Information Engineering, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8440865/8088357/liu-2755697-small.gif","p":["Yang Liu (M\u201915) received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Zhejiang Normal University, Zhejiang, China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree from Tongji University, Shanghai, China, in 2008.","He is currently a Distinguished Professor with the Department of Mathematics, Zhejiang Normal University.

With the Lyapunov function method, some criteria are, respectively, presented to ensure the global \u03bc-stability and power stability of the delayed QVNN. On the other hand, by considering the noncommutativity of quaternion multiplication and time-varying delays, the QVNN is investigated directly by the techniques of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) where quaternion self-conjugate matrices and quaternion positive definite matrices are used. Some new sufficient conditions in the form of quaternion-valued LMI are, respectively, established for the global \u03bc-stability and exponential stability of the considered QVNN. Besides, some assumptions are presented for the two different methods, which can help to choose quaternion-valued activation functions.

In order to tackle the nonconvexity of the problem, we first analyze the problem by obtaining the optimal resource allocation strategy in closed form and characterizing the optimal base station load distribution pattern. Both observations are shown essential in simplifying the original problem and making it possible to transform the nonconvex load distribution and power control problem into convex reformulation via exponential variable transformation. An iterative algorithm with low complexity is accordingly presented to obtain a suboptimal solution to the joint optimization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance than conventional approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2765322","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8249510/08088359.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8249510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2765322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"324","endPage":"338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Association and Load Optimization With User Priorities in Load-Coupled Heterogeneous Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088359","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Association and Load Optimization With User Priorities in Load-Coupled Heterogeneous Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088359/","volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8088359/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17490424","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471114, 61372106 and 61221002"},{"fundingName":"Six Talent Peaks project in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"GDZB-005"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project","grantNumber":"2016ZX03001016-003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Southeast University","grantNumber":"YBJJ1650"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Association and Load Optimization With User Priorities in Load-Coupled Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-yang-2765322-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12906S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8249510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8249510","articleId":"8088359","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8088362,"authors":[{"name":"Jai Narayan Tripathi","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics Pvt.

The use of bio-inspired neuromorphic event-driven dynamic vision sensors (DVSs) has heralded new methods for vision processing, exploiting reduced amount of data and very precise timing resolutions. Previous studies have shown these neural spiking sensors to be well suited to implementing single-sensor object tracking systems, although they experience difficulties when solving ambiguities caused by object occlusion. DVSs have also performed well in 3-D reconstruction in which event matching techniques are applied in stereo setups. In this paper, we propose a new event-driven stereo object tracking algorithm that simultaneously integrates 3-D reconstruction and cluster tracking, introducing feedback information in both tasks to improve their respective performances. This algorithm, inspired by human vision, identifies objects and learns their position and size in order to solve ambiguities. This strategy has been validated in four different experiments where the 3-D positions of two objects were tracked in a stereo setup even when occlusion occurred.

When acquiring useful patterns from them, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) models have proven to be highly effective owing to their fine representativeness of the nonnegative data. However, current NMF techniques suffer from: 1) inefficiency in addressing HiDS matrices; and 2) constraints in their training schemes. To address these issues, this paper proposes to extract nonnegative latent factors (NLFs) from HiDS matrices via a novel inherently NLF (INLF) model. It bridges the output factors and decision variables via a single-element-dependent mapping function, thereby making the parameter training unconstrained and compatible with general training schemes on the premise of maintaining the nonnegativity constraints. Experimental results on six HiDS matrices arising from industrial applications indicate that INLF is able to acquire NLFs from them more efficiently than any existing method does.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088366/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17736635","volume":"14","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8088366/","publicationDate":"May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"04 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Inherently Nonnegative Latent Factor Model for High-Dimensional and Sparse Matrices from Industrial Applications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFC0804002"},{"fundingName":"International Joint Project funded jointly by the Royal Society of the UK"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61611130209"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772493, 91646114 and 51609229"},{"fundingName":"FDCT (Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ciencias e da Tecnologia)","grantNumber":"119/2014/A3"},{"fundingName":"Pioneer Hundred Talents Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"fundingName":"Young Scientist Foundation of Chongqing","grantNumber":"cstc2014kjrc-qnrc40005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Inherently Nonnegative Latent Factor Model for High-Dimensional and Sparse Matrices from Industrial Applications","sourcePdf":"tii-zhou-2766528-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.191111S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8353885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"8353885","articleId":"8088366","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8088393,"authors":[{"name":"Luana Vieira Martinez Bonatto","affiliation":["Unipampa, Bag\u00e9, RS, Brazil"],"firstName":"Luana Vieira Martinez","lastName":"Bonatto","id":"37086248299"},{"name":"F\u00e1bio Lu\u00eds Livi Ramos","affiliation":["Unipampa, PPGC-UFRGS, Bag\u00e9, RS, Brazil"],"firstName":"F\u00e1bio Lu\u00eds Livi","lastName":"Ramos","id":"37846507900"},{"name":"Bruno Zatt","affiliation":["UFPel, Pelotas, RS, Brazil"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Zatt","id":"37295620700"},{"name":"Marcelo Porto","affiliation":["UFPel, Pelotas, RS, Brazil"],"firstName":"Marcelo","lastName":"Porto","id":"37409661800"},{"name":"Sergio Bampi","affiliation":["PPGC-UFRGS, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Bampi","id":"37265059600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-5106-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6503-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8088393","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"abstract":"The demand for higher quality video has increased in the past few years, due to the huge amount of electronic devices that process digital video in even higher resolutions. For that purpose, video coding techniques are used, which have, as main goal, the reduction of the required representation to process a digital video. Furthermore, embedded hardware video solutions are sought for both industry and academia. Therefore, low-power consumption is required for those battery-based devices. This work proposes 1-D architecture for the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) module of the HEVC video coding standard. Furthermore, the proposed work implements a digital hardware structure able to process all the four sizes of residual matrixes, by using a purely combinational fashion. Statistical analyses were made, using real video sequences as input. Based on these analyses, energetic efficiency is achieved by inserting a low-power technique, without significant prejudice to the architecture performance. Synthesis results showed that the architecture has the lowest proportional power consumption along related works by using an accurate power estimation with the use of real video sequences as stimuli for the gate-level simulation, while it is still able to process QFHD videos at 32 frames per second.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 30th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8074561/8088385/08088393.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"46","publicationTitle":"2017 30th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088385","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-power multi-size HEVC DCT architecture proposal for QFHD video processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Computer architecture","Standards","Video sequences","Streaming media","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","image representation","image resolution","image sequences","low-power electronics","matrix algebra","statistical analysis","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital hardware structure","video sequences","power estimation","video resolutions","discrete cosine transform","low-power multisize HEVC DCT architecture","residual matrixes","statistical analyses","HEVC video coding standard","DCT module","battery-based devices","low-power consumption","QFHD video processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video Coding","HEVC","Transform","DCT","Low-power"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Low-power multi-size HEVC DCT architecture proposal for QFHD video processing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8088393/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17315331","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power multi-size HEVC DCT architecture proposal for QFHD video processing","confLoc":"Fortaleza, Brazil","sourcePdf":"S23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071016S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074561","isNumber":"8088385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074561","xplore-issue":"8088385","articleId":"8088393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8088395,"authors":[{"name":"Lucas F.

Most of the existing stereo matching systems that fulfill to all of these requirements adopt the Semi-Global Matching (SOM) technique. This work proposes a scalable architecture based on a systolic array, fully pipeline. The design builds on a combination of multilevel parallelisms such as image line processing (two-dimensional processing) and disparity. The implementation of the SOM technique combined with the gradiente filter sobel as a pre-processing step and absolute differences as a local similarity method is a very robust approach to both high-quality images from the latest version of the Middlebury image database (22.7% of bad pixels) and low-quality images from our stereo camera system. This whole system was implemented in the FPGA platform Cyclone IV generating images of disparity in HD resolution (1024\u00d7768 pixel), with the range of 128 levels of disparities values and using four directions of paths for the SOM method. The proposed approach provided an operating frequency of 100Mhz, delivering images at a rate of 127 frames per second, using 70% of its resource in logical elements for processing and 63% of internal memory for intermediate data storage. So the proposed architecture fills the demands of real world applications regarding frame rate, depth resolution, low resource usage and accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088395/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 1 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17315336","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8088395/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Hardware module for low-resource and real-time stereo vision engine using semi-global matching approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware module for low-resource and real-time stereo vision engine using semi-global matching approach","confLoc":"Fortaleza, Brazil","sourcePdf":"S25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060434S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074561","isNumber":"8088385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074561","xplore-issue":"8088385","articleId":"8088395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":8088414,"authors":[{"name":"Naga Bhushan","affiliation":["Qualcomm Technologies, Inc."],"firstName":"Naga","lastName":"Bhushan","id":"37564499200"},{"name":"Tingfang Ji","affiliation":["Qualcomm Technologies, Inc."],"firstName":"Tingfang","lastName":"Ji","id":"38338259300"},{"name":"Ozge Koymen","affiliation":["Qualcomm Technologies, Inc."],"firstName":"Ozge","lastName":"Koymen","id":"37727120600"},{"name":"John Smee","affiliation":["Qualcomm Technologies, Inc."],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Smee","id":"37297005700"},{"name":"Joseph Soriaga","affiliation":["Qualcomm Technologies, Inc."],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Soriaga","id":"37283069300"},{"name":"Sundar Subramanian","affiliation":["Qualcomm Technologies, Inc."],"firstName":"Sundar","lastName":"Subramanian","id":"37287286200"},{"name":"Yongbin Wei","affiliation":["Qualcomm Technologies, Inc."],"firstName":"Yongbin","lastName":"Wei","id":"37086241721"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1284"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0687"}],"articleNumber":"8088414","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4195},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["5G mobile communication","Long Term Evolution","MIMO","OFDM","Wireless networks","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G air interface system design principles","mobile networks","5G new radio unified air interface"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088414","abstract":"5G is a unifying connectivity fabric that will expand the value of mobile networks to take on a much larger role than previous generations, empowering many new connected services across an array of world-changing use cases.

The work attempts to solve two important problems of touchless interactions inside a car. First, low latency identification of the gestures which are unobtrusive for the driver. Second, reducing the labelled data required to train learning based solutions, this is particularly important because labelling of gesture sequences is expensive and exigent. This work attempts to improve the fast detection of hand-gestures by correcting the probability estimate of a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network by pose prediction made by a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). Weak models for hand gesture classes based on five hand poses are designed to assist in the prediction-correction scheme. A training procedure to reduce the labelled data required for hand pose classification is also introduced. This method tries to utilise the statistical property of the dataset to identify a good initialization of weights for the CNN, here we demonstrate this using the Principal Component Analysis(PCA) embedding of non-labelled hand pose sequences. While solving a nine class hand gesture problem we demonstrate an accuracy of 89.50% which is better than existing systems. We also show that a PCA embedding based initialization improves the classification performance of the CNN based pose classifier.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"[POSTER] A Probabilistic Combination of CNN and RNN Estimates for Hand Gesture Based Interaction in Car","doi":"10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct.2017.19","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct.2017.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088417","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR-Adjunct)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR-Adjunct)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8087877/8088417/08088436.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"[POSTER] A Probabilistic Combination of CNN and RNN Estimates for Hand Gesture Based Interaction in Car","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8088436/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17316325","conferenceDate":"9-13 Oct. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"[POSTER] A Probabilistic Combination of CNN and RNN Estimates for Hand Gesture Based Interaction in Car","confLoc":"Nantes, France","sourcePdf":"6327a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061249S","chronDate":"9-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8087877","isNumber":"8088417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8087877","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8088417","articleId":"8088436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8088493,"authors":[{"name":"Varun Jain","affiliation":["TCS Research, India"],"firstName":"Varun","lastName":"Jain","id":"37086248895"},{"name":"Ramakrishna Perla","affiliation":["TCS Research, India"],"firstName":"Ramakrishna","lastName":"Perla","id":"37086019909"},{"name":"Ramya Hebbalaguppe","affiliation":["TCS Research, India"],"firstName":"Ramya","lastName":"Hebbalaguppe","id":"37085683929"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-6327-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1454-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8088493","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":515},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088493","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Cameras","Videos","Google","Performance evaluation","Gesture recognition","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["augmented reality","cameras","gesture recognition","human computer interaction","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex hand gestural interaction","frugal AR devices","user interaction","AR/VR applications","magnetic trigger","conductive lever","user-input capability","3-dimensional marker-less gestures","frugal smartphones","powerful AR/VR systems","gesture classification","monocular camera","AirGestAR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex gesture classification","deep learning","dynamic 3D gesture","monocular vision","smartphones"]}],"abstract":"Hand gestures provide a natural and an intuitive way of user interaction in AR/VR applications. However, the most popular and commercially available devices such as the Google Cardboard and Wearality1 still employ only primitive modes of interaction such as the magnetic trigger, conductive lever and have limited user-input capability. The truly instinctual gestures work only with inordinately priced devices such as the Hololens, Magic Leap, and Meta Glasses2 which use proprietary hardware and are still not commercially available. In this paper, we explore the possibility of leveraging deep learning for recognizing complex 3-dimensional marker-less gestures (Bloom, Click, Zoom-In, Zoom-Out) in real-time using monocular camera input from a single smartphone. This framework can be used with frugal smartphones to build powerful AR/VR systems for large scale deployments that work in real-time, eliminating the need for specialized hardware. We have created a hand gesture dataset to train LSTM networks for gesture classification and published the same online. We also demonstrate the performance of our proposed method in terms of classification accuracy and computational time.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct.2017.76","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR-Adjunct)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR-Adjunct)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8087877/8088417/08088493.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"239","doi":"10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct.2017.76","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"[POSTER] AirGestAR: Leveraging Deep Learning for Complex Hand Gestural Interaction with Frugal AR Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"[POSTER] AirGestAR: Leveraging Deep Learning for Complex Hand Gestural Interaction with Frugal AR Devices","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8088493/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17316313","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088493/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"[POSTER] AirGestAR: Leveraging Deep Learning for Complex Hand Gestural Interaction with Frugal AR Devices","confLoc":"Nantes, France","sourcePdf":"6327a235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073157S","chronDate":"9-13 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8087877","isNumber":"8088417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8087877","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8088417","articleId":"8088493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8088524,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis-Prodromos Belikaidis","affiliation":["WINGS ICT Solutions"],"bio":{"p":["Ioannis-prodromos Belikaidis (iobelika@wings-ict-solutions.eu) is a solution engineer in WINGS ICT Solutions.

A major challenge is the cost of meeting the objective, in terms of both infrastructure and deployment. Today, lack of dynamic control across wireless network resources is leading to unbalanced spectrum loads and a perceived capacity bottleneck. The solutions proposed by SPEED-5G through extended dynamic spectrum access (eDSA) address traffic allocation over heterogeneous wireless technologies, better load balancing across available spectrum bands, and capacity boosting through aggregation of available resources while ensuring fair coexistence. The objective of this article is to present a new framework for MAC and RRM layers for supporting eDSA and requirements of the next-generation networks.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2017.1700085","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/8088405/08088524.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2017.1700085","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","startPage":"14","endPage":"22","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-RAT Dynamic Spectrum Access for 5G Heterogeneous Networks: The SPEED-5G Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multi-RAT Dynamic Spectrum Access for 5G Heterogeneous Networks: The SPEED-5G Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088524/","volume":"24","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8088524/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 2017","accessionNumber":"17288682","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-RAT Dynamic Spectrum Access for 5G Heterogeneous Networks: The SPEED-5G Approach","sourcePdf":"012GEORGAKOPOULOS_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069948S","chronDate":"October  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"8088405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8088405","articleId":"8088524","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8088525,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio J.

This insight implicitly unveils a trade-off between the management of spectrum resource and the network density that offers new angles to systematically optimize the network spectral efficiency. Leveraging this tradeoff, this article proposes a framework for joint management of spectrum and network density in ultra-dense networks where the frequency spectrum and the density of the radio access network are treated as resources to be jointly optimized to improve the network spectral efficiency. The generality of this approach is demonstrated in several scenarios, including spectrum and network density management for network slicing, and spectrum sharing among multiple operators of co-located ultra-dense networks. In the process, we also discuss centralized and distributed architectural solutions for spectrum management where a network operator is granted either exclusive or non-exclusive access to a portion of the shared spectrum band.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Optimization","Radio spectrum management","5G mobile communication","Radio access networks","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","radio access networks","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5g ultra-dense networks","radio access network","network spectral efficiency","network slicing","co-located ultra-dense networks","spectrum management","network operator","network density management","spectrum resource management","spectrum sharing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWC.2017.1700087","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/8088405/08088526.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2017.1700087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum and Network Density Management in 5G Ultra-Dense Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum and Network Density Management in 5G Ultra-Dense Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088526/","volume":"24","issue":"5","publicationDate":"October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8088526/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17288666","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum and Network Density Management in 5G Ultra-Dense Networks","sourcePdf":"014KOUDOURIDIS_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034499S","chronDate":"October  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"8088405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8088405","articleId":"8088526","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8088527,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Caso","affiliation":["Sapienza University, Rome"],"bio":{"p":["Giuseppe Caso [M] (caso@diet.uniroma1.it) (Ph.D. 2016) is a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications at Sapienza University of Rome.

These IoTs are envisioned for a large number of use cases including smart cities, environment monitoring, smart vehicles, and so on. Unfortunately, most IoTs have very limited computing and storage capabilities and need cloud services. Hence, connecting these devices through 5G systems requires huge spectrum resources in addition to handling massive connectivity and improved security. This article discusses the challenges facing the support of IoTs through 5G systems. The focus is devoted to discussing physical layer limitations in terms of spectrum resources and radio access channel connectivity. We show how sparsity can be exploited for addressing these challenges, especially in terms of enabling wideband spectrum management and handling the connectivity by exploiting device-to-device communications and edge cloud. Moreover, we identify major open problems and research directions that need to be explored toward enabling the support of massive heterogeneous IoTs through 5G systems.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2017.1700067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/8088405/08088531.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"73","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2017.1700067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088405","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extracting and Exploiting Inherent Sparsity for Efficient IoT Support in 5G: Challenges and Potential Solutions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088531/","displayDocTitle":"Extracting and Exploiting Inherent Sparsity for Efficient IoT Support in 5G: Challenges and Potential Solutions","volume":"24","issue":"5","publicationDate":"October 2017","accessionNumber":"17288681","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8088531/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extracting and Exploiting Inherent Sparsity for Efficient IoT Support in 5G: Challenges and Potential Solutions","sourcePdf":"019KHALFI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034709S","chronDate":"October  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"8088405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8088405","articleId":"8088531","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8088532,"authors":[{"name":"Siyu Lin","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University"],"bio":{"p":["Siyu Lin (sylin@bjtu.edu.cn) received his B.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electronics engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University, China, in 2007 and 2013, respectively.

To achieve this target, the spectrum resource with low utilization is emptied out for 5G refarming. The refarmed spectrum is of effective propagation nature; however, it leads to extensive competition between PTOs and DTOs. To mitigate such competition, dynamic spectrum sharing should be realized. For this purpose, a spectrum sharing framework of a 5G system is designed in this article, in which the public users and dedicated users can access the sharing spectrum dynamically. In the framework, to ensure the QoE of the secondary users in a spectrum sharing system, the DTO in this case, an advanced dynamic channel access strategy is proposed. The spectrum sharing system states are modeled as a finite state Markov chain, and are used to analyze the system state transition model. Based on the analysis results, the optimal dynamic channel access strategy with minimum queuing time for DTO is derived by a Markov decision process.

Dynamic spectrum management represents interesting techniques in 5G, which improve the spectrum efficiency based on allowing unlicensed secondary users to access the licensed spectrum without interfering with licensed primary users. The secondary users must rendezvous with other intended secondary users on the same available channel at the same time before data transmission. The rendezvous process is the first key process for secondary users to communicate with each other. The channel hopping technique is a superior technique, providing rendezvous for dynamic spectrum management. This article analyzes the latest channel hopping protocols.

As the network densification has almost reached its limits, mobile network operators are motivated to share their network infrastructure and the available resources through dynamic spectrum management. Although some initial efforts have been made in this direction by concluding sharing agreements at a coarse granularity (i.e., months or years), the 5G developments require fine timescale agreements, mainly enabled by network slicing. In this article, taking into account the radical changes foreseen for next generation networks, we provide a thorough discussion of the challenges that network slicing brings in the different network parts, while introducing a new entity capable of managing the end-to-end slicing in a coherent manner. In addition, according to the paradigm shift of operators sharing their resources in a common centralized pool, we design a cooperative game to study the potential cooperation aspects among the participants. The experimental results highlight the performance and financial gains achievable by operators through multi-tenant slicing, providing them with the necessary incentives for network upgrade toward 5G.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088405","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/8088405/08088538.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2017.1700138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2017.1700138","startPage":"118","endPage":"125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Tenant Slicing for Spectrum Management on the Road to 5G","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088538/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Tenant Slicing for Spectrum Management on the Road to 5G","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8088538/","volume":"24","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"17288680","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2017","publicationDate":"October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Tenant Slicing for Spectrum Management on the Road to 5G","sourcePdf":"026VINCENZI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096476S","chronDate":"October  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"8088405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8088405","articleId":"8088538","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8088540,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Song","affiliation":["Southwest Jiatong University"],"bio":{"p":["Hao Song [S'14] (songhao992013@gmail.com) received his B.E. degree in electrical information engineering in 2011 from Zhengzhou University, China.

However, since unlicensed spectra are normally distributed over high-frequency bands and may suffer from random and uncontrollable interference, there are many research challenges for LTE-U systems ahead. To tackle these challenges, we propose a C/U decoupled system architecture for LTE-U systems, which has the advantages of lower complexity, higher flexibility, higher reliability, and higher system capacity. Specifically, we first design a framework and the corresponding system procedures for our proposed C/U decoupled LTE-U systems, including network architecture, frame structure, and centralized resource management procedure. Then we put forward the corresponding enabling and supporting technologies to solve the research challenges, including frequent inter-microcell handoffs, available unlicensed spectrum harvesting, and quality of service guarantee for traffic with high reliability requirements. We also conduct a simulation study to demonstrate the performance gain of the unlicensed spectra transmissions in our proposed LTE-U systems. Finally, we discuss several remaining research challenges, which could be potential topics for future research.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control/User Plane Decoupled Architecture Utilizing Unlicensed Bands in LTE Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2017.1600119","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/8088405/08088540.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2017.1600119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088405","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088540/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2017","displayDocTitle":"Control/User Plane Decoupled Architecture Utilizing Unlicensed Bands in LTE Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8088540/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2017","publicationDate":"October 2017","accessionNumber":"17288674","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control/User Plane Decoupled Architecture Utilizing Unlicensed Bands in LTE Systems","sourcePdf":"028FANG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073197S","chronDate":"October  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"8088405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8088405","articleId":"8088540","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8088544,"authors":[{"name":"Yasaman Ghasempour","affiliation":["Rice University"],"bio":{"p":["Yasaman Gasempour (ghasempour@rice.edu) is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rice University.

However, the application of deep learning for network traffic control in wireless/heterogeneous networks is a relatively new area. With the evolution of wireless networks, efficient network traffic control such as routing methodology in the wireless backbone network appears as a key challenge. This is because the conventional routing protocols do not learn from their previous experiences regarding network abnormalities such as congestion and so forth. Therefore, an intelligent network traffic control method is essential to avoid this problem. In this article, we address this issue and propose a new, real-time deep learning based intelligent network traffic control method, exploiting deep Convolutional Neural Networks (deep CNNs) with uniquely characterized inputs and outputs to represent the considered Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) backbone. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposal achieves significantly lower average delay and packet loss rate compared to those observed with the existing routing methods. We particularly focus on our proposed method's independence from existing routing protocols, which makes it a potential candidate to remove routing protocol(s) from future wired/ wireless networks.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2017.1700244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8304374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2017.1700244","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/8304374/08088549.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Removing Routing Protocol from Future Wireless Networks: A Real-time Deep Learning Approach for Intelligent Traffic Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"On Removing Routing Protocol from Future Wireless Networks: A Real-time Deep Learning Approach for Intelligent Traffic Control","volume":"25","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2018","dateOfInsertion":"28 February 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8088549/","publicationDate":"February 2018","accessionNumber":"17630102","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088549/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Removing Routing Protocol from Future Wireless Networks: A Real-time Deep Learning Approach for Intelligent Traffic Control","sourcePdf":"031KATO_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054835S","chronDate":"February  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"8304374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"8304374","articleId":"8088549","onlineDate":"27 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8088564,"authors":[{"name":"Tony Hanna","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, CNRS-UMR, France"],"firstName":"Tony","lastName":"Hanna","id":"37086132403"},{"name":"Nathalie Deltimple","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, CNRS-UMR, France"],"firstName":"Nathalie","lastName":"Deltimple","id":"37277053700"},{"name":"S\u00e9bastien Fr\u00e9gon\u00e8se","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, CNRS-UMR, France"],"firstName":"S\u00e9bastien","lastName":"Fr\u00e9gon\u00e8se","id":"37274861000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-5106-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6503-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8088564","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":784},"abstract":"In this work\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n we present the design of a fully integrated wideband high efficiency power amplifier for 5G applications.

The high oscillation frequency of mm-wave SROs enables fast quench rates that could well exceed 10 GHz. This is desirable because higher symbol rates and, consequently, higher communication data rates could be achieved. This work presents a limiting amplifier fabricated in a 0.13-qm SiGe BiCMOS technology fr = 300 GHz) for the generation of fast switching signals from an external RF sinusoidal source. The amplifier core is based on a modified differential Cherry-Hooper topology with embedded emitter followers, which is preceded by an active balun input stage. An additional tapered emitter follower output stage is implemented to drive 50-\u03a9 loads. The amplifier delivers 27.3 dB of differential gain over a 25-GHz bandwidth with a total power consumption of 79 mW. The power consumption is only 42 mW when excluding the output 50-\u03a9 driver that is only necessary for measurement. The circuit occupies an active area of only 100 \u03bcm \u03c7 150 \u03bcm due to its compact inductor-less design. It generates a high-speed differential output from a single input with a maximum peak-to-peak output voltage swing of 1.2 V and a rise/fall time of 5.6/6.0 ps at 20 GHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088565/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 1 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8088565/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17315313","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A SiGe HBT limiting amplifier for fast switching of mm-wave super-regenerative oscillators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A SiGe HBT limiting amplifier for fast switching of mm-wave super-regenerative oscillators","confLoc":"Fortaleza, Brazil","sourcePdf":"S52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055738S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074561","isNumber":"8088385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074561","xplore-issue":"8088385","articleId":"8088565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8088570,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Borges","affiliation":["Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Video Technology Group - ViTech, Brazil"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Borges","id":"37086233781"},{"name":"Luciano Braatz","affiliation":["Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Video Technology Group - ViTech, Brazil"],"firstName":"Luciano","lastName":"Braatz","id":"37086097532"},{"name":"Bruno Zatt","affiliation":["Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Video Technology Group - ViTech, Brazil"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Zatt","id":"37295620700"},{"name":"Marcelo Porto","affiliation":["Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Video Technology Group - ViTech, Brazil"],"firstName":"Marcelo","lastName":"Porto","id":"37409661800"},{"name":"Guilherme Corr\u00eaa","affiliation":["Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Video Technology Group - ViTech, Brazil"],"firstName":"Guilherme","lastName":"Corr\u00eaa","id":"37666854300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-5106-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6503-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8088570","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","image segmentation","splines (mathematics)","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video quality","HDR videos","time-consuming process","HDR pre-processor","high dynamic range video pre-processor","digital video capturing","compression techniques","real-time encoding","embedded systems","energy constraints","hardware designs","segmented spline hardware design","video codecs","Altera Stratix V FPGA","frequency 17.56 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High dynamic range","hardware","pre-processor","segmented spline"]}],"abstract":"Digital video capturing generates a huge amount of data to be processed and stored, which requires the use of compression techniques. Efficient hardware designs for real-time encoding are mandatory, especially for embedded systems, due to their performance and energy constraints. High Dynamic Range (HDR) video is a new technology that tends to be present in the next generation of devices in order to improve the video quality. However, the particularities of this kind of video incur in increased data to be stored and require support for special features in video processors/codecs. The current approach includes a pre-processor annex to an encoder to convert the HDR videos to a format that can be handled. This work presents a hardware design for the most time-consuming process within the HDR pre-processor, the Segmented Spline. The hardware design was developed based on hardware-oriented mathematical simplifications of the Segmented Spline, which reduce about 50% the number of basic operators.

At the same time, the adopted resolutions have been enlarged, demanding more coding efficiency and motivating the development of the new state-of-the-art standard, High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). However, to achieve the required efficiency the new standard greatly increased the computational intensity. That, allied to real-time constraints on mobile devices, results in a need for dedicated hardware implementations. A large part of the increasing complexity came at the Motion Estimation (ME) in the prediction coding step using larger blocks and more candidates. In ME, similarity metrics are a centerpiece of the performance achieved, both on coding efficiency and required computations. Among the used metrics is the Sum of Absolute Transformed Differences (SATD). Such metric may be calculated using a Transpose Buffer (TB) which largely increases the architecture area as block sizes increase. Alternatively, a Linear Buffer (LB) can be used, which results in less area at the cost of more energy consumption. This paper evaluates the use of Partial Distortion Elimination (PDE) as a means to reduce the energy consumption penalty associated with LB architectures. Our experimental results show that using PDE along with the LB architecture provides up to 65.61% energy reduction while negligibly degrading area.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the energy efficiency of a low-area SATD hardware architecture using fine grain PDE","publicationTitle":"2017 30th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 30th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8074561/8088385/08088572.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088385","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Improving the energy efficiency of a low-area SATD hardware architecture using fine grain PDE","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8088572/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17315311","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the energy efficiency of a low-area SATD hardware architecture using fine grain PDE","confLoc":"Fortaleza, Brazil","sourcePdf":"S64.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073784S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074561","isNumber":"8088385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074561","xplore-issue":"8088385","articleId":"8088572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8088573,"authors":[{"name":"Oscar Anacona-Mosquera","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Bras\u00edlia, Bras\u00edlia, D.F., Brazil"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Anacona-Mosquera","id":"37085884806"},{"name":"Gustavo Vinhal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Bras\u00edlia, Bras\u00edlia, D.F., Brazil"],"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Vinhal","id":"37086212292"},{"name":"Renato C.

NML circuits are composed of nanosized elongated magnets that operate at room temperature with ultra-low switching power dissipation. To create an NML circuit, the designer must place the magnets in such a way that, through magnetostatic interactions, signal propagation and logic are accomplished. The design of large NML circuits is at its infancy, where case studies involving complex circuits are lacking. To bridge this gap, we have examined two study cases: a Content Addressable Memory (CAM) and its ternary variant called Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM). CAM/TCAM differ from traditional RAM as the input is a data word instead of a memory address. CAM/TCAM provides the position where a given word can be found. In this paper, we present an overview of the functionality of NML, the proposed architectures, and its basic building blocks. We simulated the designs and showed that the memories work as expected. This work shows a potential tool for NML components design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CAM/TCAM \u2014 NML: (Ternary) content addressable memory implemented with nanomagnetic logic","publicationTitle":"2017 30th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 30th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8074561/8088385/08088575.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088385","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088575","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088575/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"CAM/TCAM \u2014 NML: (Ternary) content addressable memory implemented with nanomagnetic logic","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8088575/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17315328","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CAM/TCAM \u2014 NML: (Ternary) content addressable memory implemented with nanomagnetic logic","confLoc":"Fortaleza, Brazil","sourcePdf":"S72.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083478S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2017-Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074561","isNumber":"8088385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074561","xplore-issue":"8088385","articleId":"8088575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8088577,"authors":[{"name":"Jens Spinner","affiliation":["HTWG Konstanz, Institute of System Dynamics (ISD), Konstanz, Germany"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Spinner","id":"38527417700"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Freudenberger","affiliation":["HTWG Konstanz, Institute of System Dynamics (ISD), Konstanz, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Freudenberger","id":"37269391900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-5106-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6503-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8088577","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":155},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088577","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Flash memories","Parity check codes","Error correction codes","Error analysis","Error probability","Concatenated codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","binary codes","concatenated codes","decoding","error correction codes","flash memories","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-rate GC codes","soft information","inner codes","optional Chase soft decoder","code construction","decoder architecture","soft decoding capability","high-rate generalized concatenated codes","nonvolatile flash memories","decoder implementation","high reliability data storage","Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem codes","outer Reed-Solomon codes","extended binary BCH codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error correction","generalized concatenated codes","Reed-Solomon codes","Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem codes","flash memory"]}],"abstract":"This work proposes a decoder implementation for high-rate generalized concatenated (GC) codes.

Moreover, a suppressed zero-forcing (SZF) scheme based on vertically and horizontally polarized transmit beams is proposed with multibeam transmissions in order to increase diversity and improve the reliability of the precoded control channel. Extensive numerical results are provided in a fifth generation new radio (5G-NR) ultradense network (UDN) context with a realistic system level simulator. Results show that control channel capacity can be increased significantly by means of multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) techniques, without the need for accurate channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed beamforming based scheme achieve the desirable >0.98 reliability of downlink control channel with different TRP array sizes. Further improvements in reliability are suggested in order to reach the challenging ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) targets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17315261","htmlLink":"/document/8088590/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Location-aware beamformed downlink control channel for ultra-dense networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location-aware beamformed downlink control channel for ultra-dense networks","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570361167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093718S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074544","isNumber":"8088583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074544","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8088583","articleId":"8088590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8088591,"authors":[{"name":"Fasil B.

Simulation results have shown that, for a sufficiently long cyclic prefix duration, the multiconnectivity scheme can fully resolve connection failures, and improve 5-%ile and average throughput by around 33% and 9%, respectively, compared to single connectivity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088591/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17315296","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8088591/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Impact of cyclic prefix configuration on mobility performance of multi-connectivity in 5G networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of cyclic prefix configuration on mobility performance of multi-connectivity in 5G networks","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570357029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058025S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074544","isNumber":"8088583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074544","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8088583","articleId":"8088591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8088593,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d6.

To cater to such demand, 3GPP has finalized specifications for enhanced machine type communication (eMTC) and narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) as part of LTE Release 13\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n. To avoid resource congestion to legacy users, eMTC communication can be limited to predefined eMTC narrowband(s) with receiver bandwidth of 1.08MHz, whereas in NB-IoT all communications are limited to a single resource block\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n. Both eMTC and NB-IoT are designed to cater for bandwidth limited low complexity/coverage enhancement (BL/CE) devices, with MTC messages repeated across several BL/CE subframes lasting up to several seconds, to accomodate for large maximum coupling losses (MCL). To avoid MTC users from hogging, collide with legacy resources during lengthy repetitions, 3GPP defines BL/CE subframes and has made provisions for valid and invalid BL/CE subframes to be configured. With large number of MTC devices sharing limited resources and message repetitions lasting several SFs, the LTE medium access control (MAC) scheduler processing burden will be significantly increased. This is because the scheduler operates on a subframe (SF) basis and has to find the MTC users who can be scheduled either in the current SF, or at a future SF after ongoing repetitions finish, or within a gap between previously scheduled repetitions. Another complexity is that the control messages(e.g., MPDCCH) can only be scheduled at certain start intervals and within predefined boundaries. In this paper we address these problems with a low complexity constant time scheduling scheme for MTC users\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n when invalid BL/CE SFs are configured. The proposed algorithms are generic and applicable to both eNB and UE implementation. With detailed system level simulations we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed scheme when large number of MTC users are active in the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088600/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8088600/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17315262","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient resource scheduling for eMTC/NB-IoT communications in LTE Rel. 13","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient resource scheduling for eMTC/NB-IoT communications in LTE Rel. 13","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570361225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04993S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074544","isNumber":"8088583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074544","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8088583","articleId":"8088600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8088601,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Han","affiliation":["University of Kaiserslautern, Institute for Wireless Communication and Navigation, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Han","id":"37086119054"},{"name":"Mohammad Asif Habibi","affiliation":["University of Kaiserslautern, Institute for Wireless Communication and Navigation, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Mohammad Asif","lastName":"Habibi","id":"37086244199"},{"name":"Hans D.

The proposed Vehicular SUDAS shows excellent performance, positioning itself as a strong contender for next V2X communication services.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSCN.2017.8088606","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking (CSCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking (CSCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8074544/8088583/08088606.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"108","doi":"10.1109/CSCN.2017.8088606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicular SUDAS for 5G high mobility V2X scenarios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Vehicular SUDAS for 5G high mobility V2X scenarios","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8088606/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17315297","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088606/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicular SUDAS for 5G high mobility V2X scenarios","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570367557.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040939S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074544","isNumber":"8088583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074544","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8088583","articleId":"8088606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8088608,"authors":[{"name":"Rakibul Islam Rony","affiliation":["Dept. of Network Engineering, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona ES"],"firstName":"Rakibul Islam","lastName":"Rony","id":"37085682315"},{"name":"Akshay Jain","affiliation":["Dept. of Network Engineering, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona ES"],"firstName":"Akshay","lastName":"Jain","id":"37086238290"},{"name":"Elena Lopez-Aguilera","affiliation":["Dept. of Network Engineering, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona ES"],"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Lopez-Aguilera","id":"38274498700"},{"name":"Eduard Garcia-Villegas","affiliation":["Dept. of Network Engineering, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona ES"],"firstName":"Eduard","lastName":"Garcia-Villegas","id":"37078118900"},{"name":"Ilker Demirkol","affiliation":["Dept. of Network Engineering, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona ES"],"firstName":"Ilker","lastName":"Demirkol","id":"37397025200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3070-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3071-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8088608","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088608","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["5G mobile communication","Wireless communication","Mobile radio mobility management","Conferences","Quality of service","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","mobility management (mobile radio)","multi-access systems","next generation networks","quality of service","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access mechanisms","backhaul optimization","software defined networks","network function virtualization","distributed mobility management","interference management","QoS","mobility management mechanisms","joint access-backhaul perspective","quality of service","backhaul-fronthaul networks"]}],"abstract":"The ongoing efforts in the research, development and standardization of 5G, by both industry and academia, have resulted in the identification of enablers (Software Defined Networks, Network Function Virtualization, Distributed Mobility Management, etc.) and critical areas (Mobility management, Interference management, Joint access-backhaul mechanisms, etc.) that will help achieve the 5G objectives. During these efforts, it has also been identified that the 5G networks, due to their high degree of heterogeneity, high QoS demand and the inevitable density (both in terms of access points and users), will need to have efficient joint backhaul and access mechanisms as well as enhanced mobility management mechanisms in order to be effective, efficient and ubiquitous. Therefore, in this paper, we first provide a discussion on the evolution of the backhaul scenario, and the necessity for joint access and backhaul optimization. Subsequently, and since mobility management mechanisms can entail the availability, reliability and heterogeneity of the future backhaul/fronthaul networks as parameters in determining the most optimal solution for a given context, a study with regards to the effect of future backhaul/fronthaul scenarios on the design and implementation of mobility management solutions in 5G networks has been performed.","doi":"10.1109/CSCN.2017.8088608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSCN.2017.8088608","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking (CSCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking (CSCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8074544/8088583/08088608.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint access-backhaul perspective on mobility management in 5G networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint access-backhaul perspective on mobility management in 5G networks","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8088608/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17315279","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088608/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint access-backhaul perspective on mobility management in 5G networks","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570366526.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083052S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074544","isNumber":"8088583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074544","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8088583","articleId":"8088608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8088616,"authors":[{"name":"Panu L\u00e4hdekorpi","affiliation":["Magister Solutions Ltd., Finland"],"firstName":"Panu","lastName":"L\u00e4hdekorpi","id":"37597087300"},{"name":"Michal Hronec","affiliation":["Magister Solutions Ltd., Finland"],"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Hronec","id":"37086251430"},{"name":"Petri Jolma","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs, Finland"],"firstName":"Petri","lastName":"Jolma","id":"37085583400"},{"name":"Jani Moilanen","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs, Finland"],"firstName":"Jani","lastName":"Moilanen","id":"37947152900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3070-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3071-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8088616","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":774},"abstract":"The paper presents system level simulation results on future base station energy saving using a time-triggered sleep model.

The fifth generation (5G) will be a major revolution in mobile networks and there have been discussions onto adopting a different protocol, with the proposals being generic routing encapsulation (GRE), virtual extensible local area network (VXLAN) and generic network virtualization encapsulation (Geneve). In this paper, these protocols are compared. GTP has a 32-bit tunnel endpoint identifier (TEID) and runs on top of user datagram protocol (UDP), thus allowing many applications in the same IP address in different ports. However, GTP unnecessarily stores packet length many times in the Internet protocol (IP), UDP and GTP levels, and the fragmentation strategy defined in third generation partnership project (3GPP) specifications is suboptimal. GRE has well-defined fragmentation strategy but runs directly on top of IP, so multiplexing based on ports is not possible. VXLAN and Geneve have only 24 bits for network identifier and encapsulate media access control (MAC) frames, which is not really what is needed here, and the fragmentation strategy of VXLAN is suboptimal albeit in a different way than in GTP. In this paper, we propose a common fragmentation strategy that may be applicable to all protocols.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","IP networks","Tunneling","Proposals","Control systems","5G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","5G mobile communication","access protocols","cellular radio","IP networks","local area networks","packet radio networks","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic","transport protocols","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data plane protocols","5G mobile networks","general packet radio service tunneling protocol","core network","fifth generation","generic routing encapsulation","GRE","VXLAN","generic network virtualization encapsulation","Geneve","32-bit tunnel endpoint identifier","user datagram protocol","IP","GTP levels","generation partnership project specifications","network identifier","common fragmentation strategy","packet length","media access control frames","MAC frames","mobile networks","5G","word length 24.0 bit","word length 32 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Generic Routing Encapsulation","General Packet Radio Service Tunneling Protocol","Virtual Extensible Local Area Network","Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CSCN.2017.8088623","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking (CSCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking (CSCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8074544/8088583/08088623.pdf","startPage":"207","endPage":"213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSCN.2017.8088623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data plane protocols and fragmentation for 5G","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data plane protocols and fragmentation for 5G","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088623/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8088623/","accessionNumber":"17315282","conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data plane protocols and fragmentation for 5G","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570352984.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045896S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074544","isNumber":"8088583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074544","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8088583","articleId":"8088623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8088624,"authors":[{"name":"Le Luong Vy","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Le Luong","lastName":"Vy","id":"37086212763"},{"name":"Li-Ping Tung","affiliation":["Microelectronics & Information Research Center, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Ping","lastName":"Tung","id":"37950603500"},{"name":"Bao-Shuh Paul Lin","affiliation":["Microelectronics & Information Research Center, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Bao-Shuh Paul","lastName":"Lin","id":"38237920400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3070-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3071-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8088624","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handover","Big Data","Forecasting","Clustering algorithms","Hidden Markov models","5G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobility management (mobile radio)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra-dense networks","macro cells","mobile networks","network quality","mobility management","handover management","machine learning","big data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["key performance indicators (KPIs)","Machine Learning","SON","5G","drive test","handover","big data"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088624","abstract":"Handover (HO), as a key aspect of mobility management, plays an important role in improving network quality and mobility performance in mobile networks. Especially, in 5G networks, heterogeneous networks (HetNets) deployment of macro cells and small cells, and the deployment of ultra-dense networks (UDNs) make HO management become more challenging. Besides, the understanding of HO behavior in a cell is quite limited in existing studies, thus the forecasting HO for an individual cell is complicated, even impossible. This challenge led the authors to propose a practical process for managing and forecasting HO for a huge number of cells, based on machinelearning (ML) algorithms and big data. Moreover, based on HO forecasting, the authors also propose an approach to detect any abnormal HO in cells. The performance of the proposed approaches was evaluated by applying it to a real dataset that collected HO KPI of more than 6000 cells of a real network during the years, 2016 and 2017. The results show that the study was successful in identifying, separating HO behavior, forecasting the future number of HO attempts, and detecting abnormal HO behaviors of cells.","doi":"10.1109/CSCN.2017.8088624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSCN.2017.8088624","startPage":"214","endPage":"219","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking (CSCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8074544/8088583/08088624.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking (CSCN)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Big data and machine learning driven handover management and forecasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Big data and machine learning driven handover management and forecasting","conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8088624/","accessionNumber":"17315260","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088624/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Big data and machine learning driven handover management and forecasting","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570355269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101036S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074544","isNumber":"8088583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074544","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8088583","articleId":"8088624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8088633,"authors":[{"name":"Chieh-Hao Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chieh-Hao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086222490"},{"name":"Jing-Yan Lin","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jing-Yan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086218914"},{"name":"Jen-Ming Wu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen-Ming","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085355434"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3070-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3071-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8088633","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":501},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Resource management","Uplink","Silicon carbide","Detection algorithms","Receivers","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","error statistics","multi-access systems","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","nonorthogonal multiple access communication system","orthogonal multiple access system","NOMA communications","K"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-orthogonal multiple access","resource allocation","fairness"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study fairness and sum rate performance issues in uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication system by allocation of subbands and power to users. In a NOMA system, each subband can be shared by L users simultaneously, which leads to higher spectral efficiency than the Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) system. It has been studied that, without proper allocation of target data rate for each uplink NOMA user, a user can always be in outage.

theoretical capacity limits. Ever-increasing demand for wireless communications and emerging numerous high-capacity services and applications mandate providers to employ more bandwidth-oriented solutions to meet the requirements. Trend and predictions point out that marketplace targets data rates around 10Gbps or even more within the upcoming decade. It is clear that such rates could only be achieved by employing more bandwidth with the state-of-the-art technology. Considering the fact that bands in the range of 275GHz-3000GHz, which are known as Terahertz (THz) bands, are not allocated yet for specific active services around the globe, there is an enormous potential to achieve the desired data rates. Although THz bands look promising to achieve data rates on the order of several tens of Gbps, realization of fully operational THz communications systems obliges to carry out a multidisciplinary effort including statistical propagation and channel characterizations, adaptive transceiver designs, reconfigurable platforms, advanced signal processing algorithms and techniques along with upper layer protocols equipped with various security and privacy levels. Therefore, in this study, several important statistical parameters for line-of-sight (LOS) channels are measured. High resolution frequency domain measurements are carried out at single-sweep within a span of 60GHz. Impact of antenna misalignment under LOS conditions is also investigated. By validating exponential decay of the received power in both time and frequency domain, path loss exponent is examined for different frequencies along with the frequency-dependent path loss phenomenon. Furthermore, impact of humidity is also tested under LOS scenario. Measurement results are presented along with relevant discussions and future directions are provided as well.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSCN.2017.8088634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088583","startPage":"275","endPage":"280","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking (CSCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8074544/8088583/08088634.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical modeling of propagation channels for Terahertz band","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8088634/","displayDocTitle":"Statistical modeling of propagation channels for Terahertz band","conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17315267","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical modeling of propagation channels for Terahertz band","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570361398.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049027S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074544","isNumber":"8088583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074544","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8088583","articleId":"8088634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":8088642,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Mylrea","affiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Mylrea","id":"37086233520"},{"name":"Sri Nikhil Gupta Gourisetti","affiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"],"firstName":"Sri Nikhil Gupta","lastName":"Gourisetti"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6055-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6056-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8088642","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Contracts","Distributed databases","Computer security","Resilience","Smart grids","Transactive energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system security","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trustworthiness","complex energy transactions","data exchanges","auditable multiparty transactions","distributed energy providers","blockchain based smart contracts","distributed energy transactions","energy flows","financial transactions","transactive energy costs","sustainability","distributed energy resource integration","decentralized power grid","resilient power grid","smart grid cyber resiliency","secure transactive energy applications","smart grid resilience"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blockchain","resilience","transactive energy","smart grid","cybersecurity","grid cybersecurity","cryptography","smart contracts"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088642","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Resilience Week (RWS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8070887/8088637/08088642.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWEEK.2017.8088642","doi":"10.1109/RWEEK.2017.8088642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088637","publicationTitle":"2017 Resilience Week (RWS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blockchain for smart grid resilience: Exchanging distributed energy at speed, scale and security","abstract":"Blockchain may help solve several complex problems related to securing the integrity and trustworthiness of rapid, distributed, complex energy transactions and data exchanges. In a move towards grid resilience, blockchain commoditizes trust and enables automated smart contracts to support auditable multiparty transactions based on predefined rules between distributed energy providers and customers. Blockchain based smart contracts also help remove the need to interact with third-parties, facilitating the adoption and monetization of distributed energy transactions and exchanges, both energy flows as well as financial transactions.

Chemical, physical and mechanical variability in feedstock prevents the preprocessing plants from assuming constant control parameters. Constant control parameters can lead to suboptimal capability and reliability. However, adapting the control parameters to account for the variabilities is not a trivial task. This paper presents a framework for adapting control parameters through data driven methodologies. The framework named PDU- RS is a decision support system for human in the loop control. PDU-RS is implemented on the Biofuels National User Facility Preprocessing Process Demonstration Unit (PDU), operated by the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in Idaho Falls, Idaho. PDU-RS aims at ensuring reliability in the overall operations of the PDU while maximizing throughput. Presented implementation of the PDU-RS uses Gaussian Processes (GP) for knowledge extraction from data. This paper elaborates on the PDU-RS and presents the experimental results of implementing the PDU-RS on the real Biomass PDU. The experimental results demonstrated that the PDU-RS is able to produce significantly higher throughputs while ensuring higher reliability when compared to the traditional control methodology used with the system.","doi":"10.1109/RWEEK.2017.8088655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWEEK.2017.8088655","startPage":"97","endPage":"102","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Resilience Week (RWS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8070887/8088637/08088655.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 Resilience Week (RWS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data driven decision support for reliable biomass feedstock preprocessing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Data driven decision support for reliable biomass feedstock preprocessing","conferenceDate":"18-22 Sept. 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8088655/","accessionNumber":"17315124","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088655/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data driven decision support for reliable biomass feedstock preprocessing","confLoc":"Wilmington, DE, USA","sourcePdf":"0097nf001163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098694S","chronDate":"18-22 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8070887","isNumber":"8088637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8070887","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8088637","articleId":"8088655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8088680,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Cavallini","affiliation":["DEI - University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Cavallini","id":"37271480400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88686-099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6460-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8088680","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088680","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surges","Insulation","Partial discharges","Inverters","Time-frequency analysis","Degradation","Stress"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","invertors","motor drives","power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft","electrical vehicles actuators","insulation issues","power electronics","electrical drives","wide band-gap devices","low voltage inverter-fed motor reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Partial discharges","More Electrical Aircraft","Electric Vehicles","Inverter","Wide bandgap devices"]}],"abstract":"A brief summary of the insulation issues associated with the use of power electronics in electrical drives is presented here.

In the future, for improving a performance of power equipment such as high output or miniaturization, electrical insulation parts in motors are expected to become higher electric field. Motor windings have small gaps at which partial discharge may easily occur and it can lead to dielectric degradation and finally breakdown. Furthermore, inverter-fed motors have a problem that generated inverter surge voltage due to high speed switching with high voltage is affected its insulating system. In our previous study, under DC voltage application, it was found that partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) increased or decreased according to surface potential on insulating film and PDIV without surface charge can be estimated by subtracting the surface potential from PDIV with surface charge. However, it has not been clarified the influence of surface charge on PDIV under surge voltage application in detail. In this study, it was investigated PDIV under surge voltage application influenced by surface charge on insulating sheet and relationship between surface charge and initial electron supply was estimated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8088713/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17315536","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","conferenceDate":"11-15 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Partial discharge inception voltage under positive surge voltage application influenced by surface charge on polyimide film","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial discharge inception voltage under positive surge voltage application influenced by surface charge on polyimide film","confLoc":"Toyohashi, Japan","sourcePdf":"035SPD3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045829S","chronDate":"11-15 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8074822","isNumber":"8088674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8074822","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8088674","articleId":"8088713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Dielectrics & Electrical Insulation, IEEJ","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8088728,"authors":[{"name":"Grzegorz Dombek","affiliation":["Poznan University of Technology, Poznan"],"firstName":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Dombek","id":"37085401529"},{"name":"Jaroslaw Gielniak","affiliation":["Poznan University of Technology, Poznan"],"firstName":"Jaroslaw","lastName":"Gielniak","id":"37449704800"},{"name":"Robert Wroblewski","affiliation":["Poznan University of Technology, Poznan"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Wroblewski","id":"37086233003"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88686-099-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6460-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8088728","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088728","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Minerals","Fires","Oils","Liquids","Dielectric liquids","Oil insulation","Power transformer insulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric losses","electrical conductivity","fires","insulating oils","oils","permittivity","power transformers","safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fire safety","electrical properties","mineral oil/synthetic ester mixtures","flash point","fire point","net calorific value","breakdown voltage","relative permittivity","dissipation factor","conductivity","dielectric loss","power transformers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dielectric liquids","power transformers","oil insulation","safety"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents research results of mineral oil/synthetic ester mixtures comprising: flash point (open and closed cup), fire point (open cup), net calorific value, breakdown voltage, relative permittivity, dissipation factor, conductivity and dielectric losses.

The system describes an absolute amplitude ratio sensitivity of 5250 to stiffness perturbations in linear operation.

A resolution of 85ppb corresponding to normalised stiffness perturbations in amplitude ratio measurements is thus demonstrated at 500s integration time. Comparisons to frequency shift sensing within the same device shows that amplitude ratio sensing provides higher accuracies for long term measurements due to intrinsic common mode rejection properties in a mode-localized system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonators","Sensors","Sensitivity","Frequency measurement","Thermal stability","Resonant frequency","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mass measurement","micromechanical resonators","microsensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["absolute amplitude ratio sensitivity","mode-localized system","closed-loop tracking","mode-localized resonant MEMS sensor","amplitude ratio measurement","normalised stiffness perturbation","intrinsic common mode rejection property","frequency shift stability","integration time amplitude ratio sensing","time 500.0 s"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FCS.2017.8088944","publicationTitle":"2017 Joint Conference of the European Frequency and Time Forum and IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium (EFTF/IFCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Joint Conference of the European Frequency and Time Forum and IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium (EFTF/IFCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8075004/8088780/08088944.pdf","startPage":"510","endPage":"513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8088780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCS.2017.8088944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-loop tracking of amplitude and frequency in a mode-localized resonant MEMS sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8088944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Closed-loop tracking of amplitude and frequency in a mode-localized resonant MEMS sensor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8088944/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8088944/","accessionNumber":"17293698","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-loop tracking of amplitude and frequency in a mode-localized resonant MEMS sensor","confLoc":"Besancon, France","sourcePdf":"C2LB041392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042303S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8075004","isNumber":"8088780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8075004","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8088780","articleId":"8088944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8088963,"authors":[{"name":"P.-Y.

Cognitive radio (CR) networks are gleaning attention in the current generation of wireless networks and it is predicted that it will play a vital role in the field of communication in providing an interminable connection. When networks are integrated on the availability of many types, user plays a major role in selecting the best optimal desired network, since each network type has its standalone characteristics from the other. The handoff parameters can also be taken into account for determining ideal networks. This motivates to investigate the significance of various handoff parameters in terms of networks conditions on coadunation of Wifi and Wimax (WW) in CR networks and the existing integrated WW. The empirical results shows that cognitive based integrated WW networks are effective with minimal complexity in the handoff process compared to the existing integrated WW networks. The performance of various handoff parameters is analyzed on a network simulator and results indicate best performance is obtained in cognitive radio based integrated WW network compared to the existing method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSTM.2017.8089149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8089108","startPage":"190","endPage":"194","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Smart Technologies and Management for Computing, Communication, Controls, Energy and Materials (ICSTM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8078139/8089108/08089149.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of handoff parameters in cognitive radio networks on coadunation of Wifi and Wimax systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8089149/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of handoff parameters in cognitive radio networks on coadunation of Wifi and Wimax systems","conferenceDate":"2-4 Aug. 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17316069","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of handoff parameters in cognitive radio networks on coadunation of Wifi and Wimax systems","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"A33P279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062271S","chronDate":"2-4 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8078139","isNumber":"8089108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8078139","xplore-issue":"8089108","articleId":"8089149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8089175,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Lately, ambulatory data gathering methods are being popularized in real applications. However, due to present mobile underwater data collection investigations that are on the basis of 2-D scenarios, the associated approaches are not suitable for 3-D UASNs. Additionally, mobile-element-assisted data collection usually brings special issues on obstacle avoidance. Accordingly, we propose a probabilistic neighborhood location-point covering set-based data collection algorithm with obstacle avoidance for 3-D UASNs. The proposed algorithm initially generates a space lattice set to establish the probabilistic neighborhood location-point covering set for data collection, so as to optimize the data collection latency. Then, an autonomous underwater vehicle traverses only location points in the constructed covering set with a hierarchical grid-based obstacle avoidance strategy. The simulation experiments are performed to verify the proposed algorithm compared with other existing underwater data collection algorithms. Simulations show that our proposed algorithm achieves better performance in terms of data collection latency, data collection efficiency, and obstacle avoidance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2767619","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08089330.pdf","startPage":"24785","endPage":"24796","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2767619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Neighborhood Location-Point Covering Set-Based Data Collection Algorithm With Obstacle Avoidance for Three-Dimensional Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Neighborhood Location-Point Covering Set-Based Data Collection Algorithm With Obstacle Avoidance for Three-Dimensional Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8089330/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17381281","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089330/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572172 and 61602152"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2016B10714 and 2016B03114"},{"fundingName":"Changzhou Sciences and Technology Program","grantNumber":"CE20165023 and CE20160014"},{"fundingName":"Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"XYDXXJS-007"},{"fundingName":"Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Acoustics","grantNumber":"SKLA201706"},{"fundingName":"Liaoning Fourth Batch of Distinguished Professor Project (2014)"},{"fundingName":"Liaoning BaiQianWan Talents Program(2016)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005047","fundingName":"Liaoning Province Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"20170540793"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Probabilistic Neighborhood Location-Point Covering Set-Based Data Collection Algorithm With Obstacle Avoidance for Three-Dimensional Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"access-han-2767619-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069593S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8089330","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8089335,"authors":[{"name":"Yue-Jing He","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, National Chin-Yi University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Yue-Jing He received the M.S. degree from the Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2006.

The traditional cloud infrastructure will run into a series of difficulties due to centralized computation, storage, and networking in a small number of datacenters, and due to the relative long distance between the edge devices and the remote datacenters. To tackle this challenge, edge cloud and edge computing seem to be a promising possibility which provides resources closer to the resource-poor edge IoT devices and potentially can nurture a new IoT innovation ecosystem. Such prospect is enabled by a series of emerging technologies, including network function virtualization and software defined networking. In this survey paper, we investigate the key rationale, the state-of-the-art efforts, the key enabling technologies and research topics, and typical IoT applications benefiting from edge cloud. We aim to draw an overall picture of both ongoing research efforts and future possible research directions through comprehensive discussions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089336/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","volume":"5","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17577588","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8089336/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Future Edge Cloud and Edge Computing for Internet of Things Applications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100009226","fundingName":"National Security Agency","grantNumber":"H98230-17-1-0393 and H98230-17-1-0352"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007165","fundingName":"University of Missouri System Research Board Award"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Future Edge Cloud and Edge Computing for Internet of Things Applications","sourcePdf":"jiot-pan-2767608-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034974S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8288638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"155","xplore-issue":"8288638","articleId":"8089336","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8089340,"authors":[{"name":"Sara Tehsin","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Software Engineering, National University of Sciences and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8089340/tehsi-2762354-small.gif","p":["Sara Tehsin received the B.Sc. degree from Islamia University, Pakistan.

Most correlation filters are derived from a complex filter equation leading to a closed form filter solution. The response of the correlation filter depends upon the selected values of the optimal trade-off (OT) parameters. In this paper, the OT parameters are optimized using particle swarm optimization with respect to two different cost functions. The optimization has been made generic and is applied to each target separately in order to achieve the best possible result for each scenario. The filters obtained using standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) and hierarchal particle swarm optimization algorithms have been compared for various test images with the filter solutions available in the literature. It has been shown that optimization improves the performance of the filters significantly.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2762354","startPage":"24495","endPage":"24502","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2762354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08089340.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Organizing Hierarchical Particle Swarm Optimization of Correlation Filters for Object Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089340/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Self-Organizing Hierarchical Particle Swarm Optimization of Correlation Filters for Object Recognition","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8089340/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17381283","publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Self-Organizing Hierarchical Particle Swarm Optimization of Correlation Filters for Object Recognition","sourcePdf":"access-tehsin-2762354-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103514S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8089340","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8089342,"authors":[{"name":"Xiansheng Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xiansheng","lastName":"Guo","orcid":"0000-0002-8440-1607","id":"37292757600"},{"name":"Sihua Shao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Newark, USA"],"firstName":"Sihua","lastName":"Shao","orcid":"0000-0002-2831-9860","id":"37085574191"},{"name":"Nirwan Ansari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Newark, USA"],"firstName":"Nirwan","lastName":"Ansari","orcid":"0000-0001-8541-3565","id":"37279350900"},{"name":"Abdallah Khreishah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Newark, USA"],"firstName":"Abdallah","lastName":"Khreishah","orcid":"0000-0003-1583-713X","id":"37303999200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"8089342","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1942},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"","type":"graphic","fileSize":"288 KB","file":"/ielx7/4563994/8080089/8089342/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2767576.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/4563994/8080089/8089342/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2767576.jpg"},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8089342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indoor Localization Using Visible Light Via Fusion of Multiple Classifiers","abstract":"We propose a localization technique by fusing multiple classifiers based on received signal strengths (RSSs) of visible light in which different intensity-modulated sinusoidal signals emitted by LEDs are captured by photodiodes placed at various grid points.

Unlike the existing RSSs-based algorithms, several representative machine learning algorithms are adopted to train multiple classifiers based on these RSSs fingerprints.

network, as a medium distance transmission system, poses a special challenge of transmission capacity and cost. In this paper, we present a detailed comparison of applying three advanced modulation formats including pulse amplitude modulation-4 (PAM-4), carrierless amplitude and phase modulation-16 QAM (CAP-16), and discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-S OFDM) with low-cost direct detection for 100-Gb/s/\u03bb metro optical transmission systems. These modulation formats are all experimentally demonstrated with similar digital signal processing algorithms. Three kinds of chromatic dispersion (CD) compensation ways named CD precompensation method, single sideband (SSB), and dispersion compensating fiber (DCF) are also compared. Two types of modulators including an IQ modulator and a dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator are employed to generate SSB or CD precompensated signals in this experiment and their transmission performance is also evaluated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the performance of single-wavelength 100-G signal transmission based on direct detection is evaluated over 480 km of standard single mode fiber with PAM-4, CAP-16, and DFT-S OFDM modulation formats.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2767901","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8114351/08089346.pdf","startPage":"5127","endPage":"5133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2767901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8114351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission Performance Comparison for 100-Gb/s PAM-4, CAP-16, and DFT-S OFDM With Direct Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8089346","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1, 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089346/","displayDocTitle":"Transmission Performance Comparison for 100-Gb/s PAM-4, CAP-16, and DFT-S OFDM With Direct Detection","volume":"35","issue":"23","publicationDate":"1 Dec.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"17372091","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8089346/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61325002, 61527801, 61571133, 61720106015 and 61675048"},{"fundingName":"State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC): Research on Key Technologies of High Reliability and Short Distance Wireless Communication in Power Complex Electromagnetic Environment and Open Fund of IPOC (BUPT)","grantNumber":"IPOC2015B002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission Performance Comparison for 100-Gb/s PAM-4, CAP-16, and DFT-S OFDM With Direct Detection","sourcePdf":"jlt-shi-2767901-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076957S","chronDate":"Dec.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8114351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8114351","articleId":"8089346","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8089349,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Ibrahim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/8466984/8089349/ibrah-2759251-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Ibrahim (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc.

Over the past decade, several design-automation (synthesis) techniques have been developed for on-chip droplet manipulation. However, these methods oversimplify the dynamics of biomolecular protocols and they have yet to make a significant impact in biochemistry/microbiology research, leading to a large gap between advances in biochip design and the adoption of biochips for running biomolecular protocols. In this paper, we bridge this gap by introducing a new paradigm for biochip design automation. By exploiting advances in the integration of sensing systems into a digital-microfluidic biochip, we present a number of synthesis solutions that use realistic models of biomolecular protocols to address real-world microbiology applications through cyber-physical adaptation. This paper also details a vision for continued research on design-automation and optimization methodologies for the realization of biomolecular protocols using microfluidic biochips.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5/8466984/8089349-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089349/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8089349/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2018","accessionNumber":"18095282","volume":"106","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cyber\u2013Physical Digital-Microfluidic Biochips: Bridging the Gap Between Microfluidics and Microbiology","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1702596 and CCF-1135853"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Cyber\u2013Physical Digital-Microfluidic Biochips: Bridging the Gap Between Microfluidics and Microbiology","sourcePdf":"jproc-ibrahim-2759251-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.204546S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"8466984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8466984","articleId":"8089349","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8089355,"authors":[{"name":"Chongtao Guo","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8318405/8089355/guo-2767633-small.gif","p":["Chongtao\u00a0Guo (S\u201913\u2013M\u201914) received the B.S.\n degree in electronic and information engineering and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information systems from\n Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2009 and 2014, respectively.","Since 2014, he has been with the College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China, where he\n is currently an Assistant Professor.

The harvest-then-transmit protocol is adopted in the WPSCN, i.e., the energy access point (EAP) first transfers energy to legitimate users through energy beamforming, and then, the legitimate users transmit their data to the information access point (IAP) by time-division multiple access. Since an eavesdropper intercepts users' uplink information, the EAP creates artificial noise to cripple the interception capability of the eavesdropper. For providing a secrecy throughput balancing across different legitimate users, we aim to maximize the minimum secrecy throughput of all users via time allocation, energy beamforming, and artificial noise design. To this end, a low-complexity two-stage algorithm is proposed. In the first stage, without taking into account the eavesdropper's wiretapping, we design time allocation and energy beamforming by solving the problem of minimum throughput maximization, which is convex and can be easily solved. In the second stage, two easily implementable strategies are proposed for artificial noise design so as to strengthen the noise power at the eavesdropper and simultaneously reduce the noise power at the IAP. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed approach is close to the upper bound and not sensitive to scenario settings, which confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2767633","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8318405/08089355.pdf","startPage":"2571","endPage":"2581","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2767633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum Secrecy Throughput Maximization in Wireless Powered Secure Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Minimum Secrecy Throughput Maximization in Wireless Powered Secure Communications","volume":"67","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8089355/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17633228","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089355/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601307, 61771316, 61701317, 61601300 and 61501285"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2017A030313341, 2017A030310371 and 2017A030313336"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"JCYJ20160422102022017 and JCYJ20170302150006125"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund through the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory of Southeast University in China","grantNumber":"2017D10"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of SZU","grantNumber":"2017076 and 827-000071"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum Secrecy Throughput Maximization in Wireless Powered Secure Communications","sourcePdf":"tvt-guo-2767633-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093083S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8318405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8318405","articleId":"8089355","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8089356,"authors":[{"name":"Junqiang Ge","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, P.R.

However, there have been few substantive studies on e-commerce systems in real world. In this paper, we investigate the systems of Tmall and JD, the top-two most popular e-commerce websites in China, with a measurement approach. By analyzing traffics from campus network, we present a characterization study that covers several features, including usage patterns and shopping behaviors, of the e-commerce workload; in particular, we characterize the massive flash crowd in the Double-11 Day, which is the biggest online shopping festival in the world. We also reveal Tmall and JD's e-commerce infrastructures, including content delivery networks (CDNs) and clouds, and evaluate their performances under the flash crowd. We find that Tmall's CDN proactively throttles bandwidths for ensuring low but guaranteed throughputs, while JD still follows the best-effort way, leading to poor and unstable performances; both providers do not have sufficient capacities in their private clouds, resulting in extraordinarily long transaction latencies. Based on the insights obtained from measurement, we discuss the design choices of e-commerce CDNs, and investigate the potential benefits brought by incorporating client-side assistances in offloading massive flash crowd of e-commerce workloads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089356/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1 2020","volume":"13","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"20259231","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2020","publicationDate":"1 Nov.-Dec. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8089356/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Understanding E-Commerce Systems under Massive Flash Crowd: Measurement, Analysis, and Implications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61672486, 61379130 and 61672485"},{"fundingName":"New Generation Broadband Mobile Wireless Communication Network","grantNumber":"2017ZX03001019-004"},{"fundingName":"Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1608085MF126"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding E-Commerce Systems under Massive Flash Crowd: Measurement, Analysis, and Implications","sourcePdf":"tsc-tian-2767600-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.195638S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"9286945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9286945","articleId":"8089356","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8089357,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8329291/8089357/luo-2763822-small.gif","p":["Yi Luo (S\u201912) received the B.A.Sc. degree in electronic systems engineering from the University of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, in 2012, and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from The University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2015, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Systems-on-a-Chip Laboratory.

space-time block coding using index shift keying (DSTBC-ISK), which is the first differential space-time modulation (DSTM) scheme that can simultaneously achieve the following three imperative objectives: First, forming a finite-cardinality transmit-signals set; second, retaining a single-stream maximum-likelihood (ML) detection complexity; and third, offering a beneficial transmit diversity gain. In order to make a fair comparison, we also conceive a low-complexity single-stream detector for DSM. Furthermore, in order to improve the performance of finite-cardinality DSTM schemes at higher throughputs, we propose to generalize both differential amplitude shift keying (DASK) and amplitude shift keying (ASK), which subsume the existing two-/four-level-ring star quadratic-amplitude modulation (QAM) solutions as special cases. As a result of using star QAM signaling, the power of the DSTM's signal matrix becomes variable. Against this background, we further develop bespoke ML, minimum mean squared error, and least-square detectors for DSTM using DASK/ASK. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DSTBC-ISK is capable of achieving substantial diversity gains over DSM without eroding its low transceiver complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089362/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2018","volume":"66","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"17468544","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2017","publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8089362/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Single-RF Index Shift Keying Aided Differential Space\u2013Time Block Coding","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/Noo4558/1 and EP/L018659/1"},{"fundingName":"European Research Council's Advanced Fellow"},{"fundingName":"Beam-Me-Up project"},{"fundingName":"Royal Society's Wolfson Research Merit Award"},{"fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI","grantNumber":"17H07036"},{"fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI","grantNumber":"26709028 and 16KK0120"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-RF Index Shift Keying Aided Differential Space\u2013Time Block Coding","sourcePdf":"tsp-hanzo-2768019-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.208757S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8233522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8233522","articleId":"8089362","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8089363,"authors":[{"name":"Olivier Marcelot","affiliation":["Image Sensor Research Team, Institut Sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019A\u00e9ronautique et de l\u2019Espace, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/8103302/8089363/marce-2762433-small.gif","p":["Olivier Marcelot (M\u201912) received the Ph.D. degree from Paul Sabatier University, Toulouse, France, in 2007.","In 2008, he was with Synopsys, Zurich, Switzerland, as a Development Engineer.

The sharing mechanism is activated and controlled by polarizing the AG at a positive OFF voltage, and consequently the dark current is reduced and not compensated.

The preferable characteristic of MESs raises the need for optimizing the configuration of MESs across multiple energy sectors at the planning stage. Based on the energy hub (EH) model, this research presents a two-stage mixed-integer linear programming approach for district level MES planning considering distributed renewable energy integration. The approach models an MES as a directed acyclic graph with multiple layers. The proposed EH configuration planning procedure includes two stages: 1) optimizing what equipment (e.g., energy converters, distributed renewable energy sources and storages) should be invested in for each layer and 2) optimizing the connection relationships between the invested equipment in each two adjacent layers. The proposed approach is able to optimize both the equipment selection and the MES configuration. It can be applied to both expansion planning and initial planning of MESs from scratch. An illustrative example of planning a typical MES is given. A sensitivity analysis is performed to show the impacts of load profiles, energy prices and equipment parameters on the optimal MES configuration. A case study based on the MES in Beijing's new subsidiary administrative center is conducted using the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2017.2767860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2017.2767860","startPage":"1452","endPage":"1464","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8643651/08089369.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8643651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Configuration Planning of Multi-Energy Systems Considering Distributed Renewable Energy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Configuration Planning of Multi-Energy Systems Considering Distributed Renewable Energy","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2019","accessionNumber":"18629521","publicationDate":"March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8089369/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51620105007 and 51677096"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Configuration Planning of Multi-Energy Systems Considering Distributed Renewable Energy","sourcePdf":"tsg-kang-2767860-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133089S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8643651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"8643651","articleId":"8089369","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8089374,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Its goal is to match pedestrians across multiple nonoverlapping network cameras. Despite the recent effort, the performance of pedestrian reidentification needs further improvement. Hence, we propose a novel two-stream multirate recurrent neural network for video-based pedestrian reidentification with two inherent advantages: First, capturing the static spatial and temporal information; Second,Author: Figure II is not cited in the text. Please cite it at the appropriate place. dealing with motion speed variance. Given video sequences of pedestrians, we start with extracting spatial and motion features using two different deep neural networks. Then, we explore the feature correlation which results in a regularized fusion network integrating the two aforementioned networks. Considering that pedestrians, sometimes even the same pedestrian, move in different speeds across different camera views, we extend our approach by feeding the two networks into a multirate recurrent network to exploit the temporal correlations. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world video-based pedestrian reidentification benchmarks: iLIDS-VID and PRID 2011 datasets. The experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed method. Our code will be released upon acceptance.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2017.2767557","startPage":"3179","endPage":"3186","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2017.2767557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8402070","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8402070/08089379.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Stream Multirate Recurrent Neural Network for Video-Based Pedestrian Reidentification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089379/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Two-Stream Multirate Recurrent Neural Network for Video-Based Pedestrian Reidentification","volume":"14","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8089379/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17895245","publicationDate":"July 2018","dateOfInsertion":"03 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China","grantNumber":"2016 J01324 and 2017 J01511"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Fund of Fujian Provincial Education Department","grantNumber":"JA15385"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772322"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Stream Multirate Recurrent Neural Network for Video-Based Pedestrian Reidentification","sourcePdf":"tii-li-2767557-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102786S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8402070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8402070","articleId":"8089379","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8089383,"authors":[{"name":"Youming Xin","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Youming","lastName":"Xin","orcid":"0000-0001-6484-8631","id":"37085536368"},{"name":"Yuxia Li","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Yuxia","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-6069-2630","id":"37422523300"},{"name":"Xia Huang","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Xia","lastName":"Huang","orcid":"0000-0002-4955-8318","id":"37600928300"},{"name":"Zunshui Cheng","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Physics, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Zunshui","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38004168800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-2267"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2275"}],"articleNumber":"8089383","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":679},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Memristors","Artificial neural networks","Delays","Symmetric matrices","Biological neural networks","Linear matrix inequalities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","continuous time systems","delays","Lyapunov methods","memristors","neurocontrollers","synchronisation","time-varying systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inequality technique","master-slave synchronization","uncertain continuous time-varying parameters","NNs","quasisynchronization criteria","chaotic MNNs","chaotic memristive neural networks","Lyapunov function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Memristive neural networks (MNNs)","synchronization","time-delay","uncertainty"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8089383","abstract":"We study the problem of master-slave synchronization of two delayed memristive neural networks (MNNs).

A set of random variables satisfying the Bernoulli distribution is used to describe the phenomenon of the packet loss.

By applying the Lyapunov stability theory and the stochastic analysis method, a sufficient condition for state estimation is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities.

Accompanied with the development of a contactless data transmission technique, the lack of effective secret key establishment between lightweight wearable devices which support contactless data transmission technique becomes a security bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a novel wireless key establishment method by moving or shaking the wearable wireless devices. Instead of received signal strength (RSS) itself, we denote the RSS trajectories of two moving wireless devices as the materials of secret key. Moreover, inspired by channel reciprocity in a channel feature-based key establishment technique, we propose the concept of reciprocity of RSS trajectory that guarantees that even when the RSSs of two devices are the same, the identical RSS trajectories of two devices can successfully generate the secret key. In addition, to effectively utilize the RSS trajectories, we design a novel quantization scheme by considering the entropy and efficiency of key generation.

The proposed library oriented to the NTV region is optimized using the parasitic effects of nanometer process technology and a body-biasing technique. To maximize the energy efficiency, the proposed cell library utilized the minimum width allowed by the process as the base width unit. To enhance the performance, digital cells were developed with various strengths whose sizing method relies on the minimum unit width, reverse short channel effect, and inverse narrow width effect. An asymmetric gate-length scheme is applied to multi-fan-in logic gates to increase the performance. Also, the proposed TAP cell was added, combined with an inverter-based forward body-biasing circuit. Finally, a library with 59 cells was developed and made available for synthesis and automatic layout and the proposed NTV library was then evaluated with ISCAS benchmark logics. The proposed NTV cell library shows more than 10~20% less energy consumption compared with a conventional digital cell library using minimum gate length and monolithic width. EDP is also increased by 10~20% with a simply controlled body-biasing scheme compared with the conventional one.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089397/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","volume":"65","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"17682845","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8089397/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Near-Threshold Voltage Oriented Digital Cell Library for High-Energy Efficiency and Optimized Performance in 65nm CMOS Process","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003662","fundingName":"IT R&D Program of MOTIE/KEIT through Design technology development of ultra-low voltage operating circuit and IP for smart sensor SoC","grantNumber":"10052716"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Near-Threshold Voltage Oriented Digital Cell Library for High-Energy Efficiency and Optimized Performance in 65nm CMOS Process","sourcePdf":"tcsi-kim-2758793-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08226S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8329291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8329291","articleId":"8089397","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8089398,"authors":[{"name":"Dezhi Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8329255/8089398/xu-2767544-small.gif","p":["Dezhi Xu (M\u201915) received the Ph.D. degree in control theory and\n control engineering from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2013.","He joined Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China, as an Associate Professor and a Master Tutor.

The HESS consists of a supercapacitor serving as the main power source and a fuel cell serving as the auxiliary power source. First, a Hammerstein-type neural network is proposed to identify the HESS, which formulates the Hammerstein model with a nonlinear static gain in cascade with a linear dynamic block. It provides the model information for the controller to achieve the adaptive performance. Second, a feedforward neural network based on a back-propagation training algorithm is designed to formulate the proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-type neural network, which is used for the adaptive control of the HESS. Meanwhile, a dynamic antiwindup signal is designed to solve the operational constraint of the HESS. Then, an appropriate power reference signal for the HESS can be generated. Third, the stability and the convergence of the whole system are proved based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, simulation experiments are followed through on a four-area interconnected power system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2767544","startPage":"6625","endPage":"6634","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2767544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8329255","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8329255/08089398.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Adaptive Neural Network Constrained Control for a Multi-Area Interconnected Power System With Hybrid Energy Storage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089398/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Adaptive Neural Network Constrained Control for a Multi-Area Interconnected Power System With Hybrid Energy Storage","volume":"65","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8089398/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17661130","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61503156, 61403161 and 61473250"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2016YFD0400300"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Adaptive Neural Network Constrained Control for a Multi-Area Interconnected Power System With Hybrid Energy Storage","sourcePdf":"tie-xu-2767544-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096459S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8329255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"8329255","articleId":"8089398","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8089400,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Zhu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8291767/8089400/zhu-2767556-small.gif","p":["Qi Zhu (GS'16) was born in Anhui, China, in 1993.

Although some approaches, such as increasing the quality factor and achieving precise impedance matching, can reduce the adverse impacts of the low coupling coefficient and improve the system performance, high leakage magnetic flux between the transmitter and receiver remains a problem. With the increase in transfer distance and the misalignment between the transmitter and receiver, the increasing leakage magnetic flux of nondirectional fields degrades the WPT system performance. This paper proposes an active field orientation method to shape the magnetic flux so as to minimize the leakage flux. The amplitude and phase angle of the magnetizing current are controlled, and a coil structure for minimizing the coupling among the transmitters and generating a three-dimensional magnetic field is proposed. This method realizes three-dimension full-range field orientation with adjustable magnitude and direction of B-field at an arbitrary point, and as a result the B-field is concentrated with reduced leakage magnetic flux. The proposed field orientation shaping technique is verified by theoretical analysis, simulation, and experimental results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic fields","Transmitters","Magnetic flux","Couplings","Receivers","Inductance","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coils","impedance matching","inductive power transmission","machine vector control","magnetic fields","magnetic flux","magnetic leakage","phase control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude","phase angle","magnetizing current","three-dimensional magnetic field","full-range field orientation","B-field","wireless power transfer system","quality factor","transfer distance","nondirectional fields","WPT system performance","active field orientation method","leakage flux","leakage magnetic flux","coupling coefficient","impedance matching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Current amplitude and phase angle control","field orientation shaping","leakage magnetic field","wireless power transfer (WPT)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2767556","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8291767/08089400.pdf","startPage":"4758","endPage":"4770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8291767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2767556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field Orientation Based on Current Amplitude and Phase Angle Control for Wireless Power Transfer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8089400","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Field Orientation Based on Current Amplitude and Phase Angle Control for Wireless Power Transfer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089400/","volume":"65","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8089400/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17578046","dateOfInsertion":"15 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51677195 and 61622311"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council","grantNumber":"201706370068"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field Orientation Based on Current Amplitude and Phase Angle Control for Wireless Power Transfer","sourcePdf":"tie-zhu-2767556-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073346S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8291767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8291767","articleId":"8089400","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8089401,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Lei","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Electromagnetic Environmental Effects and Electro-optical Engineering, PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Lei","orcid":"0000-0003-0448-5239","id":"37086050320"},{"name":"Jianbao Wang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Electromagnetic Environmental Effects and Electro-optical Engineering, PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianbao","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0003-2264-9268","id":"38241249900"},{"name":"Lihua Shi","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Electromagnetic Environmental Effects and Electro-optical Engineering, PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lihua","lastName":"Shi","orcid":"0000-0002-6501-9613","id":"37271159700"},{"name":"Hailin Chen","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Electromagnetic Environmental Effects and Electro-optical Engineering, PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hailin","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0001-9582-7032","id":"37293463900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"8089401","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":450},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"This communication presents a high-efficiency hybrid implicit-explicit finite-difference time-domain (HIE FDTD) algorithm for solving the problem of periodic structures at the oblique incident.

After that, with similar number of arithmetic operations, memory allocation and better computational accuracy, the Courant-Friedrich-Lewy stability condition of the proposed algorithm can be relaxed approximately two times than previous algorithm.

In this paper, we consider a hybrid switching strategy of NOMA and MUD (HSS-NM) by combining these two approaches in two-user and multiuser systems. With NOMA using successive interference cancellation and MUD based on proportional fair scheduling, we find out that one can perform better than the other according to certain channel conditions. From this, HSS-NM is proposed to improve spectral efficiency. Furthermore, we extend HSS-NM to a multiuser scenario with a user selection strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a relatively high sum-rate gain.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Hybrid Transmission Method: Using Nonorthogonal Multiple Access and Multiuser Diversity","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2767573","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8318405/08089404.pdf","startPage":"2276","endPage":"2288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2767573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318405","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8089404","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Hybrid Transmission Method: Using Nonorthogonal Multiple Access and Multiuser Diversity","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8089404/","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17633263","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61231011, 61231013 and 61571025"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Hybrid Transmission Method: Using Nonorthogonal Multiple Access and Multiuser Diversity","sourcePdf":"tvt-bai-2767573-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104834S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8318405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8318405","articleId":"8089404","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8089405,"authors":[{"name":"Jincheng Dai","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jincheng","lastName":"Dai","orcid":"0000-0002-0310-568X","id":"37085852309"},{"name":"Guangjin Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guangjin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086134590"},{"name":"Kai Niu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Niu","orcid":"0000-0002-8076-1867","id":"37284274700"},{"name":"Jiaru Lin","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiaru","lastName":"Lin","id":"37069913600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8089405","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":802},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partially Active Message Passing Receiver for MIMO-SCMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8089405","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Message passing","MIMO","Iterative decoding","Receiving antennas","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","approximation theory","decoding","Gaussian processes","message passing","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","multiuser detection","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partially active message passing receiver","MIMO-SCMA systems","5G wireless system","multiple input multiple output system","sparse code multiple access","joint MIMO and multiuser detection","Gaussian approximation principle","decoding process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO-SCMA","message passing algorithm","partially active","Gaussian approximation"]}],"abstract":"Recently, sparse code multiple access (SCMA) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) are viewed as two key techniques to address the high spectral efficiency and massive connectivity requirements for the 5G wireless system. Even though the sparse structure of each user's codewords has been exploited, the complexity of joint MIMO and multiuser detection (JMMD) in the MIMO-SCMA systems still grows exponentially with the number of antennas and accessed users. In this letter, to tackle this severe problem, based on the Gaussian approximation principle, we propose a partially active message passing receiver for the MIMO-SCMA systems. In this case, a sliding window is introduced to determine which users stay active during each detection and decoding process while others keep silent. By this means, the complexity of JMMD can be efficiently reduced while its performance just suffers a slight loss, which fascinates the practical implementation of MIMO-SCMA systems.","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2017.2767588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2017.2767588","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/8334007/08089405.pdf","startPage":"222","endPage":"225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8334007","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089405/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"Partially Active Message Passing Receiver for MIMO-SCMA Systems","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17683590","htmlLink":"/document/8089405/","dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"BUPT Excellent Ph.D. Students Foundation","grantNumber":"CX2017306"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61671080"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partially Active Message Passing Receiver for MIMO-SCMA Systems","sourcePdf":"lwc-dai-2767588-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061257S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"8334007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8334007","articleId":"8089405","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8089408,"authors":[{"name":"Engin Cemal Meng\u00fc\u00e7","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nigde \u00d6mer Halisdemir University, Nigde, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8125793/8089408/mengu-2768024-small.gif","p":["Engin Cemal Meng\u00fc\u00e7 received the Ph.D. degree in\n electrical and electronics engineering from Nigde \u00d6mer Halisdemir University, Nigde, Turkey, in 2016.

The goal of the design is to minimize the outage probability of specified signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio targets, and to do so at a low computational cost. The proposed design strategy provides an efficient way to handle PAPCs, in addition to a total power constraint, for a variety of precoding techniques, including the offset maximization approach to robust beamforming, and the nominal zero-forcing and maximum ratio transmission approaches. Through observations regarding the structure of the optimality conditions for each of the design formulations, low-complexity iterative algorithms that involve the evaluation of closed-form expressions are developed. In systems with a large number of antennas, the computational cost of some of these algorithms can be reduced to being linear in the number of antennas, without a significant degradation in performance. Simulation results show that the proposed robust designs can provide substantial reductions in the outage probability while satisfying the PAPCs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2768043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8125793","startPage":"515","endPage":"527","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8125793/08089411.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Robust MISO Downlink Precoder Design With Per-Antenna Power Constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8089411/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Robust MISO Downlink Precoder Design With Per-Antenna Power Constraints","publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2018","accessionNumber":"17410790","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"66","issue":"2","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"RGPIN-2015-06631"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Robust MISO Downlink Precoder Design With Per-Antenna Power Constraints","sourcePdf":"tsp-medra-2768043-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.181466S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8125793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8125793","articleId":"8089411","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8089412,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Pinchera","affiliation":["ELEDIA@UniCAS and DIEI, University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8241014/8089412/pinch-2767621-small.gif","p":["Daniele Pinchera (S\u201905\u2013M\u201908\u2013SM\u201914) received the Dr.Eng. degree (summa cum laude) in telecommunication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information and electronic engineering from the University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","He is currently a Researcher with the Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Cassino and Southern Lazio.

Various types of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as distributed energy storage, distributed generators, microgrids, and load aggregators, can bid into the day-ahead distribution-level electricity market. Considering system Volt/VAR control, network reconfiguration, and interactions with the wholesale market, an optimization model is built to clear the day-ahead market, through which the distribution locational marginal pricing (DLMPs) for both active power and reactive power are determined. Through derivations of the Lagrangian function and sensitivity factors, DLMPs are decomposed to five components (i.e., marginal costs for active power, reactive power, congestion, voltage support, and loss), which provide price signals to motivate DERs to contribute to congestion management and voltage support. Finally, case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2767632","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

Because of the unique properties of mechanical data, predetermined features based on prior knowledge are usually used as inputs for fault classification. However, proper selection of features often requires expertise knowledge and becomes more difficult and time consuming when volume of data increases. In this paper, a novel deep learning network (LiftingNet) is proposed to learn features adaptively from raw mechanical data without prior knowledge. Inspired by convolutional neural network and second generation wavelet transform, the LiftingNet is constructed to classify mechanical data even though inputs contain considerable noise and randomness. The LiftingNet consists of split layer, predict layer, update layer, pooling layer, and full-connection layer. Different kernel sizes are allowed in convolutional layers to improve learning ability. As a multilayer neural network, deep features are learned from shallow ones to represent complex structures in raw data. Feasibility and effectiveness of the LiftingNet is validated by two motor bearing datasets. Results show that the proposed method could achieve layerwise feature learning and successfully classify mechanical data even with different rotating speed and under the influence of random noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8291767/08089430.pdf","startPage":"4973","endPage":"4982","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2767540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2767540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8291767","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8089430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LiftingNet: A Novel Deep Learning Network With Layerwise Feature Learning From Noisy Mechanical Data for Fault Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Fault diagnosis","Feature extraction","Neural networks","Convolution","Transforms","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning network","second generation wavelet transform","SGWT","CNN","convolutional neural network","intelligent fault diagnosis","fault classification","noisy mechanical data","layerwise feature learning","LiftingNet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural network (CNN)","deep learning","intelligent fault diagnosis","second generation wavelet transform (SGWT)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089430/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"LiftingNet: A Novel Deep Learning Network With Layerwise Feature Learning From Noisy Mechanical Data for Fault Classification","volume":"65","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8089430/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17595223","dateOfInsertion":"15 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61633001, 51775411 and 51421004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2017YFC0805701"},{"fundingName":"Shaanxi Industrial Science and Technology Project","grantNumber":"2014SZS14-K03"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China","grantNumber":"XJJ2015106"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LiftingNet: A Novel Deep Learning Network With Layerwise Feature Learning From Noisy Mechanical Data for Fault Classification","sourcePdf":"tie-zi-2767540-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094329S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8291767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"8291767","articleId":"8089430","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8089431,"authors":[{"name":"Jiadong Lu","affiliation":["School of Automation, and Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Small and Special Electrical Machine and Drive Technology, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8291767/8089431/lu-2767542-small.gif","p":["Jiadong Lu was born in Pucheng, China, 1990.

The phase currents are independently reconstructed and no additional test voltage pulses are required. First, the principle of the basic phase current reconstruction for IPMSM drive system is analyzed in detail. Then, an independent phase current reconstruction scheme without using null switching states is proposed. The current reconstruction dead zone is divided into six sectors, and each sector is split into three parts with corresponding vector synthesis methods. Meanwhile, the null switching states, V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">000</sub>\n and V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">111</sub>\n, are removed from the proposed scheme. In this case, the zero vector is synthesized by the other available vectors. Finally, the reconstructed threephase currents are utilized for high frequency sine-wave voltage injection-based position estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by experimental results on a 5 kW IPMSM motor prototype, which shows that the reconstructed phase currents track the actual currents accurately under different working conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8291767/08089431.pdf","startPage":"4492","endPage":"4502","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2767542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2767542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8291767","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8089431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Independent Phase Current Reconstruction Strategy for IPMSM Sensorless Control Without Using Null Switching States","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["TV","Switches","Sensorless control","Pulse width modulation","Permanent magnet motors","Estimation","Integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","permanent magnet motors","position control","sensorless machine control","synchronous motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["independent phase current reconstruction strategy","IPMSM sensorless control","null switching states","interior permanent magnet synchronous motor","basic phase current reconstruction","IPMSM drive system","independent phase current reconstruction scheme","current reconstruction dead zone","IPMSM motor prototype","zero vector","high frequency sine-wave voltage injection-based position estimation","power 5.0 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault tolerance","high frequency (HF) voltage injection","interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM)","phase current reconstruction","sensorless control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Independent Phase Current Reconstruction Strategy for IPMSM Sensorless Control Without Using Null Switching States","volume":"65","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8089431/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17578060","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Shaanxi Science Technology Coordination and Innovation Project, China","grantNumber":"2013KTCQ01-20 and 2016KTCQ01-49"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Independent Phase Current Reconstruction Strategy for IPMSM Sensorless Control Without Using Null Switching States","sourcePdf":"tie-lu-2767542-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111106S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8291767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8291767","articleId":"8089431","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8089432,"authors":[{"name":"Mai Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/8359225/8089432/xu-2767784-small.gif","p":["Mai Xu (M'10\u2013SM'16) received the B.S. degree from\n Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2003, the M.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2006, and\n the Ph.D. degree from the Imperial College London, London, U.K., in 2010.

In videoconferencing, almost every frame contains a human face. Therefore, it is important to predict human visual attention on face videos by saliency detection, as saliency may be used as a guide to the region of interest for the content-based applications of face videos. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach for saliency detection in face videos. From the data-driven perspective, we first establish an eye-tracking database that contains fixations of 76 face videos viewed by 40 subjects. Upon the analysis of our database, we find that visual attention is significantly attracted by faces in videos. More important, the attention distribution within face regions varies with regard to mouth movement. Since previous works have investigated that it is efficient to model face saliency in still images using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), the variation of visual attention in videos can be modeled by dynamic GMM (DGMM). Accordingly, we propose adopting the particle filter (PF) in modeling DGMM for saliency detection of face videos, which is called PF-DGMM. Finally, the experimental results show that our PF-DGMM approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in saliency detection of face videos.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2017.2767784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2017.2767784","startPage":"1335","endPage":"1349","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/8359225/08089432.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8359225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saliency Detection in Face Videos: A Data-Driven Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","displayDocTitle":"Saliency Detection in Face Videos: A Data-Driven Approach","publicationDate":"June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2018","volume":"20","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8089432/","accessionNumber":"17766468","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089432/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573037 and 61471022"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004806","fundingName":"Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation","grantNumber":"151061"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saliency Detection in Face Videos: A Data-Driven Approach","sourcePdf":"tmm-xu-2767784-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153707S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"8359225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8359225","articleId":"8089432","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8089437,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqiang Guo","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8291767/8089437/guo-2767548-small.gif","p":["Xiaoqiang Guo (S'16) received the B.S. degree in measurement and\n control technology and instrumentation from Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China, in 2012, and the M.S. degree in\n integrated circuit engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2015, where he is currently working\n toward the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics and solid-state electronics.","His research interests include design and control of switched reluctance motor with emphasis on analysis and\n reduction of vibration and noise of switched reluctance motor."]},"firstName":"Xiaoqiang","lastName":"Guo","orcid":"0000-0001-5323-1425","id":"37086314327"},{"name":"Rui Zhong","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8291767/8089437/zhong-2767548-small.gif","p":["Rui Zhong received the B.S. degree in microelectronics and\n solid-state electronics from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1996, and the M.S. and Ph.D.\n degrees in microelectronics and solid-state electronics from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2000 and 2003,\n respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor in the College of Electronic Science and Engineering, Southeast University.\n His research interests mainly include switched reluctance motor modeling and control, and analysis and optimization of\n motor drive system."]},"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37588741700"},{"name":"Mingshu Zhang","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8291767/8089437/zhang-2767548-small.gif","p":["Mingshu Zhang received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from\n Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 2015.

Only a piecewise first-order linear function is used to calculate the total peak acceleration, which is rather fast. The overall radial vibration is the superposition of natural oscillation of each mode. Before that, several critical parameters need to be calculated or measured in advance, including weight factor, natural frequency and damping ratio of each mode, in order to obtain the respective analytical expression of natural oscillation of each mode. First, the total peak acceleration concerning the multiple of current and its slope is derived analytically from the perspective of abrupt change of radial force. Then, a simple method for calculating weight factors is presented for the distribution of peak acceleration of each mode from the total peak acceleration. Natural frequencies are measured and compared by three methods, including finite-element analysis, hammer impulse test, and dc pulse excitation. The calculation of damping ratio is improved since the traditional damping ratio calculation method cannot be used in a multiple degree-of-freedom system. Finally, both simulation and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2767548","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8291767/08089437.pdf","startPage":"4588","endPage":"4598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2767548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8291767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Computation of Radial Vibration in Switched Reluctance Motors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8089437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089437/","displayDocTitle":"Fast Computation of Radial Vibration in Switched Reluctance Motors","volume":"65","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17545546","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8089437/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51277026 and 61674033"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20161148"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Computation of Radial Vibration in Switched Reluctance Motors","sourcePdf":"tie-sun-2767548-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075966S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8291767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8291767","articleId":"8089437","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8089438,"authors":[{"name":"Zongsheng Zheng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zongsheng","lastName":"Zheng","orcid":"0000-0002-4198-5788","id":"37085529937"},{"name":"Zhigang Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0003-4154-5587","id":"37085823307"},{"name":"Yinxia Dong","affiliation":["Department of Rail Transportation, Guiyang Vocational and Technical College, Guiyang, China"],"firstName":"Yinxia","lastName":"Dong","id":"37086496341"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8089438","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":322},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8089438","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Steady-state","Matrices","Circuits and systems","Performance analysis","Genetic expression","IP networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","affine transforms","least mean squares methods","mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tracking performance","tracking analyses","performance analysis","energy-conservation arguments","steady-state analysis","IPAP algorithm","steady-state excess mean-square error","proportionate-type affine projection algorithms","tracking behavior","proportionate affine projection algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Affine projection (AP) algorithm","proportionate type adaptive-filtering","steady-state analysis","tracking analysis"]}],"abstract":"The performance analysis of the improved proportionate affine projection (IPAP) algorithm is performed in this brief.

We introduce and practically completely evaluate and compare the performance of three different inhomogeneous gradient-index dielectric lenses with the effective parameters circularly and cylindrically distributed. These lenses, despite their planar profile antenna configuration, allow full 2-D beam scanning of high-gain radiation beams. A time-domain spectroscopy system is used to practically evaluate the permittivity profile achieved with the LTCC manufacturing process, obtaining very good results to confirm the viability of fabricating inhomogeneous flat lenses in a mass production technology. Then, the lenses performance is evaluated in terms of radiation pattern parameters, maximum gain, beam scanning, bandwidth performance, efficiencies, and impedance matching in the whole frequency band of interest. Finally, the performance of the three lenses is also experimentally evaluated and compared to a single omni-directional antenna and to a ten-element uniform linear array of omni-directional antennas in real 60 GHz wireless personal area network indoor line-of-sight (LOS) and obstructed-LOS environments, obtaining interesting and promising remarkable results in terms of measured received power and root-mean-square delay spread. At the end of this paper, an innovative switched-beam antenna array concept based on the presented cylindrically distributed effective parameters lens is also introduced and completely evaluated, confirming the potential applicability of the proposed antenna solution for future 5G wireless millimeter-wave communication system.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2017.2767821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8124133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2017.2767821","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8124133/08089440.pdf","startPage":"6453","endPage":"6473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessment of LTCC-Based Dielectric Flat Lens Antennas and Switched-Beam Arrays for Future 5G Millimeter-Wave Communication Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Assessment of LTCC-Based Dielectric Flat Lens Antennas and Switched-Beam Arrays for Future 5G Millimeter-Wave Communication Systems","volume":"65","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8089440/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17394458","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089440/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007136","fundingName":"Spanish Inter-Ministerial Commission on Science and Technology (CICYT)","grantNumber":"TEC2013-47360-C3-1-P, TEC2013-47360-C3-2-P and TEC2016-78028-C3-1-P"},{"fundingName":"FEDER and the Unidad de Excelencia Maria de Maeztu MDM-2016-0600"},{"fundingName":"Agencia Estatal de Investigaci\u00f3n, Spain"},{"fundingName":"\u201cMinisterio de Econom\u00eda\u201d through the FPI fellowship program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessment of LTCC-Based Dielectric Flat Lens Antennas and Switched-Beam Arrays for Future 5G Millimeter-Wave Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tap-imbert-2767821-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.187015S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8124133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8124133","articleId":"8089440","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8089445,"authors":[{"name":"Asmae El Mejdoubi","affiliation":["LUSAC Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 de Caen Normandie, Cherbourg-En-Cotentin, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8260593/8089445/mejdo-2767550-small.gif","p":["Asmae El Mejdoubi (S\u201915\u2013M\u201916) was born in Morocco\n in 1988.

To reduce developers workload, repairing and healing techniques have been extensively investigated as solutions for efficiently repairing and maintaining software in the last few years. In particular, repairing solutions have been able to automatically produce useful fixes for several classes of bugs that might be present in software programs. A range of algorithms, techniques, and heuristics have been integrated, experimented, and studied, producing a heterogeneous and articulated research framework where automatic repair techniques are proliferating.

Many anomaly detection algorithms have been proposed recently. However, constrained by their matrix-based traffic data model, existing algorithms often suffer from low accuracy in anomaly detection. To fully utilize the multi-dimensional information hidden in the traffic data, this paper takes the initiative to investigate the potential and methodologies of performing tensor factorization for more accurate Internet anomaly detection. More specifically, we model the traffic data as a three-way tensor and formulate the anomaly detection problem as a robust tensor recovery problem with the constraints on the rank of the tensor and the cardinality of the anomaly set. These constraints, however, make the problem extremely hard to solve. Rather than resorting to the convex relaxation at the cost of low detection performance, we propose TensorDet to solve the problem directly and efficiently. To improve the anomaly detection accuracy and tensor factorization speed, TensorDet exploits the factorization structure with two novel techniques, sequential tensor truncation and two-phase anomaly detection.

Most systems assume that each training image is annotated by a single label associated to the most significant semantic content of the image. However, this assumption does not fit well with the complexity of RS images, where an image might have multiple land-cover classes (i.e., multilabels). Moreover, annotating images with multilabels is costly and time consuming. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce a semisupervised graph-theoretic method in the framework of multilabel RS image retrieval problems. The proposed method is based on four main steps. The first step segments each image in the archive and extracts the features of each region. The second step constructs an image neighborhood graph and uses a correlated label propagation algorithm to automatically assign a set of labels to each image in the archive by exploiting only a small number of training images annotated with multilabels. The third step associates class labels with image regions by a novel region labeling strategy, whereas the final step retrieves the images similar to a given query image by a subgraph matching strategy. Experiments carried out on an archive of aerial images show the effectiveness of the proposed method when compared with the state-of-the-art RS content-based image retrieval methods.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2017.2760909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2760909","startPage":"1144","endPage":"1158","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8271875/08089668.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8271875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilabel Remote Sensing Image Retrieval Using a Semisupervised Graph-Theoretic Method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Multilabel Remote Sensing Image Retrieval Using a Semisupervised Graph-Theoretic Method","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2018","volume":"56","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8089668/","accessionNumber":"17535499","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089668/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"India-Trento Program for Advanced Research"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilabel Remote Sensing Image Retrieval Using a Semisupervised Graph-Theoretic Method","sourcePdf":"tgrs-demir-2760909-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137321S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8271875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"8271875","articleId":"8089668","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8089675,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Sung An","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8241022/8089675/an-2759191-small.gif","p":["Jae-Sung An (S\u201912) received the B.S. degree in media communications engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2010, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electronics and computer engineering.","His current research interests include high-precision analog integrated circuit design, capacitive touch sensing system with passive and active styli, driving and sensing schemes for the capacitive touch systems, and fingerprint sensing systems."]},"firstName":"Jae-Sung","lastName":"An","orcid":"0000-0001-9727-9826","id":"37085837335"},{"name":"Sang-Hyun Han","affiliation":["Leading UI Co., Ltd., Anyang, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8241022/8089675/han-2759191-small.gif","p":["Sang-Hyun Han was born in Seoul, South Korea, in 1970.

The proposed AFE IC achieves a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by using an external noise spectrum and locating the frequencies of the excitation signals in low-noise regions. In addition, it employs the MFDM to increase the frame rate by simultaneously sending excitation signals having multiple frequencies to the touch screen panel (TSP). The proposed AFE IC extracts the coordinates of the finger as well as the coordinates, pressure, and tilt angle of the active stylus with the force gauge and gyro sensor. The proposed AFE IC and active stylus were fabricated in a 0.13-\u03bcm standard CMOS process. The measurement results show that the proposed AFE IC achieves a frame rate of 3.9 kHz, and SNRs of 61.0 and 50.1 dB when a finger and active stylus are used, respectively. In addition, the pressure and tilt angle of the active stylus are expressed with 6-bit resolution. A capacitive touch system with the proposed AFE IC is demonstrated with a 65-in 104 \u00d7 64 TSP using ten fingers and the active stylus with the pressure and tilt angle.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2017.2759191","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/8241022/08089675.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2017.2759191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8241022","startPage":"187","endPage":"203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3.9-kHz Frame Rate and 61.0-dB SNR Analog Front-End IC With 6-bit Pressure and Tilt Angle Expressions of Active Stylus Using Multiple-Frequency Driving Method for Capacitive Touch Screen Panels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8089675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 3.9-kHz Frame Rate and 61.0-dB SNR Analog Front-End IC With 6-bit Pressure and Tilt Angle Expressions of Active Stylus Using Multiple-Frequency Driving Method for Capacitive Touch Screen Panels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089675/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17515556","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8089675/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003052","fundingName":"Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy and Korea Institute for Advanced of Technology through the Promoting Regional Specialized Industry","grantNumber":"R0004373"},{"fundingName":"\u201cDevelopment of MCU-Based Touch Screen Solution having 2-Way Communication Interface for Large-sized Display above 100-inch\u201d"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3.9-kHz Frame Rate and 61.0-dB SNR Analog Front-End IC With 6-bit Pressure and Tilt Angle Expressions of Active Stylus Using Multiple-Frequency Driving Method for Capacitive Touch Screen Panels","sourcePdf":"jssc-kwon-2759191-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138959S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"8241022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8241022","articleId":"8089675","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":8089704,"authors":[{"name":"Navjeet Bagga","affiliation":["Microelectronics and VLSI Group, IIT Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/8103302/8089704/bagga-2759898-small.gif","p":["Navjeet Bagga is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, IIT Roorkee, Roorkee, India.","His current research interest includes tunnel FETs, their modeling and applications in digital logic design."]},"firstName":"Navjeet","lastName":"Bagga","orcid":"0000-0001-7859-5903","id":"37085388404"},{"name":"Anil Kumar","affiliation":["Microelectronics and VLSI Group, IIT Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/8103302/8089704/kumar-2759898-small.gif","p":["Anil Kumar received the M.Tech. degree from the Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, IIT Roorkee, Roorkee, India, in 2017.","His current research interests include the study of novel structures of tunnel FETs."]},"firstName":"Anil","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086253451"},{"name":"Sudeb Dasgupta","affiliation":["Microelectronics and VLSI Group, IIT Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/8103302/8089704/dasgu-2759898-small.gif","p":["Sudeb Dasgupta (M\u201914) received the Ph.D. degree from IIT Varanasi, Varanasi, India, in 2000.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, IIT Roorkee, Roorkee, India.

During the iterative decoding process, the log likelihood ratios (LLRs) fed to each adaptive CA-SCL decoder are iteratively combined with the extrinsic LLRs from other decoders. The correlation among the sources is exploited to improve the decoding performance.

has been demonstrated in recent years. Due to electromagnetic compatibility, privacy, and security issues, this kind of transmission fits the requirements of many medical applications, body-area networks, and general wireless short-range systems, where the transmission takes place in a single room with the distance up to 10 m. In the literature, different models of airborne ultrasound transmission have been investigated, but not supported by discussion of the channel theoretical capacity. On the other hand, knowledge of this measure is essential in the design of an efficient communication link and allows identifying its potential areas of applications. In this letter, we calculate estimates of the Shannon limit for five different configurations of airborne ultrasound digital communication channels. Our evaluation is based on the numerical results available in the literature. The obtained estimates show that in case of systems with multichannel transmission and higher order modulation schemes, the achieved data rates are closest to theoretical boundaries, but still further work is needed in order to achieve more efficient data transmission in airborne ultrasound communication channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089735/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","volume":"22","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17485348","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8089735/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Channel Capacity of Short-Range Ultrasonic Communications in Air","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Capacity of Short-Range Ultrasonic Communications in Air","sourcePdf":"lcomm-mazurek-2768034-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062047S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8249516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8249516","articleId":"8089735","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8089739,"authors":[{"name":"Rezvan Kianifar","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221039/7807362/8089739/kiani-2736559-small.gif","p":["Rezvan Kianifar received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the K.

Visual assessment is subjective and depends on the experience of the clinician. In this paper, an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based method for automated assessment of squat quality is proposed to provide clinicians with a quantitative measure of SLS performance. A set of three IMUs was used to estimate the joint angles, velocities, and accelerations of the squatting leg. Statistical time domain features were generated from these measurements. The most informative features were used for classifier training. A data set of SLS performed by healthy participants was collected and labeled by three expert clinical raters using two different labeling criteria: \u201cobserved amount of knee valgus\u201dand \u201coverall risk of injury\u201d. The results showed that both flexion at the hip and knee, as well as hip and ankle internal rotation are discriminative features, and that participants with \u201cpoor\u201dsquats bend the hip and knee less than those with better squat performance. Furthermore, improved classification performance is achieved for females by training separate classifiers stratified by gender. Classification results showed excellent accuracy, 95.7 % for classifying squat quality as \u201cpoor\u201dor \u201cgood\u201dand 94.6% for differentiating between high and no risk of injury.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089739/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","volume":"5","accessionNumber":"17381020","pubMedId":"29204327","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2017","publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/8089739/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"externalId":"2100213","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Automated Assessment of Dynamic Knee Valgus and Risk of Knee Injury During the Single Leg Squat","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Automated Assessment of Dynamic Knee Valgus and Risk of Knee Injury During the Single Leg Squat","sourcePdf":"jtehm-kianifar-2736559-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134494S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221039","isNumber":"7807362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221039","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7807362","articleId":"8089739","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8089742,"authors":[{"name":"Jamal Ahmed Hussein","affiliation":["Information Technology Department, University of Human Development, Sulaimaniyah, Iraq"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687307/8227024/8089742/husse-2768061-small.gif","p":["Jamal Ahmed Hussein received the B.Sc. degree (First Class Hons.) in electrical engineering from the Electrical Department, College of Engineering, University of Salahaddin, Erbil, Iraq, in 2001, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Electrical Department, College of Engineering, University of Sulaimani, Sulaimani, Iraq, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, U.K., in 2017.","He is currently a Senior Communication Engineer with the Directorate of Transportation and Communications, Ministry of Transportation and Communications, Kurdistan Regional Government, Sulaimaniyah, Iraq.

More precisely, a decode-and-forward relay protocol for a cognitive cooperative network is considered. In this study, the impact of both the primary transmitter interference and CCI on the secondary system performance are considered. First, an exact expression for the equivalent signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of the secondary system is obtained. Then, the corresponding exact and asymptotic cumulative distribution functions are derived. From this, the exact outage performance for the secondary network is investigated. Furthermore, the equivalent probability density function is obtained and discussed. In addition, approximate expressions for the average error probability and the system ergodic capacity performances are derived. From the results, it can be inferred that the presence of the CCI and primary network interference severely degrades the system performance. Moreover, a higher value of the shape parameter of the desired fading channel gives better performance and diversity gain. In addition, despite the impact of interferences, the secondary network performance gives better results in comparison to the Rayleigh fading channels scenario.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089742/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","accessionNumber":"17541346","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8089742/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Study of a UCRN Over Nakagami- ${m}$ Fading Channels in the Presence of CCI","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/H004637/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000275","fundingName":"Leverhulme Trust","grantNumber":"VP1- 2012-008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Performance Study of a UCRN Over Nakagami- ${m}$ Fading Channels in the Presence of CCI","sourcePdf":"tccn-hussein-2768061-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099158S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"8227024","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8227024","articleId":"8089742","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":8089744,"authors":[{"name":"Kerem Yunus Camsari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Kerem Yunus","lastName":"Camsari","orcid":"0000-0002-6876-8812","id":"37085455160"},{"name":"Sayeef Salahuddin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sayeef","lastName":"Salahuddin","id":"37293958100"},{"name":"Supriyo Datta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Supriyo","lastName":"Datta","id":"37273579600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"8089744","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4055},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic tunneling","Tunneling magnetoresistance","Saturation magnetization","Transistors","Magnetization","Integrated circuit interconnections","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic logic","magnetic tunnelling","random number generation","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SPICE models","invertible gate","transistor circuit","voltage driven p-bit","input terminal","three-terminal tunable RNG","scale correlated networks","invertible Boolean logic","inference","random number generators","magnetic tunnel junctions","embedded MTJ"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Embedded MTJ","invertible logic","MTJ","neuromorphic computing","probabilistic computing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8089744","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/55/8103303/08089744.pdf","startPage":"1767","endPage":"1770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2017.2768321","doi":"10.1109/LED.2017.2768321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103303","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementing p-bits With Embedded MTJ","abstract":"Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) utilizing unstable magnets with low barriers have been shown to be well-suited for the implementation of random number generators (RNGs).

However, this requires a new device, namely, a three-terminal tunable RNG or a p-bit, whose input terminal can be used to pin its output to 0 or 1. In this letter, we show that a voltage driven p-bit can be implemented simply by incorporating existing RNGs into a transistor circuit using experimentally demonstrated 2-terminal MTJs, without requiring a new device.

Yet most existing results of IN are limited to two-hop networks such as the relay-aided cellular network. Little progress has been made so far in the exploration of IN in generic multi-hop (more than two hops) networks. This paper aims to bridge this gap by developing an optimization framework for IN in a generic multi-hop network with the objective of maximizing the end-to-end throughput of multiple coexisting communication sessions. We first derive a mathematical model for IN in a special one-hop network to characterize the capability of IN, and then generalize this model to a multi-hop network. Based on the IN model, we develop a cross-layer optimization framework for a multi-hop network with the objective of fully translating the benefits of IN to the end-to-end throughput of the multi-hop sessions. To evaluate the performance of IN in multi-hop networks, we compare its performance against the case where IN is not employed. Simulation results show that the use of IN can significantly (more than 50%) increase the session throughput and, more notably, the throughput gain of IN increases with the node density and traffic intensity in the network.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2768066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2768066","startPage":"889","endPage":"903","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8291762/08089747.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8291762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Interference Neutralization in Multi-Hop Wireless Networks","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/8291762/8089747-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Interference Neutralization in Multi-Hop Wireless Networks","volume":"66","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","accessionNumber":"17577982","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8089747/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1642873 and 1617634"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N00014-15-1-2926"},{"fundingName":"CNS-1717840"},{"fundingName":"KSEF-148-502-17-400"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Cooperative Interference Neutralization in Multi-Hop Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zeng-2768066-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.280805S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8291762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8291762","articleId":"8089747","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8089748,"authors":[{"name":"Mina Feizi","affiliation":["Antenna and Microwave Research Laboratory, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8241014/8089748/feizi-2768081-small.gif","p":["Mina Feizi (S\u201917) was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1990.

These two antenna elements are able to excite different modes in the ground plane and thus realize the desired diverse radiation patterns and high isolation without any additional decoupling structures. The experimental results show that both antenna elements are ultra-wideband with impedance bandwidths (return losses more than 6 dB for the quarter-loop antenna and more than 10 dB for the circular planar monopole antenna) of 130% (2-9.5 GHz). The isolation is over 20 dB with a peak value of 50 dB. The realized gains are above 1.5 dBi. The total efficiencies are above 70%.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a dynamic trust relationships aware data privacy protection (DTRPP) mechanism for mobile crowd-sensing. In this mechanism, combining key distribution with trust management, the trust value of a public key is evaluated according to both the number of supporter and the trust degree of the public key. The trust value is estimated from the accuracy of the public key provided by the encountering nodes. DTRPP achieves the dynamic management of nodes and estimates the trust degree of the public key. In addition, by classifying traffic data into different types and selecting a proper relay node to forward the data according to data types, it is more effective to use the network resource with the trust degree and centrality of the relays. With extensive evaluations, results show that the proposed mechanism protects the data privacy effectively and has better performance on the average delay, the delivery rate and the loading rate when compared to traditional mechanisms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8430490/08089752.pdf","startPage":"2958","endPage":"2970","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2768073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2768073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8430490","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8089752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Trust Relationships Aware Data Privacy Protection in Mobile Crowd-Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Public key","Data privacy","Sensors","Mobile communication","Relays","Privacy","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","mobile computing","public key cryptography","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trust degree","mobile crowd-sensing","public key","dynamic trust relationships aware data privacy protection mechanism","key distribution","trust management","trust value","traffic data","data types","DTRPP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile crowd-sensing","privacy protection","trust management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Trust Relationships Aware Data Privacy Protection in Mobile Crowd-Sensing","volume":"5","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8089752/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18025501","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371097 and 61771082"},{"fundingName":"Program for Innovation Team Building at Institutions of Higher Education in Chongqing","grantNumber":"CXTDX201601020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Trust Relationships Aware Data Privacy Protection in Mobile Crowd-Sensing","sourcePdf":"jiot-wu-2768073-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0639S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8430490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"8430490","articleId":"8089752","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8089755,"authors":[{"name":"Behdad Heidarpour","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement de G\u00e9nie \u00c9lectrique, \u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure (University of Quebec), Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4275028/8310716/8089755/heida-2768240-small.gif","p":["Behdad Heidarpour was born in Amol, Iran, in 1985.

While this could be perceived as a disadvantage for customers, it helps the cellular wireless providers to reduce the traffic intensity at their base stations and this leads to a better service quality and higher rates for concurrently connected users. Hence, there is a tradeoff between the data volume and the data rates attributed to the users. To avoid the adverse effect of service inaccessibility, the cellular providers should carefully set the size and pricing of their data packages. Toward this end, the providers need a model that, together with proper market information, would allow to set the best prices for volume-based data and estimate the acceptable quantity of subscribers and their average data rate. In this paper, we propose such a model that quantifies the relationship between pricing and various market/system parameters such as data volume size, user budget, data rate, and service blocking probability. In particular, we formulate a set of revenue optimization problems for different spectrum assignment criteria like shared-carrier and dynamic sub-carrier allocation. Finally, several realistic scenarios are investigated in which the optimal network parameters are computed.","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2017.2768240","pdfPath":"/iel7/4275028/8310716/08089755.pdf","startPage":"260","endPage":"274","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2017.2768240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8310716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pricing the Volume-Based Data Services in Cellular Wireless Markets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Pricing the Volume-Based Data Services in Cellular Wireless Markets","volume":"15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2018","accessionNumber":"17616622","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8089755/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pricing the Volume-Based Data Services in Cellular Wireless Markets","sourcePdf":"tnsm-heidarpour-2768240-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120352S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"8310716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8310716","articleId":"8089755","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8089756,"authors":[{"name":"Roy Timo","affiliation":["Ericsson ResearchTorshamnsgatan, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Roy Timo is an Experienced Researcher at Ericsson Research in Stockholm, Sweden.

To fully explore the effect of the user's distortion requirements, we formulate the caching problem using f-separable distortion functions recently introduce by Shkel and Verd\u00fa. The class of f-separable distortion functions includes separable distortion functions as a special case, and our analysis covers both the expected- and excess-distortion settings in detail. We also determine what \u201ccommon information\u201d should be placed in the cache, and what information should be transmitted during the delivery phase.

However, low-complexity receiver design for FTN signaling becomes challenging. In this paper, we develop frequency-domain joint channel estimation and decoding methods for FTN signaling transmitting systems over frequency-selective fading channels. To deal with the colored noise inherent in FTN signaling, we propose to approximate the corresponding autocorrelation matrix by a circulant matrix, the special eigenvalue decomposition of which facilitates an efficient fast Fourier transform operation and decoupling the noise in frequency domain. Through a specific partition of the received symbols, many independent estimates are obtained and combined to further improve the accuracy of the channel estimation and data detection. Moreover, instead of assuming the data symbols to be Gaussian random variables, a generalized approximated message passing-based equalization is developed and embedded in the turbo iterations between the channel estimation and the soft-in soft-out decoder. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the cyclic prefix-based and overlap-based frequency-domain equalization methods. With the proposed algorithms, FTN signaling reaches up to 67% higher transmission rate compared to the Nyquist counterpart without substantially consuming more transmitter energy per bit, and the overall complexities grow logarithmically with the length of the observations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2768063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2768063","startPage":"781","endPage":"795","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8291762/08089757.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8291762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-Domain Joint Channel Estimation and Decoding for Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-Domain Joint Channel Estimation and Decoding for Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling","volume":"66","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","accessionNumber":"17577996","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8089757/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"\u201cNational Science Foundation of China (NSFC)\u201d","grantNumber":"61471037, 61571041 and 61201181"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-Domain Joint Channel Estimation and Decoding for Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wu-2768063-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140592S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8291762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"8291762","articleId":"8089757","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8089761,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Jalili","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California at Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8306523/8089761/jalil-2762658-small.gif","p":["Hossein Jalili (S\u201911\u2013GS\u201913\u2013M\u201917) received the B.Sc. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering, from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

This structure is a continuous distributed coherent array that avoids lossy and parasitic coupling networks. Moreover, it can be scaled simply by extending the size of the structure and replicating the unit cell. The absence of coupling parasitics in addition to the unique characteristics of standing waves allows us to extend the tuning range without using varactors. The 0.34-THz four-element radiator array is designed and fabricated in a 130-nm SiGe BiCMOS process using microstrip transmission lines as the standing-wave mediums and on-chip patch antennas to radiate the desired fourth harmonic of the oscillation. The circuit was measured with no post processing or silicon lens and has 5.9% frequency tuning range (332.5-352.8 GHz) with less than 6-dB output power variation across the band. It consumes 425-mW power from 1.8-V supply and the radiated power is -10.5 dBm at center frequency with -98.2 dBc/Hz phase noise at 10-MHz offset frequency.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/22/8306523/8089761-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089761/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","volume":"66","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"17600031","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8089761/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Standing-Wave Architecture for Scalable and Wideband Millimeter-Wave and Terahertz Coherent Radiator Arrays","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1454732"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Standing-Wave Architecture for Scalable and Wideband Millimeter-Wave and Terahertz Coherent Radiator Arrays","sourcePdf":"tmtt-jalili-2762658-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142947S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8306523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8306523","articleId":"8089761","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8089768,"authors":[{"name":"X.

Multiple carry chains are integrated in a single TDC channel for resolution enhancement. The TDC performance would suffer greatly without temperature compensation due to its sensitivity to the operating temperature. In order to improve the TDC adaptability, we analyzed the temperature-dependent delay variation function, and designed a powerful offset canceler to ensure stable performance of our TDC over a wide temperature range. The offset canceler can effectively correct the delay offset over temperature for the carry chain as well as for the signal transmission path. The TDC channels are tested to be fully functional with the operating temperature continuously varying from -20 \u00b0C to 60 \u00b0C. The averaged TDC bin size is 1.15 ps, and the single-shot precision is 3.5 ps. The duplications of the TDCs in three FPGA chips show good performance reproducibility according to the tests in a temperature chamber.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2017.2768082","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/8167039/08089768.pdf","startPage":"2951","endPage":"2957","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2017.2768082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167039","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8089768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1.15-ps Bin Size and 3.5-ps Single-Shot Precision Time-to-Digital Converter With On-Board Offset Correction in an FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089768/","displayDocTitle":"A 1.15-ps Bin Size and 3.5-ps Single-Shot Precision Time-to-Digital Converter With On-Board Offset Correction in an FPGA","volume":"64","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8089768/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17466543","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"973 Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB921800 and 2016YFB0501603"},{"fundingName":"Strategic Priority Research Program (B) of the CAS","grantNumber":"XDB01030400"},{"fundingName":"Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences of the CAS","grantNumber":"QYZDY-SSW-SLH004 and QYZDB-SSWSLH005"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"WK2030040081"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004739","fundingName":"Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A 1.15-ps Bin Size and 3.5-ps Single-Shot Precision Time-to-Digital Converter With On-Board Offset Correction in an FPGA","sourcePdf":"tns-qin-2768082-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062589S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"8167039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8167039","articleId":"8089768","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8089773,"authors":[{"name":"Choon Ki Ahn","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Choon Ki","lastName":"Ahn","orcid":"0000-0003-0993-9658","id":"37061578700"},{"name":"Shunyi Zhao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Advanced Process Control for Light Industry (Ministry of Education), Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Shunyi","lastName":"Zhao","orcid":"0000-0001-5363-8305","id":"38241138600"},{"name":"Yuriy S.

Gain-cell eDRAM (GC-eDRAM) is an interesting area-efficient alternative to SRAM, but requires refresh cycles and typically a boosted write word-line (WWL). This brief proposes a hybrid GC-eDRAM/SRAM bitcell addressing the leakage power and low voltage robustness issues of SRAM, while avoiding bandwidth-consuming refresh and WWL boost of conventional GC-eDRAM. In the hybrid 8T bitcell, an SRAM keeper latch is connected to the storage node (SN) of a gain cell. The SRAM keepers are power gated most of the time for leakage reduction; the keepers are powered on only during zero bandwidth consuming refresh cycles, after write, and before read, to ensure strong data levels on the SN. Compared to a conventional 6T SRAM bitcell, the hybrid 8T bitcell has a 2T read port and an interruptible keeper for both robust read and write at low voltages. Simulations in 65-nm CMOS show that the hybrid bitcell enables 35% (at 400 mV) to 55% (at 1 V) lower data retention power than an 6T SRAM cell at 25 \u00b0C.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2017.2768102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2017.2768102","startPage":"1362","endPage":"1366","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8118325/08089774.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8118325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid GC-eDRAM/SRAM Bitcell for Robust Low-Power Operation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid GC-eDRAM/SRAM Bitcell for Robust Low-Power Operation","volume":"64","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","accessionNumber":"17390399","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8089774/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid GC-eDRAM/SRAM Bitcell for Robust Low-Power Operation","sourcePdf":"tcsii-giterman-2768102-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083351S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8118325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8118325","articleId":"8089774","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8089812,"authors":[{"name":"E.

A unit cell of the memory consists of a control transistor (FinFET) and a storage transistor (a second FinFET). The later performs as a bipolar RRAM. This unit cell can be integrated in an AND-type memory array. The memory cell has an ON/OFF ratio equal to 200 and 400 for the n-type and p-type FinFET RRAMs, respectively, endurance larger than 400 and 1000 times for n- and p-type devices, respectively, and the retention test for over 1 month under 125\u00b0C temperature environment. To analyze the array performance of the AND-type FinFET RRAM at the circuit level, we have further discussed the issues of the sneak path and disturbance, in which an active-fin isolation of FinFET in an AND-type array has been suggested to minimize the leakage current induced by sneak paths. The results have shown a large window with up to 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n ON/OFF ratio, 30% standby power reduction, and 90% active power reduction with reference to the conventional AND-type array. As a result, the bipolar FinFET RRAM exhibits great potential for the embedded memory applications, in particular it can be extended to 28-nm HKMG and the FinFET platform beyond 14-nm technology node, to fill the Moore's gap between the high-performance logic and the embedded memory.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2017.2763960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2017.2763960","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/8103302/08089812.pdf","startPage":"4910","endPage":"4918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 14-nm FinFET Logic CMOS Process Compatible RRAM Flash With Excellent Immunity to Sneak Path","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2017","displayDocTitle":"A 14-nm FinFET Logic CMOS Process Compatible RRAM Flash With Excellent Immunity to Sneak Path","volume":"64","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8089812/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17390095","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089812/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 105-2221-E009-130-MY3 and MOST 106-2633-E-009-001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 14-nm FinFET Logic CMOS Process Compatible RRAM Flash With Excellent Immunity to Sneak Path","sourcePdf":"ted-chung-2763960-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114665S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"8103302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8103302","articleId":"8089812","onlineDate":"30 October 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8089891,"authors":[{"name":"Wu Haotian","affiliation":["Shcnyang Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Haotian","id":"37086233177"},{"name":"Guo Ruifeng","affiliation":["Shcnyang Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Guo","lastName":"Ruifeng","id":"37541457200"},{"name":"Deng Changyi","affiliation":["Shcnyang Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Deng","lastName":"Changyi","id":"37086237140"},{"name":"Peng Azhen","affiliation":["Shcnyang Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Azhen","id":"37086240570"},{"name":"Zheng Liaomo","affiliation":["Shenyang Golding NC Intelligence tech.

In this paper, a new low power algorithm (LPABOBF) is proposed for the periodic task model of real-time systems. The algorithm uses dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) to calculate the optimal static speed at the offline stage, and updates the processor speed at running time by using the slack time of both high priority tasks and low priority tasks. When the task speed is lower than the critical speed, the balance factor is used to analyze whether the critical speed or traditional DVS strategy is used to schedule tasks.

In response, a robust method for regressing discriminative 3D morphable face models(3DMM) is described to support face recognition and 3D mask printing. Combining the local data sets with the public data sets, improving the exiting 3DMM fitting method and then using a convolutional neural network(CNN) to improve reconstruction effect.

Currently, there are some methods designed to detect DDoS attacks, but the detection rate of them is low. Moreover, DDoS detection is easily misled by flash crowd traffic. In this paper, a new method to detect DDoS attacks based on RDF-SVM algorithm is proposed. By considering the importance of feature selection in DDoS attacks detection, the RDF-SVM algorithm is designed to exploit random forest to compute the feature importance and SVM to rescreen the features, which will prevent from removing features mistakenly. Finally, an optimal feature subset is obtained, which will reach a higher detection rate and recall rate. In this paper, two kinds of datasets are used to train and test. The experimental result shows that the RDF-SVM algorithm can select the optimal feature subset over KDD99 dataset, and can also distinguish between DDoS attacks traffic and normal traffic (Flash Crowd) over the DDoS dataset collected from real environment. Compared with the CART, Neural Network, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, and SVM method, RDF-SVM algorithm has a higher detection rate and recall rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICICTA.2017.43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICTA.2017.43","startPage":"161","endPage":"165","publicationTitle":"2017 10th International Conference on Intelligent Computation Technology and Automation (ICICTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 10th International Conference on Intelligent Computation Technology and Automation (ICICTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8086095/8089882/08089926.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8089882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on DDoS Attacks Detection Based on RDF-SVM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089926/","conferenceDate":"9-10 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Research on DDoS Attacks Detection Based on RDF-SVM","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2017","accessionNumber":"17335416","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8089926/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on DDoS Attacks Detection Based on RDF-SVM","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"1230a161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067623S","chronDate":"9-10 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8086095","isNumber":"8089882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8086095","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8089882","articleId":"8089926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8089943,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Shiya","affiliation":["School of Automation, Foshan University of Science and Technology, Foshan, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Shiya","id":"37086226641"},{"name":"Wang Fei","affiliation":["School of Automation, Foshan University of Science and Technology, Foshan, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Fei","id":"37086124825"},{"name":"Wu Jun","affiliation":["School of Automation, Foshan University of Science and Technology, Foshan, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Jun","id":"37086222485"},{"name":"Zhang Caixia","affiliation":["School of Automation, Foshan University of Science and Technology, Foshan, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Caixia","id":"38297940600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1230-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1231-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8089943","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8089943","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Predictive models","Data models","Mathematical model","Neural networks","Computational modeling","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","public utilities","sensors","sewage treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","principal linear output","waste water index","sewage soft sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feature extract","Networks","Relative error","Soft sensor","Reliability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICICTA.2017.60","pdfPath":"/iel7/8086095/8089882/08089943.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 10th International Conference on Intelligent Computation Technology and Automation (ICICTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 10th International Conference on Intelligent Computation Technology and Automation (ICICTA)","startPage":"237","endPage":"240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8089882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICTA.2017.60","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Delicate Neural Network and Its Application in Sewage Soft Sensor","abstract":"This paper presents a rapidly and lower neural networks to treat those waste water index that is difficult to be measured.

With the rapid growth of the amount of data in the embedded environment, using a traditional embedded processor is hard to satisfy the requirements of big data processing. Sorting is one of the fundamental operation in data processing and is also frequently used for search, filter, feature analysis and so on. It can contribute significantly to the overall execution time in a system. Existing techniques accelerate sorting using multiprocessor or GPUs, but it is impractical for embedded systems. In this paper, we propose a FPGA-based collaborative hardware sorting unit for embedded data processing. The waiting data is transferred from the embedded processor to our hardware sorting unit by the data bus, then a ordered sequence is given form hardware sorting unit and is returned to the embedded processor by data bus. The waiting data is processed in a pure hardware circuit, do not need anything software operation, so the calculating speed depends on the delay time of hardware circuit, which is faster than traditional iterative algorithm by software method. By the collaborative hardware unit, we can greatly reduce the processor load and improve the operation efficiency significantly. In addition, we can define the size of the data bit flexibly, we can also expend the scale of the unit by circuit topology.","doi":"10.1109/ICICTA.2017.65","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICTA.2017.65","publicationTitle":"2017 10th International Conference on Intelligent Computation Technology and Automation (ICICTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 10th International Conference on Intelligent Computation Technology and Automation (ICICTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8086095/8089882/08089948.pdf","startPage":"260","endPage":"264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8089882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Collaborative Hardware Sorting Unit for Embedded Data Processing System","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-10 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17335385","htmlLink":"/document/8089948/","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Collaborative Hardware Sorting Unit for Embedded Data Processing System","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"1230a260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052549S","chronDate":"9-10 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8086095","isNumber":"8089882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8086095","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8089882","articleId":"8089948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8089957,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbin Ruan","affiliation":["College of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, Gansu province, China"],"firstName":"Wenbin","lastName":"Ruan","id":"37086227455"},{"name":"Zhenye Gan","affiliation":["College of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, Gansu province, China"],"firstName":"Zhenye","lastName":"Gan","id":"37085345552"},{"name":"Bin Liu","affiliation":["College of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, Gansu province, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086233212"},{"name":"Yin Guo","affiliation":["College of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, Gansu province, China"],"firstName":"Yin","lastName":"Guo","id":"37089093747"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1230-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1231-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8089957","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech recognition","Data models","Training","Optimization","Feature extraction","Speech"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","speech recognition","speech synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov model","improved Tibetan Lhasa dialect speech recognition method","HMM","sequence modeling","word error rate","WER","DNN","deep Neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tibetan Lhasa dialect","Deep Neural Network","Hidden Markov Models","Speech Recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8089957","abstract":"Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are the dominant technique widely used in English and Chinese speech recognition currently.

So in this paper we utilize the CNN model to build on a neural network for 3 tasks: object recognition, location and pose detection. This model treat pose detection as a classification problem and try to combine recognition, location at the same level. To validate the performance of the multi-task detection model, experiments and analysis of the model performance was carried out by the real-time PCB detection test. In the experiment, we use the PCB dataset comprised of 3 types which contains different poses made by ourselves as train/test samples. The number of object pose categories was divided into 8bins, 12bins and 36bins according to pose detection precision. We analysis the effect of the non-uniform datasets on training process and the final detect results shows that this CNN-based detection model can achieve high accuracy on PCB pose detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17335430","htmlLink":"/document/8089976/","conferenceDate":"9-10 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"CNN-Based Model for Pose Detection of Industrial PCB","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CNN-Based Model for Pose Detection of Industrial PCB","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"1230a390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049119S","chronDate":"9-10 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8086095","isNumber":"8089882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8086095","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8089882","articleId":"8089976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8089984,"authors":[{"name":"Li Yong","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Industrial Internet of Things & Intelligent Instrument Ministry of Education, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Yong","id":"37086216189"},{"name":"Jiang Lu Lu","affiliation":["Industrial IoT Collaborative Innovation Center Chongqing Education Commission, Chongqing, China","Key Laboratory of Industrial Internet of Things & Intelligent Instrument Ministry of Education, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing"],"firstName":"Jiang Lu","lastName":"Lu","id":"37086215875"},{"name":"Yin Qing","affiliation":["Industrial IoT Collaborative Innovation Center Chongqing Education Commission, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yin","lastName":"Qing","id":"37086212906"},{"name":"Zhang Bo","affiliation":["Industrial IoT Collaborative Innovation Center Chongqing Education Commission, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Bo","id":"37086217990"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1230-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1231-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8089984","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8089984","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Robots","Planning","Cognition","Law enforcement","Knowledge engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inference mechanisms","mobile robots","path planning","programming language semantics","semantic networks","semantic Web"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state machine","state semantic network objects","semantic knowledge","automatic robot task planning","SSN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["State semantic network","Semantic object","Task planning","State machine"]}],"abstract":"The generation of robot task planning is a challenging issue in uncertain and dynamic real world. Semantic knowledge can be used to support the task planning of robots as a source of implied knowledge. At present, many literatures elaborate semantic networks, which integrate spatial information and semantic information, and use semantic knowledge to carry out robot task planning. Aiming at the demand of automatic robot task planning, this paper improved the semantic network with the trend of the development of the current semantic network. This paper proposed a state semantic network (SSN) based on state machine and semantic network. The state semantic network is a semantic network composed of semantic objects with current state information, and the current state information of the objects in the SSN is determined by the state machine associated with the semantic network objects. In the case of reasoning based on the state semantic network objects, only when the object being reasoned and its current state satisfy specific conditions, can the reasoned object be iterated as a semantic object associated with the current object that conforms to the particular condition, and achieves further reasoning.","doi":"10.1109/ICICTA.2017.101","publicationTitle":"2017 10th International Conference on Intelligent Computation Technology and Automation (ICICTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 10th International Conference on Intelligent Computation Technology and Automation (ICICTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8086095/8089882/08089984.pdf","startPage":"420","endPage":"424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICTA.2017.101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8089882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robot Task Planning Based on State Semantic Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-10 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8089984/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Robot Task Planning Based on State Semantic Network","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8089984/","accessionNumber":"17335388","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robot Task Planning Based on State Semantic Network","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"1230a420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046615S","chronDate":"9-10 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8086095","isNumber":"8089882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8086095","xplore-issue":"8089882","articleId":"8089984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"}]
