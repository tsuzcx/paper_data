Adaptive networks have various indoor and outdoor applications hence, their implementations with light waves face with different problems. Almost all free space optical (FSO)communication systems must deal with two channel deficiencies namely, optical noise and channel turbulence. Both channel noise and turbulence follow certain distributions that we explain in detail. In this paper, we analyze the effects of these disturbances on the estimation performance of incremental adaptive networks and present the results using various simulations. The results are presented by the means of mean square error values. Also, for Gaussian noise and Gamma-Gamma turbulence models we derived the theoretical mean square deviation (MSD)and excess mean square error (EMSE)values and compared them with the simulation outcomes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770000/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 April 2019","publicationDate":"April 2019","conferenceDate":"27-28 April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8770000/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18850847","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The Implementation of Adaptive Networks with Visible Light Communication Channels Modeled with Gamma-Gamma Turbulence","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Implementation of Adaptive Networks with Visible Light Communication Channels Modeled with Gamma-Gamma Turbulence","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126084S","chronDate":"27-28 April 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8764265","isNumber":"8769996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8764265","xplore-issue":"8769996","articleId":"8770000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8770001,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Torabi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Torabi","id":"37298395800"},{"name":"Nasim Mohammadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Nasim","lastName":"Mohammadi","id":"37086920158"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3767-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3768-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8770001","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Channel capacity","Fading channels","Interference","Relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","channel capacity","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","free-space optical communication","gamma distribution","intensity modulation","Monte Carlo methods","optical modulation","power control","radio networks","radio receivers","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PU receiver side","FSO link","atmospheric turbulence","signal detection","Gamma-Gamma distributions","performance analysis","cumulative distribution function","signal-to-noise-ratio","SU receiver","average channel capacity","capacity analysis","AF relaying","asymmetric RF-FSO system","cognitive radio network","cognitive-radio system","radio-frequency link","free-space-optical communication link","licence spectrum","primary user","unlicensed user","secondary user","underlay spectrum-sharing","power control mechanism","hybrid RF-FSO system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free space optic (FSO)","radio frequency (RF)","hybrid RF-FSO cooperative relaying systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770001","doi":"10.1109/WACOWC.2019.8770001","publicationTitle":"2019 2nd West Asian Colloquium on Optical Wireless Communications (WACOWC)","abstract":"This paper presents a performance analysis for the average channel capacity of an asymmetric two-hop cooperative relaying in cognitive-radio system, in which the first hop is a radio-frequency (RF) link and the second hop is a free-space-optical (FSO) communication link. In the considered cognitive radio, the licence spectrum of a primary user (PU)is shared with an unlicensed user, denoted as secondary user (SU), using underlay spectrum-sharing and power control mechanism to keep the interference at the PU receiver side, always below a given threshold. For the FSO link, some practical issues such as pointing errors, and atmospheric turbulence are taken into considerations, where the IM/DD scheme is used for signal detection. It is also assumed that RF and FSO links follow the Rayleigh and the Gamma-Gamma distributions, respectively. To perform a performance analysis, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the received signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) at the SU receiver is presented. Using the CDF expression, a closed-form expression is derived for the average channel capacity of the considered hybrid RF-FSO system. Finally, the numerical results as well as Monte-Carlo simulation results, and discussions are presented.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WACOWC.2019.8770001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8769996","startPage":"162","endPage":"166","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 2nd West Asian Colloquium on Optical Wireless Communications (WACOWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8764265/8769996/08770001.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Analysis of an AF Relaying Asymmetric RF-FSO System in a Cognitive Radio Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8770001/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Analysis of an AF Relaying Asymmetric RF-FSO System in a Cognitive Radio Network","conferenceDate":"27-28 April 2019","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18865011","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Analysis of an AF Relaying Asymmetric RF-FSO System in a Cognitive Radio Network","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104334S","chronDate":"27-28 April 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8764265","isNumber":"8769996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8764265","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8769996","articleId":"8770001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8770003,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Ataee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Ataee","id":"38315853900"},{"name":"Seyed Mohammad Sajad Sadough","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Mohammad","lastName":"Sajad Sadough","id":"37085426960"},{"name":"Zabih Ghassemlooy","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University, Newcastle, England"],"firstName":"Zabih","lastName":"Ghassemlooy","id":"37267374400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3767-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3768-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8770003","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"abstract":"In visible light communications (VLC) the main bottleneck is the limited bandwidth of the light emitting diodes, which limits the maximum transmission data rates.

This paper explores the use of deep learning in a flood monitoring application in the context of an EC-funded project, Smart Cities and Open Data REuse (SCORE). IoT sensors for detecting blocked gullies and drainages are notoriously hard to build, hence we propose a novel technique to utilise deep learning for building an IoT-enabled smart camera to address this need. In our work, we apply deep leaning to classify drain blockage images to develop an effective image classification model for different severity of blockages. Using this model, an image can be analysed and classified in number of classes depending upon the context of the image. In building such model, we explored the use of filtering in terms of segmentation as one of the approaches to increase the accuracy of classification by concentrating only into the area of interest within the image. Segmentation is applied in data pre-processing stage in our application before the training. We used crowdsourced publicly available images to train and test our model. Our model with segmentation showed an improvement in the classification accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770019/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 June 2019","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 June 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8770019/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18852082","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using Deep Learning for IoT-enabled Camera: A Use Case of Flood Monitoring","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Deep Learning for IoT-enabled Camera: A Use Case of Flood Monitoring","confLoc":"Leeds, UK","sourcePdf":"235-240.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057983S","chronDate":"5-7 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765677","isNumber":"8770005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765677","xplore-issue":"8770005","articleId":"8770019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8770038,"authors":[{"name":"Fash Safdari","affiliation":["Leeds Beckett University, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Fash","lastName":"Safdari","id":"37086920099"},{"name":"Anatoliy Gorbenko","affiliation":["National Aerospace University, Kharkiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Anatoliy","lastName":"Gorbenko","id":"37586469200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1733-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1734-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8770038","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Wireless networks","Wireless fidelity","Wireless sensor networks","Benchmark testing","Portable computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network performance evaluation","telecommunication standards","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data transfer","contention-based DCF","contention-based distributed coordination function","WLAN","mixed data rate IEEE 802.11ac wireless networks","wireless standard","performance degradation","airtime consumption unfairness","mixed-data rate Wi-Fi networks","performance anomaly","throughput unfairness","wireless nodes","network load","wireless medium","IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE802.11ac","wireless networks","Wi-Fi","DCF","CSMA/CA","mixed data rate","airtime consumption unfairness","performance anomaly","throughput","benchmarking"]}],"abstract":"IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLANs) are shared networks, which use contention-based distributed coordination function (DCF) to share access to wireless medium. The performance of DCF mechanism depends on the network load, number of wireless nodes and their data rates. The throughput unfairness also known as performance anomaly is inherent in the very nature of mixed-data rate Wi-Fi networks. This unfairness exhibits itself through the fact that slow clients consume more airtime to transfer a given amount of data, leaving less airtime for fast clients. In this paper, we evaluate the performance anomaly of mixed rate wireless networks and present the results of practical experiments benchmarking throughput of a mixed rate 802.11ac wireless network. These results clearly show that even the most recent wireless standard still suffers from the airtime consumption unfairness. At the end of the paper we analyse related works offering possible solutions and discuss our approach to evade performance degradation in mixed data rate Wi-Fi environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Evaluation of Performance Anomaly in Mixed Data Rate IEEE802.11ac Wireless Networks","publicationTitle":"2019 10th International Conference on Dependable Systems, Services and Technologies (DESSERT)","doi":"10.1109/DESSERT.2019.8770038","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 10th International Conference on Dependable Systems, Services and Technologies (DESSERT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765677/8770005/08770038.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DESSERT.2019.8770038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8770005","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770038","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770038/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 June 2019","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Evaluation of Performance Anomaly in Mixed Data Rate IEEE802.11ac Wireless Networks","conferenceDate":"5-7 June 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8770038/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18865256","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Evaluation of Performance Anomaly in Mixed Data Rate IEEE802.11ac Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Leeds, UK","sourcePdf":"082-087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045975S","chronDate":"5-7 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765677","isNumber":"8770005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765677","xplore-issue":"8770005","articleId":"8770038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8770039,"authors":[{"name":"Aleksandr Serkov","affiliation":["dept.

In addition, it will protect the channel from being intercepted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 June 2019","conferenceDate":"5-7 June 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8770039/","accessionNumber":"18852085","displayDocTitle":"Ultra Wideband Signals in Control Systems of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra Wideband Signals in Control Systems of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","confLoc":"Leeds, UK","sourcePdf":"025-028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047672S","chronDate":"5-7 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765677","isNumber":"8770005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765677","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8770005","articleId":"8770039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":8770055,"authors":[{"name":"Kostiantyn Zashcholkin","affiliation":["Odessa National Polytechnic University, Odessa, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Kostiantyn","lastName":"Zashcholkin","id":"37086366776"},{"name":"Oleksandr Drozd","affiliation":["Odessa National Polytechnic University, Odessa, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Oleksandr","lastName":"Drozd","id":"37085686164"},{"name":"Olena Ivanova","affiliation":["Odessa National Polytechnic University, Odessa, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Olena","lastName":"Ivanova","id":"37086253013"},{"name":"Ruslan Shaporin","affiliation":["Odessa National Polytechnic University, Odessa, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Ruslan","lastName":"Shaporin","id":"37086919371"},{"name":"Olga Veselska","affiliation":["University of Bielsko-Bia\u0142a, Bielsko-Bia\u0142a, Poland"],"firstName":"Olga","lastName":"Veselska","id":"37086594547"},{"name":"Hanna Stepova","affiliation":["Odessa National Polytechnic University, Odessa, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Hanna","lastName":"Stepova","id":"37086922771"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1733-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1734-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8770055","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedding the Digital Watermarks into FPGA-Projects Containing the Adaptive Logic Modules","abstract":"The given paper deals with the problem of embedding the digital watermarks into program code of the FPGA chips. A digital watermark gives the possibility to place the extra information hidden from an outside surveillance in the program code FPGA.

The matter is that the existing methods of the digital watermark embedding are focused on FPGA, in which basic logic elements contain only a programmable calculating unit LUT and programmable flip-flop. The adaptation of method of the digital watermark embedding to FPGA chips, which have dedicated hard full adders in the composition of basic logic elements, is offered.

Most of the existing multichannel EEG CS methods ignore the noise or only consider the Gaussian noise. However, there are also some other types of noise, such as heavy-tailed impulsive noise. In this paper, to overcome the above mentioned problems, we propose a novel multichannel EEG CS method based on sparse and low rank representation in the presence of mixed noise (SLRMN), which can take both Gaussian noise and impulsive noise into consideration. Moreover, we develop the alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the proposed SLRMN.

IESSD is capable of performing DNN operations inside an SSD, avoiding frequent data movements between application servers and data storage. This boosts up analytics performance of DNN applications. Moreover, by placing accelerators near data within an SSD, IESSD delivers scalable analytics performance which improves with the amount of data to analyze. To evaluate its effectiveness, we implement an FPGA-based proof-of-concept prototype of IESSD and carry out a case study with an image tagging (classification) application.

A drawback of cuckoo filters is that the insertion process is complex and requires a large number of memory accesses when the filter operates at high occupancy. Therefore, insertion complexity may limit the applicability of cuckoo filters in many networking applications that require fast updates of the filter contents. In this letter, the cuckoo filter is extended to integrate a Bloom filter that is used to improve the performance of insertions. The proposed CFBF does not require additional memory accesses for lookup operations and preserves the support for deletion of the original cuckoo filter. The CFBF targets hardware implementations where the Bloom filter can be checked with negligible cost and where the memory width can also be adjusted to the bucket size. The evaluation results show that it can be used to reduce worst case insertion time by a factor of ten and achieve an average insertion time similar to that of a lookup. The CFBF can support bursts of hundreds of insertions for large filters and moderate false positive rates. Therefore, it can enable the use of hardware implemented cuckoo filters in applications that need to support bursts of insertions or to provide a low worst case insertion time.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2019.2930508","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8863555/08770062.pdf","startPage":"1857","endPage":"1861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8863555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2019.2930508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CFBF: Reducing the Insertion Time of Cuckoo Filters With an Integrated Bloom Filter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770062","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","displayDocTitle":"CFBF: Reducing the Insertion Time of Cuckoo Filters With an Integrated Bloom Filter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770062/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19090806","htmlLink":"/document/8770062/","volume":"23","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004837","fundingName":"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci\u00f3n","grantNumber":"TEC2016-80339-R"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008433","fundingName":"Consejer\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n, Juventud y Deporte, Comunidad de Madrid","grantNumber":"P2018/TCS-4496"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission","grantNumber":"#762057 and #780326"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CFBF: Reducing the Insertion Time of Cuckoo Filters With an Integrated Bloom Filter","sourcePdf":"lcomm-reviriego-2930508-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058682S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8863555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8863555","articleId":"8770062","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770063,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Tao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Acoustics, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Tao","orcid":"0000-0002-1195-9503","id":"37399182100"},{"name":"Le Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Le","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0001-7945-6323","id":"37085765121"},{"name":"Xiao Han","affiliation":["Acoustic Science and Technology Laboratory, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Han","orcid":"0000-0003-3915-8043","id":"37086459330"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8770063","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":348},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770063","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Correlation","Acoustics","Signal to noise ratio","Long Term Evolution","Frequency estimation","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","frequency estimation","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation accuracy","enhanced carrier frequency offset estimation","received Zadoff-Chu sequence","absolute value ratio-based approach","sign flip problem","signal-to-noise ratios","enhanced CFO estimator","AVR-based technique","correlation outputs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset (CFO)","Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB)","sign filp","Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence"]}],"abstract":"The carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation through correlating a received Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence with a locally generated one is considered.

As OOK has a non-symmetric optimal input distribution, shaping approaches that are based on the concatenation of a distribution matcher followed by systematic encoding do not result in optimal signaling. Instead, these approaches represent a time-sharing scheme, where only a fraction of the codeword symbols is shaped. The proposed scheme uses a polar code for joint distribution matching and forward error correction which enables asymptotically optimal signaling. Numerical simulations show a gain of 1.8 dB compared to uniform transmission at a spectral efficiency of 0.25 bits/channel use for a blocklength of 65 536 bits.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2019.2930511","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8894905/08770064.pdf","startPage":"1922","endPage":"1926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2019.2930511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8894905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shaped On\u2013Off Keying Using Polar Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Shaped On\u2013Off Keying Using Polar Codes","volume":"23","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2019","accessionNumber":"19119887","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8770064/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770064/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shaped On\u2013Off Keying Using Polar Codes","sourcePdf":"lcomm-wiegart-2930511-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072334S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8894905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"8894905","articleId":"8770064","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770065,"authors":[{"name":"Sheler Maktoobi","affiliation":["FEMTO-ST/Optics Department, UMR CNRS 6174, Universit\u00e9.

The system is based on a grid of UHF-RFID tags deployed on the floor underneath the gate equipped with a single reader antenna. When a transpallet crosses the gate, it shadows the tags of the deployed grid differently, according to the specific direction, namely incoming or outgoing. Such distinguishable signature is employed as input of a recurrent neural network. In particular, the number of readings for each tag is aggregated within short time windows, and a sequence of binary read/missed tag data over the time is extracted. Such temporal sequences are used to train a long short-term memory neural network.

Among such future memories, a multi-level cell (MLC) spin-transfer magnetic torque random access memory (STT-MRAM) attracts considerable attention as an alternative to static or dynamic random access memories. An MCL STT-MRAM has the advantages of capacity and non-volatility, but the disadvantages of performance, power consumption, and endurance resulting from complicated resistance state transition and detection processes. In particular, such issues are exacerbated in the latest smart image applications employing block-based processing algorithms. In this paper, we propose a memory subsystem that mitigates the MLC STT-MRAM disadvantages in smart image applications. Our main idea is threefold: MLC-aware image buffer composing, block-aware pixel-to-memory mapping, and prediction-aware image-to-buffer allocating techniques that all make multi-step resistance state transition and detection processes less required. Experimental results show that the proposed memory subsystem achieves 24.5% shorter application execution time, and 96.4% lower memory power consumption than the conventional memory subsystems for industrial smart image applications. In addition, our memory subsystem increases the lifetime of MLC STT-MRAMs via 93.8% fewer multi-step resistance state transition processes.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2019.2930342","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/9006961/08770092.pdf","startPage":"717","endPage":"729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9006961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2019.2930342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MLC STT-MRAM-Aware Memory Subsystem for Smart Image Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","displayDocTitle":"MLC STT-MRAM-Aware Memory Subsystem for Smart Image Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770092/","publicationDate":"March 2020","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2020","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19392027","htmlLink":"/document/8770092/","volume":"22","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010449","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2017R1D1A1B03036353"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MLC STT-MRAM-Aware Memory Subsystem for Smart Image Applications","sourcePdf":"tmm-jang-2930342-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098289S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"9006961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","xplore-issue":"9006961","articleId":"8770092","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770093,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Tian","affiliation":["University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8937050/8770093/tian-2929558-small.gif","p":["Hao Tian (S\u201912) received the B.Sc. and the M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

It has a competitive number of devices, showing the potential to build low-cost 7L converters. However, to ensure the wide frequency range operation and power quality of MV drives, its dc-link capacitors and floating capacitors must be controlled properly with balanced voltages. In this paper, an active voltage balancing method is proposed for the 7L-HC converter. This method can effectively balance all the capacitor voltages under a wide frequency range.

Compared to capacitive, piezoelectric, and piezoresistive sensors, inductive sensors are less susceptible to capacitance fluctuation in the environment, and they can convert loading pressure into inductance changes for wireless detection as resonance frequency shifts. However, inductive sensors normally require the use of ferromagnetic materials for frequency tuning; their frequency responses are harder to detect over larger distance separations. Without using ferromagnetic materials, we will utilize two coaxially coupled resonators whose mutual inductance (and thus resonance frequency) is modulated by the thickness of an elastic substrate that can deform under pressure loading. By modifying one of the coupled resonators into a parametric resonator that contains nonlinear capacitors and an extra conductor across its virtual grounds, the sensor can utilize wireless pumping power to enlarge backscattered signals whose peak response frequency is linearly correlated with the loading pressure. This linear relation is observable beyond the near-field region, even though the distance separation between the sensor and the measurement loop is ten-fold the sensor's circuit dimension. This novel concept of wirelessly powered signal regeneration will improve the remote detectability and operation flexibility of various physiological sensors.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8891924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2019.2930651","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/8891924/08770100.pdf","startPage":"1011","endPage":"1020","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2019.2930651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wirelessly Powered Signal Regeneration to Improve the Remote Detectability of an Inductive Pressure Sensor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Wirelessly Powered Signal Regeneration to Improve the Remote Detectability of an Inductive Pressure Sensor","volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8770100/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","accessionNumber":"19183951","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2019","pubMedId":"31352353","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770100/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health","grantNumber":"R00EB016753"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wirelessly Powered Signal Regeneration to Improve the Remote Detectability of an Inductive Pressure Sensor","sourcePdf":"tbcas-qian-2930651-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161339S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"8891924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8891924","articleId":"8770100","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8770103,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud Sami","affiliation":["University of Mississippi, Oxford, USA"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Sami","orcid":"0000-0002-3474-1371","id":"37088235365"},{"name":"John N.

By exploiting the sparse scattering nature of mmWave channels, the beam alignment problem is formulated as a sparse encoding and phaseless decoding problem. More specifically, the problem of interest involves finding a sparse sensing matrix and an efficient recovery algorithm to recover the support and magnitude of a sparse signal from compressive phaseless measurements. A sparse bipartite graph code algorithm is developed for sparse encoding and phaseless decoding. Our theoretical analysis shows that, in the noiseless case, our proposed algorithm can perfectly recover the support and magnitude of the sparse signal with a probability exceeding a pre-specified value from (9(K\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) measurements, where K is the number of nonzero entries of the sparse signal. The proposed algorithm has a simple decoding procedure which is computationally efficient and noise robust. Simulation results show that our proposed method renders reliable beam alignment even in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime and presents a clear performance advantage over existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.1, 1 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"67","issue":"17","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept.1, 2019","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2019","accessionNumber":"18884516","htmlLink":"/document/8770109/","displayDocTitle":"Fast Beam Alignment for Millimeter Wave Communications: A Sparse Encoding and Phaseless Decoding Approach","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61829103 and 61871091"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Beam Alignment for Millimeter Wave Communications: A Sparse Encoding and Phaseless Decoding Approach","sourcePdf":"tsp-fang-2929460-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127572S","chronDate":"Sept.1, 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8789628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8789628","articleId":"8770109","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8770110,"authors":[{"name":"Rakesh R","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8937050/8770110/rakes-2930280-small.gif","p":["Rakesh R (S\u201918) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the College of Engineering, Trivandrum, India, in 2014, and the M.Tech. degree in electronic systems engineering from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, in 2017.

The SVS eliminates the presence of harmonics up to 25th order from motor phase voltage throughout the entire modulation range, providing a torque profile devoid of lower order pulsations. Linear modulation is extended till 99.63% of base speed without exceeding the motor phase voltage rating. Topology consists of a dc-link fed primary inverter and two equal low voltage modular capacitor fed secondary inverters. Here the harmonics generated by the primary inverter is canceled by the secondary inverter which acts as a switched capacitive filter. Detailed description of the SVS generation and timing calculations are provided in this paper. Effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated using experimental results, inverter loss calculations, and harmonic analysis.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8937050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2019.2930280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8937050/08770110.pdf","startPage":"2402","endPage":"2410","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2019.2930280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Switched Capacitive Filter-Based Harmonic Elimination Technique by Generating a 30-Sided Voltage Space Vector Structure for IM Drive","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","displayDocTitle":"A Switched Capacitive Filter-Based Harmonic Elimination Technique by Generating a 30-Sided Voltage Space Vector Structure for IM Drive","volume":"35","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8770110/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2020","accessionNumber":"19404759","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770110/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Switched Capacitive Filter-Based Harmonic Elimination Technique by Generating a 30-Sided Voltage Space Vector Structure for IM Drive","sourcePdf":"tpel-gopakumar-2930280-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.181679S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8937050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8937050","articleId":"8770110","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8770117,"authors":[{"name":"Akram Al-Hourani","affiliation":["School of Engineering, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8871140/8770117/alhou-2930509-small.gif","p":["Akram Al-Hourani (M\u201910\u2013SM\u201916) received the Ph.D. degree from RMIT University in 2016.

We model the frequency reuse distance using tools from stochastic geometry, namely, we utilize the Mat\u00e9rn hard-core (MHC) point process to capture the effect of interference protection zones created around base stations. To model the overall cellular network, we introduce a new point process composed of N superimposed MHC processes, where each individual MHC process corresponds to a co-channel base station group; this new point process is called the union-MHC (UMHC) process. We further investigate the resulting performance of the UMHC process and present the link success probability in integral form. The success probability can be evaluated for an arbitrary fading model and an arbitrary number of orthogonal resource groups. We test the newly proposed model against the practical data sets from a network operator and observe a good match of the results.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2930509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2930509","startPage":"7277","endPage":"7287","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8871140/08770117.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8871140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Next-Generation Cellular Networks Guarded With Frequency Reuse Distance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Next-Generation Cellular Networks Guarded With Frequency Reuse Distance","volume":"67","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19115053","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8770117/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF 1525904"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Next-Generation Cellular Networks Guarded With Frequency Reuse Distance","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hourani-2930509-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.208299S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8871140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8871140","articleId":"8770117","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770118,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Lei","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Artificial Intelligence, Shaanxi University of Science and Technology, Xi\u2019an, China","School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/9184168/8770118/lei-2930030-small.gif","p":["Tao Lei (M\u201917) received the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from the Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2011.","From 2012 to 2014, he was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China.

Although density peak clustering is able to find the number of clusters, it suffers from memory overflow when it is used for image segmentation because a moderate-size image usually includes a large number of pixels leading to a huge similarity matrix. To address this issue, here we proposed an automatic fuzzy clustering framework (AFCF) for image segmentation. The proposed framework has threefold contributions. First, the idea of superpixel is used for the density peak (DP) algorithm, which efficiently reduces the size of the similarity matrix and thus improves the computational efficiency of the DP algorithm. Second, we employ a density balance algorithm to obtain a robust decision-graph that helps the DP algorithm achieve fully automatic clustering. Finally, a fuzzy c-means clustering based on prior entropy is used in the framework to improve image segmentation results. Because the spatial neighboring information of both the pixels and membership are considered, the final segmentation result is improved effectively. Experiments show that the proposed framework not only achieves automatic image segmentation, but also provides better segmentation results than state-of-the-art algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2019.2930030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2019.2930030","startPage":"2078","endPage":"2092","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/9184168/08770118.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9184168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Fuzzy Clustering Framework for Image Segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Fuzzy Clustering Framework for Image Segmentation","volume":"28","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2020","accessionNumber":"20014000","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8770118/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871259, 61811530325, 61461025, 61871260, 61672333 and 61873155"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016M602856"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Automatic Fuzzy Clustering Framework for Image Segmentation","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-lei-2930030-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.31859S","chronDate":"Sept.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"9184168","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"9184168","articleId":"8770118","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770121,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroshi Kikusato","affiliation":["Department of Advanced Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan","Fukushima Renewable Energy Institute, National Institute of Advanced Science and Technology (FREA), Fukushima, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/9121590/8770121/kikus-2926998-small.gif","p":["Hiroshi Kikusato (M\u201914) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, in 2018.

The proposed scheme coordinates an amount of self-consumption of PV output by shifting the charging period of customers' EVs, and it reduces PV curtailment caused by voltage rise in low-voltage distribution systems (LVDSs). The auction mechanism is introduced in order to assure both the equity of benefit in each customer and the autonomy that enables customers to voluntarily participate in the EV charging management scheme. The authors perform numerical simulations based on a Japanese distribution system model and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

The modeling methodology is based on representing the current paths in the power distribution network (PDN) with appropriate circuits based on cavity model and plane-pair partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC). The PDN input impedance looking from on-chip sources can be computed. A commercial simulation tool is used to corroborate the modeling approach where the system consists of a commercial integrated circuits, a complex organic package and a very high-layer-count printed circuit board. Two types of circuit models are proposed from the methodology with physical correspondence maintained in the circuit elements. The circuits can be used to analyze the geometry impact on the PDN impedance and explore design improvements. Voltage ripple simulations are conducted with the circuit models. The simulated results correlated with measurements. The modeling methodology helps to understand the impact of the fundamental physics of the different parts of the PDN system and the impact of changes in the PI designs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel7/15/9166801/08770129.pdf","startPage":"1266","endPage":"1277","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2019.2927742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2019.2927742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9166801","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physics-Based Circuit Modeling Methodology for System Power Integrity Analysis and Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Impedance","Geometry","Inductance","Tools","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equivalent circuits","geometry","printed circuit design","printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit models","circuit elements","PDN system","physics-based circuit modeling methodology","system-level power integrity analysis","power distribution network","cavity model","commercial integrated circuits","high-layer-count printed circuit board"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cavity model","input impedance","power distribution network (PDN) design","plane pair partial element equivalent circuit (PPP)","power integrity (PI)","system PDN","voltage ripple"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770129/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Physics-Based Circuit Modeling Methodology for System Power Integrity Analysis and Design","volume":"62","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8770129/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2020","accessionNumber":"19956240","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IIP-1440110"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physics-Based Circuit Modeling Methodology for System Power Integrity Analysis and Design","sourcePdf":"temc-pt1-zhao-2927742-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090886S","chronDate":"Aug.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"9166801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"9166801","articleId":"8770129","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8770132,"authors":[{"name":"Yanyan Ye","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Image Processing and Intelligent Control Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of China, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/9026988/8770132/ye-2930307-small.gif","p":["Yanyan Ye received the B.S. degree in automatic control and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2014 and 2019, respectively.","Her current research interests include multiagent system and fractional-order system."]},"firstName":"Yanyan","lastName":"Ye","orcid":"0000-0002-3153-692X","id":"37086914457"},{"name":"Housheng Su","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Image Processing and Intelligent Control Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of China, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/9026988/8770132/su-2930307-small.gif","p":["Housheng Su received the B.S. degree in automatic control and the M.S. degree in control theory and control engineering from the Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2008.","Since 2014, he has been a Full Professor of Control Theory and Control Engineering with the School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.

First, an intermittent sampled-data control protocol with input time delay is proposed. By virtue of Laplace transform and stability theory, some necessary and sufficient conditions depending on the order, input time delay, sampling period, communication width, coupling strengths, and network structure are presented for the delayed FOMASs to reach consensus. Moreover, due to the relationship about the input time delay, communication width, and sampling period, four cases are carefully discussed to find that the sampling period has bounds for a given network with known input time delay and communication width to obtain consensus.

After collecting all measurements at receivers, we can determine the target location. The aim of this paper is to provide a unified factor graph-based framework for passive localization in wireless sensor networks based on TOA measurements. Relying on the linearization of range measurements, we construct a Forney-style factor graph model and conceive the corresponding Gaussian message passing algorithm to obtain the target location. It is shown that the factor graph can be readily modified for handling challenging scenarios such as uncertain receiver positions and link failures. Moreover, a distributed localization method based on consensus-aided operation is proposed for a large-scale resource constrained network operating without a fusion center. Furthermore, we derive the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB) to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Our simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed unified approach and of its distributed implementation.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2930517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8871140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2930517","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8871140/08770141.pdf","startPage":"6952","endPage":"6965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TOA-Based Passive Localization Constructed Over Factor Graphs: A Unified Framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"TOA-Based Passive Localization Constructed Over Factor Graphs: A Unified Framework","volume":"67","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8770141/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","accessionNumber":"19115073","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770141/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471037 and 61571041"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003181","fundingName":"Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of the People's Republic of China","grantNumber":"201445"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/Noo4558/1 and EP/PO34284/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TOA-Based Passive Localization Constructed Over Factor Graphs: A Unified Framework","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hanzo-2930517-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.23732S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8871140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8871140","articleId":"8770141","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770145,"authors":[{"name":"Lucana Santos","affiliation":["University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/9063575/8770145/santo-2929971-small.gif","p":["Lucana Santos received the Telecommunication Engineering degree from the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,\u00a0Las Palmas, Spain, in 2008, and the European Ph.D. degree from the Research Institute for Applied Microelectronics (IUMA),\u00a0Las Palmas, Spain, in 2014.","Since then she has conducted her research activity at the Integrated System Design Division, IUMA.

The CCSDS 121.0-B-2 describes a lossless universal compressor based on a Rice adaptive encoding. The CCSDS 123.0-B-1 standard describes a lossless algorithm specifically designed for efficient on-board compression of hyperspectral and multispectral images, and it is based on a prediction and entropy-based encoding structure. Two options are offered for the latter: the sample-adaptive and the block-adaptive encoder, which corresponds to the CCSDS 121.0-B-2 algorithm. These IP cores have been designed as independent compressors, but they can be easily combined in a plug-and-play fashion to be used together thanks to a dedicated interface. Additionally, standard interfaces are provided for configuration and external memory access. The design process encompasses the consideration of several different hardware architectures in order to maximize throughput and optimize the requirements of on-board resources at the same time. Both IPs are compliant with the high degree of configurability considered in the standard. The obtained VHDL code is completely technology independent, so it can be used to target any field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or ASIC of interest in the space environment, aiming to perform efficiently compression in satellites despite the inherent constraints of these devices. Results are reported as implementation results for the FPGA devices that are currently considered most representative and suited for on-board use from Xilinx and Microsemi families. In particular, the CCSDS123 IP core reaches for the Virtex5 FX130 a throughput of 153.5 Msamples per second, comprising only 5% of the look-up table (LUTs) in the device.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2019.2929971","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/9063575/08770145.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2019.2929971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9063575","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","startPage":"1120","endPage":"1138","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Implementation of CCSDS Standards for Lossless Multispectral and Hyperspectral Satellite Image Compression","volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8770145/","dateOfInsertion":"13 April 2020","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19625167","publicationDate":"April 2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2020","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000844","fundingName":"European Space Agency","grantNumber":"ITT AO/1-8032/14/NL/AK"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of CCSDS Standards for Lossless Multispectral and Hyperspectral Satellite Image Compression","sourcePdf":"taes-santos-2929971-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138363S","chronDate":"April  2020","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"9063575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"9063575","articleId":"8770145","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770146,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Sang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Sang","orcid":"0000-0003-3992-8757","id":"37087122360"},{"name":"Jun Zhao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China","College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhao","orcid":"0000-0001-9096-103X","id":"37292067100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"8770146","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":627},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Fuzzy systems","Nonlinear systems","Switching frequency","Switched systems","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","discrete time systems","feedback","fuzzy control","fuzzy systems","sampled data systems","switching systems (control)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched T-S fuzzy systems","passivity analysis","feedback passification","switched Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems","switching law","discrete sampling","switching frequency","room air regulating system","sampled-data-dependent switching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feedback passification","min-switching","nonmonotonous storage function","sampled-data implementation","switched T\u2013S fuzzy systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770146","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2019.2930430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2019.2930430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9130783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/9130783/08770146.pdf","startPage":"1219","endPage":"1229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passivity and Passification for Switched T\u2013S Fuzzy Systems With Sampled-Data Implementation","abstract":"This article investigates the issues of passivity analysis and feedback passification for a class of switched Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems with the sampled-data-dependent switching strategy and controllers. Different from the previous switching laws, the proposed switching law only requires the values of system state at the discrete sampling instants. More incisively, a dwell time constraint for all subsystems is produced, which reduces the switching frequency and avoids the occurrence of chattering phenomenon or Zeno behavior. Then, sufficient conditions for the existence of the sampled-data-dependent switching strategy and controllers are formulated, under which the switched T-S fuzzy systems is strictly passive without requiring the strict passivity of any subsystem. In addition, the storage function is only decreasing with respect to its value at the sampling times, which in turn implies that the storage function can be nonmonotonous. Finally, a numeral example and a room air regulating system are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the presented theoretical results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8770146/","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2020","publicationDate":"July 2020","accessionNumber":"19745700","volume":"28","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Passivity and Passification for Switched T\u2013S Fuzzy Systems With Sampled-Data Implementation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61773098"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B16009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passivity and Passification for Switched T\u2013S Fuzzy Systems With Sampled-Data Implementation","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-sang-2930430-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092686S","chronDate":"July  2020","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"9130783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"9130783","articleId":"8770146","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8770147,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7274860/9188049/8770147/wang-2930526-small.gif","p":["Chen Wang (S'10-M'13-SM'19) received the BS and PhD degrees from the Department of Automation, Wuhan University, China, in 2008 and 2013, respectively.

Many Internet giants such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft now provide Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) to meet the increasing demand for machine learning services. However, the prediction results of training data and testing data with the same machine learning model in MLaaS have remarkable differences, and thus the attackers can leverage machine learning techniques to launch the so-called membership inference attacks, i.e., to infer whether a record is in the training data or not. In this paper, we propose MIASec that can guarantee the data indistinguishability of the training data and thereby has the ability to defend against membership inference attacks in MLaaS. The key idea of MIASec is to narrow the dynamic ranges of vital features in the training data, such that the training data, the testing data, and even the synthetic data have almost semblable prediction results by the same machine learning model. With elaborated design on modifying the values of vital features in the training data, MIASec can thus reduce the differences between the model's outcomes of training data and testing data, thereby protecting the training data in effect while keeping the model's accuracy stable. We empirically evaluate MIASec on machine learning models trained by off-line neural networks and on-line MLaaS. Using realistic data and classification tasks, our experiment results show that MIASec can defend the membership inference attacks effectively. In particular, MIASec can reduce the precision and recall of attacks respectively by 11.7 and 15.4 percent in average, and by 18.6 and 21.8 percent at best.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770147/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2020","volume":"5","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"19932216","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2020","publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8770147/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"MIASec: Enabling Data Indistinguishability Against Membership Inference Attacks in MLaaS","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61872416, 61671216, 61871436, 51479159, 51879210, 51879210, 61702204 and 61872415"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2019kfyXJJS017"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Suzhou/Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20160385"},{"fundingName":"Transportation Internet of Things","grantNumber":"2018IOT004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIASec: Enabling Data Indistinguishability Against Membership Inference Attacks in MLaaS","sourcePdf":"tsusc-huang-2930526-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15207S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"7274860","isNumber":"9188049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7274860","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"9188049","articleId":"8770147","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770148,"authors":[{"name":"Ihsan Erdin","affiliation":["Engineering Design Services, Celestica Inc., Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/8874591/8770148/erdin-2930565-small.gif","p":["Ihsan Erdin (S\u201997\u2013M\u201901\u2013SM\u201912) received the M.

It is also shown that uniform MLCC capacitors with variable distance from power pins can have a similar decoupling effect to an assortment of capacitors. By simultaneously optimizing the pin-capacitor distance and value, the proposed method is shown to allow for the allocation of fewer decoupling capacitors under the ball-grid-array (BGA) pin field of an integrated circuit (IC) device.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2019.2930565","startPage":"1976","endPage":"1983","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503870/8874591/08770148.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2019.2930565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8874591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Objective Optimization of Decoupling Capacitors for Placement and Component Value","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Pins","Impedance","Optimization","Packaging","Bills of materials","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ball grid arrays","ceramic capacitors","evolutionary computation","optimisation","printed circuit design","surface mount technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pin-capacitor distance","decoupling capacitors","integrated circuit device","multiobjective optimization","multiobjective evolutionary","surface mount device","ceramic chip capacitors","printed circuit boards","resonant power-ground plane pairs","power integrity specifications","bill-of-material cost","part procurement risk","uniform MLCC capacitors","multilayer ceramic chip capacitors","BOM cost","ball-grid-array","BGA pin field"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decoupling capacitors","genetic algorithm","multilayer ceramic chip (MLCC)","power delivery network (PDN)","power integrity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770148/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Objective Optimization of Decoupling Capacitors for Placement and Component Value","volume":"9","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/8770148/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19080922","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Objective Optimization of Decoupling Capacitors for Placement and Component Value","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-erdin-2930565-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060971S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"8874591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8874591","articleId":"8770148","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8770151,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Chen","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8840987/8770151/ychen-2930639-small.gif","p":["Yun Chen received the B.S. degree in 2016 from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, School of Electronic Information and Communications.

Our design objective is to improve the energy efficiency of the hybrid precoder of millimeter-wave massive multiple input multiple output systems. We first propose a successive interference cancellation based hybrid precoding algorithm to maximize the achievable rate for any given RF chain and antenna configuration. This algorithm first decomposes the total achievable rate optimization problem into multiple sub-rate optimization problems, then it successively maximizes these sub-rates. Since the number of RF chains is limited, we can afford using an exhaustive search scheme to evaluate all configurations and identify the one having the best energy efficiency. Moreover, to rely on an attractive limited feedback, we also propose a beamsteering codebook for our hybrid precoding aided GSAC architecture. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a similar rate as the corresponding optimal unconstrained precoder. Furthermore, we show that the energy efficiency of the proposed scheme is better than that of the existing schemes in the fully connected and sub-array-connected architectures.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2019.2930639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8840987/08770151.pdf","startPage":"8940","endPage":"8950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8840987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2019.2930639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Systems Relying on Generalized Sub-Array-Connected Hybrid Precoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Systems Relying on Generalized Sub-Array-Connected Hybrid Precoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770151/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18991449","htmlLink":"/document/8770151/","volume":"68","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771216 and 61631015"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds"},{"fundingName":"Central Universities","grantNumber":"2015ZDTD012"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/Noo4558/1 and EP/PO34284/1"},{"fundingName":"Royal Society's Global Challenges Research Fund"},{"fundingName":"European Research Council's Advanced Fellow"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Systems Relying on Generalized Sub-Array-Connected Hybrid Precoding","sourcePdf":"tvt-hanzo-2930639-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090946S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8840987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8840987","articleId":"8770151","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770153,"authors":[{"name":"Dror Simon","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technion, Israel, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Dror","lastName":"Simon","orcid":"0000-0002-9056-2933","id":"37086933581"},{"name":"Jeremias Sulam","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department and the Mathematical Institute of Data Science, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Jeremias","lastName":"Sulam","orcid":"0000-0003-0946-1957","id":"37085459473"},{"name":"Yaniv Romano","affiliation":["Statistics Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yaniv","lastName":"Romano","orcid":"0000-0001-9031-8829","id":"37085389303"},{"name":"Yue M.

From a Bayesian perspective, sparse coding provides a maximum a posteriori estimate of the unknown vector under a sparse prior. In this paper, we suggest enhancing the performance of sparse coding algorithms by a deliberate and controlled contamination of the input with random noise, a phenomenon known as stochastic resonance. The proposed method adds controlled noise to the input and estimates a sparse representation from the perturbed signal. A set of such solutions is then obtained by projecting the original input signal onto the recovered set of supports. We present two variants of the described method, which differ in their final step. The first is a provably convergent approximation to the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator, relying on the generative model and applying a weighted average over the recovered solutions. The second is a relaxed variant of the former that simply applies an empirical mean. We show that both methods provide a computationally efficient approximation to the MMSE estimator, which is typically intractable to compute. We demonstrate our findings empirically and provide a theoretical analysis of our method under several different cases.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing

Elastic RF/FSO system has considered RF as a back-up link while FSO stops working due to aforementioned destructive effects. This work has analyzed the performance of two kinds of channel coding schemes named low density parity check (LDPC) and space time block codes (STBC) the former is applied to provide coding gain and the latter to provide spatial diversity over Lutz model considered as a statistical model in RF communication. Finally, the bit error rate (BER) performance of coding schemes has been evaluated over Lutz model with Rayleigh and Rician fading distributions. Simulation results demonstrate a considerable BER reduction even in low signal to noise ratios particularly when FSO meets undesirable atmospheric effects.","doi":"10.1109/WACOWC.2019.8770187","publicationTitle":"2019 2nd West Asian Colloquium on Optical Wireless Communications (WACOWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 2nd West Asian Colloquium on Optical Wireless Communications (WACOWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8764265/8769996/08770187.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8769996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WACOWC.2019.8770187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Elastic MIMO-RF/FSO Communication Over Lutz Model with LDPC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770187","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 April 2019","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Elastic MIMO-RF/FSO Communication Over Lutz Model with LDPC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770187/","publicationDate":"April 2019","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18865009","htmlLink":"/document/8770187/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-28 April 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Elastic MIMO-RF/FSO Communication Over Lutz Model with LDPC","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091948S","chronDate":"27-28 April 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8764265","isNumber":"8769996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8764265","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8769996","articleId":"8770187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770192,"authors":[{"name":"Behzad Noursabbaghi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran"],"firstName":"Behzad","lastName":"Noursabbaghi","id":"37086923082"},{"name":"Gholamreza Baghersalimi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran"],"firstName":"Gholamreza","lastName":"Baghersalimi","id":"37680548700"},{"name":"Ozra Mohammadian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran"],"firstName":"Ozra","lastName":"Mohammadian","id":"37086916869"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3767-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3768-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8770192","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Scattering","Optical transmitters","Attenuation","Absorption","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","interpolation","least squares approximations","Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation","optical modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","underwater acoustic communication","underwater optical wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","OFDM-based","depth-dependent variations","Wireless Optical Communications link","account impact","depth variation","attenuation coefficient","clear open ocean","Monte Carlo modeling","light method","Henyey-Greenstein model","scattering phase function","least-square channel estimation method","interpolation","Bit Error Rate performance","depth water","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing","quadrature amplitude modulation scheme","Underwater Wireless Optical communication link","comb type channel estimation arrangement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UWOC","OFDM","Henyey-Greenstein model","LS channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the performance of a 10-meter length Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)-based Underwater Wireless Optical Communications (UWOC) link by employing quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)scheme for various depths, taking into account impact of the depth variation on the attenuation coefficient in the clear open ocean.

In the considered system, an unlicensed secondary user (SU)uses the spectrum which is shared by a licensed primary user (PU)in a controlled manner to keep the interference at PU receiver, below a predefined value. Furthermore, among M available relays, one relay with the best end-to-end signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR)is selected for transmission. It is assumed that all of the RF links follow Rayleigh fading and all of the FSO links follow Gamma-Gamma distribution.

For a better understanding of UAV-based FSO systems, it is important to study the capacity of such channels, which is the main goal of this paper.

To continuously enhance user trust in the website, improve page visits and dwell time, and most importantly, increase gross merchandise value (GMV), it is crucial to understand and capture the important information hidden in the data, which has a great impact on user choice. The fashion e-commerce websites can collect the attributes of items and users as well as the user purchase behaviors, but lack the fine-grained classification of the items and the implicit relationship between items and users. This paper focuses on Amazon fashion dataset, one of the most widely used datasets in the fashion field. A differentiated recommendation framework is proposed that provides different recommendation paths for active and inactive users to improve the overall recommendation quality. In the framework, a data augmentation algorithm based on transfer learning is proposed to filter out the irrelevant items and label items with fine-grained tags, and a user-item knowledge graph is built to discover the potential relationship between items and users. Finally, a differentiated recommendation strategy is put forward to make different recommendations for users with different characteristics. The experimental results show that through data augmentation algorithm to improve data quality, factorization machine model produces higher recommendation accuracy, the constructed knowledge graph can alleviate the cold start problem for recommendation, and the differentiated recommendation strategy has achieved better recommendations for both active and inactive users.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08770225.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2928848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2928848","startPage":"102239","endPage":"102248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differentiated Fashion Recommendation Using Knowledge Graph and Data Augmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770225/","displayDocTitle":"Differentiated Fashion Recommendation Using Knowledge Graph and Data Augmentation","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8770225/","volume":"7","accessionNumber":"18880596","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2019","publicationDate":"2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61402100 and 61602109"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China","grantNumber":"16D111210"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007219","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai","grantNumber":"19ZR1401900"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Differentiated Fashion Recommendation Using Knowledge Graph and Data Augmentation","sourcePdf":"access-yan-2928848-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105094S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8770225","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770226,"authors":[{"name":"Minjie Wan","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8931267/8770226/wan-2930656-small.gif","p":["Minjie Wan received the B.S. degree in electronic science and technology from the Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in optical engineering.","He was a visiting Ph.D. student with the Department of Electrical and Computing Engineering, Laval University, Quebec City, QC, Canada, from 2017 to 2018.

First of all, each target candidate is sparsely represented in the subspace spanned by a joint dictionary. Then, the sparse representation coefficient is further constrained by an L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n regularization based on temporal consistency. To cope with the partial occlusion appearing in UAV videos, a Markov random field (MRF)-based binary support vector with contiguous occlusion constraint is introduced to our sparse representation model. For long-term tracking, the particle filter framework along with a dynamic template update scheme is designed. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments implemented on visible (Vis) and infrared (IR) UAV videos prove that the presented tracker can achieve better performances in terms of precision rate and success rate when compared with other state-of-the-art trackers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Video-Based Target Tracking Algorithm Using Sparse Representation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2019.2930656","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8931267/08770226.pdf","startPage":"9689","endPage":"9706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2019.2930656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8931267","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770226/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Video-Based Target Tracking Algorithm Using Sparse Representation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8770226/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2019","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19275677","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"6167509 and 61701233"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Video-Based Target Tracking Algorithm Using Sparse Representation","sourcePdf":"jiot-chen-2930656-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.181873S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8931267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8931267","articleId":"8770226","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8770230,"authors":[{"name":"Hesham Omran","affiliation":["Integrated Circuits Laboratory (ICL), Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8770230/omran-2930595-small.gif","p":["Hesham Omran received the B.Sc.

The proposed iterative methodology relies on one-time-generated precomputed lookup tables (LUTs); thus, it does not require invoking a simulator in the loop. Despite the inherent finite accuracy of the LUT-based design approach, we demonstrate that a precision bandgap circuit can be designed with less than 1-ppm error. We verified the proposed procedure against the Spectre simulations and probed the design space using a symbolic circuit solver. Moreover, we demonstrated how variations and mismatch can be taken into account in the context of the proposed methodology. The results demonstrate that the proposed procedure can provide very accurate results in a short execution time, enabling the designer to explore the design space of key performance metrics, such as power-supply rejection (PSR) and noise.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930595","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08770230.pdf","startPage":"100131","endPage":"100142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770230/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"Systematic Design of Bandgap Voltage Reference Using Precomputed Lookup Tables","volume":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18862626","htmlLink":"/document/8770230/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Information Technology Industry Development Agency (ITIDA)","grantNumber":"PRP2018.R24.7"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Systematic Design of Bandgap Voltage Reference Using Precomputed Lookup Tables","sourcePdf":"access-omran-2930595-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092606S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8770230","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":8770232,"authors":[{"name":"Chang Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8770232/cwang-2929204-small.gif","p":["Chang Wang received the B.S. degree from the School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, in 2018, where he is currently pursuing the master\u2019s degree.

Although recently neural network-based methods can improve the classification performance compared with the previous word-emotion and topic-emotion approaches, they have not fully utilized some important sentence language features and document topic features. In this paper, we propose a new neural network architecture exploiting both the syntactic information of a sentence and topic distribution of a document. The proposed architecture first constructs a tree-structured long short-term memory (Tree-LSTM) network based on the sentence syntactic dependency tree to obtain a sentence vector representation. For a multi-sentence document, we then use a Chain-LSTM network to obtain the document representation from its sentences' hidden states. Furthermore, we design a topic-based attention mechanism with two attention levels. The word-level attention is used for weighting words of a single-sentence document and the sentence-level attention for weighting sentences of a multi-sentence document. The experiments on three public datasets show that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art ones in terms of higher average Pearson correlation coefficient and MicroF1 performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770232/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18862496","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8770232/","publicationDate":"2019","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Tree-Structured Neural Networks With Topic Attention for Social Emotion Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"19BXW051"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Tree-Structured Neural Networks With Topic Attention for Social Emotion Classification","sourcePdf":"access-xu-2929204-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09852S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8770232","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8770233,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d8yvind Janbu","affiliation":["Zivid AS, Oslo, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8811631/8770233/janbu-2924337-small.gif","p":["\u00d8yvind Janbu (SM\u201906) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway, in 1998.

However, their conventional successive cancellation decoding method performs not well at a short or moderate length. In order to improve the performance, concatenation with other error-correction codes has been proved an effective approach, whereas current concatenation schemes using rate-optimized method are too complex to implement with long decoding latency. In this paper, we propose a critical set protected BCH-Polar code with its corresponding decoding architecture. In the proposed concatenation scheme, we only provide extra protection to partial information bits in the critical set, which is constructed based on the channel reliability. For its corresponding decoding architecture, we redesign some components and adopt the Look-up table decoding method for BCH codes, resulting in much degradation of decoding latency. Compared with existing decoders, the hardware implementation shows low decoding latency and high throughput-area efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770235/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","volume":"7","accessionNumber":"18862494","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2019","publicationDate":"2019","htmlLink":"/document/8770235/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Concatenation Scheme of BCH-Polar Codes With Low-Latency Decoding Architecture","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61874140"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Improved Concatenation Scheme of BCH-Polar Codes With Low-Latency Decoding Architecture","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2929188-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137626S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8770235","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770238,"authors":[{"name":"Yueyi Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8770238/yang-2929162-small.gif","p":["Yueyi Yang received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from the Zhongyuan University of Technology, in 2011, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University, in 2014.

Due to the harsh work environment, there are various known and previously unknown fault types, current scheduled maintenance cannot detect early anomaly in time, and constructing an accurate and stable anomaly detector is a challenging task. In this paper, an anomaly detection approach is proposed to detect anomaly based on a dynamic ensemble selection system (DESS) without the expert knowledge, which involves two-class and one-class classifiers, and the base classifiers are trained with the network features extracted from the physical-layer information. To conduct the fusion, the support function of \u201cdistance-based\u201d classifier is redefined as a class-conditional probability density function, and the source competence of base classifier is estimated by the entropy-based method in validate space and extended to entire decision space using the normalized Gaussian potential function. For different fault types, the competence classifiers are selected and the anomaly detection result is finally achieved by weighted majority voting. The comparative experiments are included in this paper to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness in anomaly detection, including varying fault types.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2929162","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08770238.pdf","startPage":"95418","endPage":"95429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2929162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection for Controller Area Network in Braking Control System With Dynamic Ensemble Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770238","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770238/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection for Controller Area Network in Braking Control System With Dynamic Ensemble Selection","volume":"7","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18862367","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8770238/","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2018YJS148"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"L171009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Anomaly Detection for Controller Area Network in Braking Control System With Dynamic Ensemble Selection","sourcePdf":"access-yang-2929162-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.189459S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8770238","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8770240,"authors":[{"name":"Renxiang Zhu","affiliation":["BioKnow Health Informatics Laboratory Key Laboratory of Symbolic Computation and Knowledge Engineering, College of Computer Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8770240/zhu-2929237-small.gif","p":["Renxiang Zhu is currently pursuing the degree through the Tang Aoqing Honors Program (computer science) with the College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China.

This paper comprehensively evaluated four classification algorithms and five image feature extraction algorithms for the TPC diagnosis problem. Our data demonstrated that the Hessian features extracted from the transverse ultrasonograms performed better than those from the longitudinal view.

FD-MIMO scenarios utilize a planar 2-D active antenna system (AAS) that not only allows a large number of antenna elements to be placed within feasible base station (BS) form factors, but also provides the ability of adaptive electronic beam control over both the elevation and the traditional azimuth dimensions. This paper presents a tutorial on elevation beamforming analysis for cellular networks utilizing FD massive MIMO antenna arrays. In contrast to existing works that focus on the standardization of FD-MIMO in the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP), this tutorial is distinguished by its depth with respect to the theoretical aspects of antenna array and 3-D channel modeling. In an attempt to bridge the gap between industry and academia, this preliminary tutorial introduces the relevant array and transceiver architecture designs proposed in the 3GPP Release 13 that enable elevation beamforming. Then it presents and compares two different 3-D channel modeling approaches that can be utilized for the performance analysis of elevation beamforming techniques. The spatial correlation in FD-MIMO arrays is characterized and compared based on both channel modeling approaches and some insights into the impact of different channel and array parameters on the correlation are drawn. All these aspects are put together to provide a mathematical framework for the design of elevation beamforming schemes in single-cell and multi-cell scenarios. Simulation examples associated with comparisons and discussions are also presented. To this end, this paper highlights the state-of-the-art research and points out future research directions.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2019.2930621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8915915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2019.2930621","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/8915915/08770245.pdf","startPage":"3238","endPage":"3273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elevation Beamforming With Full Dimension MIMO Architectures in 5G Systems: A Tutorial","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Elevation Beamforming With Full Dimension MIMO Architectures in 5G Systems: A Tutorial","volume":"21","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourthquarter  2019","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8770245/","publicationDate":"Fourthquarter 2019","accessionNumber":"19189825","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770245/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elevation Beamforming With Full Dimension MIMO Architectures in 5G Systems: A Tutorial","sourcePdf":"comst-nadeem-2930621-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.234907S","chronDate":"Fourthquarter  2019","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"8915915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8915915","articleId":"8770245","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770246,"authors":[{"name":"Shangping Wang","affiliation":["School of Science, Xi\u2019an University of Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8770246/swang-2929205-small.gif","p":["Shangping Wang received the B.S. degree in mathematics from the Xi\u2019an University of Technology, Xi\u2019an, China, in 1982, the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, in 1989, and the Ph.D. degree in cryptology from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, in 2003.

In order to ensure data security and privacy, data are usually stored on the cloud server in the form of ciphertext. When a user requests access to the encrypted data, an access key distributed by a third party is needed. However, if the third party is dishonest, the security of the system will be threatened. Faced with this problem, in this paper, we propose a new secure cloud storage framework with access control by using the Ethereum blockchain technology. Our new scheme is a combination of Ethereum blockchain and ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE). The proposed cloud storage framework is decentralized, that is, there is no trusted third party in the system. Our scheme has three main features. First, as the Ethereum blockchain technology is used, the data owner can store ciphertext of data through smart contracts in a blockchain network. Second, the data owner can set valid access periods for data usage so that the ciphertext can only be decrypted during valid access periods. Finally, as the creation and invocation of each smart contract can be stored in the blockchain, thus, the function of the trace is achieved. The analysis of the security and experiment shows that our scheme is feasible.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2929205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2929205","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08770246.pdf","startPage":"112713","endPage":"112725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Secure Cloud Storage Framework With Access Control Based on Blockchain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"A Secure Cloud Storage Framework With Access Control Based on Blockchain","volume":"7","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2019","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18914199","htmlLink":"/document/8770246/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572019"},{"fundingName":"Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi","grantNumber":"2019GY-028"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Secure Cloud Storage Framework With Access Control Based on Blockchain","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2929205-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145248S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8770246","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770249,"authors":[{"name":"Yuting Su","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8770249/su-2929109-small.gif","p":["Yuting Su received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Tianjin University, China, where he is currently a Professor with the School of Electrical and Information Engineering.

For this challenging task, feature learning and similarity measure are two critical problems. However, existing approaches usually learn discriminative visual features and develop a complex graph matching strategy to measure the similarity independently. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method which can embed similarity measure into the feature space. The proposed method utilizes both similarity and dissimilarity information to better leverage the unsupervised problem and estimates the labels which are further used for metric learning. With the learned metric, we project the original features to more discriminative feature space and efficiently measure the similarity among models under the new feature space. We conduct extensive evaluations of three popular and challenging datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method, competing against the state of the arts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770249/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18843695","htmlLink":"/document/8770249/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2019","volume":"7","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Feature Learning With Graph Embedding for View-Based 3D Model Retrieval","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772359, 61572356 and 61872267"},{"fundingName":"Tianjin New Generation Artificial Intelligence Major Program","grantNumber":"17ZXRGGX00180 and 18ZXZNGX00150"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004517","fundingName":"Tianjin University","grantNumber":"2019XRX-0035"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Unsupervised Feature Learning With Graph Embedding for View-Based 3D Model Retrieval","sourcePdf":"access-li-2929109-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125023S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8770249","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8770255,"authors":[{"name":"Devrishi Khanna","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8818466/8770255/khann-2927117-small.gif","p":["Devrishi Khanna (M\u201916) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Jaypee Institute of Information Technology University (JIITU), Noida, India, in 2009, and the M.Sc. degree in integrated circuit (IC) design through the Joint Degree Program from Nanyang Technological University and the Technical University of Munich (NTU\u2013TUM), Singapore, in 2014.

By using a single-stage cascode amplifier for each PUF cell, the output impedance can be significantly elevated. Compared with a traditional single-stage amplifier-based current-mode PUF, the proposed structure is capable of generating more polarized voltage value for the output node. With an additional digital buffer, the temporal noise can be well-suppressed, and a rail-to-rail digital output can be provided with high native reliability. Moreover, through operating the transistors at the subthreshold region, the overall power consumption can be dramatically reduced. Featuring a compact footprint of 3.23 \u03bcm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n (i.e. 764 F\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) for each PUF cell, the proposed PUF implementation is validated using 65-nm standard CMOS process. The excellent randomness of the proposed PUF design is verified based on the test results with widely-accepted auto-correlation function and NIST suites. Meanwhile, the PUF's uniqueness is measured with 10 chip prototypes and reported to be 49.94%. In addition, the fabricated PUF chips were also characterized with various environmental influences. With multiple readout (500 times) under the reference operating temperature of 27 \u00b0C and supply voltage of 1.2 V, the native unstable bit ratio is measured to be as low as 1.50%, which can be further improved to 0.79% by adopting the mainstream temporal majority voting (TMV)-based error correction scheme. Besides, we also evaluate the fabricated PUF chips' reliability under varied operating temperature from -40 \u00b0C to 120 \u00b0C and supply voltage from 0.95 to 1.3 V. The averaged bit error rate (BER) per 10 \u00b0C and BER per 0.1 V are measured to be 0.86% and 1.02%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art implementations, the reliability figure of merit (RFoM) is improved by 1.16~4.29\u00d7, with the influences of the temporal noise, the temperature/supply voltage variations and their ranges comprehensively considered.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770256/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","volume":"66","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"18952958","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2019","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8770256/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 124 fJ/Bit Cascode Current Mirror Array Based PUF With 1.50% Native Unstable Bit Ratio","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Kongque Technology Innovation Foundation of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"KQJSCX20170727101037551 and KQJSCX20180328093500762"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Foundation of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"JCYJ20170818101906654 and JCYJ20170302151209762"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 124 fJ/Bit Cascode Current Mirror Array Based PUF With 1.50% Native Unstable Bit Ratio","sourcePdf":"tcsi-pan-2927758-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069807S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8818466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8818466","articleId":"8770256","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770264,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Lan","affiliation":["Institute of Medical Robotics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Lan","orcid":"0000-0001-6061-5419","id":"37324711800"},{"name":"Chuanxin M.

This article argues that providing neural compatibility with the residual sensorimotor system of patients should be a main goal among others in the design of neural prosthetic and therapeutic devices. Neural compatibility is referred to as the congruency of neural information communicated between the brain and the external devices as in the intact central and peripheral sensorimotor system. Thus, efferent commands and afferent feedback can effectively reinforce motor relearning or function reacquisition. This may ultimately improve the efficacy of the external devices in restoring or assisting impaired motor abilities. This article presents several examples of neural technologies that leverage on the improved neural compatibility for neuromotor rehabilitation. Evidence supports the proposition that enriched neural compatibility may lead to enhanced effectiveness or functionality of the external devices.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"28KB","file":"/ielx7/8253409/8809235/8770264/graphical_abstract/tmrb-gagraphic-2930356.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/8253409/8809235/8770264/graphical_abstract/tmrb-gagraphic-2930356.jpg"},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770264","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Prosthetics","Computational modeling","Muscles","Task analysis","Iron","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomimetics","feedback","medical control systems","medical signal processing","neurophysiology","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomimetic sensorimotor control","neural compatibility","prosthetic devices","therapeutic devices","human sensorimotor control","neural technologies","natural sensory feedback","neural signal processing techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural prosthetics and therapeutics","functional electrical stimulation (FES)","sensory feedback","compliant control","EMG"]}],"abstract":"Prosthetic and therapeutic devices have been developed to ameliorate the quality of daily living for people with amputation or neurological disorders. However, many of them fall short of functional benefits, and therefore, are frequently rejected by users due to awkward control, or no awareness of interaction during tasks. Traditional wisdom in the design of prosthetic and therapeutic devices may have emphasized the need to provide users with apparatus that replace or assist motor ability. Rather, the notion to achieve neural compatibility with the existing sensorimotor system has not been well recognized. We argue that providing biomimetic control and sensing capacity to prosthetic and therapeutic devices can enhance their neural compatibility, and therefore, can yield greater functionality in performing activities of daily lives, or in rehabilitation training. In this paper, the authors will present a range of neural technologies that may allow implementation of biomimetic sensorimotor control, including natural sensory feedback, neuromuscular like compliant control, natural module of synergy-based control, as well as advanced neural signal processing techniques. Based on the evidence in our research and in literature, we propose that achieving neural compatibility with the existing human sensorimotor system should be the ultimate goal of prosthetic and therapeutic devices.","doi":"10.1109/TMRB.2019.2930356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMRB.2019.2930356","startPage":"122","endPage":"134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Robotics and Bionics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Robotics and Bionics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8253409/8809235/08770264.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8809235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving Neural Compatibility With Human Sensorimotor Control in Prosthetic and Therapeutic Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Achieving Neural Compatibility With Human Sensorimotor Control in Prosthetic and Therapeutic Devices","volume":"1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2019","accessionNumber":"18990637","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8770264/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2017YFA0701104 and 2017YFA0701103"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"81630050"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Achieving Neural Compatibility With Human Sensorimotor Control in Prosthetic and Therapeutic Devices","sourcePdf":"tmrb-lan-2930356-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.240619S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8253409","isNumber":"8809235","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8253409","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8809235","articleId":"8770264","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770269,"authors":[{"name":"Dongfang Xu","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Rehabilitation Engineering, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dongfang","lastName":"Xu","orcid":"0000-0001-5709-3883","id":"37086270322"},{"name":"Xiuhua Liu","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Rehabilitation Engineering, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiuhua","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086495321"},{"name":"Qining Wang","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Rehabilitation Engineering, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qining","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0003-3484-4810","id":"37577407400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2576-3202"}],"articleNumber":"8770269","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":691},"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"Knee exoskeleton assistive torque control based on real-time gait event detection.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"30KB","file":"/ielx7/8253409/8809235/8770269/graphical_abstract/tmrb-gagraphic-2930352.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/8253409/8809235/8770269/graphical_abstract/tmrb-gagraphic-2930352.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Exoskeletons","Knee","Torque control","Real-time systems","Torque","Event detection","Biomimetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gait analysis","medical robotics","torque control","wearable robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero torque control","critical gait events","real-time gait event detection","knee exoskeleton assistive torque control","bionic knee exoskeleton","inertial measurement unit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Knee exoskeleton","assistive torque control","real-time gait event detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770269","abstract":"In this paper, an assistive torque control strategy is proposed for the control of a bionic knee exoskeleton based on real-time gait event detection. Real-time gait event detection is executed with an inertial measurement unit based on an onboard trained model. Two models are trained based on the collected data from the knee exoskeleton at normal walking speed under zero torque and assistive torque control modes, respectively. We conduct two experiments: 1) real-time detection experiments under zero torque control at different speeds and 2) real-time detection and assistive torque control experiments based on real-time detection results at different speeds. Five able-bodied subjects participated in the experiments. The recognition accuracy and assistive torque performances based on real-time detection are evaluated. The experimental results show that all the critical gait events are detected rightly and the delay of gait event detection does not lead to damage to the overall system of knee exoskeleton. In addition, in real-time detection and assistive torque control experiments, parameters of the controller are refreshed for the current cycle based on the previous gait cycle, which is reasonable according to the detection result. The tracking performance of the torque could meet the requirement.

For example, state-of-the-art systems-on-chip (SoCs) enable controlling the type (Big/Little), number, and frequency of active cores. Managing these platforms becomes challenging with the increase in the type, number, and supported frequency levels of the cores. However, existing solutions used in mobile platforms still rely on simple heuristics based on the utilization of cores. This paper presents a novel and practical imitation learning (IL) framework for dynamically controlling the type (Big/Little), number, and the frequencies of active cores in heterogeneous mobile processors. We present efficient approaches for constructing an Oracle policy to optimize different objective functions, such as energy and performance per Watt (PPW). The Oracle policies enable us to design low-overhead power management policies that achieve near-optimal performance matching the Oracle. Experiments on a commercial platform with 19 benchmarks show on an average 101% PPW improvement compared to the default interactive governor.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2019.2926106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8910476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2019.2926106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8910476/08770273.pdf","startPage":"2842","endPage":"2854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Resource Management of Heterogeneous Mobile Platforms via Imitation Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Resource Management of Heterogeneous Mobile Platforms via Imitation Learning","volume":"27","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8770273/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19157470","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770273/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1526562, OAC-1910213 and IIS-1845922"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation","grantNumber":"2721.001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-17-1-0485 and W911NF-19-1-0162"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Resource Management of Heterogeneous Mobile Platforms via Imitation Learning","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-mandal-2926106-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09552S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8910476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8910476","articleId":"8770273","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770276,"authors":[{"name":"Ruiting Ouyang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687307/8930661/8770276/ouyan-2930594-small.gif","p":["Ruiting Ouyang received the B.E. degree in communication science and engineering from Fudan University, China, in 2016, and the M.I. degree in communications and computer engineering from Kyoto University, Japan, in 2018, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Graduate School of Informatics.

On the contrary, TV white-spaces have the potential to provide a wide-coverage, large-capacity, and cost-effective connectivity for ITS because of the excellent propagation properties, and there are increasing demands for applying IEEE 802.22 to mobile communication system capable of a wide coverage of 10-30 km. Meanwhile, since IEEE 802.22 was standardized as a fixed communication system, its scattered pilot pattern hinders accurate channel estimation in a highly mobile environment due to the Doppler shift and long-delay multipath fading. In this paper, we propose a reliable channel estimation scheme enabling an IEEE 802.22-based mobile communication system in rural areas without altering physical layer parameters. The proposed scheme effectively uses pilot symbols in adjacent subcarriers to extend interpolation range and shorten interpolation interval and offers high-accurate and stable channel estimation while maintaining flexibility in downstream/upstream ratio. As a simulation result, our proposed scheme sufficiently achieves a required bit error rate of 2 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n in a highly mobile long-delay multipath fading environment even in the presence of high carrier frequency offset.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687307/8930661/08770276.pdf","startPage":"935","endPage":"948","doi":"10.1109/TCCN.2019.2930594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2019.2930594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8930661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reliable Channel Estimation Scheme Using Scattered Pilot Pattern for IEEE 802.22-Based Mobile Communication System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770276/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","displayDocTitle":"A Reliable Channel Estimation Scheme Using Scattered Pilot Pattern for IEEE 802.22-Based Mobile Communication System","htmlLink":"/document/8770276/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2019","accessionNumber":"19275801","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ImPACT Program of Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (Cabinet Office, Government of Japan)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reliable Channel Estimation Scheme Using Scattered Pilot Pattern for IEEE 802.22-Based Mobile Communication System","sourcePdf":"tccn-ouyang-2930594-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07546S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"8930661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8930661","articleId":"8770276","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8770277,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Tschiersky","affiliation":["Chair of Precision Engineering, University of Twente, AE Enschede, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8253409/8809235/8770277/tschi-2930341-small.gif","p":["Martin Tschiersky received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of Duisburg\u2013Essen, Duisburg, Germany, in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

Three different spring designs are obtained and evaluated. The synthesis method to obtain these is explained in detail and an experimental evaluation validates the desired gravity balancing properties. It is found that in comparison to a flexure spring with constant thickness, a variable thickness distribution along the spring leads to a drastic reduction of its width, which amounts to 81 % in the presented case, and offers an energy to weight ratio that is 94 % higher. Employing a nested spring design further increases the storable elastic energy of the variable thickness design by 145 % through utilization of the otherwise unused space within the original spring envelope. A proof-of-concept prototype is built to illustrate a practical implementation. The presented synthesis method provides a tool to obtain gravity balancing flexure springs that offer a promising solution for the design of assistive devices which aim to be both wearable and inconspicuous.","doi":"10.1109/TMRB.2019.2930341","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Robotics and Bionics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Robotics and Bionics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8253409/8809235/08770277.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMRB.2019.2930341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8809235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gravity Balancing Flexure Springs for an Assistive Elbow Orthosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770277/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Gravity Balancing Flexure Springs for an Assistive Elbow Orthosis","volume":"1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"18990633","htmlLink":"/document/8770277/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research","grantNumber":"688857"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Gravity Balancing Flexure Springs for an Assistive Elbow Orthosis","sourcePdf":"tmrb-tschiersky-2930341-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112228S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8253409","isNumber":"8809235","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8253409","xplore-issue":"8809235","articleId":"8770277","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8770278,"authors":[{"name":"Weng-Geng Ho","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8883027/8770278/ho-2927363-small.gif","p":["Weng-Geng Ho (S\u201910\u2013M\u201916) received the B.Eng.

There are four main contributions in this paper. First, the negative-bias temperature-instability (NBTI) degradation of PMOS transistors in the conventional SRAM cell that causes the data imprinting effect is explained. Second, the data imprinting effect that leaks the stored information in the conventional SRAM cell is investigated. Third, a novel low transistor-count transmission-gate-based master-slave SRAM cell is proposed to periodically toggle the stored data for reducing the data imprinting effect. Fourth, an efficient imprinting analysis flow is proposed to evaluate the proposed data-toggling SRAM for quantifying the data imprinting effect. Based on a 65-nm CMOS process, we implement and prototype the proposed 1k-byte data-toggling SRAM design. We perform our imprinting analysis flow on various SRAM ICs and benchmark our proposed data-toggling SRAM IC against the non-toggling SRAM IC and a commercial Lyontek SRAM IC. From the measurement results, the non-toggling SRAM and Lyontek SRAM suffer from 60% and 81% data imprinting effects, respectively, whereas our data-toggling SRAM has only 11% data imprinting effect (at 160-kHz toggling frequency). The data-toggling SRAM could switch between high security (<; 5% data imprinting effect) high power mode for hardware security applications and low power (<; 0.1mW) low security mode for power-saving applications. Particularly, our data-toggling SRAM could feature as low as ~1% data imprinting effect when increasing the toggling frequency to 1.6 MHz by compromising the power dissipation. Using the image analysis flow, the stored information is revealed in both the non-toggling and Lyontek SRAM ICs but is well protected in the proposed data-toggling SRAM IC.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2019.2927363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2019.2927363","startPage":"4186","endPage":"4199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8883027/08770278.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8883027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Secure Data-Toggling SRAM for Confidential Data Protection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770278/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"A Secure Data-Toggling SRAM for Confidential Data Protection","volume":"66","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19096836","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8770278/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Secure Data-Toggling SRAM for Confidential Data Protection","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ho-2927363-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168665S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8883027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8883027","articleId":"8770278","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770280,"authors":[{"name":"Charles Jeon","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8789628/8770280/charl-2928947-small.gif","p":["Charles Jeon (S\u201912) received the M.S.\u00a0degree in electrical engineering and B.S.\u00a0degree in electrical engineering and mathematics both from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA, in 2013.

Such algorithms, however, typically rely on centralized processing at the base station (BS) which results in 1) excessive interconnect and chip input/output (I/O) data rates and 2) high computational complexity. Decentralized baseband processing (DBP) partitions the BS antenna array into independent clusters that are associated with separate radio-frequency circuits and computing fabrics in order to overcome the limitations of centralized processing. In this paper, we investigate decentralized equalization with feedforward architectures that minimize the latency bottlenecks of existing DBP solutions. We propose two distinct architectures with different interconnect and I/O bandwidth requirements that fuse the local equalization results of each cluster in a feedforward network. For both architectures, we consider maximum ratio combining, ZF, L-MMSE, and a nonlinear equalization algorithm that relies on approximate message passing. For these algorithms and architectures, we analyze the associated post-equalization signal-to-noise-and-interference-ratio. We provide reference implementation results on a multigraphics processing unit system which demonstrate that decentralized equalization with feedforward architectures enables throughputs in the Gb/s regime and incurs no or only a small performance loss compared to centralized solutions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Equalization With Feedforward Architectures for Massive MU-MIMO","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2019.2928947","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8789628/08770280.pdf","startPage":"4418","endPage":"4432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2019.2928947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8789628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770280","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/8789628/8770280-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.1, 1 2019","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Equalization With Feedforward Architectures for Massive MU-MIMO","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"17","htmlLink":"/document/8770280/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2019","publicationDate":"1 Sept.1, 2019","accessionNumber":"18884519","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Xilinx, Inc."},{"fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1408006, CCF-1535897, CCF-1652065, CNS-1717559 and ECCS-1824379"},{"fundingName":"Xilinx, Inc."},{"fundingName":"US NSF","grantNumber":"ECCS-1408370, CNS-1717218 and CNS-1827940"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Decentralized Equalization With Feedforward Architectures for Massive MU-MIMO","sourcePdf":"tsp-studer-2928947-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107097S","chronDate":"Sept.1, 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8789628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8789628","articleId":"8770280","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8770283,"authors":[{"name":"Qianqian Yang","affiliation":["Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8871140/8770283/yang-2929140-small.gif","p":["Qianqian Yang (S\u201912) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Imperial College London in 2019.

In practice, however, users start watching an online video content asynchronously over time, and often abort watching a video before it is completed. The latter behavior is captured by the notion of audience retention rate, which measures the portion of a video content watched on average. In order to bring coded caching one step closer to practice, asynchronous user demands are considered in this paper by allowing user demands to arrive randomly over time, and both the popularity of video files, and the audience retention rates are taken into account. A decentralized partial coded delivery (PCD) scheme is proposed, and two cache allocation schemes are employed; namely homogeneous cache allocation (HoCA) and heterogeneous cache allocation (HeCA), which allocate users' caches among different chunks of the video files in the library. Numerical results validate that the proposed PCD scheme, either with HoCA or HeCA, outperforms conventional uncoded caching as well as the state-of-the-art decentralized caching schemes, which consider only the file popularities, and are designed for synchronous demand arrivals. An information-theoretical lower bound on the average delivery rate is also presented.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2929140","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8871140/08770283.pdf","startPage":"7088","endPage":"7102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8871140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2929140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Audience-Retention-Rate-Aware Caching and Coded Video Delivery With Asynchronous Demands","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Audience-Retention-Rate-Aware Caching and Coded Video Delivery With Asynchronous Demands","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770283/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19115072","htmlLink":"/document/8770283/","volume":"67","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EC H2020-MSCA-ITN-2015 project SCAVENGE","grantNumber":"675891"},{"fundingName":"European Research Council project BEACON","grantNumber":"677854"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Audience-Retention-Rate-Aware Caching and Coded Video Delivery With Asynchronous Demands","sourcePdf":"tcomm-yang-2929140-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099538S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8871140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8871140","articleId":"8770283","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770291,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Pan","affiliation":["School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Pan","orcid":"0000-0002-0521-250X","id":"37088491726"},{"name":"Limao Zhang","affiliation":["School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Limao","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-7245-3741","id":"37087863051"},{"name":"ZhiWu Li","affiliation":["School of Electro-Mechanical Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China","Institute of Systems Engineering, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macau"],"firstName":"ZhiWu","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-1547-5503","id":"37086069733"},{"name":"Lieyun Ding","affiliation":["School of Civil Engineering and Mechanics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Lieyun","lastName":"Ding","id":"37088490967"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"8770291","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":745},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770291","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Risk analysis","Bayes methods","Fuzzy sets","Safety","Complex systems","Modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","belief networks","decision support systems","fuzzy set theory","inference mechanisms","probability","risk analysis","uncertainty handling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Dempster-Shafer evidence theory","fuzzy-based Bayesian inference","fuzzy BN model","fused intervals","fuzzy prior probability","interval fusion","systematic decision support approach","IVFS","risk analysis","D-S evidence theory","interval-valued fuzzy sets","fuzzy Bayesian network-based risk analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dempster\u2013Shafer (D\u2013S) evidence theory","fuzzy Bayesian network (BN)","interval-valued fuzzy set (IVFS)","Latin hypercube sampling","risk analysis"]}],"abstract":"A novel risk analysis approach is developed by merging interval-valued fuzzy sets (IVFSs), improved Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory, and fuzzy Bayesian networks (BNs), acting as a systematic decision support approach for safety insurance for the entire life cycle of a complex system under uncertainty. Aiming to alleviate the problem of insufficient and imprecise data collected from the complicated environment, the expert judgment in linguistic expressions is employed to describe the risk levels for all risk factors, which are represented by IVFSs using Gaussian membership function to fully consider such fuzziness and uncertainty. In regard to interval fusion and highly conflicting data, an improved combination rule based on the D-S evidence theory is developed. Then, fuzzy prior probability for each risk factor can be generated from fused intervals and fed into a fuzzy BN model for fuzzy-based Bayesian inference, including predictive, sensitivity, and diagnosis analysis. Furthermore, a case study is used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed risk analysis. A comparison of risk analysis based upon the hybrid improved D-S, classical D-S, and arithmetic average method is illustrated to show the outstanding performance of the developed approach in fusing multisource information with ubiquitous uncertainty and conflicts in an efficient manner, leading to more reliable risk evaluation. It is concluded that the proposed risk analysis provides a deep insight on risk control, especially for complex project environment, which enables to not only reduce the likelihood of failure ahead of time but also mitigate risk magnitudes to some degree after the occurrence of a failure.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2019.2929024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2019.2929024","startPage":"2063","endPage":"2077","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/9184168/08770291.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9184168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Fuzzy Bayesian Network-Based Risk Analysis With Interval-Valued Fuzzy Sets and D\u2013S Evidence Theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Improved Fuzzy Bayesian Network-Based Risk Analysis With Interval-Valued Fuzzy Sets and D\u2013S Evidence Theory","volume":"28","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2020","accessionNumber":"20014025","publicationDate":"Sept. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8770291/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010449","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"M4011971.030"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001475","fundingName":"Nanyang Technological University","grantNumber":"M4082160.030"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Fuzzy Bayesian Network-Based Risk Analysis With Interval-Valued Fuzzy Sets and D\u2013S Evidence Theory","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-zhang-2929024-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151314S","chronDate":"Sept.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"9184168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"9184168","articleId":"8770291","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770292,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Jiang","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8863562/8770292/hjian-2929126-small.gif","p":["Hao Jiang received the B.S. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Since user equipment (UE) detection and channel estimation in grant-free RA rely solely on the received preambles, preamble designs that enable high success rate of UE detection and channel estimation are very much in need to ensure the performance gain of grant-free RA with massive MIMO. In this paper, a super preamble consisting of multiple consecutive preambles is proposed for the high success rate of grant-free RA with massive MIMO. With the proposed approach, the success of UE detection and channel estimation for a UE depends on two conditions: 1) it is a solvable UE, where we define the UE whose super preamble is not a linear combination of the other UEs' super preambles as a solvable UE and 2) its super preamble is detected. Accordingly, we theoretically analyze the solvable rate of the UEs with multiple preambles and propose a reliable UE detection algorithm to obtain the super preambles of the UEs by exploiting the quasi-orthogonality characteristic of massive MIMO. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that turning a preamble into a super preamble consisting of two or three shorter preambles, the success rate of UE detection and channel estimation could be significantly increased using the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Preambles for High Success Rate of Grant-Free Random Access With Massive MIMO","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2019.2929126","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8863562/08770292.pdf","startPage":"4779","endPage":"4789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2019.2929126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8863562","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770292/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Preambles for High Success Rate of Grant-Free Random Access With Massive MIMO","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/8770292/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2019","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","accessionNumber":"19115238","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701186, 61571200, 61325004, 61771216 and 61631015"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2017M612458"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Preambles for High Success Rate of Grant-Free Random Access With Massive MIMO","sourcePdf":"twc-qu-2929126-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145308S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8863562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8863562","articleId":"8770292","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8770293,"authors":[{"name":"Suneet Sawant","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/9210948/8770293/sawan-2927475-small.gif","p":["Sunnet Sawant received the BTech and MTech dual degree in electrical engineering from IIT Bombay, in 2017.

Distributed algorithms proposed in the literature aim to maximize the network throughput by ensuring orthogonal channel allocation for the SUs. However, these algorithms work under the assumption that all the SUs faithfully follow the algorithms which may not always hold due to the decentralized nature of the network. In this paper, we study distributed algorithms that are robust against malicious behavior (jamming attack). We consider both the cases of jammers launching coordinated and uncoordinated attacks. In the coordinated attack, the jammers select non-overlapping channels to attack in each time slot and can significantly increase the number of collisions for SUs. We setup the problem in each scenario as a multi-player bandit and develop algorithms. The analysis shows that when the SUs faithfully implement proposed algorithms, the regret is constant with high probability. We validate our claims through exhaustive synthetic experiments and also through a realistic USRP based experiment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 1 2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2020","accessionNumber":"20022241","htmlLink":"/document/8770293/","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Coordinate in a Decentralized Cognitive Radio Network in Presence of Jammers","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005808","fundingName":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay","grantNumber":"SEED grant"},{"fundingName":"DST Government of India","grantNumber":"Inspire faculty fellowship"},{"fundingName":"SERB Government of India","grantNumber":"Early Career Research Award"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Coordinate in a Decentralized Cognitive Radio Network in Presence of Jammers","sourcePdf":"tmc-hanawal-2927475-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.273266S","chronDate":"Nov. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"9210948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9210948","articleId":"8770293","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8770298,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaolong Ning","affiliation":["School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China","Chongqing Key Laboratory of Mobile Communications Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China","University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687307/8930661/8770298/ning-2930521-small.gif","p":["Zhaolong Ning (M\u201914\u2013SM\u201918) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China.

Fog computing, whose infrastructure is deployed in close proximity to terminals, extends the facilities of cloud computing. However, due to the limitation of vehicular fog nodes, it is challenging to satisfy the quality of experiences of users, calling for intelligent networks with updated computing abilities. This paper constructs a three-layer offloading framework in intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to minimize the overall energy consumption while satisfying the delay constraint of users. Due to its high computational complexity, the formulated problem is decomposed into two parts: 1) flow redirection and 2) offloading decision. After that, a deep reinforcement learning-based scheme is put forward to solve the optimization problem. Performance evaluations based on real-world traces of taxis in Shanghai, China, demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, where average energy consumption can be decreased by around 60% compared with the baseline algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TCCN.2019.2930521","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687307/8930661/08770298.pdf","startPage":"1060","endPage":"1072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8930661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2019.2930521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Internet of Vehicles: An Energy-Efficient Computational Offloading Scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Internet of Vehicles: An Energy-Efficient Computational Offloading Scheme","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770298/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19275789","htmlLink":"/document/8770298/","volume":"5","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671092 and 61771120"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2018T110210"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"DUT19JC18 and DUT18JC09"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001871","fundingName":"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia","grantNumber":"UID/EEA/50008/2019"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico","grantNumber":"309335/2017-5"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Internet of Vehicles: An Energy-Efficient Computational Offloading Scheme","sourcePdf":"tccn-ning-2930521-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099332S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"8930661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8930661","articleId":"8770298","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770300,"authors":[{"name":"James K.

In almost all of the CF literature, it is a first-order circuit. In this paper, we examine two second-order CF linearizers and show that they can provide deeper suppression of intermodulation distortion or greater signal bandwidth at a given loop delay. Twin-loop CF with damping factor 0.707, for example, can provide 20 dB lower intermodulation distortion and half the error vector magnitude (EVM), relative to first-order CF. For twin-loop CF and proportional-integrator CF, we provide the first analyses of their behavior, stability limits, and linearization performance. Comparison with simulations using nonlinear amplifier models shows both the value and the shortcomings of linear analysis. Our new spectral separation approach leads to insights about linearization and EVM.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2019.2926387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2019.2926387","startPage":"4134","endPage":"4146","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8883027/08770300.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8883027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advantages of Second-Order Cartesian Feedback Linearizers for Radio Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770300/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Advantages of Second-Order Cartesian Feedback Linearizers for Radio Amplifiers","volume":"66","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19096823","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8770300/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"RF Technology Pty.

In recent times, the cooperative spectrum sensing that improves the reliability of the decisions made about the presence of a PU and overcoming hidden terminal problem by obtaining sensing results from different sensors is gaining much attention. However, the selfish SUs are sometimes not willing to cooperate. This paper proposes a contract theory-based approach, which is an incentive design mechanism where the participants are offered appropriately designed reward to encourage cooperation. The secondary base-station (BS)-SU interaction is modeled as a labor market using contract theory. Contract theory helps in analyzing the case of incomplete information where the BS is not aware of the SU's private information. Further, the contract is formed in such a way that only the limited number of noncorrelated SUs can participate in sensing such that unnecessary energy consumption is reduced. Simulation results show that the contract can effectively incentivize SU's cooperation, and outperforms the considered benchmark scheme in terms of PU detection probability.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2019.2927686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9107507","startPage":"2400","endPage":"2410","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/9107507/08770303.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Contract Theory Approach-Based Scheme to Encourage Secondary Users for Cooperative Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8770303/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Contract Theory Approach-Based Scheme to Encourage Secondary Users for Cooperative Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationDate":"June 2020","accessionNumber":"19669083","dateOfInsertion":"03 June 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Contract Theory Approach-Based Scheme to Encourage Secondary Users for Cooperative Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"jsyst-gupta-2927686-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093145S","chronDate":"June  2020","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"9107507","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"9107507","articleId":"8770303","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8770304,"authors":[{"name":"Qinge Xiao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Transmission, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/9316330/8770304/xiao-2924444-small.gif","p":["Qinge Xiao (S\u201918) received the M.S. degree in industrial engineering from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2016, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering with a specialization in process modeling and intelligent optimization methods for sustainable manufacturing systems.","She has authored or co-authored ten technical papers in journals and conference proceedings."]},"firstName":"Qinge","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37086322859"},{"name":"Congbo Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Transmission, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/9316330/8770304/cli-2924444-small.gif","p":["Congbo Li (M\u201912\u2013SM\u201917) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently a Professor of Mechanical Engineering with Chongqing University.

Optimal machining parameter decision is regarded as an effective way to achieve energy efficient turning. For flexible machining, it is of utmost importance to determine the optimal parameters adaptive to various machines, workpieces, and tools. However, very little research has focused on this issue. Hence, this paper undertakes this challenge by integrated meta-reinforcement learning (MRL) of machining parameters to explore the commonalities of optimization models and use the knowledge to respond quickly to new machining tasks. Specifically, the optimization problem is first formulated as a finite Markov decision process (MDP). Then, the continuous parametric optimization is approached with actor-critic (AC) framework. On the basis of the framework, meta-policy training is performed to improve the generalization capacity of the optimizer. The significance of the proposed method is exemplified and elucidated by a case study with a comparative analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2019.2924444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2019.2924444","startPage":"5","endPage":"18","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8856/9316330/08770304.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9316330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Meta-Reinforcement Learning of Machining Parameters for Energy-Efficient Process Control of Flexible Turning Operations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Meta-Reinforcement Learning of Machining Parameters for Energy-Efficient Process Control of Flexible Turning Operations","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2021","accessionNumber":"20286094","publicationDate":"Jan. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/8770304/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51975075"},{"fundingName":"Chongqing Technology Innovation and Application Program","grantNumber":"cstc2018jszx-cyzdX0183"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China","grantNumber":"cqu2018CDHB1B07"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Meta-Reinforcement Learning of Machining Parameters for Energy-Efficient Process Control of Flexible Turning Operations","sourcePdf":"tase-li-2924444-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106811S","chronDate":"Jan.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"9316330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"9316330","articleId":"8770304","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770305,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Xing","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., Beijing, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/9204502/8770305/xing-2930577-small.gif","p":["Yu Xing received the M.S. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.","He is a Senior Software Engineer with the Department of Architecture, Xilinx, Inc., Beijing.

The increasingly complex CNN models are both computation-bound and I/O-bound. Fieldprogrammable gate array-based accelerators driven by custom instruction set architecture (ISA) achieve a balance between generality and efficiency, but there is much on them left to be optimized. We propose the full-stack compiler deep neural network virtual machine (DNNVM), which is an integration of optimizers for graphs, loops and data layouts, an assembler, a runtime supporter, and a validation environment. The DNNVM works in the context of deep learning frameworks and transforms CNN models into the directed acyclic graph: XGraph. Based on XGraph, we transform the optimization challenges for both data layout and pipeline into graph-level problems. DNNVM enumerates all potentially profitable fusion opportunities by a heuristic subgraph isomorphism algorithm to leverage pipeline and data layout optimizations, and searches for the best choice of execution strategies of the whole computing graph. On the Xilinx ZU2@330 MHz and ZU9@330 MHz, we achieve equivalently state-of-the-art performance on our benchmarks by na\u00efve implementations without optimizations, and the throughput is further improved up to 1.26\u00d7 by leveraging heterogeneous optimizations in DNNVM. Finally, with ZU9@330 MHz, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for VGG and ResNet50. We achieve a throughput of 2.82 TOPs/s and an energy efficiency of 123.7 GOPs/s/W for VGG. Additionally, we achieve 1.38 TOPs/s for ResNet50 and 1.41 TOPs/s for GoogleNet.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770305/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2020","volume":"39","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2020","publicationDate":"Oct. 2020","accessionNumber":"19984794","htmlLink":"/document/8770305/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"DNNVM: End-to-End Compiler Leveraging Heterogeneous Optimizations on FPGA-Based CNN Accelerators","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100014121","fundingName":"Xilinx"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012282","fundingName":"Beijing Innovation Center for Future Chips"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100014121","fundingName":"Tsinghua Xilinx AI Research Fund"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100017582","fundingName":"Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB0105005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61622403 and 61621091"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004147","fundingName":"Project of Tsinghua University and Toyota Joint Research Center for AI Technology of Automated Vehicle","grantNumber":"TT2018-01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DNNVM: End-to-End Compiler Leveraging Heterogeneous Optimizations on FPGA-Based CNN Accelerators","sourcePdf":"tcad-wang-2930577-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117768S","chronDate":"Oct.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"9204502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"9204502","articleId":"8770305","onlineDate":"23 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8770310,"authors":[{"name":"Dimas Aji Nugraha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9754/8770307/8770310/nugra-2914723-small.gif","p":["Dimas Aji Nugraha received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia, in 2011.

Numerous efforts have been introduced to mitigate this problem. Some commonly used approaches are deploying some metaheuristic (MH) algorithm to track the multiple-peak P-V curve of partially shaded PV system. Cuckoo search (CS) is a new optimization algorithm based on the MH approach. It has been used to solve an optimization problem in many applications, including the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) problem. The CS algorithm performs well in tracking the global maximum power point (GMPP). However, just like any other MH algorithm, there is still a dilemmatic trading between their accuracy and the tracking time needed to find GMPP. This paper proposes a new MPPT algorithm by combining the CS algorithm with golden section search (GSS) to take beneficial features from both the algorithms. To validate the proposed algorithm, it is evaluated with various cases of partial shading. The simulation and experimental results show a noticeable performance improvement compared with the original CS algorithm and other MH algorithms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8770307","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/9754/8770307/08770310.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2019.2914723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2019.2914723","startPage":"173","endPage":"182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel MPPT Method Based on Cuckoo Search Algorithm and Golden Section Search Algorithm for Partially Shaded PV System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770310/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel MPPT Method Based on Cuckoo Search Algorithm and Golden Section Search Algorithm for Partially Shaded PV System","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8770310/","volume":"42","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"18849572","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2019","publicationDate":"Summer 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"NSC 106-2221-E-011-100"},{"fundingName":"Taiwan Building Technology Center from the Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education, Taiwan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel MPPT Method Based on Cuckoo Search Algorithm and Golden Section Search Algorithm for Partially Shaded PV System","sourcePdf":"cjece-lian-2914723-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091287S","chronDate":"Summer  2019","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"8770307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8770307","articleId":"8770310","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8770453,"authors":[{"name":"Merin Loukrakpam","affiliation":["NIT Silchar, Silchar, India"],"firstName":"Merin","lastName":"Loukrakpam","id":"37086918563"},{"name":"Ch.

So, DSP-based applications widely utilize Multiply-Accumulate (MA C) operation for accomplishing speed. In contrast with the binary number system, Residue Number Systems (RNS) is considered to be more prominent because of their abilities of carrying out carry-free arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction. Ternary value logic (TVL) offers several advantages like reduced chip area as well as overall delay, over conventional binary number system. Designing superior adder and multiplier have become the major concern for implementing high performance signal processing applications. To improve the performance of MA C unit, a new architecture is proposed in this paper. In this paper, MA C unit is implemented using ternary multiplier and RNS adder in TVL domain. The major bottleneck of TVL to RNS conversion and vice versa has introduced huge complexity which leads to decreased efficiency of performance due to large conversion time. The performance of RNS based system can be enhanced by choosing relative prime moduli set as improper selection of moduli will affect system speed, dynamic range and hardware complexity. Proposed MAC unit is mapped on field programmable gate array (FPGA) for analysis its performance.","doi":"10.1109/EDKCON.2018.8770463","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDKCON.2018.8770463","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Electron Devices Kolkata Conference (EDKCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Electron Devices Kolkata Conference (EDKCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765317/8770219/08770463.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8770219","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of RNS Adder Based MAC Unit in Ternary Value Logic Domain for Signal Processing Algorithm and its Performance Analysis","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-25 Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18851488","htmlLink":"/document/8770463/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of RNS Adder Based MAC Unit in Ternary Value Logic Domain for Signal Processing Algorithm and its Performance Analysis","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"43732038-5718421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058108S","chronDate":"24-25 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8765317","isNumber":"8770219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765317","xplore-issue":"8770219","articleId":"8770463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8770501,"authors":[{"name":"Kuldeep Raghuwanshi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, IET-Devi Ahilya University, Indore, M.P., India"],"firstName":"Kuldeep","lastName":"Raghuwanshi","id":"37086922664"},{"name":"Prachi Sanvale","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, IET-Devi Ahilya University, Indore, M.P., India"],"firstName":"Prachi","lastName":"Sanvale","id":"37086920599"},{"name":"Kratika Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, IET-Devi Ahilya University, Indore, M.P., India"],"firstName":"Kratika","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37086917937"},{"name":"Vaibhav Neema","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, IET-Devi Ahilya University, Indore, M.P., India"],"firstName":"Vaibhav","lastName":"Neema","id":"37543250200"},{"name":"Praveen Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, IET-Devi Ahilya University, Indore, M.P., India"],"firstName":"Praveen","lastName":"Singh","id":"37086402821"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6415-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6416-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8770501","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Negative bias temperature instability","Thermal variables control","Threshold voltage","SRAM cells","Aging","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ageing","circuit simulation","closed loop systems","CMOS memory circuits","compensation","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit reliability","negative bias temperature instability","sensors","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drain current","SRAM cell","voltage generator module","decision making module","transistor width auto-resizer module","NBTI effect","NBTI stress","On-Chip NBTI Mitigation Sensor","negative bias temperature instability","PTM CMOS technology","run time threshold voltage extraction","device reliability","aging effect mitigation","performance parameter degradation","run-time threshold voltage extractor module","aging sensor","circuit level simulation","post stress condition","pre stress condition","read SNM","hold SNM","PMOS transistor","close loop system","size 45.0 nm","time 6.0 year"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Negative bias temperature instability (NBTI)","6T SRAM cell","Threshold Voltage Degradation","Aging Sensor"]}],"abstract":"The aggressive scaling of the CMOS technology has made negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) a key concern in device reliability.

Here a close loop system is proposed to compensate the degradation in performance parameter of 6T SRAM cell. The proposed model consists of four modules such as run-time threshold voltage extractor module(aging sensor), voltage generator module, decision making module and transistor width auto-resizer module. All the modules are designed and investigated using PTM 45nm CMOS technology. Circuit level simulation on SRAM cell are performed in pre and post stress condition for 6 years of NBTI effect. The simulation result shows that the threshold voltage is increased by 14.77% which in turn degrades the drain current by 12.8% in 6 year of NBTI effect. Simulation result also shows that the Read SNM and Hold SNM are decreased by 18.59% and 2.97% and Write SNM is increased by 1.6% in 6 year of NBTI stress. It is observed that the proposed sensor increases the drain current to its actual value by just oversizing the width of NBTI affected PMOS transistor by 35.8% and mitigate the effect of NBTI on SRAM cell.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Run Time <tex>$V_{th}$</tex> Extraction Based On-Chip NBTI Mitigation Sensor for 6T SRAM Cell","doi":"10.1109/EDKCON.2018.8770501","startPage":"288","endPage":"293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDKCON.2018.8770501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8770219","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Electron Devices Kolkata Conference (EDKCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Electron Devices Kolkata Conference (EDKCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765317/8770219/08770501.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Nov. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Run Time <tex>$V_{th}$</tex> Extraction Based On-Chip NBTI Mitigation Sensor for 6T SRAM Cell","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8770501/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18865090","conferenceDate":"24-25 Nov. 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Run Time <tex>$V_{th}$</tex> Extraction Based On-Chip NBTI Mitigation Sensor for 6T SRAM Cell","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"43732059-5718477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075184S","chronDate":"24-25 Nov. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8765317","isNumber":"8770219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765317","xplore-issue":"8770219","articleId":"8770501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8770520,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Xiao","affiliation":["National Digital Switching System Engineering and Technological Research Center, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37086556559"},{"name":"Yijun Zhu","affiliation":["National Digital Switching System Engineering and Technological Research Center, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yijun","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38267742800"},{"name":"Dongfang Zhang","affiliation":["National Digital Switching System Engineering and Technological Research Center, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dongfang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086629884"},{"name":"Haiyong Zhang","affiliation":["National Digital Switching System Engineering and Technological Research Center, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Haiyong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086921585"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0660-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0661-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2379-1268"}],"articleNumber":"8770520","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":409},"abstract":"This paper proposes a visible light communication (VLC) chipset based multi-color multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) VLC system.

By enabling NFV in MEC, different functions can be programmed on the server to support diversified AV applications, thus enhancing the server's flexibility.

As one of the representative aggregation technologies, LAA is in favor of the harmonious coexistence with WiFi systems by leveraging the LBT mechanism and different pre-defined access priorities. In this article, we present a general overview of the attractive benefits and technical challenges for aggregating licensed carriers with unlicensed carriers. We then introduce some fundamental features of the LBT based LAA, including transmission modes, ED threshold, random backoff within the contention window, and access priority classes. Under multiple unlicensed channels, we propose two novel multi-carrier LBT mechanisms to improve the transmission behavior and coexistence performance of LAA and WiFi. It is verified in terms of successful transmission probability and carrier utilization rate that two proposed multi-carrier LBT mechanisms can achieve much better performance than the conventional counterpart using random carrier selection.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Throughput","Long Term Evolution","Wireless fidelity","Resource management","Interference","Pricing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","multi-access systems","multiuser channels","radio spectrum management","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple unlicensed channels","multicarrier LBT mechanisms","LTE systems","WiFi systems","LBT mechanism","predefined access priorities","unlicensed-licensed spectrum","licensed-assisted access","listen-before-talk mechanism","LAA & WiFi coexistence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770534","doi":"10.1109/MNET.2019.1900172","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel7/65/8977430/08770534.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2019.1900172","startPage":"76","endPage":"83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8977430","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Multi-Carrier LBT for LAA&WiFi Coexistence in Unlicensed Spectrum","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of Multi-Carrier LBT for LAA&WiFi Coexistence in Unlicensed Spectrum","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770534/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"January/February  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","volume":"34","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8770534/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2020","publicationDate":"January/February 2020","accessionNumber":"19301212","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Multi-Carrier LBT for LAA&WiFi Coexistence in Unlicensed Spectrum","sourcePdf":"017WEN_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081628S","chronDate":"January/February  2020","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"8977430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8977430","articleId":"8770534","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770536,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"p":["Jian Li (lijian9@mail.ustc.edu.cn) received his B.S. degree from the Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Anhui University, Hefei, China, in 2015.

The evolving STIN, as a combination of satellite networks and terrestrial networks, also faces similar obstacles. To address this challenge, technologies like ICN and SDN, which were initially proposed for terrestrial networks, could provide viable and promising solutions in STIN. In this article, we propose a novel architecture to provide flexible management and efficient content retrieval for STIN. Our architecture consists of a three-layer satellite network in which satellites of each layer are assigned to different functionalities. In order to achieve compatibility with ICN, we also design a new on-board switch based on protocol oblivious forwarding switch. In so doing, the proposed architecture inherits the advantages of ICN and SDN. Additionally, concerning the issue of the most traffic contribution in content retrieval applications, we propose a simple yet effective cooperative content retrieval scheme for terrestrial users. Furthermore, to make the best use of in-network caching and achieve further efficiency improvement of content retrieval, a cooperative caching scheme and a coded caching scheme are also proposed. The feasibility of these caching schemes is analyzed, and numerical evaluations show that the proposed content retrieval schemes in this architecture can achieve significant traffic load reduction.","doi":"10.1109/MNET.2019.1900138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel7/65/8977430/08770536.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2019.1900138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8977430","startPage":"188","endPage":"195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ICN/SDN-Based Network Architecture and Efficient Content Retrieval for Future Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An ICN/SDN-Based Network Architecture and Efficient Content Retrieval for Future Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"January/February  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770536/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January/February 2020","accessionNumber":"19301219","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8770536/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ICN/SDN-Based Network Architecture and Efficient Content Retrieval for Future Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks","sourcePdf":"032XUE_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058546S","chronDate":"January/February  2020","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"8977430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8977430","articleId":"8770536","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8770537,"authors":[{"name":"Ruoyu Su","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"bio":{"p":["Ruoyu Su received his B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Memorial University, St. John's, NF, Canada, in 2015.

Network slicing is a promising technology to establish customized end-to-end logic networks comprising dedicated and shared resources. By leveraging SDN and NFV, network slices associated with resources can be tailored to satisfy diverse QoS and SLA. Resource allocation of network slicing plays a pivotal role in load balancing, resource utilization, and networking performance. In this article, we focus on the principles and models of resource allocation algorithms in 5G network slicing. We first introduce the basic ideas of the SDN and NFV with their roles in network slicing. The MO architecture of network slicing is also studied, which provides a fundamental framework of resource allocation algorithms.

Thus, some scholars have proposed a successive cancellation flip (SCF) decoder that can maintain the similar spatial complexity of the SC decoder while improving the BLER performance of SC decoder. However, the computational complexity of the SCF decoder at low SNR is greater than that of the SC decoder. To overcome the problem and further decrease the complexity, we propose a new decoder called modified successive cancellation flip (MSCF) decoder, which reasonably avoids the unnecessary flip operation of conventional SCF decoder by utilizing a threshold based on Gaussian approximation. Simulation results have shown that the new decoder can significantly reduce the complexity of SCF algorithm with not obvious BLER performance decrease.","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770559","publicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765676/8770519/08770559.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8770519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Successive Cancellation Flip Decoder for Polar Codes Based on Gaussian Approximation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modified Successive Cancellation Flip Decoder for Polar Codes Based on Gaussian Approximation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18851997","publicationDate":"May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8770559/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770559/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 May 2019","conferenceDate":"9-10 May 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Successive Cancellation Flip Decoder for Polar Codes Based on Gaussian Approximation","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"101-p486-lv.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061288S","chronDate":"9-10 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765676","isNumber":"8770519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765676","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8770519","articleId":"8770559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8770560,"authors":[{"name":"Xifeng Chen","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, China"],"firstName":"Xifeng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086886379"},{"name":"Jupeng Ding","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, China"],"firstName":"Jupeng","lastName":"Ding","id":"37537857900"},{"name":"Huicheng Lai","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, China"],"firstName":"Huicheng","lastName":"Lai","id":"37086884257"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0660-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0661-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2379-1268"}],"articleNumber":"8770560","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":363},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Transceivers","Optical fiber communication","Handover","Optical fibers","High-speed optical techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["environmental factors","mobility management (mobile radio)","optical fibre communication","optical links","radio spectrum management","railway communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical wireless communication systems","optical fiber communication systems","optical communication performances","5G oriented optical communications","high speed train","fifth generation communication systems","high rate data services","signal bandwidth","spectrum license","optical wave","communication process","communication barriers","HST communication performance enhancement","transmission carrier","frequent handover","limited base station coverage","environmental factors","OWC systems","OFC systems","HST communication capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical wireless communications","optical fiber communications","the fifth generation","high-speed train"]}],"abstract":"With increasing of high speed train (HST) in all over the world, users' requirements for communications are constantly improving in HST scenario.

Since the Ubiquitous Smart Grid environment is complex and dynamic, it is an important problem for electrical provider to allocate the non-infinite electrical computing resources of nodes to reach an optimal and state performance. To maximum the benefits and resource utilization while satisfying users requests, it is essential for service provider to allocate resources adaptively for different conditions. In this paper, we propose a dynamic resource optimization allocation framework for the problem of Fog resource allocation for Ubiquitous Smart Grid.

Strong signal power can increase the power transfer. However, it also creates more interference in transmitting information, causing the realization of the SWIPT as a challenging problem. In this paper, SWIPT with multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) is considered for two users based on the precoding design. The source node (SN) will send the information and energy concurrently to the relay node (RN) in the first time phase within the SWIPT framework. Then the RN will reassemble the received signal and self-signal based on the decode and forward (DF) relaying protocol in the second time phase. Our target is to increase the EH at the RN under the data rate constraint of the SN and to maximize the data rate and downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) of the secondary user under the conditions to satisfy the quality of service (QoS) of the first user. Semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and Charnes-cooper transformation techniques are used to solve the nonconvex optimization problem. To support both the optimization problems CVX is premeditated, which is an efficient tool to solve convex and semidefinite programming (SDP) problems.","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770580","publicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765676/8770519/08770580.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8770519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Relaying Network Under SWIPT MIMO System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 May 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770580/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Relaying Network Under SWIPT MIMO System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18865236","htmlLink":"/document/8770580/","conferenceDate":"9-10 May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Relaying Network Under SWIPT MIMO System","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"099-p477-memon.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049525S","chronDate":"9-10 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765676","isNumber":"8770519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765676","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8770519","articleId":"8770580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8770583,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Li","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Network Technologies and New Services, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Li","id":"37086813997"},{"name":"Yuanyuan Dong","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Network Technologies and New Services, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuanyuan","lastName":"Dong","id":"37085878655"},{"name":"Zhenyu Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Network Technologies and New Services, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085880817"},{"name":"Xiyuan Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications Engineering, Beijing Information Science and Technology University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiyuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086815230"},{"name":"Xiaoming Dai","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Network Technologies and New Services, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Dai","id":"37537845200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0660-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0661-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2379-1268"}],"articleNumber":"8770583","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Complexity Channel Estimator for LTE Uplink in Non-sample-spaced Multipath Channels","abstract":"The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based channel estimation has been widely used in multiple wireless orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system owing to the good performance-complexity trade-off.

development of satellite industry, online monitoring and fault diagnosis for satellite communication system becomes more important. Due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient features of communication system, the conventional multi-classification algorithm Directed Acyclic Graph Support Vector Machine (DAG-SVM) has low diagnostic efficiency and poor coupling diagnosis performance. On the other hand, it has been proved that extending the feature space can effectively improve the classification performance. Therefore, this paper proposed a modified multi-classification algorithm called Feature-Extended Directed Acyclic Graph Least Square Twin Support Vector Machine (FEDAG-LSTSVM). The new algorithm combined all the initial features and their random combinations to establish coupling and redundancy for every feature, and then constructed the Separable Metric (SM) as classification measurement to arrange the structure sequencing of DAG-LSTSVM. To verify the utility of the algorithm, the standard monitoring signal indicators in satellite communication system were taken as experimental data. Preliminary simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the fault diagnosis accuracy to 89.69% but with 54.20% less computational time in 10-fold cross-validation compared with DAG-SVM, which means it can be well applied to diagnose fault for satellites communication system.","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770584","publicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765676/8770519/08770584.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8770519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modified DAG-SVM Algorithm for the Fault Diagnosis in Satellite Communication System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 May 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770584/","displayDocTitle":"A Modified DAG-SVM Algorithm for the Fault Diagnosis in Satellite Communication System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18852046","htmlLink":"/document/8770584/","conferenceDate":"9-10 May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified DAG-SVM Algorithm for the Fault Diagnosis in Satellite Communication System","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"059-p281-sun.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058827S","chronDate":"9-10 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765676","isNumber":"8770519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765676","xplore-issue":"8770519","articleId":"8770584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8770593,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Zhang","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, PLA Army Engineering University, Nanjing, P.

A single-antenna vehicle eavesdropper is within the courage of the AP, and the eavesdropper sends jamming signals in the uplink training and transmission phase and eavesdrops on LUs signals in the downlink transmission phase. During the training phase, a angle-domain (AD) channel estimation scheme is proposed. The active beam sets (ABS) of the interference channel and the LU channels can be separately extracted by comparing the beam gain vectors from different LUs. The pilot contamination can be eliminated and the channel state information (CSI) of LUs can be purified. By using spatial basis expansion model (BEM), full-dimension CSI of LUs and ED can be obtained, based on which the digital domain angle alignment method is designed to locate the ED.

and mobile edge computing (MEC) have been recognized as important techniques in future wireless networks, and the combination of them has received attention recently. It has been demonstrated that in a dual-user scenario, the use of the NOMA can effectively reduce the latency and energy consumption of MEC offloading. However, the scenario of multiple users needs to be considered further, which is more practical. In this paper, we consider a NOMA-MEC system with multiple users and single MEC server, and investigate the problem of minimizing offloading latency. Through using the Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm Deep Q-network (DQN) to select the users who offload at the same time without knowing the actions of other users in advance, we will obtain the optimal user combination state and minimize system offloading latency. Simulation results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the system offloading latency in the multi-user scenario of applying NOMA to MEC.","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770605","publicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765676/8770519/08770605.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8770519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Latency Optimization for Multi-user NOMA-MEC Offloading Using Reinforcement Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770605/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"Latency Optimization for Multi-user NOMA-MEC Offloading Using Reinforcement Learning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18852007","htmlLink":"/document/8770605/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","conferenceDate":"9-10 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Latency Optimization for Multi-user NOMA-MEC Offloading Using Reinforcement Learning","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"058-p276-yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092273S","chronDate":"9-10 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765676","isNumber":"8770519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765676","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8770519","articleId":"8770605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":8770608,"authors":[{"name":"Qiangyi Zhao","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qiangyi","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086917187"},{"name":"Liuguo Yin","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liuguo","lastName":"Yin","id":"37274088100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0660-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0661-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2379-1268"}],"articleNumber":"8770608","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Throughput","Iterative decoding","Multicore processing","Communication systems","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","Gaussian processes","multiprocessing systems","parallel architectures","parity check codes","processor scheduling","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parity checking result","decoding sequence","multicore scheduling","multicore low-density parity-check decoding","multicore LDPC decoding","Tera-bit/LDPC Decoding","code block processing","variable allocation sequence","Gaussian approximation analyzing algorithm","sum-product algorithm","multicore parallel architecture"]}],"abstract":"A scheduling scheme for multi-core Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) decoding is proposed to make full use of logical resources and to maximize the decoding throughput in the high-speed communication systems.

Deep learning (DL) based classifier is emerging as a prevalent choice for AMC. Previous research on DL based AMC usually assumes an environment of fixed signal to noise ratio (SNR). This paper considers DL based AMC for varying SNR environment. Two algorithms, including M2M4-aided algorithm and multi-label DL based algorithm, are proposed to combat the varying SNR. The former utilizes an M2M4 estimator to estimate SNR, according to which a proper trained DL model can be selected for AMC. The latter exploits multi-label DL to train a model, with which SNR scenario and modulation type can be inferred simultaneously. Experiment results show that the performance of both algorithms is fairly close to that of DL based AMC under fixed SNR environment.","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770611","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765676/8770519/08770611.pdf","publicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8770519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning based Automatic Modulation Classification for Varying SNR Environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Training","Binary phase shift keying","Constellation diagram","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","modulation","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["M2M4 estimator","multilabel DL based algorithm","signal to noise ratio","communications applications","deep learning based automatic modulation classification","fixed SNR environment","M2M4-aided algorithm","DL based AMC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning based Automatic Modulation Classification for Varying SNR Environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8770611/","publicationDate":"May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","conferenceDate":"9-10 May 2019","accessionNumber":"18865223","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning based Automatic Modulation Classification for Varying SNR Environment","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"005-p18-xie.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090051S","chronDate":"9-10 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765676","isNumber":"8770519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765676","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8770519","articleId":"8770611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8770614,"authors":[{"name":"Kabo Poloko Nkabiti","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kabo Poloko","lastName":"Nkabiti","id":"37086919056"},{"name":"Yueyun Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yueyun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086918659"},{"name":"Kashif Sultan","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kashif","lastName":"Sultan","id":"37085745141"},{"name":"Bika Armand","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bika","lastName":"Armand","id":"37086918836"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0660-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0661-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2379-1268"}],"articleNumber":"8770614","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless fidelity","Load modeling","Wireless communication","Recurrent neural networks","Optical filters","Data models","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Chebyshev filters","gait analysis","human computer interaction","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human gait","channel state information","human-computer interaction","unique body structures","deep learning models","DBD-LSTM-RNN","deep bidirectional LSTM-RNN model","human identification","signal propagation paths","CSI signatures","deep bidirectional LSTM recurrent Neural networks","identifying humans indoors","face","Wi-Fi","Chebyshev filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["human identification","Channel State information","long-term short-term memory"]}],"abstract":"Human identification is extremely crucial in the field of human-computer interaction. A number of studies on human identification have been done which includes using face and human gaits. Human beings have unique body structures and gaits patterns, so they induce different signal propagation paths which results in producing unique CSI signatures. These unique CSI signatures could be mapped with each individual person portraying them and by thus uniquely identifying a person. Since there are limited empirical research conducted on human identification using Wi-Fi and deep learning models, we propose a Deep bidirectional LSTM recurrent Neural networks (DBD-LSTM-RNN) for Identifying humans indoors using channel state information. A deep bidirectional LSTM-RNN model that segments the signals to determine the start and the end of human gait and map them with the appropriate body structure is deployed. Furthermore, we employed the Chebyshev filter to reduce noise on the collected CSI data. Lastly, the model is tested and evaluated using the data we have collected. The results indicated that the model achieved a high human identification accuracy with minimal computational effort and by thus making it a great option for systems that analyze human behavior.","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770614","publicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765676/8770519/08770614.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8770519","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deep Bidirectional LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks For Identifying Humans Indoors Using Channel State Information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 May 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770614/","displayDocTitle":"A Deep Bidirectional LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks For Identifying Humans Indoors Using Channel State Information","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8770614/","publicationDate":"May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","conferenceDate":"9-10 May 2019","accessionNumber":"18852032","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Deep Bidirectional LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks For Identifying Humans Indoors Using Channel State Information","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"056-p266-nkabiti.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068206S","chronDate":"9-10 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765676","isNumber":"8770519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765676","xplore-issue":"8770519","articleId":"8770614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8770615,"authors":[{"name":"Manxi Wang","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System, State Key Laboratory of Complex, Luoyang, China"],"firstName":"Manxi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086919863"},{"name":"Bingjie Liu","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bingjie","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086920035"},{"name":"Haitao Xu","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haitao","lastName":"Xu","id":"38238696600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0660-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0661-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2379-1268"}],"articleNumber":"8770615","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":255},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Internet of Things","Security","Resource management","Mathematical model","Games","Wireless communication","Dynamic scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","Internet of Things","optimisation","resource allocation","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["threat defense","cyber-security IoT system","resource allocation problem","optimal control variables","feedback solution","open loop solution","dynamic game"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["resource allocation","dynamic game","threat defense","IoT"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770615","abstract":"In this paper, we design a model for resource allocation in IoT system considering the cyber security, to achieve optimal resource allocation when defend the attack and threat.

Unfortunately, if the uplink resources are limited, the code ambiguity problem in CeRA will largely affect the success probability of single-shot attempt RA. In this paper, we propose a codeword detection method with the support of massive MIMO to address the code ambiguity problem in CeRA. The merit of the proposed codeword detection method is that the uplink resources could be effectively allocated to the actually transmitted codewords, thus resulting in significantly improved success probability. To this end, we first model the codeword signal of CeRA in massive MIMO system and then demonstrate that the proposed codeword detection method is able to detect the codewords without ambiguity by exploiting the quasi-orthogonality characteristic of massive MIMO. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of resource allocation in the CeRA with massive MIMO. Moreover, properties of the success probability of single-shot attempt RA with respect to system parameters are revealed. Compared to CeRA and LTE, it is shown that the CeRA with massive MIMO benefits from increasing of preamble space size and could provide a much higher success probability of single-shot attempt RA.","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770627","publicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications

matrix inversion operations with high complexity. Therefore, several approximated matrix inversion algorithms have been proposed. However, their convergence turns out to be very slow. In this paper, a new approach based on joint Jacobi and Richardson method is proposed. We show that the proposed method accelerate the convergence rate at low-complexity for different base station (BS)-to-user-antenna ratio (BUAR). Moreover, a promising initial estimate is utilized to achieve closer-to-optimal initialization for the proposed method. To further accelerate the convergence rate, we introduce a new approximated-eigenvalue based relaxation parameter. The convergence proof of the proposed algorithm is also provided in this work. We analyze the computational complexity of different methods and demonstrate the performance differences with numerical simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast-Convergent Detector Based on Joint Jacobi and Richardson Method for Uplink Massive MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770631","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765676/8770519/08770631.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8770519","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770631","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770631/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"A Fast-Convergent Detector Based on Joint Jacobi and Richardson Method for Uplink Massive MIMO Systems","conferenceDate":"9-10 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8770631/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18852023","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast-Convergent Detector Based on Joint Jacobi and Richardson Method for Uplink Massive MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"033-p153-khoso.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072348S","chronDate":"9-10 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765676","isNumber":"8770519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765676","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8770519","articleId":"8770631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8770632,"authors":[{"name":"Rao Shi","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rao","lastName":"Shi","id":"37086920587"},{"name":"Yunfeng Peng","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yunfeng","lastName":"Peng","id":"37086799485"},{"name":"Liang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086922662"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0660-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0661-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2379-1268"}],"articleNumber":"8770632","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770632","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","interpolation","Long Term Evolution","mobility management (mobile radio)","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user mobility prediction method","user equipment","traditional LTE handover method","mobile users","next generation wireless cellular networks","trajectory polynomial","femtocells","Lagrange interpolation","transition probability","unnecessary handover","UHO","ultra dense network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UDN","Mobility prediction","Handover"]}],"abstract":"Next generation wireless cellular networks will be ultra dense network(UDN) to increase system capacity through spatial reuse in a hot spot, but with the cost of increasing handover and delay for mobile users.

unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) acts as a temporary base station providing wireless power for the D2D transmitters to guarantee power efficiency for the D2D network, and serving as cooperative jammer (CJ) to interfere with the eavesdroppers. Considering the privacy of D2D communication, we formulate the establishment of D2D pairs as a multi-class classification problem, and use the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm to classify potential D2D transmitters. Specifically, the LSTM algorithm is based on the remaining energy of the temporary base station, the mobile state of the potential D2D transmitter and the content request amount of the D2D receiver to establish D2D communication that achieves the optimal security performance. The simulation results show that the LSTM-based D2D establishment scheme can effectively improve the security capability of D2D communication, and prove that the amount of energy harvested by the D2D transmitter affects the security capacity of the D2D communication system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 May 2019","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-10 May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18852077","htmlLink":"/document/8770650/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Wireless Powered D2D Communication Security Using LSTM in Emergency Communication System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Powered D2D Communication Security Using LSTM in Emergency Communication System","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"062-p296-hu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064419S","chronDate":"9-10 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765676","isNumber":"8770519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765676","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8770519","articleId":"8770650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8770651,"authors":[{"name":"Yawei Song","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yawei","lastName":"Song","id":"37086922327"},{"name":"Yunfeng Peng","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yunfeng","lastName":"Peng","id":"37086031311"},{"name":"Liang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086922662"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0660-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0661-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2379-1268"}],"articleNumber":"8770651","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770651","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision trees","distributed processing","face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic tasks assignment","face payment","face detection","feature extraction","classification recognition","face recognition services","face recognition tasks assignment","edge computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic Tasks Assignment","Face recognition","Decision Tree","Edge Computing"]}],"abstract":"Face recognition has been widely used in airport security, face payment, access control, and other scenarios.

But for polar code, there are at least two problems to overcome: the high decoding complexity and the undesirable correlation among the decoded bits. The former prohibits its application in practical engineering, while the latter engenders performance degradation for no iterative gains. To solve these problems, a joint iteration BP decoding algorithm based on generalized BICM-ID scheme is presented. In this algorithm, we combine the demodulation and decoding into one factor graph so that the noise corrupted symbols can be simply seen as the extended information nodes of BP decoder. Further, asymptotic performance bound of the proposed system is calculated to analyze its advantages and drawbacks. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the performance of the unmodified BIPCM-ID scheme with lower complexity.","publicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765676/8770519/08770658.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Iteration Belief Propagation Decoding for Generalized Polar Coded BICM System","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8770519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770658","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770658","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770658/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"Joint Iteration Belief Propagation Decoding for Generalized Polar Coded BICM System","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18865239","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-10 May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8770658/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Iteration Belief Propagation Decoding for Generalized Polar Coded BICM System","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"053-p251-cheng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064371S","chronDate":"9-10 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765676","isNumber":"8770519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765676","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8770519","articleId":"8770658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8770660,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Dang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, P.

The main contribution is to unveil that current receiver of CP-FBMA system, which is based on critically sampling of the received signal after analysis filtering, is rather suboptimal in the sense that a notable amount of useful information is lost in the process of downsampling. To regain the lost information, we propose to leverage oversampled signal for data detection at the expense of higher receiver complexity. Mutual information and computational complexity analysis suggests that 2x oversampling of the signal is a good tradeoff between receiver performance and its complexity.

It is a future trend to combine F-OFDM with MIMO to further improve the system capacity. However, when employing different numerologies, a long filter length is needed to suppress severe inter-user interference (IUI) caused by various symbol duration in time domain, which causes inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) at the same time. Longer CP is helpful to resist the effect of multipath and filter responds but will waste more time resource. In order to reduce ISI and ICI while improving the spectrum efficiency, we propose a CP optimization model based on theoretical derivation of ISI, ICI and IUI for downlink MIMO F-OFDM system. The simulation results show that the ISI and ICI decrease as CP gets longer, while the spectrum efficiency is improved based on the proposed CP optimization model and outperforms traditional OFDM.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765676/8770519/08770665.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2019

In this paper, we proposed a novel mmWave channel estimation algorithm based on Imperialist Competitive-Extreme Learning Machine (IC-ELM). The number of hidden neurons is optimized by Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) in the structure of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) according to the mean square error (MSE) between the actual and estimated channel state information (CSI). The IC-ELM is trained by the channel frequency response (CFR) of pilot positions to learn the channel characteristics. Further, the CSI of mmWave channel can be estimated by the trained IC-ELM network. Compared with conventional channel estimation algorithms, the simulation results show that the proposed IC-ELM mmWave channel estimation algorithm can achieve better performance in terms of MSE and bit error rate (BER). And the proposed IC-ELM is available in different types of mmWave channel models.","publicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765676/8770519/08770671.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8770519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Millimeter Wave Channel Estimation Algorithm Based on IC-ELM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Millimeter Wave Channel Estimation Algorithm Based on IC-ELM","htmlLink":"/document/8770671/","publicationDate":"May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18852051","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-10 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Millimeter Wave Channel Estimation Algorithm Based on IC-ELM","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"003-p8-miao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067533S","chronDate":"9-10 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765676","isNumber":"8770519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765676","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8770519","articleId":"8770671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8770673,"authors":[{"name":"Erfan Khordad","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Macquarie University, Australia"],"firstName":"Erfan","lastName":"Khordad","id":"37086917270"},{"name":"Ata Khalili","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Shahed University, Iran"],"firstName":"Ata","lastName":"Khalili","id":"37086353520"},{"name":"Soroush Akhlaghi","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Shahed University, Iran"],"firstName":"Soroush","lastName":"Akhlaghi","id":"37320596600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0660-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0661-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2379-1268"}],"articleNumber":"8770673","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO communication","Interference cancellation","Relay networks (telecommunications)","Array signal processing","Receiving antennas","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mathematical programming","MIMO communication","minimax techniques","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate balancing","multiple-input multiple-output wireless network","two-hop manner","full-duplex operation","underlying max-min problem","semidefinite relaxation technique","low residual self-interference scenarios","analogous half-duplex counterpart","full-duplex MIMO two-way relay networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Max-min","full-duplex (FD)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","two-way relay (TWR)","semi-definite programming (SDP)"]}],"abstract":"Maximizing the minimum rate for a full-duplex multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless network encompassing two sources and a two-way (TW) relay operating in a two-hop manner is investigated.

To circumvent this issue, semidefinite relaxation technique is employed, leading to upper and lower bound solutions for the optimization problem. Numerical results verify that the upper and lower bound solutions closely follow each other, showing that the proposed approach results in a close-to-optimal solution.

For the purpose of addressing this problem, this paper aims to reduce application completion time and energy consumption of user device (UD) in offloading. The algorithm proposed formalizes the computation offloading problem into an energy and time optimization problem according to user experience, and obtains the optimal cost strategy on the basis of deep Q-learning (DQN). The simulation results show that comparing to the known local execution algorithm and random offloading algorithm, the computation offloading algorithm proposed in this paper can significantly reduce the energy consumption and shorten the completion time of service workflow execution.","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770689","publicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765676/8770519/08770689.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8770519","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"Computation Offloading for Workflow in Mobile Edge Computing Based on Deep Q-Learning","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-10 May 2019","accessionNumber":"18852027","htmlLink":"/document/8770689/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","publicationDate":"May 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computation Offloading for Workflow in Mobile Edge Computing Based on Deep Q-Learning","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"009-p38-zhu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060765S","chronDate":"9-10 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765676","isNumber":"8770519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765676","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8770519","articleId":"8770689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8770690,"authors":[{"name":"Jingwen Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jingwen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086921134"},{"name":"Jingxuan Huang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jingxuan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086090456"},{"name":"Ce Sun","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ce","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086089590"},{"name":"Dai Jia","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Communication Networks Laboratory, Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, China"],"firstName":"Dai","lastName":"Jia","id":"38548534600"},{"name":"Xinyi Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xinyi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086381499"},{"name":"Zesong Fei","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zesong","lastName":"Fei","id":"37328223300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0660-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0661-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2379-1268"}],"articleNumber":"8770690","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Encoding","Decoding","5G mobile communication","Packet loss","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","automatic repeat request","block codes","decoding","error correction","error statistics","fading channels","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-density parity-check codes","transport block level hybrid automatic repeat request","connected-coding retransmission scheme","5G data channels","code blocks","parity bits","connected encoding","connected decoding","packet losses","LDPC codes","error correction","HARQ","CB error rate performances","5G mobile communication","CCR scheme","fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["connected-coding retransmission","LDPC","5G","HARQ"]}],"abstract":"Aiming at reducing unnecessary packet losses of transport block (TB) level hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ), we propose a connected-coding retransmission (CCR) scheme for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes in 5G data channels. Once the transmission of a TB, which is divided into one or several code blocks (CBs), was failed, we introduce failed CBs information into the parity bits of the new CBs by connected encoding. Then error correction for the failed CBs is achieved again by connected decoding to avoid packet losses. The simulation results in fading channel demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently improves both CB error rate performances and system throughput performances.","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770690","publicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 28th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765676/8770519/08770690.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8770519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2019.8770690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connected-coding Retransmission Scheme for Low-density Parity-check Codes in 5G","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8770690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"Connected-coding Retransmission Scheme for Low-density Parity-check Codes in 5G","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8770690/","publicationDate":"May 2019","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18852015","htmlLink":"/document/8770690/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-10 May 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connected-coding Retransmission Scheme for Low-density Parity-check Codes in 5G","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"046-p217-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105231S","chronDate":"9-10 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765676","isNumber":"8770519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765676","xplore-issue":"8770519","articleId":"8770690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8770692,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Zhang","affiliation":["State Grid Information & Telecommunication Group Co., Ltd., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086918682"},{"name":"Di Liu","affiliation":["State Grid Information & Telecommunication Group Co., Ltd., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086922917"},{"name":"Jianbin Zhao","affiliation":["State Grid Hebei Information & Telecommunication Branch., Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Jianbin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086919247"},{"name":"Zhihui Wang","affiliation":["State Grid Hebei Information & Telecommunication Branch., Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Zhihui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086917620"},{"name":"Yan Sun","affiliation":["China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086918592"},{"name":"Zhi Li","affiliation":["State Grid Information & Telecommunication Group Co., Ltd., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Li","id":"37086921326"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0660-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0661-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2379-1268"}],"articleNumber":"8770692","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dispatching","Maintenance engineering","Genetic algorithms","Computational modeling","Task analysis","Edge computing","Smart grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","genetic algorithms","power engineering computing","power generation dispatch","resource allocation","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fog computing","smart grid","fog servers","reasonable dispatching plan","genetic algorithm","allocation method","repair material resource global control","repair resource dispatching algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fog computing","smart grid","genetic algorithm"]}],"abstract":"With the development of smart grid, it becomes a key problem need to be resolved at present that how to realize an appropriate repair dispatching algorithm.

This facilitates the ECC calculation directly from the sampled radiating currents, bypassing the conventional tedious complex far-field pattern-based method.

Wide-band antennas and reconfigurable antennas are arranged on the opposite sides of the FR4 substrate. All the antenna elements are planar in architecture and are fabricated on a low-cost FR-4 substrate of dimension 80 mm\u00d780 mm\u00d71.6 mm. The proposed MIMO antenna system exhibit maximum simulated gain of 5 dBi with maximum simulated radiation efficiency of 92%. Both the wide-band antennas are arranged orthogonally for better envelope correlation coefficient (ECC).

The electrodynamic suspension is used for levitation and guidance. Gap control is not required for this suspension system, but the damping factor of the system is small. The damper coil system is considered to increase damping of the levitation system. Running simulation of the bogie is undertaken when the bogie passes the guideway displacement. The damper coil decreases the oscillation of the bogie. However, the energy for running is increased because of the weight of the damper coil. By changing the shape of the damper coil, the weight of the damper coil becomes half of the conventional one. From the results, the current of damper coil increases. When weight-reduced coil is used in passive damper mode, damping factor is small. But in the semi-active mode, damping factor increases. Electromagnetic analysis has been undertaken. Improvements of oscillations of the bogie with the weight-reduced damper coils are shown. The convergence time is improved 58.0% in lateral displacement and 57.3% on rolling angle by the weight-reduced damper coils.","doi":"10.1109/LDIA.2019.8771001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LDIA.2019.8771001","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 12th International Symposium on Linear Drives for Industry Applications (LDIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8764482/8770968/08771001.pdf","publicationTitle":"2019 12th International Symposium on Linear Drives for Industry Applications (LDIA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8770968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of the Lateral Vibration by using Weight Reduced Damper Coil on Superconducting Magnetically Levitation Bogie","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Control of the Lateral Vibration by using Weight Reduced Damper Coil on Superconducting Magnetically Levitation Bogie","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2019","publicationDate":"July 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8771001/","accessionNumber":"18851150","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771001/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of the Lateral Vibration by using Weight Reduced Damper Coil on Superconducting Magnetically Levitation Bogie","confLoc":"Neuchatel, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"Ohashi-Control_of_the_Lateral_Vibration.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035572S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8764482","isNumber":"8770968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8764482","xplore-issue":"8770968","articleId":"8771001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8771051,"authors":[{"name":"Osama Alluhaibi","affiliation":["WMG, The University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8771051/alluh-2930746-small.gif","p":["Osama Alluhaibi received the B.E. degree in electrical and communications engineering from the University of Baghdad, Iraq, in 2006, the M.Sc. degree in electronics and communications engineering from Sam Higginbottom Institute of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences (SHUATS), India, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics and communications engineering from the University of Kent, Canterbury, U.K., in 2018.","Since 2007, he has been with ABB Group, and also with Kalimat Telecommunication.

Industry 4.0 targets to accelerate the digitalization of manufacturing processes by allocating fixed and mobile robotics which use wireless communication. Such development requires high data throughput for which the utilization of short distance wireless communication such as mm-Wave system is crucially required. Based on our measurements, the probability of mm-Wave propagation waves to be reflected and refracted from metallic surfaces are shown to be significantly high. Consequently, uplink transmissions from different users such as robotics, machines, and sensors can go through paths sharing the same physical scatters, some transmission paths of different users may have overlapped angle of arrivals (AoAs) at the base station. Under such circumstance, the correlation between the channel vectors also increases considerably, which affects the achievable uplink rate severely. Therefore, the intrinsic focus is on substantially maximizing the desired signal while reducing the system interference. The proposed analog precoders and combiners are designed by using the power iteration and the Riemannian optimization method based on Stiefel manifold algorithms, respectively. The proposed digital combiner adapts the minimum mean-square error by judiciously exploiting the effective uplink analog channel gains. Furthermore, the channel estimation is investigated through a newly designed two-step procedure. In each scattering point, there is the strongest power point which is detected and then used to improve the accuracy by employing an angular domain scheme. The impact of this paper will be the boosting of the achievable uplink rate in industrial environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08771051.pdf","startPage":"101178","endPage":"101194","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Overlapped AoAs on the Achievable Uplink Rate of Hybrid Beamforming for Massive MIMO mm-Wave Systems for Industrial Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uplink","Interference","Precoding","MIMO communication","Channel estimation","Antennas","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","digital-analogue conversion","direction-of-arrival estimation","electromagnetic wave reflection","electromagnetic wave refraction","interference suppression","iterative methods","millimetre wave communication","millimetre wave propagation","MIMO communication","optimisation","precoding","probability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO mm-Wave systems","industrial environments","uplink massive multiple-input multiple-output millimeter wave systems","fixed robotics","mobile robotics","short distance wireless communication","uplink transmissions","achievable uplink rate","system interference","analog precoders","digital combiner","effective uplink analog channel gains","overlapped AoAs","multiuser hybrid digital-to-analog beamforming","novel precoder schemes","radio frequency chains","transceiver","manufacturing processes","Industry 4.0","high data throughput","metallic surfaces","physical scatters","transmission paths","mm-Wave propagation wave probability","overlapped angle of arrivals","base station","channel vectors","system interference reduction","power iteration","Riemannian optimization method","Stiefel manifold algorithms","minimum mean-square error","channel estimation","two-step procedure","scattering point","angular domain scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid precoding and combining","millimetre wave","massive MIMO","Riemannian manifold optimization problem"]}],"topic":"Emerging Trends, Issues and Challenges for Array Signal Processing and Its Applications in Smart City","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Overlapped AoAs on the Achievable Uplink Rate of Hybrid Beamforming for Massive MIMO mm-Wave Systems for Industrial Environments","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8771051/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18880515","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"WMG Centre High Value Manufacturing Catapult, The University ofWarwick, Coventry, U.K."},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Impact of Overlapped AoAs on the Achievable Uplink Rate of Hybrid Beamforming for Massive MIMO mm-Wave Systems for Industrial Environments","sourcePdf":"access-alluhaibi-2930746-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153037S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8600701","topics":["Emerging Trends, Issues and Challenges for Array Signal Processing and Its Applications in Smart City"],"articleId":"8771051","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8771052,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyu Ai","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8771052/ai-2930750-small.gif","p":["Xiaoyu Ai was born in Henan.

The SPCMR algorithm consists of two parts: projection subspaces estimation and interference-plus-noise covariance matrix (INCM) reconstruction. Specifically, we estimate two projection subspaces containing the signal component and obtain the signal SV from their intersection. The first projection subspace is estimated from the constructed signal covariance matrix via the distortionless responses principle. The second one is gotten according to the subspace proximity between the nominal signal SV and the eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix. Subsequently, the interference SVs are estimated by using the Capon spatial estimator, and each interference power is obtained via the oblique projectors. After that, an accurate INCM is reconstructed, and the SPCMR beamformer is proposed. The simulation results show that the SPCMR algorithm is robust to several model mismatches and outperforms other adaptive algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771052/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","volume":"7","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18880418","publicationDate":"2019","htmlLink":"/document/8771052/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2019","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming With Subspace Projection and Covariance Matrix Reconstruction","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming With Subspace Projection and Covariance Matrix Reconstruction","sourcePdf":"access-gan-2930750-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10073S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8771052","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8771058,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Xi\u2019an Institute of High-Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0003-2621-8633","id":"37086934023"},{"name":"Chuan He","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"He","id":"37085369087"},{"name":"Changhua Hu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Xi\u2019an Institute of High-Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Changhua","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085353573"},{"name":"Hong Pei","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Xi\u2019an Institute of High-Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Pei","id":"37086933964"},{"name":"Licheng Jiao","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Licheng","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37276095000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2169-3536"}],"articleNumber":"8771058","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2369},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/index.html"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"The algorithm mainly consists of five parts, namely, data preprocessing, feature fusion, box regression, prediction and Soft-NMS.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"43KB","file":"/ielx7/6287639/8600701/8771058/graphical_abstract/access-gagraphic-2930939.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/6287639/8600701/8771058/graphical_abstract/access-gagraphic-2930939.jpg"},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deep Neural Network Based on an Attention Mechanism for SAR Ship Detection in Multiscale and Complex Scenarios","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08771058.pdf","startPage":"104848","endPage":"104863","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930939","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Marine vehicles","Feature extraction","Radar polarimetry","Detection algorithms","Synthetic aperture radar","Object detection","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","object detection","radar imaging","ships","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep neural network","attention mechanism","synthetic aperture radar ship detection","densely arranged ships","SAR images","ship shapes","object detection network","ship targets","missed detections","extended SAR ship detection dataset","real-time detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ship detection","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","deep neural network","attention mechanism"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771058","abstract":"Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship detection based on deep learning has been widely applied in recent years. However, two main obstacles are hindering SAR ship detection. First, the identification of ships in a port is seriously disrupted by the presence of onshore buildings. It is difficult for the existing detection algorithms to effectively distinguish the targets from such a complex background. Additionally, it appears more complicated to accurately locate densely arranged ships. Second, the ships in SAR images exist at a variety of scales due to multiresolution imaging modes and the variety of ship shapes; these pose a much greater challenge to ship detection. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes an object detection network combined with an attention mechanism to accurately locate targets in complex scenarios. To address the diverse scales of ship targets, we construct a loss function that incorporates the generalized intersection over union (GIoU) loss to reduce the scale sensitivity of the network. For the final processing of the results, soft nonmaximum suppression (Soft-NMS) is also introduced into the model to reduce the number of missed detections for ship targets in the presence of severe overlap. The experimental results reveal that the proposed model exhibits excellent performance on the extended SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) while achieving real-time detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771058/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18880694","htmlLink":"/document/8771058/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2019","volume":"7","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Deep Neural Network Based on an Attention Mechanism for SAR Ship Detection in Multiscale and Complex Scenarios","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61773389, 61833016 and 61573365"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Deep Neural Network Based on an Attention Mechanism for SAR Ship Detection in Multiscale and Complex Scenarios","sourcePdf":"access-chen-2930939-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106891S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8771058","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":8771073,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Engineering"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086919310"},{"name":"Meng-Chieh Lee","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Engineering"],"firstName":"Meng-Chieh","lastName":"Lee","id":"37088810811"},{"name":"Vincent S.

The modular architecture of the wristband platform allows for incorporation of other sensors for future correlated sensing studies between health and environment.","doi":"10.1109/BSN.2019.8771074","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 16th International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks (BSN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 16th International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks (BSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8764266/8771035/08771074.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BSN.2019.8771074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8771035","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wearable Wrist-Band with Compressive Sensing based Ultra-Low Power Photoplethysmography Readout Circuit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771074","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Wearable Wrist-Band with Compressive Sensing based Ultra-Low Power Photoplethysmography Readout Circuit","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771074/","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 2019","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18850866","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8771074/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wearable Wrist-Band with Compressive Sensing based Ultra-Low Power Photoplethysmography Readout Circuit","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1570522254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081807S","chronDate":"19-22 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8764266","isNumber":"8771035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8764266","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8771035","articleId":"8771074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8771100,"authors":[{"name":"Tianzhe Bao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Tianzhe","lastName":"Bao","id":"37086916871"},{"name":"Ali Zaidi","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Zaidi","id":"37086063693"},{"name":"Shengquan Xie","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Shengquan","lastName":"Xie","id":"37833367900"},{"name":"Zhiqiang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085859836"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7477-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0804-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8894"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2376-8886"}],"articleNumber":"8771100","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface-EMG based Wrist Kinematics Estimation using Convolutional Neural Network","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 16th International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks (BSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8764266/8771035/08771100.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 16th International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks (BSN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BSN.2019.8771100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8771035","doi":"10.1109/BSN.2019.8771100","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wrist","Estimation","Feature extraction","Ground penetrating radar","Muscles","Training","Two dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","electromyography","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal processing","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surface-EMG","wrist kinematics estimation","prosthetic hands","single stream convolutional neural network","surface electromyography","nonlinear ML models","2D spectrum sEMG images","deep learning","machine learning methods","two dimensional sEMG images","linear ML models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sEMG","wrist kinematics estimation","machine learning","deep learning","convolutional neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771100","abstract":"In the past decades, classical machine learning (ML) methods have been widely investigated in wrist kinematics estimation for the control of prosthetic hands.

Two types of two dimensional (2D) sEMG images are constructed in time domain and spectrum as CNN inputs, respectively. Six typical linear and nonlinear ML models are implemented for comparison, where four efficient time-spatial hand-crafted features are extracted to represent feature engineering. Experiment results with four able-bodied participants illustrate that CNN with 2D spectrum sEMG images can achieve highest accuracy in most testing sessions. In other sessions, it is still competitive to the most promising ML techniques.

However, human-like driver model is a rarely mentioned research issue. In this paper, we first establish three preview-based driver models in PreScan+Simulink and collect human drivers' steering data on four two-way and two-lane free curved roads with 20 experienced drivers and one experimental vehicle under four specified speeds. Then, the similarities between steering wheel angles of preview-based models and those of human drivers are compared through dynamic time warping (DTW). From the calculation results of DTW and analysis of human drivers' gaze positions, it shows that the preview-based models are hard to reflect the characteristics of human drivers' maneuver. To this end, we propose a human-like driver model based on the continuity of human drivers' steering wheel angles. The experienced drivers' steering wheel angels are modeled with three different kinds of multivariate multi-step recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and the inputs of models are historical speeds, historical road curvatures, future road curvatures, and historical steering wheel angles, as well as the outputs are future steering wheel angles. By comparing the three RNN-based driver models with different configuration structures and historical steps, it is found that the long short-term memory (LSTM) model has the best prediction performance in validation and testing period. In this way, a data-driven human-like driver model is developed to generate human-like steering wheel angles on curved roads.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930873","startPage":"98094","endPage":"98106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08771110.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of Human-Like Driver Model Based on Recurrent Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771110/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Implementation of Human-Like Driver Model Based on Recurrent Neural Networks","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8771110/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18862456","publicationDate":"2019","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51675235 and 51605199"},{"fundingName":"Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"KYCX17_1812"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Implementation of Human-Like Driver Model Based on Recurrent Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"access-li-2930873-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128546S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8771110","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8771111,"authors":[{"name":"Zakaria Abou El Houda","affiliation":["ICD/ERA, University of Technology of Troyes, Troyes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8771111/houda-2930715-small.gif","p":["Zakaria Abou El Houda received the Engineer\u2019s degree in computer science from the National School of Applied sciences Marrakech, Marrakech, Morocco, and the M.Sc. degree in computer networks from Paul Sabatier University, Toulouse, France.

Existing DDoS mitigation schemes are facing obstacles due to low flexibility, lack of resources, and high cost. The new emerging technologies, such as blockchain, introduce new opportunities for low-cost, efficient and flexible DDoS attacks mitigation across multiple domains. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based approach, called Cochain-SC, which combines two levels of mitigation, intra-domain and inter-domain DDoS mitigation. For intra-domain, we propose an effective DDoS mitigation method in the context of software defined networks (SDN); it consists of three schemes: (1) Intra Entropy-based scheme (I-ES) to measure, using sFlow, the randomness of data inside the domain; (2) Intra Bayes-based scheme (I-BS) to classify, based on entropy values, illegitimate flows; and (3) Intra-domain Mitigation (I-DM) scheme to effectively mitigate illegitimate flows inside the domain. For inter-domain, we propose a collaborative DDoS mitigation scheme based on blockchain; it uses the concept of smart contracts (i.e., Ethereum's smart contracts) to facilitate the collaboration among SDN-based domains (i.e., Autonomous System: AS) to mitigate DDoS attacks. For this aim, we design a novel and secure scheme that allows multiple SDN-based domains to securely collaborate and transfer attack information in a decentralized manner. Combining intra- and inter-domain DDoS mitigation, Cochain-SC allows an efficient mitigation along the path of an ongoing attack and an effective mitigation near the origin of the attack. This allows reducing the enormous cost of forwarding packets, across multiple domains, which consist mostly of useless amplified attack traffic. To the best of our knowledge, Cochain-SC is the first scheme that proposes to deal with both intra-domain and inter-domain DDoS attacks mitigation combining SDN, blockchain and smart contract. The implementation of Cochain-SC is deployed on Ethereum official test network Ropsten. Moreover, we conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed approach; the experimental results show that Cochain-SC achieves flexibility, efficiency, security, cost effectiveness, and high accuracy in detecting illegitimate flows, making it a promising approach to mitigate DDoS attacks.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930715","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08771111.pdf","startPage":"98893","endPage":"98907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cochain-SC: An Intra- and Inter-Domain Ddos Mitigation Scheme Based on Blockchain Using SDN and Smart Contract","topic":"Advanced Software and Data Engineering for Secure Societies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Cochain-SC: An Intra- and Inter-Domain Ddos Mitigation Scheme Based on Blockchain Using SDN and Smart Contract","volume":"7","dateOfInsertion":"02 August 2019","accessionNumber":"18862633","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","htmlLink":"/document/8771111/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771111/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Cochain-SC: An Intra- and Inter-Domain Ddos Mitigation Scheme Based on Blockchain Using SDN and Smart Contract","sourcePdf":"access-abouelhouda-2930715-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079344S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8600701","topics":["Advanced Software and Data Engineering for Secure Societies"],"articleId":"8771111","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8771114,"authors":[{"name":"Chiung-An Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ming Chi University of Technology, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8771114/cchen-2930818-small.gif","p":["Chiung-An Chen received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Chung Yuan Christian University, Zhongli, Taoyuan, Taiwan, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2013.

In order to achieve high performance, low complexity and low memory requirement, a novel lossless CFA image compression algorithm based on JPEG-LS is proposed for the VLSI implementation. A previous study showed the usage of a context table with its memory consuming more than 81% of the chip area for a JPEG-LS encoder design. The proposed algorithm implements a JPEG-LS-based lossless image compression algorithm that eliminates the use of the context technique and its memory in order to reduce the chip area while still maintaining its high performance. The proposed algorithm includes a pixel restoration, an adaptive Golomb-Rice parameter prediction and an improved Golomb-Rice coding technique. This paper was realized using a 0.18\u03bc m CMOS process with synthesized gate counts and core area of 4.8 k and 57,625\u03bcm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, respectively. The synthesized operating frequency of this design reached 200 MHz by using a pipeline scheduling technique. Compared with the previous JPEG-LS-based designs, this paper reduced the gate count to at least 28% and increased the average compression ratio by over 17.15% using the video endoscopy images from the Gastro Gastroenterologist Hospital.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lossless CFA Image Compression Chip Design for Wireless Capsule Endoscopy","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930818","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08771114.pdf","startPage":"107047","endPage":"107057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771114","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771114/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"Lossless CFA Image Compression Chip Design for Wireless Capsule Endoscopy","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8771114/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18897501","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST-107-2218-E-131-002, MOST-107-2221-E-033-057, MOST-107-2622-E-033-002-CC2, MOST-107-2622-E-131-007-CC3, MOST-106-2622-E-033-014-CC2, MOST-106-2221-E-033-072 and MOST-106-2119-M-033-001"},{"fundingName":"National Chip Implementation Center, Taiwan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Lossless CFA Image Compression Chip Design for Wireless Capsule Endoscopy","sourcePdf":"access-chen-2930818-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.200843S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8771114","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8771117,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Mei","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Smart Grid Technology and Equipment, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8771117/mei-2930748-small.gif","p":["Jun Mei (M\u201912) was born in Huai\u2019an, Jiangsu, China, in 1971.

These target decomposition features play an important role in terrain classification but completely utilizing them produces a high computational complexity. Furthermore, some features have a negative impact on the classification task. Therefore, selecting the appropriate amount of high-quality features is of great significance to the classification task. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based feature selection algorithm for PolSAR image classification. First, we design a 1-D CNN for feature selection, then train the designed network with all the decomposition features to obtain a trained model. Second, the Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) between different features is utilized as a standard to select feature subsets. Third, feature subsets with excellent performance form the final results. Due to the special structure of the 1-D CNN, repetitively training model is avoided when the input changes. Different from traditional feature selection methods, our method considers the performance of features combination rather than single feature contribution. To this end, the feature subsets selected by the proposed method are more useful to the classification task. Innovatively introducing KLD in the selection stage avoids random selection and improves the selection efficiency. Finally, we validate the performance of selected feature subsets in traditional and deep learning classification frameworks.

UAVs in the same subset are contending for access and transmission, while each subset is allotted a slot based on adaptive time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme. As a multi-channel system, a novel channel allocation algorithm is presented for subset relay transmission period to optimize the performance of networks. The UAV returning period for charging is utilized in the protocol to enhance the transmission throughput and mitigate delay.

We execute AC-4 tests and acquire voltage and current waveforms during breaking processes. For every waveform, we extract signals within a period in which the breaking arc occurs. Extracted three-phase signals of every breaking operation are reformed to a 32 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 6 example. We also measure the accumulated mass loss of the contacts to represent the electrical endurance condition and label the examples according to the mass loss proportion. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed to build prediction models. Both a LeNet5-like CNN structure (CNN-A) and an improved CNN structure (CNN-B) with 3-D convolution layers are implemented to train classification and regression models. Experimental results show that CNN-B for classification achieves the best prediction accuracy. Then, a voting mechanism is utilized for accuracy improvement and achieves the prediction accuracy of 82.14% for ten classes and 90.98% for five classes. Especially, the accuracy is over 90% for the last classes, which represent the ending condition of electrical endurance. Therefore, it is proven that the method can be utilized to predict electrical endurance for the AC-4 condition.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2019.2930741","startPage":"1785","endPage":"1793","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2019.2930741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8874597","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503870/8874597/08771146.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional Neural Networks for Electrical Endurance Prediction of Alternating Current Contactors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771146/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Convolutional Neural Networks for Electrical Endurance Prediction of Alternating Current Contactors","volume":"9","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/8771146/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19080908","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51507113"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"LQ16E070004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional Neural Networks for Electrical Endurance Prediction of Alternating Current Contactors","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-wu-2930741-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10687S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"8874597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8874597","articleId":"8771146","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8771151,"authors":[{"name":"Meysam Gheisarnejad","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Meysam","lastName":"Gheisarnejad","id":"37086841148"},{"name":"Hooman Mohammadi-Moghadam","affiliation":["Shiraz University of Technology, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Hooman","lastName":"Mohammadi-Moghadam","id":"37088227705"},{"name":"Jalil Boudjadar","affiliation":["Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jalil","lastName":"Boudjadar","orcid":"0000-0003-1442-4907","id":"37086073164"},{"name":"Mohammad Hassan Khooban","affiliation":["Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"],"firstName":"Mohammad Hassan","lastName":"Khooban","orcid":"0000-0003-0223-4081","id":"38517425000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-8184"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-9234"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7816"}],"articleNumber":"8771151","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":443},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems Council","url":"http://www.ieeesystemscouncil.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microgrids","Frequency control","Load modeling","Wind turbines","Power system stability","Switches","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","frequency control","fuzzy control","fuzzy set theory","harmonic distortion","load (electric)","maximum power point trackers","power distribution control","power distribution faults","power generation control","power system simulation","reactive power control","turbogenerators","wind power plants","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["islanded microgrid","nonlinear load","reactive power","nondispatchable distributed generation","power fluctuation source","maximum power point tracking","wind turbine generator","active power-frequency droop control","self-frequency recovery control","SI-IT2-FI controller","P-f droop control","active power sharing","total harmonic distortion","software-in-the-loop real-time simulation","dSPACE 1202 board","single input interval type-2 fuzzy integral controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active power sharing","islanded microgrid","self-frequency recovery","single input interval type-2 fuzzy integral (SI-IT2-FI) controller"]}],"abstract":"This paper discusses the effect of nonlinear loads of some equipment on the islanded microgrids. The nonlinear load with active and reactive power is considered, which highly threatens the stability of the microgrids. Moreover, a wind turbine, which is a nondispatchable distributed generation (DG), is included as a power fluctuation source in the microgrid. The maximum power point tracking is integrated to ensure that the wind turbine generator operates at its maximum power level. In order to enable efficient power sharing among DG units, active power-frequency droop control is adopted for a microgrid with three DG units. In particular, a single input interval type-2 fuzzy integral (SI-IT2-FI) controller is implemented for the self-frequency recovery control of the microgrid to restore the frequency deviation within the desired range from its nominal value. In this way, by varying an adjustable design parameter which shapes the footprint of uncertainty, the SI-IT2-FI controller with different control surfaces generation is developed. In order to ascertain the efficiency of the SI-IT2-FI controller, the output responses in the absence and presence of wind turbine are compared with the P-f droop control. Total harmonic distortion is adopted as the harmonic metric to investigate the impact of the nonlinear loads at the test microgrid. Finally, in order to ascertain the feasibility and applicability of the proposed technique, a software-in-the-loop real-time simulation using dSPACE 1202 board is carried out. The simulation outcomes of the islanded microgrid confirm the efficiency of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2019.2927112","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/9020228/08771151.pdf","startPage":"1058","endPage":"1068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2019.2927112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9020228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Power Sharing and Frequency Recovery Control in an Islanded Microgrid With Nonlinear Load and Nondispatchable DG","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771151/","displayDocTitle":"Active Power Sharing and Frequency Recovery Control in an Islanded Microgrid With Nonlinear Load and Nondispatchable DG","volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2020","accessionNumber":"19428528","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8771151/","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Power Sharing and Frequency Recovery Control in an Islanded Microgrid With Nonlinear Load and Nondispatchable DG","sourcePdf":"jsyst-khooban-2927112-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106454S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"9020228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"9020228","articleId":"8771151","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8771158,"authors":[{"name":"Anik Islam","affiliation":["Kumoh National Institute of Technology, Gumi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8771158/islam-2930774-small.gif","p":["Anik Islam was born in 1992.

Before initiating data acquisition, the UAV swarm shares a shared key with the IoT devices in order to maintain communications. However, prior to transmitting data, the IoT devices encrypt the data and forward it to the UAV swarm. Upon receiving the data, the UAV swarm implements a two-phase validation utilizing the \u03c0-hash bloom filter and the digital signature algorithm to validate the sender; in addition, prior to forwarding data to the nearest server, it performs encryption. However, before adding data in blockchain, consent from all validators is required. Finally, the data are stored in blockchain with the approval of validators. A security analysis is performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is manifested through the implementation and simulation. The security analysis and the performance results show that UAV assist the IoT devices both in terms of connectivity and energy consumption, and provides security against the threats mentioned in the paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771158/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","volume":"7","accessionNumber":"18880360","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2019","publicationDate":"2019","htmlLink":"/document/8771158/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"BUS: A Blockchain-Enabled Data Acquisition Scheme With the Assistance of UAV Swarm in Internet of Things","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"MSIT (Ministry of Science, ICT), Korea"},{"fundingName":"ITRC","grantNumber":"IITP-2019-2014-1-00639"},{"fundingName":"IITP (Institute for Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"BUS: A Blockchain-Enabled Data Acquisition Scheme With the Assistance of UAV Swarm in Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"access-shin-2930774-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155241S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8771158","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8771159,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Feng","orcid":"0000-0002-3569-8782","id":"37085355706"},{"name":"Jianan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jianan","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-3536-5777","id":"37085370498"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-1353-0444","id":"37085636945"},{"name":"Zhihao Zhao","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Zhihao","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085633913"},{"name":"Jing Jin","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Jin","id":"37085869343"},{"name":"Qi-Jun Zhang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Qi-Jun","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0001-7852-5331","id":"37275873300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"8771159","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":448},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Strain","Sensitivity","Integrated circuit modeling","Finite element analysis","Microwave circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","equivalent circuits","mesh generation","microwave devices","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fine-mesh space mapping","electromagnetic optimization","coarse model","equivalent circuit coarse models","fine-mesh SM technique","coarse-mesh EM optimization","coarse-mesh EM sensitivities","SM optimization","EM optimization","coarse-mesh EM responses","new coarse-mesh SM technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coarse mesh","electromagnetic (EM) optimization","mesh deformation","microwave component","space mapping (SM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771159","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2019.2927113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","abstract":"Space mapping (SM) is a recognized method for speeding up electromagnetic (EM) optimization. The SM technique often requires an equivalent circuit as the coarse model. In practical cases, equivalent circuit coarse models are not always available. This letter addresses this situation and proposes a new coarse- and fine-mesh SM technique for EM optimization incorporating mesh deformation. By incorporating mesh deformation into coarse-mesh EM optimization, the coarse-mesh EM responses change continuously as the values of the geometrical design variables change. The incorporation of mesh deformation also improves the consistency between the coarse-mesh EM sensitivities and the changes in the coarse-mesh EM responses. This results in the speedup of the coarse-mesh EM optimization and potentially less SM iterations, therefore accelerating the overall SM optimization. This technique is illustrated by two microwave examples.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2019.2927113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8790637","startPage":"510","endPage":"512","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/8790637/08771159.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coarse- and Fine-Mesh Space Mapping for EM Optimization Incorporating Mesh Deformation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771159/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8771159/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Coarse- and Fine-Mesh Space Mapping for EM Optimization Incorporating Mesh Deformation","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"18884447","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"8","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"RGPIN-2017-06420"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coarse- and Fine-Mesh Space Mapping for EM Optimization Incorporating Mesh Deformation","sourcePdf":"lmwc-zhang-2927113-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061644S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"8790637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8790637","articleId":"8771159","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8771165,"authors":[{"name":"Vikas Kumar","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Patna, Patna, India","Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, Patna, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/9020228/8771165/kumar-2923549-small.gif","p":["Vikas Kumar (M\u201910) received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Institution of Engineers, Kolkata, India, in 2003, the M.Tech. degree in very large scale integration (VLSI) and computer-aided design from Thapar University, Patiala, India, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Patna, Patna, India, in 2017.","He is currently an SDE-in-Charge with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, Patna.

However, real-time hardware realization of multicarrier systems is limited by a large number of arithmetic units for inverse fast Fourier transform and pulse-shaping filters. In this paper, we aim to propose a low-complexity and reconfigurable architecture for a baseband UFMC transmitter. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed architecture is the first reconfigurable architecture that has the flexibility to choose the number of subcarriers in a subband without any change in hardware resources. In addition, the proposed architecture selects the filter from a group of filters with a single selection line. Moreover, we use a commercially available field-programmable gate array device for real-time testing and analyzing the baseband UFMC signal. From the extensive experiments, we study the occupied bandwidth, main-lobe power, and sidelobe power of the baseband signal with different filters in real-time scenarios. Finally, we measure the quantization error in baseband signal generation for the proposed UFMC transmitter architecture and find comparable with the error bound.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771165/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","volume":"14","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"19428494","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2020","publicationDate":"March 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8771165/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable Architecture of UFMC Transmitter for 5G and Its FPGA Prototype","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable Architecture of UFMC Transmitter for 5G and Its FPGA Prototype","sourcePdf":"jsyst-lloretmauri-2923549-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144103S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"9020228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"9020228","articleId":"8771165","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8771176,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Huang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/9210948/8771176/liang-2928811-small.gif","p":["Liang Huang (M'16) received the BEng degree in communications engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2009, and the PhD degree in information engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2013.

In this paper, we consider a wireless powered MEC network that adopts a binary offloading policy, so that each computation task of wireless devices (WDs) is either executed locally or fully offloaded to an MEC server. Our goal is to acquire an online algorithm that optimally adapts task offloading decisions and wireless resource allocations to the time-varying wireless channel conditions. This requires quickly solving hard combinatorial optimization problems within the channel coherence time, which is hardly achievable with conventional numerical optimization methods. To tackle this problem, we propose a Deep Reinforcement learning-based Online Offloading (DROO) framework that implements a deep neural network as a scalable solution that learns the binary offloading decisions from the experience. It eliminates the need of solving combinatorial optimization problems, and thus greatly reduces the computational complexity especially in large-size networks. To further reduce the complexity, we propose an adaptive procedure that automatically adjusts the parameters of the DROO algorithm on the fly. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance while significantly decreasing the computation time by more than an order of magnitude compared with existing optimization methods. For example, the CPU execution latency of DROO is less than 0.1 second in a 30-user network, making real-time and optimal offloading truly viable even in a fast fading environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771176/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 1 2020","volume":"19","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"20022248","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2020","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8771176/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Deep Reinforcement Learning for Online Computation Offloading in Wireless Powered Mobile-Edge Computing Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871271"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LY19F020033"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Province Pearl River Scholar Funding Scheme 2018"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010226","fundingName":"Department of Education of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2017KTSCX163"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Shenzhen City","grantNumber":"JCYJ20170818101824392"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Innovation Commission of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"827/000212"},{"fundingName":"General Research Funding","grantNumber":"14209414 and 14208107"},{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of Hong Kong"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Reinforcement Learning for Online Computation Offloading in Wireless Powered Mobile-Edge Computing Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-bi-2928811-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.216308S","chronDate":"Nov. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"9210948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"9210948","articleId":"8771176","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8771183,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Haschke","affiliation":["Photovoltaics and Thin-Film Electronics Laboratory, Institute of Microengineering, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503869/8809931/8771183/hasch-2924389-small.gif","p":["Jan Haschke received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany, in 2014.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Engineer with the Photovoltaics and Thin-Film Electronics Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland.

To solve CC-OPF, we often need access to the (true) joint probability distribution of all uncertainties, which is rarely known in practice. A solution based on a biased estimate of the distribution can result in poor reliability. To overcome this challenge, recent work has explored distributionally robust chance constraints, in which the chance constraints are satisfied over a family of distributions called the ambiguity set. Commonly, ambiguity sets are only based on moment information (e.g., mean and covariance) of the random variables; however, specifying additional characteristics of the random variables reduces conservatism and cost. Here, we consider ambiguity sets that additionally incorporate unimodality information. In practice, it is difficult to estimate the mode location from the data and so we allow it to be potentially misspecified. We formulate the problem and derive a separation-based algorithm to efficiently solve it. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on a modified IEEE-30 bus network with wind uncertainty and compare it with other distributionally robust approaches. We find that a misspecified mode significantly affects the reliability of the solution, and the proposed model demonstrates a good tradeoff between cost and reliability.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6509490/8842573/8771187-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771187/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8771187/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2019","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"18991636","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributionally Robust Chance-Constrained Optimal Power Flow Assuming Unimodal Distributions With Misspecified Modes","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1442495 and CMMI-1662774"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Distributionally Robust Chance-Constrained Optimal Power Flow Assuming Unimodal Distributions With Misspecified Modes","sourcePdf":"tcns-li-2930872-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143381S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6509490","isNumber":"8842573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6509490","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8842573","articleId":"8771187","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":8771206,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangyu Zhang","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiangyu","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-4858-5429","id":"37086274144"},{"name":"Zhanqing Yu","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhanqing","lastName":"Yu","orcid":"0000-0002-2705-6595","id":"37402462100"},{"name":"Zhengyu Chen","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhengyu","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-0487-5037","id":"37086279892"},{"name":"Biao Zhao","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Biao","lastName":"Zhao","orcid":"0000-0001-9956-724X","id":"38244200600"},{"name":"Rong Zeng","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Zeng","orcid":"0000-0002-4514-605X","id":"37276100900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"8771206","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":897},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Standards","Snubbers","RLC circuits","Oscillators","Semiconductor diodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC circuit breaker","diode bridge","solid-state switch","standard recovery diode"]}],"abstract":"At present, it is usually necessary to use fast recovery type diodes to cooperate with the fast switching actions of fully controlled devices such as insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs). However, the specific nature of the working conditions of the diode-bridge bidirectional solid-state switch (DBSS) provides an opportunity to apply standard recovery diodes for this purpose, which helps to reduce the cost of the bidirectional switch. This letter presents the self-oscillation phenomenon that is caused by the recovery processes of the diodes in a DBSS. Then, the recovery effects of these diodes in different topologies are analyzed from the perspective of the DBSS and optimized designs for both the snubber circuit and the energy-absorbing circuit are proposed. A 500-kV dc breaker is realized based on the proposed DBBS using the standard recovery diodes, which can work reliably with IGBTs, and the cost of the resulting dc circuit breakers is greatly reduced.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2019.2930739","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8903439/08771206.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2019.2930739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8903439","startPage":"1165","endPage":"1170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Design of Diode-Bridge Bidirectional Solid-State Switch Using Standard Recovery Diodes for 500-kV High-Voltage DC Breaker","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Design of Diode-Bridge Bidirectional Solid-State Switch Using Standard Recovery Diodes for 500-kV High-Voltage DC Breaker","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771206/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8771206/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2018YFB0904603"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51837006"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Design of Diode-Bridge Bidirectional Solid-State Switch Using Standard Recovery Diodes for 500-kV High-Voltage DC Breaker","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2930739-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05874S","chronDate":"Feb.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8903439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8903439","articleId":"8771206","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8771210,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofang Pan","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8771210/pan-2930804-small.gif","p":["Xiaofang Pan (S\u201912\u2013M\u201916) received the B.Eng. degree in electronic science and engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2015.

The recognition accuracies of the previous implementations are always constrained by the limited feature or dynamic information extracted from the short transient gas response curves. In order to address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach with both convolutional and recurrent neural networks combined, which is based on the long short-term memory module. Featuring the capability of learning the correlations of time-series data, the proposed deep learning method is well-suited for extracting the valuable transient feature contained in the very beginning of the response curve. As a result, within a response time as short as 0.5 s, the proposed implementation is capable of recognizing the gas species with an accuracy of 84.06%. In addition, the aforesaid accuracy can be further improved by increasing the response time with the step of 0.5 s. According to our extensive experimental results, the recognition accuracy can be elevated up to 98.28% at the response time of 4 s, where it typically needs 40 s for the response curve to achieve saturation. The reported accuracy dramatically outperforms the previous algorithms, including gradient tree boosting (GTB), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Moreover, various standard drift related experiments are conducted, of which the results validate our proposed algorithm's superior robustness for the wide range of real-life applications.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930804","startPage":"100954","endPage":"100963","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08771210.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast and Robust Gas Recognition Algorithm Based on Hybrid Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Convolutional codes","Recurrent neural networks","Data mining","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemical engineering computing","electronic noses","feature extraction","flammability","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust gas recognition algorithm","recurrent neural network","flammable gas species","toxic gas species","short response time","gas sensing devices","recognition accuracy","short transient gas response curves","short-term memory module","time-series data","deep learning method","valuable transient feature","response curve","hybrid convolutional-recurrent neural networks","dynamic information extraction","time 0.5 s","time 4.0 s","time 40.0 s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electronic nose","fast gas recognition","long short-term memory","drift counteraction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771210/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"A Fast and Robust Gas Recognition Algorithm Based on Hybrid Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Network","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8771210/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2019","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18880340","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Kongque Technology Innovation Foundation of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"KQJSCX20170727101037551 and KQJSCX20180328093500762"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Foundation of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"JCYJ20170818101906654 and JCYJ20160427174443407"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Fast and Robust Gas Recognition Algorithm Based on Hybrid Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Network","sourcePdf":"access-zhao-2930804-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136386S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8771210","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8771214,"authors":[{"name":"Bruna G.

A particular application which has in part motivated this research is the use of UAV in wide area search and surveillance operations in unstructured outdoor environments.

In this letter, we propose an end-to-end multi-task regression-based learning approach capable of defining flight commands for navigation and exploration under the forest canopy, regardless of the presence of trails or additional sensors (i.e., GPS). Training and testing are performed using a software in the loop pipeline, which allows for a detailed evaluation against state-of-the-art pose estimation techniques. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach excels in performing dense exploration within the required search perimeter, is capable of covering wider search regions, generalises to previously unseen and unexplored environments and outperforms contemporary state-ofthe-art techniques.","doi":"10.1109/LRA.2019.2930496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7083369/8764082/08771214.pdf","startPage":"4116","endPage":"4123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2019.2930496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8764082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Task Regression-Based Learning for Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Flight Control Within Unstructured Outdoor Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771214/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Task Regression-Based Learning for Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Flight Control Within Unstructured Outdoor Environments","volume":"4","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","accessionNumber":"18893434","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8771214/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"1750094"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Task Regression-Based Learning for Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Flight Control Within Unstructured Outdoor Environments","sourcePdf":"lra-macielpearson-2930496-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090999S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7083369","isNumber":"8764082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7083369","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8764082","articleId":"8771214","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8771220,"authors":[{"name":"Jinghong Tan","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Product Development, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8840987/8771220/tan-2930723-small.gif","p":["Jinghong Tan (S\u201919) received the B.E. degree in communication engineering from Shandong University, Shandong, China, in 2014.

With the imperfect channel state information, we aim to maximize the worst-case energy efficiency (EE), which is defined as the ratio of the sum of worst-case group rates to the total power consumption of the network. The formulated problems for both strategies are non-convex and challenging to solve. In order to find the solutions, we develop a two-layer iterative algorithm that recast the formulated problems as a series of convex quadratic matrix inequality problems which can be solved by the generated Augmented Lagrangian method. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is proved via both analytical and simulated ways, and the effectiveness of them on improving EE is also validated. Moreover, through the comparison of the two transmission strategies considered, we find that the compression strategy can achieve higher worst-case EE than the data-sharing strategy in most scenarios, except for the case with low rate requirement in small-size network. Our conclusions can be used as meaningful references for the practical system design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771220/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","volume":"68","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"18991479","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8771220/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2019","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Energy Efficiency Maximization in Multicast Downlink C-RAN","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"SUTD-ZJU Research Collaboration","grantNumber":"SUTD-ZJU/RES/01/2016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61801244"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20180754"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Energy Efficiency Maximization in Multicast Downlink C-RAN","sourcePdf":"tvt-quek-2930723-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110285S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8840987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8840987","articleId":"8771220","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8771231,"authors":[{"name":"Yuzhen Niu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Spatial Data Mining and Information Sharing, Ministry of Education, Fuzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8771231/niu-2930707-small.gif","p":["Yuzhen Niu received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Shandong University, China, in 2010.

In this paper, we present an index for both no-reference 2D and 3D IQA. We propose to transform the IQA task into a task of quality comparison between images. By generating image pairs, the amount of training data reaches the square of the original amount of data, effectively solving the lacking of training samples. We also propose a learning to rank model using Siamese convolutional neural networks (LRSN) for quality comparison. The presented LRSN has two branches that have the same structure, share weights with each other, and take two image patches as inputs. The goal of LRSN is learning to rank the quality scores between the two input image patches. The relative quality score of a test image is obtained by first comparing its image patches with many image patches of other images and counts the number of times that its image patches are ranked superior to other patches. The experimental results on three 2D (LIVE, CSIQ, and TID2013) and three 3D (LIVE 3D Phase-I, LIVE 3D Phase-II, and NBU) IQA databases demonstrate that the proposed LRSN model works well for both 2D and 3D IQA and outperforms the state-of-the-art no-reference 2D and 3D IQA metrics.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930707","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08771231.pdf","startPage":"101583","endPage":"101595","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Siamese-Network-Based Learning to Rank for No-Reference 2D and 3D Image Quality Assessment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"Siamese-Network-Based Learning to Rank for No-Reference 2D and 3D Image Quality Assessment","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8771231/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18880427","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771231/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61672158 and 61502105"},{"fundingName":"Technology Guidance Project of Fujian Province","grantNumber":"2017H0015"},{"fundingName":"Industry-Academy Cooperation Project","grantNumber":"2017H6008"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003392","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province","grantNumber":"2019J02006 and 2018J01795"},{"fundingName":"Fujian Collaborative Innovation Center for Big Data Application in Governments"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Siamese-Network-Based Learning to Rank for No-Reference 2D and 3D Image Quality Assessment","sourcePdf":"access-niu-2930707-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138679S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8771231","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8771232,"authors":[{"name":"Zi-Wei Pei","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education of Design and Electromagnetic Compatibility of High Speed Electronic System, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"p":["Zi-Wei Pei was born in 1993.

Therefore, in this paper, a novel robust adaptive wideband beamformer based on the time-frequency distribution is proposed, which can achieve high output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio close to the optimal one even with perturbed array manifold and limited snapshots. It transforms the received signal into the time-frequency domain, and gives a method to select the single-source points of wideband signals. With the single-source points, it reconstructs the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix and estimates the steering vector without using the imprecise prior information about the array manifold, guaranteeing high estimation accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other adaptive wideband beamformers, and achieves excellent output performance over a broad range of direction and sensor position errors even with small number of snapshots.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2019.2929924","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8764374/08771237.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8764374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2019.2929924","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"4370","endPage":"4382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Adaptive Wideband Beamforming Based on Time Frequency Distribution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.15, 15 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Robust Adaptive Wideband Beamforming Based on Time Frequency Distribution","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771237/","volume":"67","issue":"16","htmlLink":"/document/8771237/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Aug.15, 2019","accessionNumber":"18881109","dateOfInsertion":"02 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401469"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Adaptive Wideband Beamforming Based on Time Frequency Distribution","sourcePdf":"tsp-hu-2929924-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094999S","chronDate":"Aug.15, 15 2019","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8764374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8764374","articleId":"8771237","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8771245,"authors":[{"name":"Weina Han","affiliation":["Laser Micro/Nano Fabrication Laboratory, School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weina","lastName":"Han","orcid":"0000-0001-7703-2957","id":"37086933426"},{"name":"Dongfang Li","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering Research Center of Applied Laser Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dongfang","lastName":"Li","id":"37086935349"},{"name":"Furong Liu","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering Research Center of Applied Laser Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Furong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086936144"},{"name":"Yanping Yuan","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering Research Center of Applied Laser Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanping","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37347079200"},{"name":"Xiaowei Li","affiliation":["Laser Micro/Nano Fabrication Laboratory, School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Li","id":"37086938593"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"8771245","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":331},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"","type":"graphic","fileSize":"218 KB","file":"/ielx7/4563994/8745542/8771245/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2930801.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/4563994/8745542/8771245/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2930801.jpg"},"abstract":"We demonstrate the feasibility to control the confined electromagnetic field by surface plasmon poloritons (SPPs) excitation and scattering modulation based on the pre-processed Au nanostructures under the irradiation of single-shot femtosecond (fs) laser pulse, and then to control the surface tension-induced molten Si transport due to the directed lateral temperature profile, thus resulting in the formation of Si nanostructures. Annular-shaped fs laser pulse is employed based on nonlinear optical effect of frequency-doubling process to imprint Au planar nanostructures with various morphologies. Because surface plasmon polaritons can be easily excited and controlled on planar nanostructures of noble metals, the localized electromagnetic field can be effectively modulated by controlling the metallic nanostructures. Thus, the quasi-plasmonic Au nanostructures act as precursors for controlling the subsequent electromagnetic field by fs laser irradiation. Upon irradiation of pre-processed Au nanostructures, confined electromagnetic field induces a specific surface tension profile, causing directional transport of molten Si. After solidification, Si nanostructures of controllable morphologies can be fabricated. Simulation results are in agreement with the theoretical mechanism. Moreover, further optimized modulation of nanodome can be achieved by controlling the focus spot control combined with the polarization state control. This paper provides an effective method for enabling a scalable formation of Si nanostructures.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/8745542/08771245.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2930801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2930801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8745542","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Controllable Formation of Si Nanostructures Based on Quasi-Plasmonic Planar Nanostructures Formed by Annular-Shaped Femtosecond Laser Pulse","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nanostructures","Silicon","Gold","Lasers","Morphology","Electromagnetic fields","Surface morphology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elemental semiconductors","gold","high-speed optical techniques","laser beam effects","metallic thin films","nanofabrication","nanostructured materials","plasmonics","semiconductor growth","silicon","solidification","surface plasmon polaritons","surface tension"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surface tension profile","quasiplasmonic planar nanostructures","pre-processed nanostructures","surface tension-induced molten transport","nonlinear optical effect","frequency-doubling process","solidification","polarization state control","focus spot control","controllable morphologies","quasiplasmonic Au nanostructures","metallic nanostructures","localized electromagnetic field","surface plasmon polaritons","scattering modulation","confined electromagnetic field","annular-shaped femtosecond laser pulse","Si","Au"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Annular-shaped femtosecond laser","surface plasmon polaritons","planar metallic nanostructure","Si nanostructures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771245/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Controllable Formation of Si Nanostructures Based on Quasi-Plasmonic Planar Nanostructures Formed by Annular-Shaped Femtosecond Laser Pulse","volume":"11","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8771245/","impactStatement":"The emerging field of steering SPPs on a metallic structure in nanometer scale opens up many possibilities in manipulating SPPs with high precision.

The platform applies data mining techniques to tackle effectively the security issues in high load communication networks. The platform uses a combination of linear and learning algorithms combined with protocol analyzer. The linear algorithms filter and extract distinctive attributes and features of the cyber-attacks while the learning algorithms use these attributes and features to identify new types of cyber-attacks. The protocol analyzer in this platform classifies and filters vulnerable protocols to avoid unnecessary computation load. The use of linear algorithms in conjunction with learning algorithms and protocol analyzer allows the HADM to achieve improved efficiency in terms of accuracy and computation time to detect cyber-attacks over existing solutions. While authors' previous paper evaluated HADM efficiency (accuracy and computation time) against related studies, this paper, concentrates on HADM robustness and scalability. For this purpose, five datasets, including ISCX-2012, UNSW-NB15 Jan, UNSW-NB15 Feb, ISCX-2017, and MAWILab-2018, with various size and diverse attacks have been used. Different feature selection methods are applied to find the best features. The feature selection methods are selected based on the algorithms' computation time and detection rate. The best algorithms are then selected through a benchmark on applied datasets and based on the metrics such as cross-entropy loss, precision, recall, and computation time. The result of HADM platform shows robustness and scalability against datasets with different size and diverse attacks.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930832","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08771247.pdf","startPage":"100964","endPage":"100978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of a Combined Anomaly Detection Platform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771247","topic":"Artificial Intelligence in CyberSecurity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771247/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of a Combined Anomaly Detection Platform","volume":"7","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18880546","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8771247/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Performance Evaluation of a Combined Anomaly Detection Platform","sourcePdf":"access-monshizadeh-2930832-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120465S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8600701","topics":["Artificial Intelligence in CyberSecurity"],"articleId":"8771247","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8771248,"authors":[{"name":"Yan-Yan Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yan-Yan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086993417"},{"name":"Yong-Ling Ban","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yong-Ling","lastName":"Ban","orcid":"0000-0002-0226-9738","id":"37427848300"},{"name":"Zaiping Nie","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zaiping","lastName":"Nie","orcid":"0000-0002-9563-4115","id":"37271589400"},{"name":"Chow-Yen-Desmond Sim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Feng Chia University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chow-Yen-Desmond","lastName":"Sim","orcid":"0000-0001-8209-5901","id":"37266406100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"8771248","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":881},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phantoms","Smart glasses","Antenna arrays","Glass","Loaded antennas","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","antenna arrays","channel capacity","impedance matching","Long Term Evolution","loop antennas","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas","UHF antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-loop antenna","4G LTE MIMO smart glasses applications","massive-input-massive-output operation","fourth-generation Long Term Evolution bands","glasses frame","glasses temple region","LTE operations","symmetrical single-loop antenna structures","ergodic channel capacity","envelope correlation coefficient","impedance matching","2 \u00d7 2 MIMO antenna array","noise figure -6.0 dB","frequency 824.0 MHz to 960.0 MHz","frequency 1710.0 MHz to 2690.0 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual-loop antenna","eyewear antenna","fourth-generation Long Term Evolution (4G LTE)","massive-input\u2013massive-output (MIMO)","smart glasses","wearable antenna"]}],"abstract":"A dual-loop antenna with massive-input-massive-output (MIMO) operation within the fourth-generation Long Term Evolution (LTE) bands for smart glasses applications is proposed.

Temperature estimation serves as a basis for motor protection. Developing accurate and real-time temperature calculation algorithms is critical for thermal and overload protection for induction motors. Vibration monitoring is a widely used approach for induction motors' fault diagnosis. Vibration signals are usually analyzed by time-, frequency-, or time-frequency-domain signal processing methods. Recent advancement of fault diagnosis by machine learning makes intelligent approaches feasible. Although decades of efforts have been put on condition monitoring of regular induction motors, electrical submersible motors operating in a very unique downhole environment in the oil industry have not received much attention. Currently, electrical submersible motors rely on downhole monitoring tools to transmit temperature and vibration data measured by sensors from downhole to the surface; however, such data are transmitted at a slow rate, and there are no fault diagnosis algorithms in place. An advanced condition monitoring and fault diagnosis method for electrical submersible motors is needed in the near future. In this paper, a literature review is conducted on temperature estimation and vibration monitoring techniques for induction motors, the state-of-the-art methods are summarized, and their potential application in electrical submersible motors are recommended.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and

Despite the successful standardization of 802.11-based communication protocols in vehicular networks (e.g., 802.11p, 802.11af), there remains an essential issue, which is to adjust the transmission rate and mode to match the highly dynamic channel conditions in vehicular scenarios. In this article, we first investigate the requirements for intelligent link adaptation (LA) in 802.11 V2X, and then present a data-driven learning-based LA architecture that fits the road channel characteristics while capturing the quick variance due to the high mobility of vehicular networks. We also propose a reference model to show how the data-driven model can efficiently catch the channel variance and improve the \u201cdrive-thru Internet\u201d throughput. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges, which should provide significant reference for the development and standardization of the intelligent LA solution in 802.11 V2X networks.","doi":"10.1109/MCOMSTD.2019.1900005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOMSTD.2019.1900005","startPage":"12","endPage":"18","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Standards Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/7886829/8771261/08771313.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Standards Magazine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8771261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Link Adaptation in 802.11 Vehicular Networks: Challenges and Solutions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Link Adaptation in 802.11 Vehicular Networks: Challenges and Solutions","publicationDate":"March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2019","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8771313/","accessionNumber":"18865580","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771313/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Link Adaptation in 802.11 Vehicular Networks: Challenges and Solutions","sourcePdf":"010CHENG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084624S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7886829","isNumber":"8771261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7886829","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8771261","articleId":"8771313","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8771314,"authors":[{"name":"Hasan Ali Khattak","affiliation":["COMSATS University Islamabad"],"bio":{"p":["Hasan Ali Khattak [S' M'15, SM' received his Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering degree from Politecnico di Bari, Italy, in April 2015.

Today's cloud infrastructures are not specifically designed to cope with the requirements presented by promising VANET applications. In this regard, fog computing focuses on moving computational resources toward the edge of the network to cater for these increasing processing and storage requirements. Thus, vehicular fog extends the fog computing paradigm to traditional vehicular networks that consist of several IoT devices. This overcomes the shortcomings of vehicular clouds by enabling ubiquitous vehicles, efficient communication, location-aware service provision, improved response time, and lower latency. This article presents fog-computing-based VANET architecture along with an infotainment application scenario. In the experiments, the cache size of fog nodes has been used as a parameter to evaluate its impact on different performance metrics in the fog-enabled VANET environment. We conclude the article by presenting various benefits of a fog-enabled VANET while investigating future challenges and their potential solutions.","doi":"10.1109/MCOMSTD.2019.1800050","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Standards Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Standards Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/7886829/8771261/08771314.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOMSTD.2019.1800050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8771261","startPage":"19","endPage":"25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating Fog Computing with VANETs: A Consumer Perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Fog Computing with VANETs: A Consumer Perspective","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771314/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18852326","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8771314/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Fog Computing with VANETs: A Consumer Perspective","sourcePdf":"011UDDIN_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068254S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7886829","isNumber":"8771261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7886829","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8771261","articleId":"8771314","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8771320,"authors":[{"name":"Hans Christian Rudolph","affiliation":["T-Systems International GmbH"],"bio":{"p":["Hans Christian Rudolph (Hans-Christian.Rudolph@telekom.de) received his Bachelor of Engineering in computer science and telecommunications from the Hochschule f\u00fcr Telekommunikation Leipzig in 2016.

Several new features and concepts are introduced to the radio interface and the core network in order to enhance the softwarization and virtualization of functional entities in the mobile core network. One of the driving new concepts is the service-based architecture (SBA). Service concepts and technologies are already well established in the area of Internet-based platforms and applications. With the 3GPP 5G SBA, flexible and on-demand service composition - even across organizational boundaries - provides a new level of flexibility and business opportunities to the mobile industry. However, this type of service orientation comes with new security implications that have not been present to their full extent in previous mobile network generations. This article introduces the foundational security concepts and technologies of SBA in 3GPP 5G, focusing mainly on non-roaming scenarios, and discusses security challenges arising from these architectural changes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771320/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","volume":"3","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"18865585","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2019","publicationDate":"March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8771320/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Security Challenges of the 3GPP 5G Service Based Architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security Challenges of the 3GPP 5G Service Based Architecture","sourcePdf":"017KUNZ_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068423S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7886829","isNumber":"8771261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7886829","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8771261","articleId":"8771320","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8771330,"authors":[{"name":"Chak-Wa Pui","affiliation":["CUHK"],"firstName":"Chak-Wa","lastName":"Pui","id":"37085854019"},{"name":"Gang Wu","affiliation":["Synopsys Inc."],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086922039"},{"name":"Freddy Y.

However, with this technique, the delay imposed by the inter-FPGA connections becomes significant. Previous research shows that TDM ratio of signals can greatly affect the performance of a system. In this paper, we extend previous problem formulation to meet more general constraints in multi-FPGA based systems and propose a novel approach to solve it. In particular, to optimize system clock period effectively and efficiently, we propose a two-step analytical framework, which first gives a continuous result using a non-linear conjugate gradient-based method and then finalizes the result optimally by a dynamic programming-based discretization algorithm. For comparison, we also solve the problem using an integer linear programming (ILP)-based method. Experimental results show that our approach can improve the system clock period by about 7% on top of a well optimized inter-FPGA routing result. Moreover, our approach scales for designs over 400K nodes while ILP-based method is not able to finish for designs with 2K nodes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 ACM/IEEE International Workshop on System Level Interconnect Prediction (SLIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766240/8771325/08771330.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2019 ACM/IEEE International Workshop on System Level Interconnect Prediction (SLIP)","doi":"10.1109/SLIP.2019.8771330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLIP.2019.8771330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8771325","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analytical Approach for Time-Division Multiplexing Optimization in Multi-FPGA based Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time division multiplexing","Field programmable gate arrays","Wires","Clocks","Optimization","Routing","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","dynamic programming","field programmable gate arrays","gradient methods","integer programming","linear programming","nonlinear programming","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-division multiplexing optimization","multiFPGA based systems","inter-FPGA signals","inter-FPGA connections","system clock period","nonlinear conjugate gradient-based method","dynamic programming-based discretization algorithm","integer linear programming-based method","ILP-based method","optimized inter-FPGA routing","TDM ratio","system clock period optimization","two-step analytical framework","temperature 400.0 K","temperature 2.0 K"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771330/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 June 2019","displayDocTitle":"An Analytical Approach for Time-Division Multiplexing Optimization in Multi-FPGA based Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8771330/","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18865259","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","conferenceDate":"1-2 June 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analytical Approach for Time-Division Multiplexing Optimization in Multi-FPGA based Systems","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"ChakWa_Pui.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080709S","chronDate":"1-2 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766240","isNumber":"8771325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766240","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8771325","articleId":"8771330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8771331,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086823313"},{"name":"Jacob Abraham","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Abraham","id":"37276152300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2818-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2819-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8771331","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Safety","Phase locked loops","Redundancy","Switches","Physical layer","Quality of service","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error detection","integrated circuit design","network-on-chip","safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Functional Safe NoC","FSNoC","Concurrent Error Detection","high Diagnostic Coverage","NoC network","inter-operable safety mechanisms","safety requirement","industry NoC design","Functional safety","mission-critical systems","power overhead","packet level lock stepping","automotive design","PLLS","high diagnostic coverage","safe network-on-chip design","reduced area overhead","system-on-chip design","performance power area trade-off","PPA trade-off"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NoC","Safety","Concurrent Error Detection"]}],"abstract":"Functional safety is the top priority for the design of automotive and other mission-critical systems.

By exploiting web software vulnerabilities, SQL injection attackers can run arbitrary malicious code on target databases to acquire or compromise sensitive data. Although web application firewalls (WAFs) are offered by most cloud service providers, tenants are reluctant to pay for them, since there are few approaches that can report accurate SQLIA statistics for their deployed services. Traditional WAFs focus on blocking suspicious SQL requests. Few of them can accurately decide whether an attack is really harmful and quickly answer how severe the attack is. To raise the tenants' awareness of the seriousness of SQLIAs, in this paper, we introduce a novel traffic-based SQLIA detection and vulnerability analysis framework named DIAVA, which can proactively send warnings to tenants promptly. By analyzing the bidirectional network traffic of SQL operations and applying our proposed multilevel regular expression model, DIAVA can accurately identify successful SQLIAs among all the suspects. Meanwhile, the severity of such SQLIAs and the vulnerabilities of the corresponding leaked data can be quickly evaluated by DIAVA based on its GPU-based dictionary attack analysis engine. Experimental results show that DIAVA not only outperforms state-of-the-art WAFs in detecting SQLAs from the perspectives of precision and recall, but also enables real-time vulnerability evaluation of leaked data caused by SQL injection.","doi":"10.1109/TR.2019.2925415","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel7/24/9023405/08771368.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9023405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2019.2925415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DIAVA: A Traffic-Based Framework for Detection of SQL Injection Attacks and Vulnerability Analysis of Leaked Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","displayDocTitle":"DIAVA: A Traffic-Based Framework for Detection of SQL Injection Attacks and Vulnerability Analysis of Leaked Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771368/","publicationDate":"March 2020","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2020","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19428476","htmlLink":"/document/8771368/","volume":"69","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013290","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research","grantNumber":"2018YFB2101300"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61872147 and 61802185"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20180470"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DIAVA: A Traffic-Based Framework for Detection of SQL Injection Attacks and Vulnerability Analysis of Leaked Data","sourcePdf":"tr-chen-2925415-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142142S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"9023405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9023405","articleId":"8771368","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8771369,"authors":[{"name":"Pu Wang","affiliation":["School of Instrument Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8771369/wang-2930882-small.gif","p":["Pu Wang was born in Anhui, China, in 1994.

The proposed framework is composed of two models: data augmentation model and classification model. In this framework, data augmentation model is designed to recast a class-balanced training dataset by generating artificial data of minor class. The outputs of augmentation model are transferred into classification model. The classification model is designed to identify abnormalities accurately after training using both the experimental and generated datasets. Data augmentation model is supported by auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (ACGAN). We construct Generator and Discriminator of the ACGAN by stacking multiple 1-dimensional convolutional layers with small kernel size. Dropout function and batch normalization are added to prevent gradients vanish and speed up convergence. In order to evaluate the performance of augmentation model, a set of quantitative indicators are introduced to verify the quality of generated ECG signals.

As imperfect channel state information (CSI) due to channel estimation errors poses problems for most wireless receivers, it presents even greater challenges in successive interference cancellation (SIC) reception of NOMA signals. We present a novel approach to the multi-user detection problem by exploiting the important constraints of forward error correction (FEC) code word. We devise our new receiver based on the minimum output energy (MOE) criterion while preserving a distortionless response to the user equipment (UE) of interest. In particular, we efficiently adopt the UE signatures presented by the FEC channel codes under distinct permutations to separate desired signals of interest from interfering UEs. We formulate our receiver optimization into a quadratic-programming problem anchored with a set of code constraints. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed code-anchored quadratic programming (CQP) receiver can accurately improve SIC performance and provide robustness to CSI errors better than other legacy schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2019.2929386","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8863562/08771371.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2019.2929386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8863562","startPage":"4790","endPage":"4802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Receiver Based on FEC Code Constraints for Uplink NOMA With Imperfect CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771371","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/8863562/8771371-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Receiver Based on FEC Code Constraints for Uplink NOMA With Imperfect CSI","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771371/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","accessionNumber":"19115242","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8771371/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"107-2622-8-009-020, 107-2218-E-009-047 and 107-2221-E-009-058-MY3"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1711823"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Enhanced Receiver Based on FEC Code Constraints for Uplink NOMA With Imperfect CSI","sourcePdf":"twc-feng-2929386-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107494S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8863562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8863562","articleId":"8771371","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8771373,"authors":[{"name":"Hongru Ren","affiliation":["School of Automation and Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Decision and Cooperative Control, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8998597/8771373/ren-2928241-small.gif","p":["Hongru Ren received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees in control science and engineering from the Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2013 and 2019, respectively.","He is currently working with the School of Automation and Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Decision and Cooperative Control, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.

Together with zero-order holder, the aperiodic sampled-data control law is utilized. Compared with the traditional periodic sampled-data control method, this approach demonstrates more greater flexibility. Adopting input delay approach, the initial sampled-data system is remodeled by continuous time system involving time-varying delays in the control signals. For the purpose of designing the sampling controllers suffering constant delays, an updated Lyapunov functional is developed from the augmentation of Wirtinger's inequality. Such a Lyapunov functional results in efficient and simplified synchronization conditions. A sufficient condition for synchronizability of network systems is set up. Then, for the case of unstable systems with some constant delays, a fresh discretized Lyapunov functional is introduced. Finally, we utilize the numerical simulation outcomes to prove the efficacy and advantage of our algorithm. Moreover, based on the network unmanned ground vehicle systems, the experiment results in a real scenario are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed synchronization scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2019.2928241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2019.2928241","startPage":"4980","endPage":"4990","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8998597/08771373.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8998597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization of Network Systems via Aperiodic Sampled-Data Control With Constant Delay and Application to Unmanned Ground Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2020","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization of Network Systems via Aperiodic Sampled-Data Control With Constant Delay and Application to Unmanned Ground Vehicles","publicationDate":"June 2020","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2020","volume":"67","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8771373/","accessionNumber":"19362866","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771373/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1700400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1611262 and 61425009"},{"fundingName":"Innovative Research Team Program of Guangdong Province Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2018B030312006"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2017FZA5010"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012245","fundingName":"Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2017B010116006"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization of Network Systems via Aperiodic Sampled-Data Control With Constant Delay and Application to Unmanned Ground Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tie-lu-2928241-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09195S","chronDate":"June  2020","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8998597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8998597","articleId":"8771373","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8771378,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Veres","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/9151912/8771378/veres-2929020-small.gif","p":["Matthew Veres received the M.A.Sc. degree in engineering: systems and computing from the University of Guelph in 2016.

Many exhibit both spatial and temporal characteristics, at varying scales, under varying conditions brought on by external sources such as social events, holidays, and the weather. Yet, modeling the interplay of factors, devising generalized representations, and subsequently using them to solve a particular problem can be a challenging task. These situations represent only a fraction of the difficulties faced by modern intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In this paper, we present a survey that highlights the role modeling techniques within the realm of deep learning have played within ITS.

To perform cross-modal retrieval, existing approaches typically learn a common semantic space from a labeled source set and directly produce common representations in the learned space for the instances in a target set. These methods commonly require that the instances of both two sets share the same classes. Intuitively, they may not generalize well on a more practical scenario of zero-shot cross-modal retrieval, that is, the instances of the target set contain unseen classes that have inconsistent semantics with the seen classes in the source set. Inspired by zero-shot learning, we propose a novel model called ternary adversarial networks with self-supervision (TANSS) in this paper, to overcome the limitation of the existing methods on this challenging task. Our TANSS approach consists of three paralleled subnetworks: 1) two semantic feature learning subnetworks that capture the intrinsic data structures of different modalities and preserve the modality relationships via semantic features in the common semantic space; 2) a self-supervised semantic subnetwork that leverages the word vectors of both seen and unseen labels as guidance to supervise the semantic feature learning and enhances the knowledge transfer to unseen labels; and 3) we also utilize the adversarial learning scheme in our TANSS to maximize the consistency and correlation of the semantic features between different modalities. The three subnetworks are integrated in our TANSS to formulate an end-to-end network architecture which enables efficient iterative parameter optimization. Comprehensive experiments on three cross-modal datasets show the effectiveness of our TANSS approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods for zero-shot cross-modal retrieval.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2019.2928180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

computations and intensive memory consumption due to their internal fully connected topologies, thereby making it a great challenge to implement RNNs on embedded devices. In this brief, we propose an energy-efficient RNN processor by exploiting the data locality in network compression using an innovative quantified sparse matrix encoding format. Compared with the conventional processors for compressed RNNs, more than 80% of the weight fetching and matrix-vector multiplications can be further reduced in applications, such as natural language and keyword spotting. To handle different scales of RNN models without introducing significant interactive overhead, scalable hardware architecture is presented to organize multiple processor engines in a spatial fashion with the assistance of the network cross-division strategy.

This paper proposes a novel hybrid RF/FSO system based on a game theoretic spectrum trading process to enhance the reliability of FSO links. The proposed system is considered to be both spectrum- and power-efficient. It is assumed that no RF spectrum is preallocated to the FSO link and only when the link availability is severely impaired by the infrequent adverse weather conditions, i.e., fog, and so on, the source can borrow a portion of licensed RF spectrum from one of the surrounding RF nodes. A market-equilibrium-based pricing process is proposed for the spectrum trading between the source and RF nodes. By using the leased spectrum, the source is able to establish a dual-hop RF/FSO hybrid link to maintain its throughput to the destination. Our extensive performance analysis illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed communication system. It is demonstrated that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the average capacity of the system, especially when the surrounding RF nodes are with low traffic loads. In addition, the system benefits from involving more RF nodes into the spectrum trading process by means of diversity. Finally, the application of the proposed system in a realistic scenario is presented based on the weather statistics in the city of Edinburgh, U.K., which demonstrates that the system can substantially enhance the link availability toward the carrier-class requirement.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8863562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8863562/08771384.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2019.2929387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2019.2929387","startPage":"4803","endPage":"4815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Game-Theoretic Spectrum Trading in RF Relay-Assisted Free-Space Optical Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771384/","displayDocTitle":"Game-Theoretic Spectrum Trading in RF Relay-Assisted Free-Space Optical Communications","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8771384/","volume":"18","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"19115234","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2019","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/R023123/1 (ARROW)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Game-Theoretic Spectrum Trading in RF Relay-Assisted Free-Space Optical Communications","sourcePdf":"twc-huang-2929387-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094831S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8863562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8863562","articleId":"8771384","onlineDate":"24 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8771415,"authors":[{"name":"Pradip Bose","affiliation":["IBM T.

Due to the large model size and tremendous computation of CNNs, they cannot be efficiently executed in small devices like mobile phones. Although several hardware accelerator architectures have been developed, most of them can only efficient address one of the two major layers in CNN, convolutional (CONV) and fully connected (FC) layers. In this paper, based on algorithm-architecture-co-exploration, our architecture targets at executing both layers with high efficiency. Vector quantization technique is first selected to compress the parameters, reduce the computation, and unify the behaviors of both CONV and FC layers. To fully exploit the gain of vector quantization, we then propose an accelerator architecture for quantized CNN. Different DRAM access schemes are employed to reduce DRAM access. We also design a high-throughput processing element architecture to accelerate quantized layers. Compare to previous accelerators for CNN, the proposed architecture achieves 1.2-5\u00d7 less DRAM access and 1.5-5\u00d7 higher throughput for both CONV and FC layers.","doi":"10.1109/AICAS.2019.8771469","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766332/8771465/08771469.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"50","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS)","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICAS.2019.8771469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8771465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerator Design for Vector Quantized Convolutional Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2019","displayDocTitle":"Accelerator Design for Vector Quantized Convolutional Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18865333","publicationDate":"March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8771469/","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerator Design for Vector Quantized Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"03_L2-4_111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111016S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766332","isNumber":"8771465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766332","xplore-issue":"8771465","articleId":"8771469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8771472,"authors":[{"name":"Iulia Alexandra Lungu","affiliation":["Institute of Neuroinformatics, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Iulia Alexandra","lastName":"Lungu","id":"37086048205"},{"name":"Shih-Chii Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Neuroinformatics, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Shih-Chii","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280142900"},{"name":"Tobi Delbruck","affiliation":["Institute of Neuroinformatics, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Tobi","lastName":"Delbruck","id":"37269976700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7884-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7885-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8771472","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Voltage control","Cameras","Brightness","Graphics processing units","Robots","Vision sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brightness","cameras","image sensors","learning (artificial intelligence)","palmprint recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incremental training stages","robot hand","RoShamBo dataset demonstration","dynamic vision sensor event camera","DVS event camera","asynchronous brightness","rock-paper-scissor demonstration","iCaRL incremental learning algorithm","desktop GPU","DVS drive recognition","hand symbol recognition system","fast event-driven incremental learning","base RoShamBo game","time 3.0 min"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neuromorphic","event camera","machine learning","data-driven","incremental learning","robotics","computer vision"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast event-driven incremental learning of hand symbols","abstract":"This paper describes a hand symbol recognition system that can quickly be trained to incrementally learn to recognize new symbols using about 100 times less data and time than by using conventional training. It is driven by frames from a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) event camera. Conventional cameras have very redundant output, especially at high frame rates. Dynamic vision sensors output sparse and asynchronous brightness change events that occur when an object or the camera is moving. Images consisting of a fixed number of events from a DVS drive recognition and incremental learning of new hand symbols in the context of a RoShamBo (rock-paper-scissors) demonstration. Conventional training on the original RoShamBo dataset requires about 12.5h compute time on a desktop GPU using the 2.5 million images in the base dataset. Novel symbols that a user shows for a few tens of seconds to the system can be learned on-the-fly using the iCaRL incremental learning algorithm with 3 minutes of training time on a desktop GPU, while preserving recognition accuracy of previously trained symbols. Our system runs a residual network with 32 layers and maintains 88.4% after 100 epochs or 77% after 5 epochs overall accuracy after 4 incremental training stages. Each stage adds an additional 2 novel symbols to the base 4 symbols. The paper also reports an inexpensive robot hand used for live demonstrations of the base RoShamBo game.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8771465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICAS.2019.8771472","doi":"10.1109/AICAS.2019.8771472","startPage":"25","endPage":"28","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766332/8771465/08771472.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS)","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771472/","displayDocTitle":"Fast event-driven incremental learning of hand symbols","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2019","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18865313","publicationDate":"March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8771472/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast event-driven incremental learning of hand symbols","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"02_L1-3_90.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080066S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766332","isNumber":"8771465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766332","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8771465","articleId":"8771472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8771475,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Zhou","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086921871"},{"name":"Yue Bai","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Bai","id":"37086537879"},{"name":"Shuvra S.

The SotA pursues this through run-time precision-scalable MAC operators, which can support the varying precision needs of DNNs in an energy-efficient way. Yet, to implement the adaptable precision MAC operation, most SotA solutions rely on separately optimized low precision multipliers and a precision-variable accumulation scheme, with the possible disadvantages of a high control complexity and degraded throughput. This paper, first optimizes one of the most effective SotA techniques to support fully-connected DNN layers. This mode, exploiting the transformation of a high precision multiplier into independent parallel low-precision multipliers, will be called the Sum Separate (SS) mode. In addition, this work suggests an alternative low-precision scheme, i.e. the implicit accumulation of multiple low precision products within the multiplier itself, called the Sum Together (ST) mode. Based on the two types of MAC arrangements explored, corresponding architectures have been proposed to implement DNN processing. The two architectures, yielding the same throughput, are compared in different working precisions (2/4/8/16-bit), based on Post-Synthesis simulation. The result shows that the proposed ST-Mode based architecture outperforms the earlier SS-Mode by up to \u00d71.6 on Energy Efficiency (TOPS/W) and \u00d71.5 on Area Efficiency (GOPS/mm\n<sup

In contrast that the previous works are only focusing on the positions of unpruned weights, the proposed work considers the consecutive pruned positions to generate the group-level validations. Denoting the survived indices only for the valid groups, the proposed multi-level indexing scheme reduces the amount of indexing data. In addition, we introduce the indexing-aware multi-level pruning and indexing methods with variable group sizes, which can further optimize the memory overheads. For the same pruning factor, as a result, the memory size for storing the indexing information is remarkably reduced by up to 81%, leading to the practical CNN architecture for intelligent mobile devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2019","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18865319","htmlLink":"/document/8771492/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-level Weight Indexing Scheme for Memory-Reduced Convolutional Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-level Weight Indexing Scheme for Memory-Reduced Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"17_L8-3_129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042917S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766332","isNumber":"8771465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766332","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8771465","articleId":"8771492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8771498,"authors":[{"name":"Xuyang Guo","affiliation":["Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Xuyang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37086857564"},{"name":"Yuanjun Huang","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Yuanjun","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086859321"},{"name":"Hsin-pai Cheng","affiliation":["Duke University"],"firstName":"Hsin-pai","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37086920902"},{"name":"Bing Li","affiliation":["Duke University"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Li","id":"37086340494"},{"name":"Wei Wen","affiliation":["Duke University"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wen","id":"37085427457"},{"name":"Siyuan Ma","affiliation":["Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University"],"firstName":"Siyuan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37086922798"},{"name":"Hai Li","affiliation":["Duke University"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Li","id":"37086126800"},{"name":"Yiran Chen","affiliation":["Duke University"],"firstName":"Yiran","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085860029"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7884-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7885-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8771498","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Neural networks","Computational modeling","Optimization","Mathematical model","Training","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating point arithmetic","neural nets","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weight quantization technique","16-bit quantization","32-bit floating-point precision","binary quantization","automatic search algorithm","search space","quantization bitwidth","mixed-precision quantization scheme","compression rate","binary-weighted model","automatic mixed-precision search","deep neural networks","cognitive tasks","mobile devices","storage resources","full-precision model","8-bit quantization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AICAS.2019.8771498","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766332/8771465/08771498.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8771465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICAS.2019.8771498","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploration of Automatic Mixed-Precision Search for Deep Neural Networks","abstract":"Neural networks have shown great performance in cognitive tasks. When deploying network models on mobile devices with limited computation and storage resources, the weight quantization technique has been widely adopted. In practice, 8-bit or 16-bit quantization is mostly likely to be selected in order to maintain the accuracy at the same level as the models in 32-bit floating-point precision. Binary quantization, on the contrary, aims to obtain the highest compression at the cost of much bigger accuracy drop. Applying different precision in different layers/structures can potentially produce the most efficient model. Seeking for the best precision configuration, however, is difficult. In this work, we proposed an automatic search algorithm to address the challenge. By relaxing the search space of quantization bitwidth from discrete to continuous domain, our algorithm can generate a mixed-precision quantization scheme which achieves the compression rate close to the one from the binary-weighted model while maintaining the testing accuracy similar to the original full-precision model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18852144","htmlLink":"/document/8771498/","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2019","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Exploration of Automatic Mixed-Precision Search for Deep Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploration of Automatic Mixed-Precision Search for Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"17_L8-1_9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053263S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766332","isNumber":"8771465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766332","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8771465","articleId":"8771498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8771513,"authors":[{"name":"Yuhang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Micro-Nano Electronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yuhang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086919435"},{"name":"Guanghui He","affiliation":["Department of Micro-Nano Electronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Guanghui","lastName":"He","id":"37086922866"},{"name":"Kea-Tiong Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kea-Tiong","lastName":"Tang","id":"37290163100"},{"name":"Guoxing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Micro-Nano Electronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Guoxing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085379298"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7884-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7885-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8771513","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771513","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","System-on-chip","Training","Multilayer perceptrons","Neuromorphics","Biological neural networks","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memristor circuits","multilayer perceptrons","neural chips","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-precision memristors","on-chip learning","weight representation","parallel computing features","nonvolatile storage","neuromorphic computing","cross-point memristor array","multilayer perceptron"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["memristor","multilayer perceptron","multilevel states","on-chip learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AICAS.2019.8771513","endPage":"12","startPage":"11","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766332/8771465/08771513.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICAS.2019.8771513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8771465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-chip Learning of Multilayer Perceptron Based on Memristors with Limited Multilevel States","abstract":"The cross-point memristor array is viewed as a promising candidate for neuromorphic computing due to its non-volatile storage and parallel computing features.

Traditionally, liver cancer detection would be performed by pathologists with observing the entire biological tissue, resulting in heavy work loading and potential misjudgment. Accordingly, the studies of the automatic pathological examination have been popular for a long period of time. Most approaches of the existing cancer detection, however, only extract cell level information based on single-scale high-magnification patch. In liver tissues, common cell change phenomena such as apoptosis, necrosis, and steatosis are similar in tumor and benign. Hence, the detection may fail when the patch only covered the changed cells area that cannot provide enough neighboring cell structure information. To conquer this problem, the convolutional network architecture with multi-magnification input can provide not only the cell level information by referencing high-magnification patches, but also the cell structure information by referencing low-magnification patches. The detection algorithm consists of two main structures: 1) extraction of cell level and cell structure level feature maps from high-magnification and low-magnification images respectively by separate general convolutional networks, and 2) integration of multi-magnification features by fully connected network. In this paper, VGG16 and Inception V4 were applied as the based convolutional network for liver tumor detection task. The experimental results showed that VGG16 based multi-magnification input convolutional network achieved 91% mIOU on HCC tumor detection task.

However, memory bandwidth is still the major issue and performance bottleneck of the deep neural network accelerators. The emerging 3D memory, such as hybrid memory cube (HMC) and processing-in-memory techniques provide new solutions to deep neural network implementation. In this paper, a novel HMC architecture is proposed for weight-sharing deep convolutional neural networks in order to solve the memory bandwidth bottleneck during the neural network implementation. The proposed HMC is designed based on conventional HMC architecture with only minor changes. In the logic layer, the vault controller is modified to enable parallel vault access. The weight parameters of pre-trained convolutional neural network are quantized to 16 numbers. During processing, the accumulation of the activations with shared weights is performed and only the accumulated results are transferred to the processing elements to perform multiplications with weights. By using this proposed architecture, the data transfer between main memory and processing elements can be reduced and the throughout of convolution operations can be improved by 30% compared to using HMC based multiply-accumulate design.","doi":"10.1109/AICAS.2019.8771540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICAS.2019.8771540","startPage":"122","endPage":"126","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766332/8771465/08771540.pdf","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8771465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Hybrid Memory Cube for Weight-Sharing Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2019","displayDocTitle":"Improved Hybrid Memory Cube for Weight-Sharing Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2019","publicationDate":"March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8771540/","accessionNumber":"18852168","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771540/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Hybrid Memory Cube for Weight-Sharing Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"07_SS03-3_141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061317S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766332","isNumber":"8771465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766332","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8771465","articleId":"8771540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8771544,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A particularly exciting vision is using them for implementing Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs), a class of deep neural networks with a highly reduced memory footprint. The challenge of resistive memory, however, is that they are prone to device variation, which can lead to bit errors. In this work we show that BNNs can tolerate these bit errors to an outstanding level, through simulations of networks on the MNIST and CIFAR10 tasks. If a standard BNN is used, up to 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n bit error rate can be tolerated with little impact on recognition performance on both MNIST and CIFAR10. We then show that by adapting the training procedure to the fact that the BNN will be operated on error-prone hardware, this tolerance can be extended to a bit error rate of 4 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n.

ReRAM-based accelerators have gained significant traction due to their ability to leverage in-memory computations. In a crossbar structure, they can perform multiply-and-accumulate operations more efficiently than standard CMOS logic. By virtue of being resistive switches, ReRAM switches can only reliably store one of two states. This is a severe limitation on the range of values in a computational kernel. This paper presents a novel scheme in alleviating the single-bit-per-device restriction by exploiting frequency dependence of v-i plane hysteresis, and assigning kernel information not only to the device conductance but also partially distributing it to the frequency of a time-varying input. We show this approach reduces average power consumption for a single crossbar convolution by up to a factor of \u00d716 for an unsigned 8-bit input image, where each convolutional process consumes a worst-case of 1.1mW, and reduces area by a factor of \u00d78, without reducing accuracy to the level of binarized neural networks. This presents a massive saving in computing cost when there are many simultaneous in-situ multiply-and-accumulate processes occurring across different crossbars.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771550/","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2019","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18865335","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","publicationDate":"March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8771550/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analog Weights in ReRAM DNN Accelerators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog Weights in ReRAM DNN Accelerators","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"16_SS05-2_45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11268S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766332","isNumber":"8771465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766332","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8771465","articleId":"8771550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8771554,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolai Kolev","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Nikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy, Varna, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Nikolai","lastName":"Kolev","id":"37086440536"},{"name":"Chavdar ALEXANDROV","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Nikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy, Varna, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Chavdar","lastName":"ALEXANDROV","id":"37352233100"},{"name":"Miroslav TSVETKOV","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Nikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy, Varna, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Miroslav","lastName":"TSVETKOV","id":"37085854470"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1413-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1412-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1414-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8771554","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Marine vehicles","Azimuth","Doppler effect","Estimation","Synthetic aperture radar","Motion estimation","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","motion estimation","oceanographic techniques","radar imaging","ships","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Sentinel-1 SAR single look complex signal model","Bulgarian AIS coastal system","estimated SAR ship target parameters","speed estimation","complex SAR SLC images ship detection","moving point target","motion estimation","Sentinel-1 SAR SLC image ship detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["synthetic aperture radar","image processing","target detection","moving target indication"]}],"abstract":"In the paper \"Sentinel - 1\" SAR single look complex signal model of a moving point target is presented.

Ambulatory epileptic monitoring devices that can detect or even predict seizures play an important role for patients with intractable epilepsy. Though many EEG-based seizure detection algorithms have been proposed in the literature with high accuracy, their hardware implementations are constrained because of power consumption. Many commercial non-research EEG monitoring systems samples multiple electrodes at a relatively high rate and transmit the data either via a wire or wirelessly to an external signal processing unit. In this work, we studied how a reduced sampling precision affects the performance of our machine learning signal processing in seizure detection. To answer this question, we reduce the number of bits (precision) in an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) used in an EEG recorder. The outcome shows that the reduction of ADC precision down to 6-bit does not significantly reduce our convolutional neural network performance in detecting seizure onsets. As an indication of the performance, we achieved an area under the curve (AUC) more than 92% and above 96% on Freiburg Hospital and the Boston Children's Hospital-MIT seizure datasets, respectively. A possible reduction in ADC precision not only contribute to energy consumption reduction, particularly if the data has to be transmitted, but also offers an improved computational efficacy regarding memory requirement and circuit area.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Precision Electroencephalogram for Seizure Detection with Convolutional Neural Network","doi":"10.1109/AICAS.2019.8771569","startPage":"299","endPage":"301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICAS.2019.8771569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8771465","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766332/8771465/08771569.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2019","displayDocTitle":"Low Precision Electroencephalogram for Seizure Detection with Convolutional Neural Network","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8771569/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18918469","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Precision Electroencephalogram for Seizure Detection with Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"18_SS06-4_91.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074001S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766332","isNumber":"8771465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766332","xplore-issue":"8771465","articleId":"8771569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8771573,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Zhao","affiliation":["EECS, Lassonde School of York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086205745"},{"name":"Zhongxia Shang","affiliation":["EECS, Lassonde School of York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhongxia","lastName":"Shang","id":"37086299335"},{"name":"Yong Lian","affiliation":["EECS, Lassonde School of York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Lian","id":"37085343628"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7884-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7885-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8771573","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Artificial neural networks","Time division multiplexing","Wires","Registers","Pipelines","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","multiplying circuits","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ANN","auto generation method","high-performance fixed-point multiplier","mixed parallel pipelining","multiplier speed","artificial neural network","critical building block","improved three-dimensional reduction method","ITDM","MBE","modified booth encoding scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["artificial neural network","multiplier","modified booth encoding","three dimensional reduction method","mixed parallel pipeline"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771573","abstract":"Multiplier is a critical building block in artificial neural network (ANN).

However, deep CNNs are hard to be fully deployed for edge devices due to both computation-intensive and memory-intensive workloads. The energy efficiency of CNNs is dominated by off-chip memory accesses and convolution computation. In this paper, an energy-efficient accelerator is proposed for sparse compressed CNNs by reducing DRAM accesses and eliminating zero-operand computation. Weight compression is utilized for sparse compressed CNNs to reduce the required memory capacity/bandwidth and a large portion of connections. Thus, ReLU function produces zero-valued activations. Additionally, the workloads are distributed based on channels to increase the degree of task parallelism, and all-row- to-all-row non-zero element multiplication is adopted for skipping redundant computation. The simulation results over the dense accelerator show that the proposed accelerator achieves 1.79x speedup and reduces 23.51%, 69.53%, 88.67% on-chip memory size, energy, and DRAM accesses of VGG-16.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771600/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18852164","htmlLink":"/document/8771600/","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2019","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Energy-Efficient Accelerator with Relative- Indexing Memory for Sparse Compressed Convolutional Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy-Efficient Accelerator with Relative- Indexing Memory for Sparse Compressed Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"03_L2-3_64.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046902S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766332","isNumber":"8771465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766332","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8771465","articleId":"8771600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8771602,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Gyun Gi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Gyun","lastName":"Gi","id":"37085732337"},{"name":"Injune Yeo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Injune","lastName":"Yeo","id":"37085735175"},{"name":"Byung-geun Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byung-geun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086921772"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7884-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7885-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8771602","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":373},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of STDP Learning for Non-volatile Memory-based Spiking Neural Network using Comparator Metastability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Writing","Nonvolatile memory","Synapses","Hardware","Integrated circuit modeling","Clocks","Pulse generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comparators (circuits)","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonvolatile memory-based","comparator metastability","spike-timing dependent plasticity learning","additional memory","STDP spike generator","comparison time information","dynamic comparator","nonlinear transfer curve","NVM device","STDP learning rule","mathematical STDP","NVM-based SNN hardware","spiking neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spike-timing dependent plasticity","spiking neural network","metastability","dynamic comparator","non-volatile memory"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a circuit for spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) learning of a non-volatile memory (NVM) based spiking neural network (SNN).

Fortunately, reduced precision has demonstrated large benefits with low impact on accuracy, paving the way towards processing in mobile devices and IoT nodes. Precision-scalable MAC architectures optimized for neural networks have recently gained interest thanks to their subword parallel or bit-serial capabilities. Yet, it has been hard to make a fair judgment of their relative benefits as they have been implemented with different technologies and performance targets. In this work, run-time configurable MAC units from ISSCC 2017 and 2018 are implemented and compared objectively under diverse precision scenarios. All circuits are synthesized in a 28nm commercial CMOS process with precision ranging from 2 to 8 bits. This work analyzes the impact of scalability and compares the different MAC units in terms of energy, throughput and area, aiming to understand the optimal architectures to reduce computation costs in neural-network processing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771610/","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 March 2019","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"18865329","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","publicationDate":"March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8771610/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Survey of Precision-Scalable Multiply-Accumulate Units for Neural-Network Processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survey of Precision-Scalable Multiply-Accumulate Units for Neural-Network Processing","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"04_SS02-2_11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091772S","chronDate":"18-20 March 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766332","isNumber":"8771465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766332","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8771465","articleId":"8771610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8771611,"authors":[{"name":"Olga Krestinskaya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan"],"firstName":"Olga","lastName":"Krestinskaya","id":"37085902161"},{"name":"Adilya Bakambekova","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan"],"firstName":"Adilya","lastName":"Bakambekova","id":"37086467734"},{"name":"Alex Pappachen James","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan"],"firstName":"Alex Pappachen","lastName":"James","id":"37391662800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7884-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7885-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8771611","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AMSNet: Analog Memristive System Architecture for Mean-Pooling with Dropout Convolutional Neural Network","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766332/8771465/08771611.pdf","startPage":"272","endPage":"273","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICAS.2019.8771611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8771465","doi":"10.1109/AICAS.2019.8771611","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","Convolution","System-on-chip","Switching circuits","Convolutional neural networks","Training","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","convolutional neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","memristors","neural chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AMSNet","analog memristive system architecture","dropout convolutional neural network","analog hardware implementation","memristive devices","memristor variabilities","analog 180nm CMOS CNN","random dropout backpropagation training","mean-pooling convolutional neural network","WOx memristors","WOx"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CNN","Memristors","Analog Circuits","Variability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771611","abstract":"This work proposes analog hardware implementation of Mean-Pooling Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 50% random dropout backpropagation training.

To achieve energy-efficient processing, it has 2 key features: First, 1-D shift convolution PEs with fully distributed memory architecture achieve 3.1TOPS/W energy efficiency. Compared with conventional architecture, even though it has massively parallel 1024 MAC units, it achieve high energy efficiency by scaling down voltage to 0.46V due to its fully local routed design. Next, fully configurable 2-D mesh core-to-core interconnection support various size of input features to maximize utilization.

The CTDA sampling scheme significantly reduces the sample points on the baseline part while provides more detail on useful features in the ECG signal. It is shown that the CTDA sampling scheme achieves significant savings on arithmetic operations in the ANN while maintains the similar performance as Nyquist sampling in the classification.

On the other hand, embedding intelligence into edge devices is highly demanded by emerging applications such as autonomous systems, human-machine interactions, and the Internet of Things (IoT). In these applications, it is advantageous to process data near or at the source of data to improve energy & spectrum efficiency and security, and decrease latency. Although the computation capability of edge devices has increased tremendously during the past decade, it is still challenging to perform sophisticated AI algorithms in these resource-constrained edge devices, which calls for not only low-power chips for energy efficient processing at the edge but also a system-level framework to distribute resources and tasks along the edge-cloud continuum. In this overview, we summarize dedicated edge hardware for machine learning from embedded applications to sub-mW \u201calways-on\u201d IoT nodes. Recent advances of circuits and systems incorporating joint design of architectures and algorithms will be reviewed. Fog computing paradigm that enables processing at the edge while still offering the possibility to interact with the cloud will be covered, with focus on opportunities and challenges of exploiting fog

auditory applications. However, direct implementation of these algorithms without considering the sparsity of data requires high processing power, consume vast amounts of energy and suffer from scalability issues. Inspired by biology, one of the methods which can reduce power consumption and allow scalability in the implementation of neural networks is asynchronous processing and communication by means of action potentials, so-called spikes. In this work, we use the well-known sigma-delta quantization method and introduce an easy and straightforward solution to convert an Artificial Neural Network to a Spiking Neural Network which can be implemented asynchronously in a neuromorphic platform. Briefly, we used asynchronous spikes to communicate the quantized output activations of the neurons. Despite the fact that our proposed mechanism is simple and applicable to a wide range of different ANNs, it outperforms the state-of-the-art implementations from the accuracy and energy consumption point of view.

The results, obtained in the paper, could be applied in the process of development of new radio-communication devices, used for precise measurement of distances.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 June 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771635/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8771635/","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18865502","conferenceDate":"6-8 June 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"An Algorithm for Synthesis of Mismatched Filters for Processing of Aperiodic Phase Manipulated Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Algorithm for Synthesis of Mismatched Filters for Processing of Aperiodic Phase Manipulated Signals","confLoc":"Varna, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"033-326.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09499S","chronDate":"6-8 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766337","isNumber":"8771467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766337","xplore-issue":"8771467","articleId":"8771635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8771719,"authors":[{"name":"Tabia Ahmad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Tabia","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37085887191"},{"name":"Nilanian Senroy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Nilanian","lastName":"Senroy","id":"37687936100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6159-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5552-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6160-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8771719","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phasor measurement units","Measurement uncertainty","Power measurement","Instruments","Transmission line measurements","Power systems","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","fluctuations","Hilbert transforms","phasor measurement","power engineering computing","power system stability","signal denoising","statistical testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data driven denoising framework","error corrupted synchrophasor data","statistical tests","null hypotheses","measurement data","PMU measurement signals","PMU error emulator","mining power system stability","phasor measurement units","empirical mode decomposition technique","nonGaussian coloured nature","power system events","measurement anomalies","detrended fluctuation analysis based thresholding","WAMS based applications","wide area measurement system based applications","EMD","DFA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PMU error","instrumentation channel","Empirical Mode Decomposition","detrended fluctuation analysis","event detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8771719","doi":"10.1109/NPSC.2018.8771719","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NPSC.2018.8771719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8771438","publicationTitle":"2018 20th National Power Systems Conference (NPSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 20th National Power Systems Conference (NPSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766333/8771438/08771719.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data Driven Denoising Framework for Error Corrupted Synchrophasor Data","abstract":"Recently, Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) have been utilized in several Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS) based applications and hence the quality of estimates is of utmost concern. In this paper, the non - Gaussian and coloured nature of PMU error is asserted using various statistical (null hypotheses) tests, which forms the basis for a purely data driven denoising framework for PMU data. The proposed framework detects the outliers from measurement data thereby serving as a basis to distinguish between data induced by power system events versus measurement anomalies. A formulation of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) technique with Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) based thresholding, tailor made for colored noise is used to denoise PMU measurement signals. The technique may be used towards creating a PMU error emulator for testing and research of algorithms focused on mining power system stability and other crucial WAMS based applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8771719/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18865399","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Data Driven Denoising Framework for Error Corrupted Synchrophasor Data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data Driven Denoising Framework for Error Corrupted Synchrophasor Data","confLoc":"Tiruchirappalli, India","sourcePdf":"1570476084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053499S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8766333","isNumber":"8771438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766333","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8771438","articleId":"8771719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8771807,"authors":[{"name":"Kaustav Chatterjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai"],"firstName":"Kaustav","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37087410561"},{"name":"S.

Assuming that only a few sensors can actually be tampered at any given time, it is suggested that the incoherence between the actual and tampered sensor readings be used in flagging an attack. Aligned to this theme, the paper presents two different schemes for replay attack detection. The singular value decomposition approach proposed in the paper is based on the relative change in ratios of dominant singular values of a data window sliding in time, while the proposed Pearson correlation based approach utilizes the time-series correlation between the neighboring PMU measurements as an instrument for attack detection. It is proposed that these detection schemes be incorporated in the wide area monitoring system as data preprocessing units for anomaly identification. The effectiveness of the detection schemes are studied on a test system and their merits and limitations are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8771807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8771807/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18852206","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven Online Detection of Replay Attacks on Wide-Area Measurement Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven Online Detection of Replay Attacks on Wide-Area Measurement Systems","confLoc":"Tiruchirappalli, India","sourcePdf":"1570468121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059055S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8766333","isNumber":"8771438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766333","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8771438","articleId":"8771807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8771812,"authors":[{"name":"Ajit Kumar","affiliation":["OPAL-RT, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"Ajit","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086923095"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6159-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5552-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6160-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8771812","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"abstract":"Pertaining to different stages of grid operation i.e., transient period and post-transient period, transient stability and voltage regulation (VR) respectively, are the main properties of power system control.

Channel parameters can be estimated through extensive measurements in the environment. Alternatively, ray tracing simulations can be done if the 3D model of the environment is available. One drawback of ray tracing simulations is the high computational complexity; therefore, ray tracing is not suitable for real-time coverage optimization. In this paper, we present a deep convolutional neural network-based approach to estimate channel parameters (specifically, path loss exponent and standard deviation of shadowing) directly from 2D satellite images. While deep learning methods require high computational resources for training and large amount of training data, once trained, the network can make predictions fast. Also, unlike the ray tracing simulations, there is no need for 3D model generation, and therefore, it can be applied easily using the images obtained from satellites or aerial vehicles. These make the proposed method a computationally efficient and reliable alternative to ray tracing simulations. The experimental results show that path loss exponent and large-scale shadowing factor at 900 MHz can be correctly classified by 88% and 76% accuracy, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931072","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08772043.pdf","startPage":"101366","endPage":"101375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path Loss Exponent and Shadowing Factor Prediction From Satellite Images Using Deep Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8772043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772043/","displayDocTitle":"Path Loss Exponent and Shadowing Factor Prediction From Satellite Images Using Deep Learning","volume":"7","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18880631","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8772043/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004410","fundingName":"T\u00fcrkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Ara\u015ftirma Kurumu","grantNumber":"215E324"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Path Loss Exponent and Shadowing Factor Prediction From Satellite Images Using Deep Learning","sourcePdf":"access-gunturk-2931072-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076422S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8772043","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8772075,"authors":[{"name":"Yanan Dong","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8772075/dong-2931074-small.gif","p":["Yanan Dong received the B.E. degree from Yantai University, China, in 2017.

However, the detection of multiple defect is challenging task due to the size imbalance between cracks, spalling, and backgrounds. Currently, deep-learning-based methods for multiple defect are dependent on multiple-stage networks, which have limited their scalability and complex frame working processes. To accurately recognize the multiple defect at the pixel-level using only one-stage networks, a new method was proposed, which integrated the basic SegNet with a focal loss function, and was referred to as an FL-SegNet method. The focal loss function was adopted to address the problem of the size imbalance by down-weighing the losses assigned to the well-classified samples, and then the training was focused on the hard samples. Furthermore, comparative experiments were performed to evaluate the performances of the different methods. The experimental results demonstrated that FL-SegNet method was capable of accurately predicting the profiles of small-sized cracks and overlapping damages even under various noise conditions, and successfully outperformed the two-stream method and the basic SegNet method in this regard. The performance metrics (MPA and MIoU) of the FL-SegNet method were significantly higher than those of other multiple defect detection approaches in different scenarios (images with small-sized damages attained to 81.53% and 69.86%, increased by 11.99 % and 4.88% compared with two-stream method, and increased by 17.78% and 7.69% compared with basic SegNet). Therefore, this paper provides an effective solution for the future detection of multiple defect in tunnel linings.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931074","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08772075.pdf","startPage":"182643","endPage":"182657","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deep-Learning-Based Multiple Defect Detection Method for Tunnel Lining Damages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"A Deep-Learning-Based Multiple Defect Detection Method for Tunnel Lining Damages","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8772075/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19214699","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772075/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41602292, 51739007 and U1806226"},{"fundingName":"Key Research and Development Project of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"2017CXGC0610"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Deep-Learning-Based Multiple Defect Detection Method for Tunnel Lining Damages","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2931074-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103453S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8772075","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8772076,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Caner Y\u00fcz\u00fcg\u00fcler","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Lausanne, VD, CH"],"bio":{"p":["Ahmet Caner Y\u00fcz\u00fcg\u00fcler is currently working toward a PhD in the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne.

In this paper, we first present a novel nonlinear analog synapse circuit design that is dense and inherently less sensitive to process variation. We then propose an interpolation-based methodology to train nonlinear synapses built with deep-submicrometer transistors.

In this method, we assume a local 3-D fault is a plane defined by a single combination of strike and dip angles. We assume the fault strikes and dips, respectively, are in the ranges of [0\u00b0, 360\u00b0] and [64\u00b0, 85\u00b0], which are divided into 577 classes corresponding to the situation of no fault and 576 different combinations of strikes and dips. We construct a 7-layer CNN to classify the fault strike and dip in a local seismic cube and obtain the classification probability at the same time. With the fault probability, strike and dip estimated at some seismic pixel, we further compute a fault cube (centered at the pixel) with fault features elongated along the fault plane. By sliding the classification window within a full seismic image, we are able to obtain a lot of overlapping fault cubes which are stacked to compute three full images of enhanced and continuous fault probabilities, strikes, and dips. To train the CNN model, we propose an effective and efficient workflow to automatically create 900 000 synthetic seismic cubes and the corresponding fault class labels. Although trained with only synthetic data sets, our CNN model can be applied to accurately estimate fault probabilities, strikes, and dips within field seismic images that are acquired at totally different surveys. With the estimated three fault images, we further construct fault cells that are represented as small 3-D squares, each square is colored by fault probability and oriented by fault strike and dip. We recursively link the fault cells by following the fault strikes and dips to finally construct fault skins, which are simple linked data structures to represent fault surfaces.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2019.2925003","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8887423/08772081.pdf","startPage":"9138","endPage":"9155","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2019.2925003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8887423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FaultNet3D: Predicting Fault Probabilities, Strikes, and Dips With a Single Convolutional Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772081/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"FaultNet3D: Predicting Fault Probabilities, Strikes, and Dips With a Single Convolutional Neural Network","volume":"57","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19111960","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8772081/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FaultNet3D: Predicting Fault Probabilities, Strikes, and Dips With a Single Convolutional Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tgrs-wu-2925003-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115813S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8887423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8887423","articleId":"8772081","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8772083,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyu Yang","affiliation":["Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data and Brain Computing, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/9317867/8772083/yang-2930985-small.gif","p":["Hongyu Yang received the BE and PhD degrees in computer science and technology from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2013 and 2019, respectively, where she is currently working as a post-doctoral with the Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data and Brain Computing.

This paper presents a novel generative adversarial network based approach to address the issues in a coupled manner. It separately models the constraints for the intrinsic subject-specific characteristics and the age-specific facial changes with respect to the elapsed time, ensuring that the generated faces present desired aging effects while keeping personalized properties stable. To render photo-realistic facial details, high-level age-specific features conveyed by the synthesized face are estimated by a pyramidal adversarial discriminator at multiple scales, which simulates the aging effects in a finer way. Further, an adversarial learning scheme is introduced to simultaneously train a single generator and multiple parallel discriminators, resulting in smooth continuous face aging sequences. The proposed method is applicable even in the presence of variations in pose, expression, makeup, etc., achieving remarkably vivid aging effects. Quantitative evaluations by a COTS face recognition system demonstrate that the target age distributions are accurately recovered, and 99.88 and 99.98 percent age progressed faces can be correctly verified at 0.001 percent FAR after age transformations of approximately 28 and 23 years elapsed time on the MORPH and CACD databases, respectively. Both visual and quantitative assessments show that the approach advances the state-of-the-art.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/9317867/08772083.pdf","startPage":"499","endPage":"515","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2930985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2930985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9317867","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8772083","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Continuous Face Age Progression: A Pyramid of GANs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Aging","Training","Databases","Computational modeling","Gallium nitride","Generative adversarial networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ageing","face recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identity permanence","novel generative adversarial network","intrinsic subject-specific characteristics","age-specific facial changes","high-level age-specific features","synthesized face","pyramidal adversarial discriminator","adversarial learning scheme","single generator","multiple parallel discriminators","smooth continuous face aging sequences","aging effects","COTS face recognition system","target age distributions","age transformations","continuous face age progression learning","GANs","photo-realistic facial detail rendering","CACD databases","MORPH databases","quantitative assessments","visual assessments","time 28.0 year","efficiency 99.98 percent","time 23.0 year","efficiency 0.001 percent"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Generative adversarial networks","age progression","face aging simulation","face verification","age estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772083/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 1 2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Learning Continuous Face Age Progression: A Pyramid of GANs","volume":"43","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8772083/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Feb. 2021","accessionNumber":"20341873","pubMedId":"31352335","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Plan","grantNumber":"2016YFC0801002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61673033 and 61421003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Continuous Face Age Progression: A Pyramid of GANs","sourcePdf":"tpami-huang-2930985-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163212S","chronDate":"Feb. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"9317867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"9317867","articleId":"8772083","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8772088,"authors":[{"name":"Boyi Liu","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Boyi","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0001-7163-5482","id":"37087061487"},{"name":"Lujia Wang","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Lujia","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-6710-4897","id":"37406752700"},{"name":"Ming Liu","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0002-4500-238X","id":"37085398677"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-3766"},{"format":"CD","value":"2377-3774"}],"articleNumber":"8772088","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1975},"abstract":"This letter was motivated by the problem of how to make robots fuse and transfer their experience so that they can effectively use prior knowledge and quickly adapt to new environments. To address the problem, we present a learning architecture for navigation in cloud robotic systems: Lifelong Federated Reinforcement Learning (LFRL). In the letter, we propose a knowledge fusion algorithm for upgrading a shared model deployed on the cloud. Then, effective transfer learning methods in LFRL are introduced. LFRL is consistent with human cognitive science and fits well in cloud robotic systems. Experiments show that LFRL greatly improves the efficiency of reinforcement learning for robot navigation. The cloud robotic system deployment also shows that LFRL is capable of fusing prior knowledge. In addition, we release a cloud robotic navigation-learning website to provide the service based on LFRL: www.shared-robotics.com.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7083369/8764082/08772088.pdf","startPage":"4555","endPage":"4562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LRA.2019.2931179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2019.2931179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8764082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8772088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lifelong Federated Reinforcement Learning: A Learning Architecture for Navigation in Cloud Robotic Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Navigation","Reinforcement learning","Task analysis","Cloud computing","Training","Robot kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile robots","path planning","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transfer learning methods","LFRL","robot navigation","cloud robotic system deployment","learning architecture","knowledge fusion algorithm","lifelong federated reinforcement learning","human cognitive science","cloud robotic navigation-learning Website"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep learning in robotics and automation","autonomous vehicle navigation","AI-based methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Lifelong Federated Reinforcement Learning: A Learning Architecture for Navigation in Cloud Robotic Systems","volume":"4","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8772088/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","accessionNumber":"19089578","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010877","fundingName":"Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission","grantNumber":"JCYJ2017081853518789"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Science and Technology Plan Guangdong-Hong Kong Cooperation Innovation Platform","grantNumber":"2018B050502009"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61603376"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1713211"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Science, Technology and Innovation Commission","grantNumber":"JCYJ20160428154842603"},{"fundingName":"Basic Research Project of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission","grantNumber":"16JC1401200"},{"fundingName":"Chengzhong Xu from University of Macau"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lifelong Federated Reinforcement Learning: A Learning Architecture for Navigation in Cloud Robotic Systems","sourcePdf":"lra-wang-2931179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075782S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7083369","isNumber":"8764082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7083369","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8764082","articleId":"8772088","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8772091,"authors":[{"name":"Anqing Wang","affiliation":["Research Institute of Intelligent Control and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China","Department of Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/9184168/8772091/wang-2931228-small.gif","p":["Anqing Wang received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from the Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2013 and 2016, respectively.

A novel design scheme, consisting of finite-time adaptive fuzzy controller and event-triggering mechanism (ETM), is proposed to decrease the number of data transmission and the number of control actuation updates. With the proposed event-triggered adaptive fuzzy control scheme, all the solutions of the resulting closed-loop system are guaranteed to be semi-globally bounded within finite time. Moreover, the feasibility of the proposed ETM is verified by excluding Zeno behavior. In contrast to existing results on similar problems, the restrictions on nonlinearities are relaxed and the more general uncertain nonlinear systems are considered. Finally, an example is provided to illustrate our theoretical results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772091/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2020","volume":"28","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"20013997","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2020","publicationDate":"Sept. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8772091/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Time Adaptive Fuzzy Control for Nonstrict-Feedback Nonlinear Systems Via an Event-Triggered Strategy","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61773327"},{"fundingName":"Self-Planned Task of State Key Laboratory of Robotics"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003472","fundingName":"Harbin Institute of Technology","grantNumber":"SKLRS201801A03"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61873311"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Time Adaptive Fuzzy Control for Nonstrict-Feedback Nonlinear Systems Via an Event-Triggered Strategy","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-wang-2931228-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11076S","chronDate":"Sept.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"9184168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"9184168","articleId":"8772091","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8772093,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Yeasir Arafat","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Chosun University, Gwangju, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8772093/arafa-2930813-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Yeasir Arafat received the B.Sc. degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering, and the M.Sc. degree in computer networks and communication from Independent University, Bangladesh, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

UAV networks have unique features and characteristics that are different from mobile ad hoc networks and vehicular ad hoc networks. The dynamic behavior of rapid mobility and topology changes in UAV networks makes the design of a routing protocol quite challenging. In this paper, we review the routing protocols for UAV networks, in which the topology-based, position-based, hierarchical, deterministic, stochastic, and social-network-based routing protocols are extensively surveyed. The routing protocols are then compared qualitatively in terms of their major features, characteristics, and performance.

When the PU does not exist, the SU identifies this idle licensed spectrum band by spectrum sensing and occupies it so that the waste of spectrum hole resource is avoided. When the PU exists, it allows the SU to share its spectrum band by NOMA to further increase the spectrum efficiency. By adopting FD mode, the proposed FD CNOMA scheme not only achieves better system performance than half-duplex mode by receiving and transmitting simultaneously, but also overcomes inherent issues of conventional CRNs. To characterize the performance of the proposed scheme, expressions of exact and asymptotic ergodic rates and system throughput are worked out. Accordingly, the high signal-to-noise ratio slopes for these ergodic rates are further derived. Simulation results verify the correctness of all these derivation results. They also illustrate that FD CNOMA outperforms other cooperative benchmarks in real-world scenarios in terms of both ergodic rates and system throughput.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2019.2927509","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/8910483/08772097.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2019.2927509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8910483","startPage":"3897","endPage":"3908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-Duplex Relaying Cognitive Radio Network With Cooperative Nonorthogonal Multiple Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8772097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Full-Duplex Relaying Cognitive Radio Network With Cooperative Nonorthogonal Multiple Access","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772097/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19157337","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8772097/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671183 and 61771163"},{"fundingName":"General Research Fund","grantNumber":"15201118"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004377","fundingName":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University","grantNumber":"G-YBK6 and G-YBR2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-Duplex Relaying Cognitive Radio Network With Cooperative Nonorthogonal Multiple Access","sourcePdf":"jsyst-jia-2927509-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161375S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8910483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8910483","articleId":"8772097","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8772100,"authors":[{"name":"Bahar Asgari","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Bahar Asgari is working toward a PhD at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, and is a member of the Computer Architecture and System Laboratory.

Recently, systolic arrays have been used for accelerating the inference of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, as sparsification mechanisms are applied to DNNs during or after training, DNN inference is usually a sparse problem. Therefore, it cannot fully benefit from the fundamental advantages offered by systolic arrays.

New-generated blocks in the CoDAG will be placed appropriately and point to those in the previous level, making it a well-connected channel. Transactions in the network will be confirmed in a deterministic period, and the CoDAG keeps a simple data structure at the same time. We also illustrate the attack strategies by adversary, and it is proved that our protocols are resistant to these attacks. Furthermore, we design a CoDAG-based IIoT architecture to improve the efficiency of the IIoT system.

Implementation of the proposed method is based on the Least-Squares estimator and does not require knowledge of network model parameters, but only requires measurement of voltage magnitude, active, and reactive power. To overcome the data collinearity problem, the sensitivity coefficients are estimated using ridge regression. To track changes in the network operating conditions, the coefficients are updated using the Recursive Least-Squares and to avoid instability in the estimation process during low excitation periods, the method uses the concept of directional forgetting in which old data are discarded only when new information are available. Effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a case study where the impact of active and reactive power injection is estimated. Besides that, it is also shown how sensitivity coefficients can be useful to establish how each photovoltaic inverter can contribute to set a cooperative control, by achieving losses minimization and ensuring voltage level within limits set by the standards.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8964030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2019.2931086","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/8964030/08772105.pdf","startPage":"278","endPage":"287","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2019.2931086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Sensitivity Coefficients Estimation for Cooperative Control of PV Inverters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2020","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Sensitivity Coefficients Estimation for Cooperative Control of PV Inverters","volume":"35","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8772105/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2020","accessionNumber":"19282138","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2020","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772105/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Post-Graduate Program in Electrical Engineering (PPgEE) of the UFCG"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico","grantNumber":"404974/2013-9"},{"fundingName":"Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Sensitivity Coefficients Estimation for Cooperative Control of PV Inverters","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-vitorino-2931086-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097219S","chronDate":"Feb.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"8964030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8964030","articleId":"8772105","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":8772109,"authors":[{"name":"Jungwhan Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/8893449/8772109/choi-2930972-small.gif","p":["Jungwhan Choi received the BS degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea in 2013, and the MS degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2015, where he is currently working toward the PhD degree.

Unfortunately, PCM cell data can be changed by frequently writing `0' to adjacent cells. This phenomenon is called Write Disturbance (WD). To mitigate WD errors with low performance overhead, we propose a Detection Cell PCM (DC-PCM). In the DC-PCM, additional cells called Detection Cells (DC) are allocated to a memory-line to pre-detect WD errors. For pre-detection, we propose schemes that give DCs higher WD-vulnerability than normal cells. However, additional time is needed to verify DCs. To hide the time needed to perform the verifications during a WRITE, DC-PCM enables the local word-lines of DCs to operate independently (Decoupled Word-line), and verifies different directions in parallel (Parallel DC-Verification). After verification, the DC-PCM increases the WD-vulnerability of the DCs, or restores the memory-line data (DC-Correction). In our simulation, DC-PCMs showed performance comparable to a WD-free PCM for all workloads.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2019.2930972","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/8893449/08772109.pdf","startPage":"1741","endPage":"1754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2019.2930972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8893449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC-PCM: Mitigating PCM Write Disturbance with Low Performance Overhead by Using Detection Cells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1 2019","displayDocTitle":"DC-PCM: Mitigating PCM Write Disturbance with Low Performance Overhead by Using Detection Cells","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8772109/","accessionNumber":"19170499","volume":"68","issue":"12","publicationDate":"1 Dec. 2019","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2017R1A2B2009380"},{"fundingName":"SK hynix"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC-PCM: Mitigating PCM Write Disturbance with Low Performance Overhead by Using Detection Cells","sourcePdf":"tc-choi-2930972-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088653S","chronDate":"Dec. 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"8893449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8893449","articleId":"8772109","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8772112,"authors":[{"name":"Zeyi Tao","affiliation":["College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Zeyi","lastName":"Tao","orcid":"0000-0002-7925-0891","id":"37086934407"},{"name":"Qi Xia","affiliation":["College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Xia","id":"37086934749"},{"name":"Zijiang Hao","affiliation":["College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Zijiang","lastName":"Hao","id":"37085712435"},{"name":"Cheng Li","affiliation":["College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-3200-1369","id":"37086022763"},{"name":"Lele Ma","affiliation":["College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Lele","lastName":"Ma","orcid":"0000-0001-7558-9479","id":"37086937708"},{"name":"Shanhe Yi","affiliation":["VMware, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shanhe","lastName":"Yi","id":"37085709559"},{"name":"Qun Li","affiliation":["College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Li","id":"37291116600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2256"}],"articleNumber":"8772112","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1989},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8772112","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Edge computing","Cloud computing","Virtual machining","Hardware","Algorithm design and analysis","Data centers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","scheduling","security of data","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual machine management","edge computing systems","virtual machines","virtualization mechanism","edge computing hardware infrastructures","VM management","virtualization frameworks","virtualization techniques","placement algorithms","scheduling algorithms","security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Algorithms","management","virtual machining"]}],"abstract":"Many edge computing systems rely on virtual machines (VMs) to deliver their services.

Assuming that the recorded data are the superposition of low-rank and sparse components, many related works have been reported using a hybrid rank-sparsity constraint. Those published works typically detect the rank and erratic noise using empirical and global thresholds, which often fail to well characterize the varying sparsity and easily cause biased estimation in case of their nonstationary distribution. We propose an iterative double Laplacian-scaled low-rank optimization to adaptively select the sparsity and rank regularizer parameters for robust signal recovery. Comparing with the published approaches with global threshold, Laplacian-scaled mixture, which is obtained by multiplying Laplacian variable with a Gamma variable, is used to locally model the sparsity of erratic noise and the low-rank feature of signal. Then, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used to transform the Laplacian-scaled mixture problem into a localized reweighted \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n minimization scheme. The weighted coefficient appearing in its EM solver provides a variable constraint to locally address the rank and erratic noise, and hence, their regularizer parameters can dynamically reflect the different importance of those coefficients. We tested the effectiveness of the proposed method using under-sampled synthetic and field data that are corrupted by erratic noise and used other state-ofthe-art methods as comparisons. The results showed that more exact estimations of the signal and erratic noise can be obtained using the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2019.2925376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2019.2925376","startPage":"9177","endPage":"9187","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8887423/08772115.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8887423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Double Laplacian-Scaled Low-Rank Optimization for Under-Sampled and Noisy Signal Recovery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Double Laplacian-Scaled Low-Rank Optimization for Under-Sampled and Noisy Signal Recovery","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2019","volume":"57","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8772115/","accessionNumber":"19100068","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772115/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Programs of China","grantNumber":"2017YFB0202903"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41574125 and 41774139"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Projects of China","grantNumber":"2017ZX05018-005"},{"fundingName":"China National 111 Foreign Experts Introduction Plan for Tight Oil & Gas Geology and Exploration"},{"fundingName":"Deep-Ultradeep Oil & Gas Geophysical Exploration"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Double Laplacian-Scaled Low-Rank Optimization for Under-Sampled and Noisy Signal Recovery","sourcePdf":"tgrs-du-2925376-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139338S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8887423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8887423","articleId":"8772115","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8772124,"authors":[{"name":"Micha Feigin","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA"],"firstName":"Micha","lastName":"Feigin","orcid":"0000-0001-7649-9539","id":"37271102000"},{"name":"Daniel Freedman","affiliation":["Google Research"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Freedman","id":"37088349083"},{"name":"Brian W.

Unfortunately, state-of-the-art shear wave imaging techniques, essential to promote this goal, are limited to high-end ultrasound hardware due to high-power requirements, and are extremely sensitive to patient and sonographer motion, and generally suffer from low frame rates. Motivated by research and theory showing that longitudinal wave sound speed carries similar diagnostic abilities to shear wave imaging, we present an alternative approach using single-sided pressure-wave sound speed measurements from channel data. Methods: In this paper, we present a single-sided sound speed inversion solution using a fully convolutional deep neural network. We use simulations for training, allowing the generation of limitless ground truth data. Results: We show that it is possible to invert for longitudinal sound speed in soft tissue at high frame rates. We validate the method on simulated data. We present highly encouraging results on limited real data. Conclusion: Sound speed inversion on channel data has made significant potential possible in real time with deep learning technologies. Significance: Specialized shear wave ultrasound systems remain inaccessible in many locations. Longitudinal sound speed and deep learning technologies enable an alternative approach to diagnosis based on tissue elasticity. High frame rates are also possible.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/9042908/08772124.pdf","startPage":"1142","endPage":"1151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2019.2931195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2019.2931195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9042908","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8772124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deep Learning Framework for Single-Sided Sound Speed Inversion in Medical Ultrasound","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Deep learning","Diseases","Elastography","Young's modulus"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","biomechanics","biomedical ultrasonics","cancer","convolutional neural nets","elastic waves","elasticity","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tissue elasticity","soft tissue","specialized shear wave ultrasound systems","shear wave imaging techniques","thyroid disease diagnostics","longitudinal wave sound speed","sonographer motion","high-end ultrasound hardware","cancer detection","ultrasound elastography","medical ultrasound","deep learning technologies","channel data","longitudinal sound speed","limitless ground truth data","fully convolutional deep neural network","single-sided sound speed inversion solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep learning","inverse problems","ultrasound","sound speed inversion"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Deep Learning","Elasticity Imaging Techniques","Humans","Phantoms, Imaging","Sound","Ultrasonography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"A Deep Learning Framework for Single-Sided Sound Speed Inversion in Medical Ultrasound","volume":"67","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8772124/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2020","accessionNumber":"19524367","pubMedId":"31352330","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Deep Learning Framework for Single-Sided Sound Speed Inversion in Medical Ultrasound","sourcePdf":"tbme-feigin-2931195-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162828S","chronDate":"April  2020","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"9042908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"9042908","articleId":"8772124","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8772135,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenming Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Zhenming Yu received the B.Eng. degree in electronic science and technology and the M.Eng. degree in optical engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2011 and 2014, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic science and technology from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2018.

To acquire and recover signals with low resolution ADCs, we propose a binarized coherent optical receiver based on opto-electronic neural network, which consists of three layers, the broadcast layer, the optical neural layer, and the electronic neural layer. The broadcast layer that composed of Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) is to duplicate and select the input optical signal into the opto-electronic neural network. The optical neural layer is constituted by specially designed structures to map the binarized weights into optical domain, which can be integrated on silicon together with the broadcast layer. The one-bit vertical resolution ADCs act as the binarized activation after the optical neural layer. This binarized coherent optical receiver is demonstrated in simulation of 50-Gb/s single polarization (SP) QPSK system and 100-Gb/s polarization multiplexing (PDM) QPSK system. The one-bit vertical resolution ADCs can be utilized to recover the complex modulation format signal successfully. The broadcast layer and the optical neural layer can be integrated based on silicon, which could increase the calculation speed and reduce the energy consumption of the total system.","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2019.2931251","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2944/8764697/08772135.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2019.2931251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8764697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Binarized Coherent Optical Receiver Based on Opto-Electronic Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Neural networks","Optical polarization","Optical computing","Optical fibers","Optical mixing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","Mach-Zehnder interferometers","multiplexing","neural nets","optical fibre communication","optical modulation","optical receivers","quadrature phase shift keying","signal processing","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic neural layer","opto-electronic neural network","optical neural layer","one-bit vertical resolution ADCs","binarized coherent optical receiver","optical communication system","Mach-Zehnder interferometers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical neural network","analog to digital converter","binarized coherent optical receiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772135/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2020","displayDocTitle":"Binarized Coherent Optical Receiver Based on Opto-Electronic Neural Network","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8772135/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2019","accessionNumber":"18917418","externalId":"3900109","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB2201802 and 2018YFB2201803"},{"fundingName":"NSFC Program","grantNumber":"61771285, 61431003 and 61625104"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009592","fundingName":"Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission","grantNumber":"Z181100008918011"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binarized Coherent Optical Receiver Based on Opto-Electronic Neural Network","sourcePdf":"jstqe-yu-2931251-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095138S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"8764697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","xplore-issue":"8764697","articleId":"8772135","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8772136,"authors":[{"name":"Gaowei Xu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Information and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8772136/xu-2930958-small.gif","p":["Gaowei Xu received the bachelor\u2019s degree from the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, in 2015.

However, deep learning-based methods still face two challenging problems in practical MI EEG signal classification applications: (1) Generally, training a deep learning model successfully needs a large amount of labeled data. However, most of the EEG signal data is unlabeled and it is quite difficult or even impossible for human experts to label all the signal samples manually. (2) It is extremely time-consuming and computationally expensive to train a deep learning model from scratch. To cope with these two challenges, a deep transfer convolutional neural network (CNN) framework based on VGG-16 is proposed for EEG signal classification. The proposed framework consists of a VGG-16 CNN model pre-trained on the ImageNet and a target CNN model which shares the same structure with VGG-16 except for the softmax output layer. The parameters of the pre-trained VGG-16 CNN model are directly transferred to the target CNN model used for MI EEG signal classification. Then, front-layers parameters in the target model are frozen, while later-layers parameters are fine-tuned by the target MI dataset. The target dataset is composed of time-frequency spectrum images of EEG signals. The performance of the proposed framework is verified on the public benchmark dataset 2b from the BCI competition IV. The experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the accuracy and efficiency performance of EEG signal classification compared with traditional methods, including support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and standard CNN.","topic":"Data-Enabled Intelligence for Digital Health","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772136/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","volume":"7","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2019","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18914218","htmlLink":"/document/8772136/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Deep Transfer Convolutional Neural Network Framework for EEG Signal Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573257 and 71690234"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Deep Transfer Convolutional Neural Network Framework for EEG Signal Classification","sourcePdf":"access-xu-2930958-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11463S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8600701","topics":["Data-Enabled Intelligence for Digital Health"],"articleId":"8772136","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8772146,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Masoumi","affiliation":["Electronic Materials Laboratory, K.

It has been shown that this technical problem can be solved by utilizing the zero current technique of measurement. Here, an apparatus for the simultaneous measurement of the Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistance of bulk and thin-film samples using zero current measurement technique is presented, which automatically measures these quantities at different temperature profiles at steady-state, quasi-steady-state, and transient conditions in different atmospheres. Thick-film tin oxide microheaters are utilized to provide the desired temperature gradient along with the sample from room temperature up to 1200 K, and zero current method is used to eliminate errors originating from the high internal resistance of the sample. As examples, Seebeck voltages and electrical resistances are measured on the bulk and thin-film zinc oxide samples with internal resistances in the megohm ($\\text{M}\\Omega$ ) range. Operating the device for measurements involving time-varying temperature gradients is demonstrated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8772146/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2020","publicationDate":"June 2020","accessionNumber":"19610740","volume":"69","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Apparatus for Seebeck Coefficient Measurements on High-Resistance Bulk and Thin-film Samples","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Apparatus for Seebeck Coefficient Measurements on High-Resistance Bulk and Thin-film Samples","sourcePdf":"tim-masoumi-2931066-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158076S","chronDate":"June  2020","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9091650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9091650","articleId":"8772146","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8772148,"authors":[{"name":"Shang-Yuan Chang","affiliation":["MediaTek Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8818466/8772148/chang-2927839-small.gif","p":["Shang-Yuan Chang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the M.S. degree in electronics engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2015.

A promising approach for low-power computing at high bitrates is integrated photonic reservoir computing. In the past though, the feasible reservoir size and computational power of integrated photonic reservoirs have been limited by hardware constraints. An alternative solution to building larger reservoirs is the combination of several small reservoirs to match or exceed the performance of a single bigger one. This paper summarizes our efforts to increase the available computational power by combining multiple reservoirs into a single computing architecture. We investigate several possible combination techniques and evaluate their performance using the classic XOR and header recognition tasks as well as the well-known Santa Fe chaotic laser prediction task. Our findings suggest that a new paradigm of feeding a reservoir's output into the readout structure of the next one shows consistently good results for various tasks as well as for both electrical and optical readouts and coupling schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2019","accessionNumber":"18881116","externalId":"7700611","htmlLink":"/document/8772153/","displayDocTitle":"Improving Time Series Recognition and Prediction With Networks and Ensembles of Passive Photonic Reservoirs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU Horizon 2020 PHRESCO Project","grantNumber":"688579"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Time Series Recognition and Prediction With Networks and Ensembles of Passive Photonic Reservoirs","sourcePdf":"jstqe-freiberger-2929699-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082611S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"8764697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8764697","articleId":"8772153","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8772157,"authors":[{"name":"Federico Fries","affiliation":["Temasek Laboratories, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/8874593/8772157/fries-2931002-small.gif","p":["Federico Fries (M\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) in 2016.","He has conducted research in soft robotics for over five years.

In this work, we focus on the design of compact rotation speed sensors (RSS) and air flow sensors (AFS) that can be integrated into nature-inspired monocopters UAVs which generate lift by spinning at high frequencies. Combining barometric sensors and sensing elements embedded into soft elastomers, compact, accurate, reliable, and low power sensors that can measure rotation and air flow speed can be fabricated. Through numerical analysis and design, it is possible to customize the sensor to measure rotation speed or air flow at specific operating ranges. The AFS was experimentally capable of measuring airflow speeds up to 60 m/s, a range in which anemometers commonly saturate at. Consequently, the developed RSS can measure frequencies up to 10 Hz accurately, whereas inertia measurement units (IMUs) saturate at 5.5 Hz. Finally, the RSS sensors were mounted on a monocopter prototype, to evaluate and assess the sensors under actual flying conditions, where the UAV's movements were tracked by an onboard flight controller's (Pixracer) in-built IMU as well as a high accuracy external optical motion capture system (OptiTrack). The RSS proved to be a reliable alternative to IMUs for navigation control of Monocopters.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2019.2931002","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/8874593/08772157.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2019.2931002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8874593","startPage":"10298","endPage":"10307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Compact Rotational Speed and Air Flow Sensor for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8772157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Compact Rotational Speed and Air Flow Sensor for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15, 15 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772157/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"22","publicationDate":"15 Nov.15, 2019","accessionNumber":"19062792","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8772157/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Temasek Laboratories Defence Innovation Research Programme (DIRP)","grantNumber":"IGDSP1502041"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007040","fundingName":"Singapore University of Technology and Design"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of a Compact Rotational Speed and Air Flow Sensor for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","sourcePdf":"jsen-foong-2931002-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110457S","chronDate":"Nov.15, 15 2019","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8874593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8874593","articleId":"8772157","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8772166,"authors":[{"name":"Joengju Sohn","affiliation":["School of Computing, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejon, Republic of Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/9512528/8772166/sohn-2930977-small.gif","p":["Jeongju Sohn received the BSc degree in computer engineering from Ewha Womans University and the MSc degree in computer science from KAIST.

Spectrum Based Fault Localisation (SBFL), a coverage based approach, has been widely studied in many researches as a promising localisation technique. Recently, however, it has been proven that SBFL techniques have reached the limit of further improvement. To overcome the limitation, we extend SBFL with code and change metrics that have been mainly studied in defect prediction, such as size, age, and churn. FLUCCS, our fault learn-to-rank localisation technique, employs both existing SBFL formul\u00e6 and these metrics as input. We investigate the effect of employing code and change metrics for fault localisation using four different learn-to-rank techniques: Genetic Programming, Gaussian Process Modelling, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. We evaluate the performance of FLUCCS with 386 real world faults collected from \n<monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Defects4J</monospace>\n repository. The results show that FLUCCS with code and change metrics places 144 faults at the top and 304 faults within the top ten. This is a significant improvement over the state-of-art SBFL formul\u00e6, which can locate 65 and 212 faults at the top and within the top ten, respectively. We also investigate the feasibility of cross-project transfer learning of fault localisation. The results show that, while there exist project-specific properties that can be exploited for better localisation per project, ranking models learnt from one project can be applied to others without significant loss of effectiveness.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9512528","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/32/9512528/08772166.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2019.2930977","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2019.2930977","startPage":"1605","endPage":"1625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Empirical Evaluation of Fault Localisation Using Code and Change Metrics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772166/","displayDocTitle":"Empirical Evaluation of Fault Localisation Using Code and Change Metrics","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8772166/","volume":"47","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2021","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"NRF-2016R1C1B1011042"},{"fundingName":"Next-Generation Information Computing Development Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2017M3C4A7068179"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Empirical Evaluation of Fault Localisation Using Code and Change Metrics","sourcePdf":"tse-sohn-2930977-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.276635S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"9512528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"9512528","articleId":"8772166","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8772170,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua Robertson","affiliation":["University of Strathclyde, Technology and Innovation Centre, Glasgow, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Joshua Robertson was born in Glasgow, U.K., in 1994.

We also describe diverse approaches, based on optical or electronic excitation techniques, for the activation/inhibition of sub-ns spiking signals in VCSEL-Neurons. We report our work demonstrating the communication of spiking patterns between VCSEL-Neurons toward future implementations of optical neuromorphic networks. Furthermore, new findings show that VCSEL-Neurons can perform multiple neuro-inspired spike processing tasks. We experimentally demonstrate photonic spiking memory modules using single and mutually coupled VCSEL-Neurons. Additionally, the ultrafast emulation of neuronal circuits in the retina using VCSEL-Neuron systems is demonstrated experimentally for the first time to our knowledge. Our results are obtained with off-the-shelf VCSELs operating at the telecom wavelengths of 1310 and 1550 nm. This makes our approach fully compatible with current optical network and data center technologies, hence offering great potentials for future ultrafast neuromorphic laser-neuron networks for new paradigms in brain-inspired computing and artificial intelligence.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward Neuromorphic Photonic Networks of Ultrafast Spiking Laser Neurons","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2019.2931215","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2944/8764697/08772170.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2019.2931215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8764697","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8772170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772170/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2020","displayDocTitle":"Toward Neuromorphic Photonic Networks of Ultrafast Spiking Laser Neurons","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8772170/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2019","externalId":"7700715","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2020","accessionNumber":"18900045","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007297","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research Global","grantNumber":"ONRGNICOP-N62909-18-1-2027"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission","grantNumber":"828841-ChipAI-H2020-FETOPEN-2018-2020"},{"fundingName":"EPSRC Doctoral Training Partnership","grantNumber":"EP/N509760"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Neuromorphic Photonic Networks of Ultrafast Spiking Laser Neurons","sourcePdf":"jstqe-hurtado-2931215-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098211S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"8764697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8764697","articleId":"8772170","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8772172,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Hwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, uT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8772172/kim-2930990-small.gif","p":["Ji-Hwan Kim received the B.S. degree in information and communications engineering from Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2018, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. degree with the Department of Information and Communications Engineering.

Since the basic concept of power domain NOMA divides user data by the difference of power, successive interference cancellation (SIC) is necessary to extract user data. In the process of SIC calculation, the error propagation has occurred. Therefore, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) decreases as the number of user entity increases in a power domain NOMA system. In order to mitigate the inter-user interference, data are allocated to subcarriers with an instantaneous user grouping scheme. With the subcarrier structure of the instantaneous user grouping scheme, this paper proposes receive diversity to improve the bit error rate (BER). However, since the diversity method decreases the sum capacity of the system, a power adaptation method is also proposed to compensate the sum capacity. The simulation results show that the proposed method improves the BER performance than the conventional scheme and increases sum capacity that is decreased by the receiver diversity scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08772172.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","startPage":"102867","endPage":"102875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Enhancement Using Receive Diversity With Power Adaptation in the NOMA System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8772172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Enhancement Using Receive Diversity With Power Adaptation in the NOMA System","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772172/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"7","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18880602","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8772172/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010418","fundingName":"Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion"},{"fundingName":"Korea Government (MSIT) (Development of Immersive Signage Based on Variable Transparency and Multiple Layers)","grantNumber":"2017-0-00217"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, through the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) Support Program supervised by IITP","grantNumber":"IITP-2019-2018-0-01423"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Performance Enhancement Using Receive Diversity With Power Adaptation in the NOMA System","sourcePdf":"access-song-2930990-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084229S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8772172","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8772177,"authors":[{"name":"Zhangqin Huang","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8772177/huang-2931161-small.gif","p":["Zhangqin Huang received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 1986, 1989, and 2000, respectively.

An increasing number of binary multipliers belonging to a DSP slice usually demonstrate that it has the capacity to process as many multiplication operations as possible in one clock cycle. In order to fully utilize the DSP resource, in this paper, we propose a novel DSP slice optimization method to achieve parallel multiplication on single DSP slice, namely PMSDS. First, the PMSDS splits multiplicators into two separate parts, i.e., valid bits and vacant bits, using a customized polynomial algebra method. Then, the PMSDS pre-calculates the maximum number of overflow bits combining the above-mentioned polynomial algebra method. Finally, it computes the total multiplicators' bit numbers and parallel the final multiplicators. We also propose an optimization model to find the best parallel solution according to the performance and precision of a single DSP slice. Moreover, we implement a PMSDS-based matrix multiplication algorithm supporting the computing precision dynamically changing. The experiments based on a large-scale and real-world matrix multiplication show that the PMSDS has better performance in latency and resource utilization than the traditional, add-tree, and full-unroll methods and is more outstanding in frequency and dynamic power consumption comparing with the state-of-the-art methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Method of Parallel

In the latest 802.11ac protocol, there are two emerging problems that need to be addressed for the RA. First, 802.11ac supporting more rate selections requires more efforts to find the optimal rate. Finally, 802.11ac supports higher rate. The difference between optimal rate and non-optimal rate can be so great that non-optimal rate would severely deteriorate the throughput of the WLAN. In order to tackle these problems, we develop a novel RA algorithm termed rate adaptation with Thompson sampling (RATS) for stationary and non-stationary channel environments. In this algorithm, we first consider compacting the search space by removing some rates to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. Moreover, inspired by multi-armed bandit problem, we design RA algorithm based on Thompson sampling. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed RATS outperforms the existing method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772181/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","volume":"23","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"19090814","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2019","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8772181/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Rate Adaptation With Thompson Sampling in 802.11ac WLAN","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671073"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate Adaptation With Thompson Sampling in 802.11ac WLAN","sourcePdf":"lcomm-lu-2930976-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076069S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8863555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8863555","articleId":"8772181","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8772186,"authors":[{"name":"Weigao Sun","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","State Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Key Laboratory of Imaging Processing and Intelligence Control, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/9003434/8772186/sun-2931160-small.gif","p":["Weigao Sun received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering and automation from the China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China, in 2015.

In particular, we develop a nonparametric Bayesian framework based on the Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) and variational Bayesian inference (VBI) to establish a probabilistic model for capturing the uncertainties involved with wind generation and load power in power systems. In the proposed setup, the number of components in the mixture model can be automatically and analytically obtained from the consistently updated data. Moreover, we develop an efficient quasi-Monte Carlo sampling method to draw samples from the obtained DPMM, then propose the dynamic data-driven POPF algorithm. Performance of uncertainty modeling framework on publicly available datasets is examined by extensive numerical simulations. Furthermore, the proposed POPF algorithm is verified on multiple IEEE benchmark power systems. Numerical results show the feasibility and superiority of the proposed DPMM-based POPF algorithm for better informed decision-making in power systems with high level of uncertainties.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8772186/","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2020","publicationDate":"March 2020","accessionNumber":"19391839","volume":"11","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Probabilistic Optimal Power Flow With Nonparametric Bayesian Modeling and Inference","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1713203, 51729501, 61751303, 51721092 and 61673189"},{"fundingName":"111 Project on Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Control, China","grantNumber":"B18024"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"HUST: 2019JYCXJJ029"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Probabilistic Optimal Power Flow With Nonparametric Bayesian Modeling and Inference","sourcePdf":"tsg-zhang-2931160-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135093S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"9003434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"9003434","articleId":"8772186","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":8772188,"authors":[{"name":"Shijian Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/8805183/8772188/gao-2929400-small.gif","p":["Shijian Gao received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Nankai University and Peking University in 2014 and 2017, respectively.

However, it is a common exercise to deploy a limited number of radio-frequency (RF) chains at mmWave mMIMO transceivers due to hardware complexity and cost. As a result, the potential multiplexing gain (MG), which is restricted by the smaller number of RF chains at the transmitter and receiver, is markedly compromised. In order to boost the MG and spectral efficiency (SE), we innovatively develop a novel index modulation termed as the generalized beamspace modulation (GBM). The acquisition of (sub-)beamspace is owing to a natural exploitation of the unique features of mmWave mMIMO. Based on the (sub-)beamspace, a complete GBM transceiver is designed and optimized. Unlike existing alternatives that are largely digital based, our GBM is tailored for the hybrid structure of mmWave mMIMO and can, thereby, realize efficient spatial multiplexing despite the limited RF chains. Extensive analyses and simulations have demonstrated remarkable superiority of GBM over existing counterparts in terms of the error performance and SE.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2019.2929400","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/8805183/08772188.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2019.2929400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8805183","startPage":"2029","endPage":"2039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Multiplexing With Limited RF Chains: Generalized Beamspace Modulation (GBM) for mmWave Massive MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8772188","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Multiplexing With Limited RF Chains: Generalized Beamspace Modulation (GBM) for mmWave Massive MIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772188/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"18905291","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8772188/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Project","grantNumber":"2017YFE0121400"},{"fundingName":"Major Project from Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission","grantNumber":"Z181100003218007"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project","grantNumber":"2018ZX03001031"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61622101 and 61571020"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1935915"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Multiplexing With Limited RF Chains: Generalized Beamspace Modulation (GBM) for mmWave Massive MIMO","sourcePdf":"jsac-cheng-2929400-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100664S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"8805183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8805183","articleId":"8772188","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8772193,"authors":[{"name":"Jianqiang Li","affiliation":["Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8924788/8772193/li-2931156-small.gif","p":["Jianqiang Li received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in control theory and applications from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2003 and 2008, respectively.","He is a Professor of Computer Application with the College of Computer and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.

Under this background, the attribute-based encryption (ABE) mechanism is an alternative to fill the drawbacks of the traditional encryption through flexible fine-grained access policy and collusion prevention. However, there exist some security issues when the access policy and file need to be updated in practical applications. And the ABE has the problems of excessive computation and storage costs. In this article, an efficient ciphertext-policy ABE scheme with policy update and file update is proposed in cloud computing. The ciphertext components generated by first encryption can be shared when the policy update and file update happens. It reduces the storage and communication costs of the client, and the computational cost of the PCSP. Moreover, the proposed scheme is proved to be secure under the assumption of decision q-parallel bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent (BDHE). Finally, experimental simulation shows that the proposed scheme is highly efficient in terms of policy update and file update.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Attribute-Based Encryption Scheme With Policy Update and File Update in Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/TII.2019.2931156","startPage":"6500","endPage":"6509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2019.2931156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8924788","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8924788/08772193.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8772193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Attribute-Based Encryption Scheme With Policy Update and File Update in Cloud Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8772193/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2019","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19194770","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61702341, U1713212, 61572330 and 61836005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2019M653043"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Technology University","grantNumber":"1814309011170027"},{"fundingName":"Technology Planning Project of Shenzhen City","grantNumber":"JCYJ20170302143118519, GGFW2018021118145859 and JSGG20180507182904693"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Attribute-Based Encryption Scheme With Policy Update and File Update in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tii-wang-2931156-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109294S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8924788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8924788","articleId":"8772193","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8772194,"authors":[{"name":"Kees A.

Various efficient constructions are presented for block codes that satisfy a combined balance and maximum homopolymer run.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2019.2930970","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8863555/08772194.pdf","startPage":"1676","endPage":"1679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8863555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2019.2930970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Balanced and Maximum Homopolymer-Run Restricted Block Codes for DNA-Based Data Storage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8772194","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Balanced and Maximum Homopolymer-Run Restricted Block Codes for DNA-Based Data Storage","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772194/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19090809","htmlLink":"/document/8772194/","volume":"23","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Singapore MoE Academic Research Fund Tier 2 MOE2016-T2-2-054 and SUTD-ZJU","grantNumber":"ZJURP1500102"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Balanced and Maximum Homopolymer-Run Restricted Block Codes for DNA-Based Data Storage","sourcePdf":"lcomm-immink-2930970-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071072S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8863555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8863555","articleId":"8772194","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8772198,"authors":[{"name":"Changyang She","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8931267/8772198/she-2930983-small.gif","p":["Changyang She (S\u201912\u2013M\u201917) received the B.Eng. degree from the Honors College of Beihang University (BUAA) (formerly, School of Advanced Engineering), Beijing, China, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BUAA, in 2017.","From 2017 to 2018, he was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore.

To reduce communication delay, the fifth generation new radio is adopted in radio access networks. To avoid long queueing delay for short packets from MC-IoT, processor-sharing (PS) servers are deployed at MEC systems, where the service rate of the server is equally allocated to all the packets in the buffer. We derive the distribution of latency experienced by short packets in closed form, and minimize the overall packet loss probability subject to the end-to-end delay requirement. To solve the nonconvex optimization problem, we propose an algorithm that converges to a near optimal solution when the throughput of eMBB services is much higher than MC-IoT services, and extend it into more general scenarios. Furthermore, we derive the optimal solutions in two asymptotic cases: communication or computing is the bottleneck of reliability. The simulation and numerical results validate our analysis and show that the PS server outperforms first-come-first-serve servers.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2019.2930983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8931267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2019.2930983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8931267/08772198.pdf","startPage":"9360","endPage":"9374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Design for Mission-Critical IoT in Mobile Edge Computing Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Design for Mission-Critical IoT in Mobile Edge Computing Systems","volume":"6","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8772198/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19275637","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772198/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council Laureate Fellowship","grantNumber":"FL10100032"},{"fundingName":"SUTD-ZJU Research Collaboration","grantNumber":"SUTDZJU/RES/01/2016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP150104019 and DP190101988"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Design for Mission-Critical IoT in Mobile Edge Computing Systems","sourcePdf":"jiot-she-2930983-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.176689S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8931267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8931267","articleId":"8772198","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8772201,"authors":[{"name":"Hyohyun Nam","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyohyun","lastName":"Nam","orcid":"0000-0002-8090-7811","id":"38577431900"},{"name":"Junsik Park","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Junsik","lastName":"Park","id":"37086993984"},{"name":"Jung-Dong Park","affiliation":["Hanwha Systems, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Dong","lastName":"Park","orcid":"0000-0003-4733-2160","id":"37086993982"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"8772201","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":500},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband communication","Generators","Radio frequency","Compressed sensing","Receivers","Mixers","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","compressed sensing","feedback amplifiers","microwave integrated circuits","microwave oscillators","mixers (circuits)","radio receivers","signal generators","UHF integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["four-channel compressed sensing receiver","broadband receiver chains","double-balanced passive mixer","PRBS generators","broadband LO chain","BiCMOS integrated circuit","subNyquist acquisition","broadband local oscillator chain","pseudorandom bit sequence generators","high local-oscillator-to-intermediate frequency isolation","shunt-shunt feedback amplifier","high-frequency degradation","current 195.0 mA","frequency 2.0 GHz to 18.0 GHz","frequency 700 MHz","bit rate 36 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadband receiver","compressed sensing","BiCMOS"]}],"abstract":"We present an integrated 2-18 GHz four-channel compressed sensing receiver (CSRX), which performs a 128.5\u00d7 sub-Nyquist acquisition with 36-Gb/s pseudorandom bit sequence (PRBS) generators in 0.13-\u03bcm BiCMOS. The integrated four-channel CSRX consists of broadband receiver chains, each of which includes a distributed RF buffer that operates as an active balun at 2-18 GHz, followed by a double-balanced passive mixer for high local-oscillator (LO)-to-intermediate frequency (IF) isolation at the IF band, and a 700-MHz variable gain amplifier (VGA). Four independent 36-Gb/s PRBS generators are integrated to perform the compressed sensing by mixing the PRBS signal as the random modulator. To deliver the generated wideband PRBS signal to the mixer, the LO driver conducts band-equalization by applying a shunt-shunt feedback amplifier to compensate for the high-frequency degradation of the PRBS LO tones through the LO generation stage.

presents a novel approach for the early recognition of the type of a laparoscopic surgery from its video. Early recognition algorithms can be beneficial to the development of \u201csmart\u201d OR systems that can provide automatic context-aware assistance, and also enable quick database indexing. The task is however ridden with challenges specific to videos belonging to the domain of laparoscopy, such as high visual similarity across surgeries and large variations in video durations. To capture the spatio-temporal dependencies in these videos, we choose as our model a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network. We then propose two complementary approaches for improving early recognition performance. The first approach is a CNN fine-tuning method that encourages surgeries to be distinguished based on the initial frames of laparoscopic videos. The second approach, referred to as \u201c Future-State Predicting LSTM,\u201d trains an LSTM to predict information related to future frames, which helps in distinguishing between the different types of surgeries. We evaluate our approaches on a large dataset of 425 laparoscopic videos containing nine types of surgeries (Laparo425), and achieve on average an accuracy of 75% having observed only the first 10 min of a surgery. These results are quite promising from a practical standpoint and also encouraging for other types of image-guided surgeries.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/9023440/08772203.pdf","startPage":"556","endPage":"566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Future-State Predicting LSTM for Early Surgery Type Recognition","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2019.2931158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9023440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2019.2931158","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8772203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772203/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","displayDocTitle":"Future-State Predicting LSTM for Early Surgery Type Recognition","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2020","publicationDate":"March 2020","accessionNumber":"19428491","pubMedId":"31352339","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"39","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8772203/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001665","fundingName":"Agence Nationale de la Recherche","grantNumber":"ANR-11-LABX-0004 and ANR-10-IAHU-02"},{"fundingName":"BPI France","grantNumber":"CONDOR"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Future-State Predicting LSTM for Early Surgery Type Recognition","sourcePdf":"tmi-yengera-2931158-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119003S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"9023440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"9023440","articleId":"8772203","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8772207,"authors":[{"name":"Hao-Tien Lewis Chiang","affiliation":["Robotics at Google, Google AI, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hao-Tien Lewis","lastName":"Chiang","orcid":"0000-0001-5418-6371","id":"37086351930"},{"name":"Jasmine Hsu","affiliation":["Robotics at Google, Google AI, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jasmine","lastName":"Hsu","orcid":"0000-0002-2342-8312","id":"37086942396"},{"name":"Marek Fiser","affiliation":["Robotics at Google, Google AI, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Fiser","id":"37086043135"},{"name":"Lydia Tapia","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Lydia","lastName":"Tapia","orcid":"0000-0002-7822-7091","id":"37564283100"},{"name":"Aleksandra Faust","affiliation":["Robotics at Google, Google AI, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Faust","orcid":"0000-0002-3268-8685","id":"37077144300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-3766"},{"format":"CD","value":"2377-3774"}],"articleNumber":"8772207","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2431},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8772207","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","Robot sensing systems","Training","Noise measurement","Laser radar","Collision avoidance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile robots","robot dynamics","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kinodynamic motion planning","RL policy","subsequent computationally intractable steering","sampling-based planning","efficient kinodynamic motion planner","machine learning","long-range planning","deep reinforcement learning","obstacle-avoiding policy","kinodynamic systems","local planner policy","reachability estimator","RL-RRT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Motion and path planning","learning and adaptive systems","deep learning in robotics and automation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LRA.2019.2931199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7083369/8764082/08772207.pdf","startPage":"4298","endPage":"4305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2019.2931199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8764082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RL-RRT: Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Learning Reachability Estimators From RL Policies","abstract":"This letter addresses two challenges facing samplingbased kinodynamic motion planning: a way to identify good candidate states for local transitions and the subsequent computationally intractable steering between these candidate states. Through the combination of sampling-based planning, a Rapidly Exploring Randomized Tree (RRT) and an efficient kinodynamic motion planner through machine learning, we propose an efficient solution to long-range planning for kinodynamic motion planning. First, we use deep reinforcement learning to learn an obstacle-avoiding policy that maps a robot's sensor observations to actions, which is used as a local planner during planning and as a controller during execution. Second, we train a reachability estimator in a supervised manner, which predicts the RL policy's time to reach a state in the presence of obstacles. Lastly, we introduce RL-RRT that uses the RL policy as a local planner, and the reachability estimator as the distance function to bias tree-growth towards promising regions. We evaluate our method on three kinodynamic systems, including physical robot experiments. Results across all three robots tested indicate that RL-RRT outperforms state of the art kinodynamic planners in efficiency, and also provides a shorter path finish time than a steering function free method. The learned local planner policy and accompanying reachability estimator demonstrate transferability to the previously unseen experimental environments, making RL-RRT fast because the expensive computations are replaced with simple neural network inference.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7083369/8764082/8772207-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772207/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8772207/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2019","accessionNumber":"18917567","volume":"4","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"RL-RRT: Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Learning Reachability Estimators From RL Policies","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006785","fundingName":"Google"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IIS-1528047 and IIS-1553266"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"RL-RRT: Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Learning Reachability Estimators From RL Policies","sourcePdf":"lra-chiang-2931199-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090249S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7083369","isNumber":"8764082","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7083369","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8764082","articleId":"8772207","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8772209,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Sampedro","affiliation":["Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Madrid, Comunidad de Madrid, ES"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8772209/sampe-2931144-small.gif","p":["Carlos Sampedro received the B.Sc. degree in industrial engineering (major in industrial electronics), obtaining the best marks degree award, and the master\u2019s degree in automation and robotics from the Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid (UPM), Madrid, Spain, in July 2011 and 2014, respectively.

To this aim, the proposed system integrates one component responsible for insulator string segmentation and two components in charge of its diagnosis. The insulator string segmentation component consists of a novel fully convolutional network (FCN) architecture, termed Up-Net, which enhances the capabilities of the state-of-the-art U-Net network by introducing new skip connections at certain levels of the architecture. Furthermore, we propose a second variant of the Up-Net network by training it within a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework. The capabilities of the proposed Up-Net variants are incremented by the application of data augmentation and transfer learning techniques, achieving accurate segmentation of the insulator string elements (i.e., discs and caps). Regarding the insulator string diagnosis, we design a convolutional neural network (CNN) which takes as input the mask generated by the insulator string segmentation component and is capable of identifying the absence of a variable number of discs. The second diagnosis component consists of a novel strategy which integrates a Siamese convolutional neural network (SCNN) designed for modeling the similarity between adjacent discs and allowing the detection of several types of disc defects using the same model. The proposed system has been extensively evaluated in several video sequences from real aerial inspections of high-voltage insulators, showing robust insulator recognition and diagnosis capabilities.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08772209.pdf","startPage":"101283","endPage":"101308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning-Based System for Automatic Recognition and Diagnosis of Electrical Insulator Strings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8772209","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772209/","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning-Based System for Automatic Recognition and Diagnosis of Electrical Insulator Strings","volume":"7","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18880601","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8772209/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004837","fundingName":"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci\u00f3n","grantNumber":"INNPACTO IPT-2012-0491-120000"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006280","fundingName":"Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda","grantNumber":"MCYT DPI2010-20751-C02-01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003759","fundingName":"Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid"},{"fundingName":"MONCLOA Campus of International Excellence"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Deep Learning-Based System for Automatic Recognition and Diagnosis of Electrical Insulator Strings","sourcePdf":"access-sampedroperez-2931144-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111949S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8772209","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8772210,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Tian","affiliation":["Institute of Measurement and Control Systems, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/9151912/8772210/tian-2928963-small.gif","p":["Wei Tian received the B.Sc. degree in mechatronics engineering from Tongji University, Shanghai, China, in 2010, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and information technology and the Ph.D. degree from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany, in May 2013 and in January 2019, respectively.","Since October 2013, he has been with the Institute of Measurement and Control Systems, KIT.

One typical tracking approach is the discriminative tracker, which branches into two main categories: the correlation filter (CF) and the convolutional neural network (CNN). However, most of the current researches consider both categories as two separate techniques and only rely on one of them. Thus, a dense cooperation between the CF and the CNN still remains less discovered and the question of how to effectively join both techniques to further boost the tracking performance is still open. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a collaborative architecture which incorporates models constructed with both techniques and dynamically aggregates their response maps for target inference. By an alternating optimization, both models are learned on each other's errors to persistently improve the classification power of the whole tracker. For further efficiency, we present a faster solver for our utilized CF and an analytical solution for dynamic model weighting. Through experiments on standard benchmarks, we reveal the influence of key factors on the joint learning architecture and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2019.2928963","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/9151912/08772210.pdf","startPage":"3423","endPage":"3435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2019.2928963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9151912","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8772210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Collaborative Visual Tracking Architecture for Correlation Filter and Convolutional Neural Network Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772210/","displayDocTitle":"A Collaborative Visual Tracking Architecture for Correlation Filter and Convolutional Neural Network Learning","volume":"21","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8772210/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2020","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2020","accessionNumber":"19950647","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research and Development Plan in Key Areas of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2018B010108004 and 2019B090919003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Collaborative Visual Tracking Architecture for Correlation Filter and Convolutional Neural Network Learning","sourcePdf":"tits-tian-2928963-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092554S","chronDate":"Aug.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"9151912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","xplore-issue":"9151912","articleId":"8772210","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8772211,"authors":[{"name":"Zonghao Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Zonghao","lastName":"Huang","orcid":"0000-0002-7880-7272","id":"37086278486"},{"name":"Rui Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Hu","id":"37087039337"},{"name":"Yuanxiong Guo","affiliation":["DDepartment of Information Systems and Cyber Security, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yuanxiong","lastName":"Guo","orcid":"0000-0003-2241-125X","id":"37085344617"},{"name":"Eric Chan-Tin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Chan-Tin","orcid":"0000-0001-8367-5836","id":"38308616400"},{"name":"Yanmin Gong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yanmin","lastName":"Gong","orcid":"0000-0002-1761-2834","id":"37085358619"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-6013"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6021"}],"articleNumber":"8772211","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2129},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a widely used tool for machine learning in distributed settings where a machine learning model is trained over distributed data sources through an interactive process of local computation and message passing. Such an iterative process could cause privacy concerns of data owners. The goal of this paper is to provide differential privacy for ADMM-based distributed machine learning. Prior approaches on differentially private ADMM exhibit low utility under high privacy guarantee and assume the objective functions of the learning problems to be smooth and strongly convex. To address these concerns, we propose a novel differentially private ADMM-based distributed learning algorithm called DP-ADMM, which combines an approximate augmented Lagrangian function with time-varying Gaussian noise addition in the iterative process to achieve higher utility for general objective functions under the same differential privacy guarantee. We also apply the moments accountant method to analyze the end-to-end privacy loss. The theoretical analysis shows that the DP-ADMM can be applied to a wider class of distributed learning problems, is provably convergent, and offers an explicit utility-privacy tradeoff. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to provide explicit convergence and utility properties for differentially private ADMM-based distributed learning algorithms. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can achieve good convergence and model accuracy under high end-to-end differential privacy guarantee.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/8833568/08772211.pdf","startPage":"1002","endPage":"1012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2019.2931068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2019.2931068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8833568","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8772211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DP-ADMM: ADMM-Based Distributed Learning With Differential Privacy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Differential privacy","Machine learning","Convergence","Convex functions","Standards","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","convergence","data privacy","Gaussian noise","iterative methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","message passing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DP-ADMM","distributed data sources","interactive process","local computation","message passing","iterative process","data owners","approximate augmented Lagrangian function","time-varying Gaussian noise addition","end-to-end privacy loss","explicit utility-privacy tradeoff","explicit convergence","alternating direction method of multipliers","differentially private ADMM-based distributed learning algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine learning","ADMM","distributed algorithms","privacy","differential privacy","and moments accountant"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/10206/8833568/8772211-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"DP-ADMM: ADMM-Based Distributed Learning With Differential Privacy","volume":"15","htmlLink":"/document/8772211/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2020","accessionNumber":"19043300","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1850523"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"DP-ADMM: ADMM-Based Distributed Learning With Differential Privacy","sourcePdf":"tifs-gong-2931068-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109775S","chronDate":"2020","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"8833568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8833568","articleId":"8772211","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8772215,"authors":[{"name":"Haobin Shi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/9274447/8772215/shi-2931219-small.gif","p":["Haobin Shi received the Ph.D. degree in computer science and technology from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 2008.","He is an Associate Professor with the School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University and a Visiting Scholar with Electrical Engineering Department, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

This article proposes a fuzzy adaptive method for decoupled IBVS that allows the efficient control of a wheeled mobile robot (WMR). To address the under-actuated dynamics of the WMR, a decoupled controller is used and translation and rotation are decoupled by using two independent servoing gains, instead of the single servoing gain that is used for traditional IBVS. To reduce the effect of image noise, this article develops an improved bagging method for the decoupled controller that calculates the inverse kinematics and does not use the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse method. To improve convergence, improved Q-learning is used to adaptively adjust the mixture parameter for the image Jacobian matrix (IQ-IBVS). This allows the mixture parameter can be adjusted while the robot moves under the influence of servo control. A fuzzy method is used to tune the learning rate for the IQ-IBVS method, which ensures effective learning. The results of simulation and experiments show that the proposed method performs better than other methods, in terms of convergence.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2019.2931219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2019.2931219","startPage":"3229","endPage":"3243","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/9274447/08772215.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9274447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fuzzy Adaptive Approach to Decoupled Visual Servoing for a Wheeled Mobile Robot","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"A Fuzzy Adaptive Approach to Decoupled Visual Servoing for a Wheeled Mobile Robot","volume":"28","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2020","accessionNumber":"20209849","publicationDate":"Dec. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8772215/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"6197022343"},{"fundingName":"Shaanxi Province Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018GY-187"},{"fundingName":"Seed Foundation of Innovation and Creation for Graduate Students in Northwestern Polytechnical University","grantNumber":"ZZ2018169"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fuzzy Adaptive Approach to Decoupled Visual Servoing for a Wheeled Mobile Robot","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-hwang-2931219-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11761S","chronDate":"Dec.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"9274447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"9274447","articleId":"8772215","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8772216,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Weiss","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8809345/8772216/weiss-2929473-small.gif","p":["Amir Weiss (S\u201917) received the B.Sc.

On one hand, a \u201cmaximally separating\u201d solution, providing the minimal attainable interference-to-source-ratio (ISR), would often suffer from significant residual noise. On the other hand, optimal minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation would yield estimates that are the \u201cclosest possible\u201d to the true sources, often at the cost of compromised ISR. In this paper, we consider noisy mixtures of temporally diverse stationary Gaussian sources in a semi-blind scenario, which conveniently lends itself to either one of these objectives. We begin by deriving the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of the unknown (deterministic) parameters of the model: the mixing matrix and the (possibly different) noise variances in each sensor. We derive the likelihood equations for these parameters, as well as the corresponding Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound, and propose an iterative solution for obtaining the ML estimates (MLEs). Based on these MLEs, the asymptotically optimal \u201cmaximally separating\u201d solution can be readily obtained. However, we also present the ML-based MMSE estimate of the sources, alongside a frequency-domain-based computationally efficient scheme, exploiting their stationarity. We show that this estimate is asymptotically optimal and attains the (oracle) MMSE lower bound. Furthermore, for non-Gaussian signals, we show that this estimate serves as a quasi-ML-based linear MMSE (LMMSE) estimate, and attains the (oracle) LMMSE lower bound asymptotically. Empirical results of three simulation experiments are presented, corroborating our analytical derivations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Mathematical model","Maximum likelihood estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency-domain analysis","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","Gaussian processes","independent component analysis","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","matrix algebra","maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["residual noise","maximum-likelihood estimation","quasiML-based linear MMSE estimate","nonGaussian signals","frequency-domain-based computationally efficient scheme","ML-based MMSE estimate","ML estimates","likelihood equations","noise variances","unknown parameters","temporally diverse stationary Gaussian sources","compromised ISR","optimal minimum mean square error estimation","minimal attainable interference-to-source-ratio","independent component analysis","noisy mixtures","maximum likelihood-based minimum mean square error separation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Semi-blind source separation","independent component analysis","maximum likelihood","minimum mean square error","Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8809345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2019.2929473","startPage":"5032","endPage":"5045","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8809345/08772216.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2019.2929473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Maximum Likelihood-Based Minimum Mean Square Error Separation and Estimation of Stationary Gaussian Sources From Noisy Mixtures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Maximum Likelihood-Based Minimum Mean Square Error Separation and Estimation of Stationary Gaussian Sources From Noisy Mixtures","accessionNumber":"18937552","publicationDate":"1 Oct.1, 2019","volume":"67","issue":"19","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8772216/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1, 1 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Maximum Likelihood-Based Minimum Mean Square Error Separation and Estimation of Stationary Gaussian Sources From Noisy Mixtures","sourcePdf":"tsp-weiss-2929473-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.183903S","chronDate":"Oct.1, 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8809345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8809345","articleId":"8772216","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8772218,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Afolabi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/9210948/8772218/afola-2930059-small.gif","p":["Ibrahim Afolabi received the bachelor's degree from the VAMK University of Applied Sciences, Vaasa, Finland, in 2013, and the master's degree from the School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Finland, in 2017.

Developing a scalable system for the orchestration of end-to-end (E2E) mobile network slices requires careful planning and very reliable algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel E2E Network Slicing Orchestration System (NSOS) and a Dynamic Auto-Scaling Algorithm (DASA) for it. Our NSOS relies strongly on the foundation of a hierarchical architecture that incorporates dedicated entities per domain to manage every segment of the mobile network from the access, to the transport and core network part for a scalable orchestration of federated network slices. The DASA enables the NSOS to autonomously adapt its resources to changes in the demand for slice orchestration requests (SORs) while enforcing a given mean overall time taken by the NSOS to process any SOR. The proposed DASA includes both proactive and reactive resource provisioning techniques. The proposed resource dimensioning heuristic algorithm of the DASA is based on a queuing model for the NSOS, which consists of an open network of G/G/m queues. Finally, we validate the proper operation and evaluate the performance of our DASA solution for the NSOS by means of system-level simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2019.2930059","startPage":"2594","endPage":"2608","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/9210948/08772218.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2019.2930059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9210948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Resource Provisioning of a Scalable E2E Network Slicing Orchestration System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network slicing","Heuristic algorithms","5G mobile communication","Computer architecture","Queueing analysis","Dynamic scheduling","Time factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","queueing theory","resource allocation","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic resource provisioning","virtualized resources","end-to-end mobile network slices","NSOS","dynamic auto-scaling algorithm","DASA","scalable orchestration","federated network slices","slice orchestration requests","proactive resource provisioning techniques","reactive resource provisioning techniques","open network","scalable E2E network slicing orchestration system","queuing model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network slicing","dimensioning","orchestration","5G","queuing model","analytical model","auto-scaling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8772218/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 1 2020","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Resource Provisioning of a Scalable E2E Network Slicing Orchestration System","volume":"19","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/8772218/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2020","accessionNumber":"20022243","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program","grantNumber":"723172 and 761898"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"311654"},{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport","grantNumber":"13/04833"},{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the European Regional Development Fund","grantNumber":"TEC2016-76795-C6-4-R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Resource Provisioning of a Scalable E2E Network Slicing Orchestration System","sourcePdf":"tmc-afolabi-2930059-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160082S","chronDate":"Nov. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"9210948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"9210948","articleId":"8772218","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":8776483,"authors":[{"name":"Hang-Ting Lue","affiliation":["Macronix International Co., Ltd., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hang-Ting","lastName":"Lue","id":"37275349600"},{"name":"C.

Net P/E memory window gain of >1.3V is observed for devices using ETB poly-Si. This substantial gain can be explained by the \u201cquantum confinement\u201d that raises effective Si bandgap and in turn reduces the tunneling barrier height. Simulation model has been validated and it shows equivalent barrier height reduction of ~0.16eV and 0.07eV for electron and hole, respectively for Tsi=3nm. Meanwhile, the extremely-thin body poly silicon channel can improve S.S. to nearly 250mV/dec, which is close to bulk 2D Flash devices. However, the Idsat is degraded to only 160nA for Tsi=3nm, which is attributed to the larger effective mass or higher contact resistance. The degraded Idsat can be accommodated by lower Isense<;30nA for page buffer circuit tuning. Random telegraph noise (RTN) is significantly reduced by extremely-thin body, and it shows tighter program-verify (PV) distribution in the MLC/TLC operation.","doi":"10.23919/VLSIT.2019.8776483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8776475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/VLSIT.2019.8776483","publicationTitle":"2019 Symposium on VLSI Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 Symposium on VLSI Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766306/8776475/08776483.pdf","startPage":"T210","endPage":"T211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advantage of Extremely-thin Body (Tsi~3nm) Device to Boost the Memory Window for 3D NAND Flash","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 June 2019","displayDocTitle":"Advantage of Extremely-thin Body (Tsi~3nm) Device to Boost the Memory Window for 3D NAND Flash","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 June 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8776483/","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18865308","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776483/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advantage of Extremely-thin Body (Tsi~3nm) Device to Boost the Memory Window for 3D NAND Flash","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"T16-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087782S","chronDate":"9-14 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766306","isNumber":"8776475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766306","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8776475","articleId":"8776483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"The Japan Society of Applied Physics","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8776484,"authors":[{"name":"William Chen","affiliation":["Royal Institute of Technology KTH/ICT, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086917041"},{"name":"Bill Bottoms","affiliation":["Royal Institute of Technology KTH/ICT, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Bill","lastName":"Bottoms","id":"37374986500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-86348-719-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1530-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-9682"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"0743-1562"}],"articleNumber":"8776484","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":580},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Industries","Companies","Consumer electronics","Technological innovation","Photonics","Integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational fluid dynamics","Mie scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous integration roadmap","Moore law plateauing","market segments","continued progress","digital economy","tech company disruption","triple inflection point"]}],"abstract":"Our industry has reinvented itself through multiple disruptive changes in market, products, and technology.

We integrate the computing controller and nonlinear activation function on-chip to compute convolutional or fully-connected neural network. ISNA merges A/D conversion and activation computation by leveraging its nonlinear working region. This eliminates the need for additional circuits to realize nonlinearity and reduces area by 43.7\u00d7 w.r.t. the ADC scheme. The activation precision of ISNA can be configured from 1 to 8 bits to balance throughput, accuracy and power efficiency. The measurement of 4-layer LeNet shows such optimization improves 23.1% of computing speed via compromising a 2.5% relative accuracy drop. The proposed nvCIM PE achieves 16.9 TOPS/W power efficiency and a maximum spike frequency of 99.24 MHz.","doi":"10.23919/VLSIT.2019.8776485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/VLSIT.2019.8776485","publicationTitle":"2019 Symposium on VLSI Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 Symposium on VLSI Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766306/8776475/08776485.pdf","startPage":"T86","endPage":"T87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8776475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RRAM-based Spiking Nonvolatile Computing-In-Memory Processing Engine with Precision-Configurable In Situ Nonlinear Activation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 June 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"RRAM-based Spiking Nonvolatile Computing-In-Memory Processing Engine with Precision-Configurable In Situ Nonlinear Activation","conferenceDate":"9-14 June 2019","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18865270","htmlLink":"/document/8776485/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RRAM-based Spiking Nonvolatile Computing-In-Memory Processing Engine with Precision-Configurable In Situ Nonlinear Activation","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"T8-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063567S","chronDate":"9-14 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766306","isNumber":"8776475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766306","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8776475","articleId":"8776485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"The Japan Society of Applied Physics","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8776486,"authors":[{"name":"C.C.

We exploit nano-scale ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) memristors with inherent analogue stochastic switching arranged in selector-less crossbars to demonstrate an analogue in-memory RL system, which, via a hardware-friendly algorithm, is capable of learning behavior policies. We show that commonly undesirable stochastic conductance switching is actually, in moderation, a beneficial property which promotes policy finding via a process akin to random search. We experimentally demonstrate path-finding based on reinforcement, and solve a standard control problem of balancing a pole on a cart via simulation, outperforming similar deterministic RL systems.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8776500","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Memristors","Reinforcement learning","Stochastic processes","Memory management","Very large scale integration","Threshold voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical engineering computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","memristors","mobile computing","stochastic processes","tunnelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moderately-stochastic conductance switching","mobile deployment","von-Neumann computing architecture","in-memory computing","local learning paradigms","nanoscale ferroelectric tunnel junction memristors","analogue in-memory RL system","hardware-friendly algorithm","in-memory reinforcement learning","inherent analogue stochastic switching","learning behavior policies","undesirable stochastic conductance switching"]}],"publicationTitle":"2019 Symposium on VLSI Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 Symposium on VLSI Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766306/8776475/08776500.pdf","startPage":"T22","endPage":"T23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8776475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/VLSIT.2019.8776500","doi":"10.23919/VLSIT.2019.8776500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In-memory Reinforcement Learning with Moderately-Stochastic Conductance Switching of Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 June 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776500/","displayDocTitle":"In-memory Reinforcement Learning with Moderately-Stochastic Conductance Switching of Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 June 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18865268","htmlLink":"/document/8776500/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-memory Reinforcement Learning with Moderately-Stochastic Conductance Switching of Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"T2-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04736S","chronDate":"9-14 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766306","isNumber":"8776475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766306","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8776475","articleId":"8776500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"The Japan Society of Applied Physics","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8776502,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A high dielectric constant of 30.4 is achieved on AFE HZO. The polarization switching speed of FE and AFE HZO, associated with C-V frequency dispersion, are also studied.

During read operation, only one gate is turned on to decrease the area ratio (AFE/AIL) of ferroelectric layer to insulator layer, which increases MW and read current ratio (IRead-1/IRead-0). During write operation (program/erase), both two gates are turned on to increase AFE/AIL, which decreases MW, thereby resulting in lower write voltage (VWrite). Compared to FeFET, SG-FeFET (1) Demonstrates lower VWrite(=1.85V) and 59.5% reduction in write energy at fixed IRead-1/IRead-0;(2) Exhibits lower read energy (-11.3%) and higher IRead-1/IRead-0(=8.6E6) at fixed VWrite;(3) Allows random access and eliminates half-select disturb; (4) Preserves higher endurance due to lower VWrite and charge trapping. SG-FeFET as synaptic device also exhibits superior symmetry and linearity for potentiation and depression process.","doi":"10.23919/VLSIT.2019.8776555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/VLSIT.2019.8776555","startPage":"T134","endPage":"T135","publicationTitle":"2019 Symposium on VLSI Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 Symposium on VLSI Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766306/8776475/08776555.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8776475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Split-Gate FeFET (SG-FeFET) with Dynamic Memory Window Modulation for Non-Volatile Memory and Neuromorphic Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776555/","conferenceDate":"9-14 June 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 June 2019","displayDocTitle":"Split-Gate FeFET (SG-FeFET) with Dynamic Memory Window Modulation for Non-Volatile Memory and Neuromorphic Applications","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18865295","publicationDate":"June 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8776555/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Split-Gate FeFET (SG-FeFET) with Dynamic Memory Window Modulation for Non-Volatile Memory and Neuromorphic Applications","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"T12-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063801S","chronDate":"9-14 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766306","isNumber":"8776475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766306","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8776475","articleId":"8776555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"The Japan Society of Applied Physics","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8776559,"authors":[{"name":"S.

artificial neural network (ANN) built by highly manufacturable STT-MRAM technology. The most compact analog integrate-and-fire neuron reported to date is developed based on the back-hopping oscillation in magnetic tunnel junctions. This novel device is unique because it performs numerous essential neural functions simultaneously, including current integration, voltage spike generation, state reset, and 4-bit precision. The device itself is also a stochastic binary synapse, and thus eases the implementation of the compact all-spin ANN with high accuracy for online training.","doi":"10.23919/VLSIT.2019.8776569","publicationTitle":"2019 Symposium on VLSI Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 Symposium on VLSI Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766306/8776475/08776569.pdf","startPage":"T34","endPage":"T35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/VLSIT.2019.8776569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8776475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extremely Compact Integrate-and-Fire STT-MRAM Neuron: A Pathway toward All-Spin Artificial Deep Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Extremely Compact Integrate-and-Fire STT-MRAM Neuron: A Pathway toward All-Spin Artificial Deep Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18852118","publicationDate":"June 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8776569/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776569/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 June 2019","conferenceDate":"9-14 June 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extremely Compact Integrate-and-Fire STT-MRAM Neuron: A Pathway toward All-Spin Artificial Deep Neural Network","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"T3-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047819S","chronDate":"9-14 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766306","isNumber":"8776475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766306","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8776475","articleId":"8776569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"The Japan Society of Applied Physics","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8776570,"authors":[{"name":"O.

By setting the delay between program and reading phase to as small as 10\u03bcs, we found that several mechanisms are mixed when stored electrons are emitted during short term retention of 3-D NAND Flash. For the first time, we have confirmed that the charge loss mechanisms consist of three mechanisms and have separated each mechanism.

It not only determines the quality of services (QoSs) but also the security and safety of vehicular network system against adversaries. As a part of handover process, authentication between vehicles and a new fog node (FN) significantly contributes to protecting private information and infrastructure of vehicular network at once. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and secure mutual authentication scheme for handover process considering limited access FCS in the vehicular network environment and also service reservation scenario at login and service request phase. In the proposed scheme, mutual authentication process is assisted by a cloud server (CS) during login and service request phase in which CS distributes the credentials for on-the-road authentication between the vehicles and FN installed on road side unit (RSU). We demonstrate that our proposed scheme is lightweight due to employing one-way hash function and exclusive-or operation extensively. In addition, our scheme is efficient in terms of computational cost as well as computation cost. We show that our scheme achieves 1.1-56.67 times faster computation and also reduces the total message size by 30%-58.21% in comparison with the previous authentication schemes in the most relevant environment. The informal and formal security analyses show that this authentication scheme can protect the secrecy of transactions of all interacting entities against various known attacks. In addition, validation using SPAN software based on AVISPA also confirms that the proposed authentication scheme can satisfy mutual authentication goal and, at the same time, also protect against replay and man-in-the-middle attack.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931217","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08776585.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","startPage":"103095","endPage":"103114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mutual Authentication Scheme for Secure Fog Computing Service Handover in Vehicular Network Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8776585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Mutual Authentication Scheme for Secure Fog Computing Service Handover in Vehicular Network Environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776585/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"7","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18880654","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8776585/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"BUDI-LN Scholarship from the LPDP (Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education) and the Kementrian Ristek-Dikti (Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education) of Republic of Indonesia"},{"fundingName":"Telkom University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Mutual Authentication Scheme for Secure Fog Computing Service Handover in Vehicular Network Environment","sourcePdf":"access-dewanta-2931217-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133108S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8776585","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8776586,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Dong","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Technology for Safeguarding of Marine Rights and Interests and Application, State Oceanic Administration, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8776586/dong-2931337-small.gif","p":["Chao Dong received the Ph.D. degree in precision instrument and machinery from the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China, in 2010.","He carried out Postdoctoral Research at the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, from 2010 to 2012.

The control objective is to achieve asymptotic tracking and guarantee the transient tracking performance simultaneously. An adaptive feedforward term is used to compensate for the parametric uncertainties, and the effects generated by external disturbances can be overcome by a gain of the error sign term (a part of the RISE feedback term). In the previous RISE-based feedback control, the upper bounds of disturbances and their time derivatives are often required to be known, while the requirement is relaxed, in this paper, by rendering the gain of the error sign term adaptive. It should be noted that the adaptive gain of the error sign term adjusts automatically until it is sufficient to compensate for the disturbances, which helps to reduce the control effort. Moreover, the prescribed performance control technique is introduced to provide the transient performance specification of the tracking error, which guarantees the tracking performance and improves the robustness of the control system. Based on the backstepping procedure and the Lyapunov stability analysis, asymptotic trajectory tracking with transient tracking performance is theoretically guaranteed, and all the signals are shown to be bounded. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated through the numerical simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776586/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","volume":"7","accessionNumber":"18880597","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2019","publicationDate":"2019","htmlLink":"/document/8776586/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance-Guaranteed Tracking Control of an Autonomous Surface Vessel With Parametric Uncertainties and Time-Varying Disturbances","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Fund for the Integration of Industrialization and Informatization","grantNumber":"U180920009"},{"fundingName":"Public Science and Technology Research Funds Projects of Ocean","grantNumber":"201505002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61773169"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2017A030313381 and 2017A030313369"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2017B010117007 and 2017B090910011"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou","grantNumber":"201604016082"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Program of Nansha District","grantNumber":"2017GG006"},{"fundingName":"Foshan Science and Technology Innovation Team Special Project","grantNumber":"2018IT100322"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Performance-Guaranteed Tracking Control of an Autonomous Surface Vessel With Parametric Uncertainties and Time-Varying Disturbances","sourcePdf":"access-dai-2931337-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123234S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8776586","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8776587,"authors":[{"name":"Shuliang Gui","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8776587/gui-2931413-small.gif","p":["Shuliang Gui was born in Henan, China.

According to the theory of SAR imaging, the imaging response for each single echo of the three dimensional (3D) moving target is analyzed. Then, the relationships between the accurate degree of imaging result and radar system parameters are presented with the global human walking model, which can be summarized as: positive correlations with radar angular velocity and rotation radius, negative correlations with aperture time and motion velocity, and uncertainty with radar initial angle. Hence, the short synthetic aperture time and high-resolution of terahertz (THz) radar makes it particularly suitable for walking human security imaging. Meanwhile, the main Doppler frequency shift of walking human imaging is corrected by the back-projection (BP) algorithm modified with the estimated velocity detected by the range profile. Besides, the numerical simulation experiments of point targets are provided to verify the conclusion of moving target imaging response. Furthermore, the experiments of walking human are processed with different radar system parameters to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of our method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776587/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","volume":"7","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18914243","publicationDate":"2019","htmlLink":"/document/8776587/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2019","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Security Imaging Method for Walking Human Screening With Single Channel Synthetic Aperture Radar","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61801098"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2672018ZYGX2018J013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Analysis of Security Imaging Method for Walking Human Screening With Single Channel Synthetic Aperture Radar","sourcePdf":"access-li-2931413-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090899S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8776587","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-09"},{"_id":8776589,"authors":[{"name":"Md Sadek Ferdous","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8776589/ferdo-2931173-small.gif","p":["Md Sadek Ferdous received the double master\u2019s degrees in security and mobile computing from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway, and the University of Tartu, Estonia, and the Ph.D. degree in identity management from the University of Glasgow.

There are a few works in the literature which examine different aspects of self-sovereign identity. Unfortunately, the existing works are not methodological and comprehensive at all. Moreover, there exist different notions of what the term self-sovereign identity means. To exploit its full potential, it is essential to ensure a common understanding in a formal way. This paper aims to achieve this goal by providing the first-ever formal and rigorous treatment of the concept of self-sovereign identity using a mathematical model. This paper examines the properties that a self-sovereign identity should have and explores the impact of self-sovereign identity over the laws of identity. It also highlights the essential life-cycles of an identity management system and inter-relates how the notion of self-sovereign identity can be applied in these life-cycles. In addition, the paper illustrates several envisioned flows involving a self-sovereign identity leveraging blockchain technology covering different aspects of an identity management system. All in all, this paper presents the first formal and comprehensive step toward an academic investigation of self-sovereign identity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08776589.pdf","startPage":"103059","endPage":"103079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8776589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In Search of Self-Sovereign Identity Leveraging Blockchain Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["5G mobile communication","Licenses","Solid modeling","Blockchain","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identity management system","Internet","blockchain technology","self-sovereign identity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Identity","identity management system","self-sovereign identity","blockchain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"In Search of Self-Sovereign Identity Leveraging Blockchain Technology","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8776589/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18880384","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"In Search of Self-Sovereign Identity Leveraging Blockchain Technology","sourcePdf":"access-ferdous-2931173-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07419S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8776589","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8776591,"authors":[{"name":"Huaqiang Gao","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Work Safety Intelligent Monitoring, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8776591/gao-2931435-small.gif","p":["Huaqiang Gao received the B.E. degree in electronic and information engineering from the Harbin University of Science and Technology and the B.A. degree in business English from Heilongjiang University, Harbin, China, in 2016.

The over-the-air (OTA) testing of massive MIMO antenna system has attracted a lot of attention in terms of evaluating the radio performance of a 5G base station (BS). As a promising OTA test methodology, the sectored multi-probe anechoic chamber (MPAC) setup is employed for the performance testing of massive MIMO BS. However, the system cost and installation are still an issue to be considered in practice (e.g., the anechoic chamber and multiple probes), though it can accurately reconstruct the flexible propagation channels by channel emulation methods. This paper proposes a virtual OTA test framework for the performance testing of massive MIMO BS on the basis of MPAC setups. As an alternative, the proposed virtual OTA test system adopting the concept of virtual probes solves the inconveniences and limitations of the actual probe installation in MPAC setups. The BS array responses to the actual probes of MPAC setups are generated in a phase matrix for the virtual probes. First, in this paper, the system description of virtual OTA testing is given. Then, the emulation method of spatial clusters is presented for the virtual OTA testing. Finally, simulations are performed with good channel emulation accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Virtual Over-the-Air Method for 5G Massive MIMO Base Station Testing With Flexible Virtual Probes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931435","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08776591.pdf","startPage":"108474","endPage":"108485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8776591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776591/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"A Virtual Over-the-Air Method for 5G Massive MIMO Base Station Testing With Flexible Virtual Probes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8776591/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18897652","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701041, 61671084, 61821001 and 61272518"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Virtual Over-the-Air Method for 5G Massive MIMO Base Station Testing With Flexible Virtual Probes","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2931435-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133556S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8776591","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8776592,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Han Chiang","affiliation":["Information Systems Architecture Research Division, National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8776592/chian-2931336-small.gif","p":["Yi-Han Chiang received the Ph.D. degree from the Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2017.

In fact, various mobile applications may generate cotasks, each of which is completed only if all its constituent tasks are finished. Existing works have been devoted to the design of MEC offloading and scheduling, but none of them exploits the cotask feature to better utilize the networked computing resources. In this paper, we investigate the problem of joint cotask-aware offloading and scheduling in MEC systems (Cool-Edge), and we formulate it as a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP), the objective of which is to minimize average cotask completion time (ACCT). To cope with the Cool-Edge problem, we propose two low-complexity algorithms to offload cotasks based on an LP rounding technique and schedule them according to an earliest-cotask-arrival-first rule, respectively, and we further prove the approximation factor jointly achieved by the two algorithms. Finally, we conduct testbed experiments and simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution, and we also show how ACCT varies with the network environment.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8776592","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Task analysis","Processor scheduling","Delays","Scheduling","Approximation algorithms","Schedules","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","cloud computing","integer programming","linear programming","mobile computing","nonlinear programming","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint cotask-aware offloading","mobile edge computing systems","mobile devices","edge servers","mobile applications","cotask feature","networked computing resources","MEC systems","mixed integer nonlinear program","average cotask completion time","low-complexity algorithms","earliest-cotask-arrival-first rule","cool-edge problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cotask","mixed integer non-linear program","mobile edge computing system","task offloading","task scheduling"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08776592.pdf","startPage":"105008","endPage":"105018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931336","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Cotask-Aware Offloading and Scheduling in Mobile Edge Computing Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776592/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Cotask-Aware Offloading and Scheduling in Mobile Edge Computing Systems","isDynamicHtml":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2019","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18880685","htmlLink":"/document/8776592/","volume":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","grantNumber":"18H06471, 18KK0279 and 19K21539"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint Cotask-Aware Offloading and Scheduling in Mobile Edge Computing Systems","sourcePdf":"access-chiang-2931336-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091258S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8776592","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8776598,"authors":[{"name":"Ang Zhou","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Technology, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8776598/zhou-2931355-small.gif","p":["Ang Zhou received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), China, in 2017, where he is currently pursuing the master\u2019s degree with the School of Electronic Science.

To enhance the transmission rate and the energy efficiency while maintaining a low probability of interception, in this paper, we propose a code index modulation-aided HCC (CIM-HCC) scheme. Specifically, the input bit stream is split into the chaotic signaling stream, the modulating stream, and the code indexing stream. The chaotic signaling stream is modulated by the hybrid chaos signal and the code indexing stream is mapped onto the Walsh codes. The modulating stream is multiplied to the Walsh codes. Thus, the proposed CIM-HCC achieves higher data rate and lower power consumption than that of the conventional HCC. Another advantage is that, since part of the information bits are conveyed by the indices of the Walsh codes, the CIM-HCC outperforms the conventional HCC, and binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) in terms of reliability. In particular, when the number of indexing bits equals to that of the signaling bits, the proposed CIM-HCC doubles the data rate and saves about 50% power consumption. In addition, the numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the code index modulation differential chaos shift keying in terms of bit error rate over both the additive white Gaussian noise channel and the multipath Rayleigh fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08776598.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","startPage":"183133","endPage":"183141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Chaos Communication With Code Index Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8776598","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Chaos Communication With Code Index Modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776598/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"7","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"19214848","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8776598/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Hybrid Chaos Communication With Code Index Modulation","sourcePdf":"access-zhou-2931355-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084032S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8776598","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8776600,"authors":[{"name":"Manish Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University, Be\u2019er-Sheva, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8776600/kumar-2931181-small.gif","p":["Manish Kumar received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from IIT Patna, India, in 2018.

In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient, blind, cyclostationarity-based sampling frequency synchronization (CB-SFS) algorithm for estimating the sampling frequency offset (SFO) in OFDM communications by exploiting the relationship between the sampling frequency and the cyclostationary properties of the sampled received signal. The proposed scheme is ignorant of the channel coefficients and does not require pilots. These two properties are rather unique in this context and are not possessed by previous schemes which achieve comparable estimation performance. These properties also make the proposed CB-SFS scheme suitable for a wide range of communications scenarios. The main novelty of the new scheme is the understanding that SFO alters the cycle frequencies at the receiver, yet these frequencies are a priori known for the discrete-time (DT) transmitted signal, as they result from the periodic operation of the DT signal generation scheme at the transmitter. We show that the mismatch between the measured and the expected cycle frequencies is directly related to the SFO. Complexity analysis and numerical simulations are carried out and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CB-SFS algorithm compared to the existing approaches. It is illustrated that the proposed algorithm can achieve a smaller estimation error at the same complexity order of current algorithms while providing a higher spectral efficiency and robustness to additive stationary noise and to multipath.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Sampling Frequency Offset Estimation Algorithm for OFDM Systems Based on Cyclostationary Properties","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931181","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08776600.pdf","startPage":"100692","endPage":"100705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8776600","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776600/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Sampling Frequency Offset Estimation Algorithm for OFDM Systems Based on Cyclostationary Properties","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8776600/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18880344","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Israeli Ministry of Economy through the HERON 5G Consortium"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003977","fundingName":"Israel Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1685/16"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Novel Sampling Frequency Offset Estimation Algorithm for OFDM Systems Based on Cyclostationary Properties","sourcePdf":"access-dabora-2931181-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8776600","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8776603,"authors":[{"name":"Yucong Duan","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Hainan University, Haikou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8776603/duan-2931365-small.gif","p":["Yucong Duan received the Ph.D. degree in software engineering from the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Science, China, in 2006.

However, understanding various DIKW content or resources poses a conceptual challenge in unifying the semantics of the core concepts as a starting point. Through building metamodels of the DIKW framework, we propose to cognitively formalize the semantics of the key elements of the DIKW in a conceptual process. The formalization centers on modeling the perceived world only by relationships or semantics as the prime atomic comprising elements. Based on this cognitive world model, we reveal the difference between relationships and entities during the conceptualization process as a foundation for distinguishing data and information. Thereafter, we show the initial case for using this formalization to construct security protection solutions for edge computing scenarios centering on type conversions among typed resources formalized

Their excessive use makes them vulnerable to be hacked and used for malicious purposes. There are also security loopholes in this technology like the radio waves which can be exploited by the rivals and can cause a large amount of destruction or loss of data. This paper is written to improve the security of UAV and drones by using blockchain technology. Blockchain is a highly secured technology as it uses private key cryptography and peer to peer network. By incorporating this technology in transmitting signals from controller to drone or UAV, we can achieve an extra amount of security in transmitting of signals also it increases the connectivity.","doi":"10.1109/CONFLUENCE.2019.8776613","publicationTitle":"2019 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing, Data Science & Engineering (Confluence)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing, Data Science & Engineering (Confluence)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8767138/8776606/08776613.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CONFLUENCE.2019.8776613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8776606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Intelligent approach for UAV and Drone Privacy Security Using Blockchain Methodology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-11 Jan. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776613/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Jan. 2019","displayDocTitle":"An Intelligent approach for UAV and Drone Privacy Security Using Blockchain Methodology","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8776613/","accessionNumber":"18868887","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Intelligent approach for UAV and Drone Privacy Security Using Blockchain Methodology","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"RP-028-271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049519S","chronDate":"10-11 Jan. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8767138","isNumber":"8776606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8767138","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8776606","articleId":"8776613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8776625,"authors":[{"name":"Hanwen Yu","affiliation":["University of Houston, Houston, USA","National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping, University of Houston, Houston, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8887423/8776625/yu-2926096-small.gif","p":["Hanwen Yu (SM\u201919) was born in Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi, China, in 1985.

Compared with the traditional single-baseline (SB) PU, MB PU has wider application scope on the study area with strong phase variation, because it can overcome the limitation of the Itoh condition. Since most of the MB PU methods need to process multiple interferograms simultaneously, the size of the input interferograms will pose unique challenges when it exceeds the limit of computational capabilities. Until now, the research achievements related to large-scale (LS) MB PU have been quite limited. To deal with such case, we propose a technique for applying the two-stage programming-based MB PU method (TSPA) proposed by Vu and Lan to the LS MB InSAR data set in this paper. To be specific, the MB L\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03ba</sup>\n-norm envelope-sparsity theorem is proposed and proved first, which gives a sufficient condition to exactly guarantee the consistency between local and global TSPA solutions. Afterward, based on the MB L\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03ba</sup>\n-norm envelope-sparsity theorem, we put forward an interferogram tiling strategy, whereby each LS interferogram in the input MB InSAR data set is partitioned into a set of several smaller sub-interferograms that can be unwrapped individually by TSPA in parallel or in series. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed tiling strategy is effective for the LS MB PU problem.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2019.2926096","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8887423/08776625.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2019.2926096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8887423","startPage":"9308","endPage":"9322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-Scale Multibaseline Phase Unwrapping: Interferogram Segmentation Based on Multibaseline Envelope-Sparsity Theorem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8776625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Large-Scale Multibaseline Phase Unwrapping: Interferogram Segmentation Based on Multibaseline Envelope-Sparsity Theorem","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776625/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","accessionNumber":"19111971","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8776625/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China","grantNumber":"2017JQ4012"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100011518","fundingName":"University of Memphis"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-Scale Multibaseline Phase Unwrapping: Interferogram Segmentation Based on Multibaseline Envelope-Sparsity Theorem","sourcePdf":"tgrs-yu-2926096-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111229S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8887423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8887423","articleId":"8776625","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8776628,"authors":[{"name":"Mladen Kova\u010devi\u0107","affiliation":["BioSense Institute, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8871140/8776628/kovac-2931342-small.gif","p":["Mladen Kova\u010devi\u0107 was born in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 1984.

This paper aims to model the characteristics of such CSMA and to design transmission probabilities for achieving maximum saturation throughput. To this end, we first formulate such CSMA as a parameterized Markov decision process (MDP) and use the long-run average performance to evaluate the saturation throughput. Second, by observing that the exact values of optimal transmission probabilities are in general infeasible to find, we modify this MDP to establish an upper bound on the maximum throughput, and modify this MDP again to propose a heuristic design with near-optimal performance. Simulations with respect to a wide range of configurations are provided to validate our study. The throughput performance under more general models and the robustness of our design are also investigated.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2931326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2931326","startPage":"6966","endPage":"6979","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8871140/08776634.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8871140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized --Persistent CSMA for Asynchronous Multiple-Packet Reception","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Generalized <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$p$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-Persistent CSMA for Asynchronous Multiple-Packet Reception","volume":"67","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19115087","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8776634/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2018YFB1004800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"30918011318"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61727802, 61771244, 61472190 and 61872184"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005320","fundingName":"Xidian University","grantNumber":"ISN19-06"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010428","fundingName":"Innovation and Technology Fund","grantNumber":"ITS/066/17FP"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$p$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-Persistent CSMA for Asynchronous Multiple-Packet Reception","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zhang-2931326-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117181S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8871140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8871140","articleId":"8776634","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8776635,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad H.

The power efficient operational amplifiers are equipped with a Class C slew-rate boosting circuit that achieves a high slew-rate while static power is significantly saved. In addition, a forecasting technique in the sub-ADC is proposed, which reduces the number of active comparators during the sub-ADC's conversion phase.

We exploit the UAV\u2019s mobility in three-dimensional (3D) space to improve its cognitive communication performance while controlling the co-channel interference at the primary receivers (PRs), such that the received interference power at each PR is below a prescribed threshold termed as interference temperature (IT). First, we consider the quasi-stationary UAV scenario, where the UAV is placed at a static location during each communication period of interest. In this case, we jointly optimize the UAV\u2019s 3D placement and power control to maximize the SR\u2019s achievable rate, subject to the UAV\u2019s altitude and transmit power constraints, as well as a set of IT constraints at the PRs to protect their communications. Second, we consider the mobile UAV scenario, in which the UAV is dispatched to fly from an initial location to a final location within a given task period. We propose an efficient algorithm to maximize the SR\u2019s average achievable rate over this period by jointly optimizing the UAV\u2019s 3D trajectory and power control, subject to the additional constraints on UAV\u2019s maximum flying speed and initial/final locations. Finally, numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed designs for different scenarios, as compared to various benchmark schemes. It is shown that in the quasi-stationary scenario the UAV should be placed at its minimum altitude while in the mobile scenario the UAV should adjust its altitude along with horizontal trajectory, so as to maximize the SR\u2019s achievable rate in both scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2931322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8906190/08776639.pdf","startPage":"7872","endPage":"7888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8906190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2931322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive UAV Communication via Joint Maneuver and Power Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8776639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive UAV Communication via Joint Maneuver and Power Control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776639/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8776639/","volume":"67","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871137"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Province Key Area R&D Program","grantNumber":"2018B030338001"},{"fundingName":"National Key Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1800800"},{"fundingName":"Basic Research and Applied Basic Research Key Program of Higher Education of Guangdong","grantNumber":"2018KZDXM028"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Southeast University","grantNumber":"2019D08"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive UAV Communication via Joint Maneuver and Power Control","sourcePdf":"tcomm-xu-2931322-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.181704S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8906190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8906190","articleId":"8776639","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8776642,"authors":[{"name":"Ofer Zwikael","affiliation":["Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Ofer","lastName":"Zwikael","orcid":"0000-0003-0750-1337","id":"37593887100"},{"name":"Jack Meredith","affiliation":["Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Meredith","orcid":"0000-0002-7267-4421","id":"37087002819"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9391"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0040"}],"articleNumber":"8776642","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":358},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Technology Management Council","url":"http://www.ieee.org/tmc"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8776642","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stakeholders","Investment","Organizations","Aggregates","Project management","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Operations and management","performance evaluation","product development","project management","software development management"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TEM.2019.2925057","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","pdfPath":"/iel7/17/9520681/08776642.pdf","startPage":"1745","endPage":"1757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEM.2019.2925057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9520681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating the Success of a Project and the Performance of Its Leaders","abstract":"Although organizations regularly execute projects to improve their performance, there is still no agreement in the literature on how to evaluate their eventual success. As a result, scholars end up using different scales to measure the same outcome variable of project success, thereby causing inconsistency in research results. Existing project success evaluation models suffer from their inability to apply to all project types and lack of separation of project success measurement from that of project individuals\u2019 performance (for e.g., of the project manager). Through two longitudinal studies based on the satisficing theory, this paper develops, validates, and illustrates generic scales to measure the success of any project, as well as the performance of its two key leaders. This results in three distinct project success dimensions: 1) Project management success\u2014evaluates the performance of the project manager in achieving the project plan; 2) Project ownership success\u2014evaluates the performance of the project owner in realizing the business case; and 3) Project investment success\u2014evaluates the investment performance of the project for its funder. This paper contributes to the literature by offering a theoretically robust, multidimensional evaluation model that will enhance performance evaluation of both projects and their leaders.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776642/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8776642/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2021","volume":"68","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating the Success of a Project and the Performance of Its Leaders","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating the Success of a Project and the Performance of Its Leaders","sourcePdf":"tem-zwikael-2925057-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134448S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"17","isNumber":"9520681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"17","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"9520681","articleId":"8776642","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8776643,"authors":[{"name":"Bar\u0131\u015f Nakibo\u011flu","affiliation":["Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8906190/8776643/nakib-2931302-small.gif","p":["Bar\u0131\u015f Nakibo\u011flu received the B.S. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering and in physics from Middle East Technical University (METU), Ankara, Turkey, in 2002, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA, in 2005 and 2011, respectively.

Since the first demonstration of memristor implication logic, a significant goal has been to improve the logic cascading to make it more practical. Here, we describe and experimentally demonstrate nine symmetry-related Boolean logic operations by controlling conventional Ta/TaOx/Pt memristors integrated in a crossbar array with applied voltage pulses to perform conditional SET or RESET switching involving two or three devices, i.e., a particular device is switched depending on the state of another device. We introduce a family of four stateful two-memristor logic gates along with the copy and negation operations that enable two-input-one-output complete logic. In addition, we reveal five stateful three-memristor gates that eliminate the need for a separate data copy operation, decreasing the number of steps required for a particular task. The diversity of gates made available by simply applying coordinated sequences of voltages to a memristor crossbar memory significantly improves stateful logic computing efficiency compared to similar approaches that have been proposed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776649/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","volume":"66","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"19096849","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2019","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8776649/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Family of Stateful Memristor Gates for Complete Cascading Logic","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Family of Stateful Memristor Gates for Complete Cascading Logic","sourcePdf":"tcsi-williams-2926811-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084631S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8883027","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8883027","articleId":"8776649","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8776651,"authors":[{"name":"Madhuri Siddula","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Madhuri Siddula received the B.S. degree in computer science engineering from Osmania University, Hyderabad, India, and the M.S. degree in information security from the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, New Delhi, India.

From daily communication sites to online communities, an average person's daily life has become dependent on these online networks. Hence, it has become evident that protection should be provided to these networks from unwanted intruders. In this paper, we consider the data privacy on OSNs at the network level rather than the user level. This network-level privacy helps us to prevent information leakage to third-party users, such as advertisers. We propose a novel scheme that combines the privacy of all the elements of a social network: node, edge, and attribute privacy by clustering the users based on their attribute similarity. We use an enhanced equi-cardinal clustering (ECC) as a way to achieve k-anonymity. We further improve k-anonymity with l-diversity. Our proposed enhanced ECC ensures that there are at least \u201ck\u201d users in any given network as well as the attributes in each cluster has at least l-distinct values. We further provide proofs on how the proposed ECC ensures k-anonymity and the maximum information loss. We consider a weighted directed social network graph as an input to our method to consider the existing complexities in a social network. With the help of two real-world data sets, we evaluate this method in terms of privacy and efficiency.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6570650/8792216/8776651-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776651/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"18884351","htmlLink":"/document/8776651/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Anonymization in Online Social Networks Based on Enhanced Equi-Cardinal Clustering","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1704287, 1252292, 1741277, 1829674, 1704274, 1704397 and 1912753"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Anonymization in Online Social Networks Based on Enhanced Equi-Cardinal Clustering","sourcePdf":"tcss-cai-2928324-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125885S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6570650","isNumber":"8792216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570650","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8792216","articleId":"8776651","onlineDate":"25 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8776653,"authors":[{"name":"Quantan Wu","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Quantan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086080093"},{"name":"Guanhua Yang","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guanhua","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086378282"},{"name":"Congyan Lu","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Congyan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37068965100"},{"name":"Guangwei Xu","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guangwei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085590755"},{"name":"Jiawei Wang","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiawei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086529100"},{"name":"Bingjie Dang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wide Band Gap Semiconductor Technology, School of Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Bingjie","lastName":"Dang","id":"37086612036"},{"name":"Yuxin Gong","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuxin","lastName":"Gong","id":"37086589556"},{"name":"Xuewen Shi","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuewen","lastName":"Shi","id":"37086221947"},{"name":"Xichen Chuai","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xichen","lastName":"Chuai","id":"37086583630"},{"name":"Nianduan Lu","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Nianduan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37072904400"},{"name":"Di Geng","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Geng","id":"37719068400"},{"name":"Hong Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wide Band Gap Semiconductor Technology, School of Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37066006500"},{"name":"Ling Li","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Li","id":"37578909400"},{"name":"Ming Liu","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37401503300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9383"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9646"}],"articleNumber":"8776653","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":690},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we demonstrate a tunable Schottky diode based on amorphous indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (a-IGZO) film with high performance for rectifying circuit and bipolar one diode-one resistor (1D1R) crossbar applications.

of the popular methods that used to transmit the data in high speed rate in cellular communication. However, OFDM has a high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) which caused by the non-linearity of the High Power Amplifier (HPA) that provides transmission power to the OFDM signal. The high PAPR caused the OFDM signal to be low in efficiency and giving a high bit error rate. Thus, in this paper, a method for PAPR reduction that caused by the HPA is proposed. Precoding technique is one of the popular way to compensate the bad impact of the HPA by reducing the PAPR of the signal. In this paper, the bad impact caused by the HPA model on the OFDM signal will be analyzed. Moreover, the PAPR of the OFDM signal by using precoding techniques will be compared with the PAPR of the OFDM signal without precoding technique. From the simulation results, it was found that the ZCT-OFDM has a better PAPR reduction compared to the DCT and WALSH technique. It was also found that the lower the order of modulation scheme is, the better the PAPR reduction performance for OFDM signal compared to higher order modulation scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCAF.2018.8776697","publicationTitle":"2018 Fourth International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication & Automation (ICACCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Fourth International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication & Automation (ICACCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766334/8776677/08776697.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCAF.2018.8776697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8776677","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Non-linearity Effect of High Power Amplitude on OFDM Signal and Solution to Solve by Using PAPR Reduction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8776697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Non-linearity Effect of High Power Amplitude on OFDM Signal and Solution to Solve by Using PAPR Reduction","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776697/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18868412","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8776697/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Non-linearity Effect of High Power Amplitude on OFDM Signal and Solution to Solve by Using PAPR Reduction","confLoc":"Subang Jaya, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"2018icacca119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082295S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8766334","isNumber":"8776677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766334","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8776677","articleId":"8776697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8776701,"authors":[{"name":"Anish Gupta","affiliation":["Assistant Dean Academics, Amity University, Greater Noida, India"],"firstName":"Anish","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37086813102"},{"name":"Ayodeji Olalekan Salau","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical/ Electronics and Computer Engineering, Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria"],"firstName":"Ayodeji Olalekan","lastName":"Salau","id":"37088633119"},{"name":"Prateek Chaturvedi","affiliation":["Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Amity University, India"],"firstName":"Prateek","lastName":"Chaturvedi","id":"37086813578"},{"name":"Segun Ayokunle Akinola","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Electronics Engineering, University of Johannesburg, South Africa"],"firstName":"Segun Ayokunle","lastName":"Akinola","id":"37086921300"},{"name":"Nnamdi Ikechi Nwulu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Electronics Engineering, University of Johannesburg, South Africa"],"firstName":"Nnamdi","lastName":"Ikechi Nwulu","id":"37086918892"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8010-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-8009-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-8011-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8776701","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8776701","abstract":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles<br><br>\"Artificial Neural Networks: Its Techniques and Applications to Forecasting,\"<br> by A.

Easily available image editing software have enabled every common user of a smart phone and computer, to hack into the information of the images and video and alter it to some extent. To authenticate the genuineness of images, detection of image tempering is need of the time. Various techniques have been proposed to use image features for detection of image forgery. The techniques of forgery detection work in two domains of image forgery; copy-move forgery detection (CMFD) and image splicing detection (ISD). This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis for the use of local texture descriptors i.e. local binary pattern (LBP) and local ternary pattern (LTP) for forgery detection in an image. The paper also presents a technique to integrate fast fourier transform (FFT) with local texture descriptors for image forgery detection using existing block-based methodology. Performance of the technique(s) and descriptor(s) is tested for benchmarked dataset CASIA v1.0. Results are evaluated by using standard detection metrics detection accuracy and recall. The paper also suggests a relatively better texture descriptor.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Digital Image Forgery using Fast Fourier Transform and Local Features","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Automation, Computational and Technology Management (ICACTM)","doi":"10.1109/ICACTM.2019.8776709","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Automation, Computational and Technology Management (ICACTM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766340/8776675/08776709.pdf","startPage":"262","endPage":"267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACTM.2019.8776709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8776675","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8776709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2019","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Digital Image Forgery using Fast Fourier Transform and Local Features","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8776709/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18868700","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Digital Image Forgery using Fast Fourier Transform and Local Features","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"49-221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076837S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766340","isNumber":"8776675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766340","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8776675","articleId":"8776709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8776728,"authors":[{"name":"Junrie B.

Air contamination includes physical and substance process running over a wide size of time and space. Keeping in mind the end goal to demonstrate the Air quality prescient frameworks, broad information, for example, emanations from different sources (stationary and versatile), impact of structures and different obstructions, meteorology of the territory, data about disturbance profile, warm transition, past estimations of the poisons and so forth is required. It is basically exceptionally hard to gather the previously mentioned information (with the exception of toxin focuses), henceforth fleeting models are helpful in such circumstances. They can be utilized effectively to estimate reason in light of the fact that authentic arrangement of the toxin fixations is promptly accessible from contamination control experts of the nation. Air contamination is a period subordinate wonder which additionally legitimizes the utilization of time arrangement approach for anticipating criteria air toxins. A few systems are accessible to anticipate future poison focuses, including settled box techniques, direct relapse strategies, computational liquid elements (CFD) reenactment, man-made consciousness and so on. Customary procedure like numerical technique requires nitty gritty source data and expends a ton of time and exertion to conjecture and furthermore observed to be powerless especially when used to show nonlinear frameworks. This leaves an extension for another methodology like information driven procedures which are observed to be appropriate to show nonlinear frameworks.

and Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) is capable to enhance data rates over the radio channel providing enough protection against the destructions caused in the path of the signal. But the bit error rate (BER) of the systems degrades due to the presence of Carrier frequency offset (CFO). The presence of CFO results in generation of Inter Carrier Interference (ICI) which in turn results in loss of orthogonality between the sub carriers. The significance of MIMO-OFDM is due to orthogonality among the carriers which is at stake due to presence of CFO. In this paper, the performance of the MIMO-OFDM system is analysed over the Rayleigh channel for 2 and 3-array antennas under the effect of CFO with Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) diversity technique at receiver section. It is observed from simulations that the MIMO-MRC reduces the BER and improves the overall performance of the system which is very much useful to combat against the effects of CFO.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER assessment of OFDM system augmented with MRC technique under the effect of CFO","publicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Automation, Computational and Technology Management (ICACTM)","doi":"10.1109/ICACTM.2019.8776821","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 International Conference on Automation, Computational and Technology Management (ICACTM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766340/8776675/08776821.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACTM.2019.8776821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8776675","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8776821","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2019","displayDocTitle":"BER assessment of OFDM system augmented with MRC technique under the effect of CFO","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8776821/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18868603","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER assessment of OFDM system augmented with MRC technique under the effect of CFO","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"9-043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05779S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766340","isNumber":"8776675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766340","xplore-issue":"8776675","articleId":"8776821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":8776837,"authors":[{"name":"MD Shahrukh Adnan Khan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Asia Pacific, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"MD Shahrukh Adnan","lastName":"Khan","id":"37086280643"},{"name":"Mirza Mursalin Iqbal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Asia Pacific, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Mirza Mursalin","lastName":"Iqbal","id":"37086609855"},{"name":"Khandaker Sultan Mahmood","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Asia Pacific, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Khandaker Sultan","lastName":"Mahmood","id":"37086918537"},{"name":"Anjuman Ara Anee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommnications Engineering, North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Anjuman Ara","lastName":"Anee","id":"37086920801"},{"name":"Md.

Classification of ErrP revolutionized the domain of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), however, due to its poor classification accuracy, it is difficult to use it in practical applications. The use of deep learning techniques such as Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) has been growing because of its end-to-end learning capabilities and classification performance in other fields such as computer vision, speech processing and text synthesis. Very little work has been published towards classification of EEG or its classes using deep learning approaches because of its unexplored benefits in BCI applications. In this paper we propose a novel deep ConvNet architecture to accurately classify Error-related potentials. Using the very recent advances from the field of machine learning, such as batch normalization and dropout layers, we designed a new deep ConvNet architecture. We evaluate and compare the performance of two proposed deep ConvNets by finding its classification accuracy for EEG recordings from same and cross sessions as well as cross subjects for different trials of individual subjects. We see that the net proposed later with newer layers performs very well by improving the mean performance by 4%.","doi":"10.1109/CONFLUENCE.2019.8776901","pdfPath":"/iel7/8767138/8776606/08776901.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"249","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing, Data Science & Engineering (Confluence)","publicationTitle":"2019 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing, Data Science & Engineering (Confluence)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CONFLUENCE.2019.8776901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8776606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Error Related Potentials using Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776901/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Jan. 2019","displayDocTitle":"Classification of Error Related Potentials using Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18868948","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8776901/","conferenceDate":"10-11 Jan. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Error Related Potentials using Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"RP-043-562.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075487S","chronDate":"10-11 Jan. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8767138","isNumber":"8776606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8767138","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8776606","articleId":"8776901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8776923,"authors":[{"name":"Vikram Bali","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, JSS Academy of Technical Education, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Vikram","lastName":"Bali","id":"38111813500"},{"name":"Ajay Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, JSS Academy of Technical Education, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Ajay","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38295576900"},{"name":"Satyam Gangwar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, JSS Academy of Technical Education, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Satyam","lastName":"Gangwar","id":"37086922670"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5933-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-5932-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5934-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8776923","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":443},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Wind speed","Wind forecasting","Data models","Forecasting","Computational modeling","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","power engineering computing","wind power","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wind speed forecasting","wind power","deep learning","machine learning","LSTM","prediction rate","time gap","pattern remembrance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RNN","LSTM","Wind Speed Forecasting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8776923","doi":"10.1109/CONFLUENCE.2019.8776923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CONFLUENCE.2019.8776923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8776606","publicationTitle":"2019 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing, Data Science & Engineering (Confluence)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing, Data Science & Engineering (Confluence)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8767138/8776606/08776923.pdf","startPage":"426","endPage":"431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning based Wind Speed Forecasting-A Review","abstract":"Wind speed forecasting is the term used for predicting speed of wind to generate wind power.

Diverse domains, such as, entertainment, education, business, and medical are using it. Excessive utilization of social media may cause various types of illegal activities like spams, rumor spreading. In order to avoid these activities, it is necessary to detect them. Two types of data can be extracted from social networks: the behavioral data that represents the users' activities on the social media platform; and the structural data that represents the topological aspects of the networks. The useful information contained by data can be studied by graph theory for anomaly detection task. Existing structural features like degree, edge count, average betweenness centrality and brokerage lack in terms of accuracy and produce false positive and false negative. To reduce the amount of false positive and false negative we have used a new graph metric closeness centrality for anomaly detection task andapplied the proposed method on three datasets collected from a social networkrepository. The comparability and efficiency of different methods have been studied using statistical quantities like F-score, precision, andrecall. Experimental results show that the relationship between closeness centrality of an egonet and number of edges in egonet is capable to catch most of the anomalies and have higher F-score value than degree, average betweenness centrality and brokerage.","doi":"10.1109/CONFLUENCE.2019.8776957","publicationTitle":"2019 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing, Data Science & Engineering (Confluence)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing, Data Science & Engineering (Confluence)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8767138/8776606/08776957.pdf","startPage":"698","endPage":"703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CONFLUENCE.2019.8776957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8776606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Social Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8776957","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Jan. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8776957/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Social Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18868957","htmlLink":"/document/8776957/","conferenceDate":"10-11 Jan. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection in Social Networks","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"RP-126-498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056819S","chronDate":"10-11 Jan. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8767138","isNumber":"8776606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8767138","xplore-issue":"8776606","articleId":"8776957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8776977,"authors":[{"name":"Syed Arshad Ali","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Syed Arshad","lastName":"Ali","id":"37086065517"},{"name":"Mohammad Affan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Affan","id":"37086922877"},{"name":"Mansaf Alam","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Mansaf","lastName":"Alam","id":"37085368358"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5933-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-5932-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5934-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8776977","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Servers","Power demand","Virtual machining","Energy consumption","Resource management","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","Internet","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","cloud computing","Internet","pattern classification","pattern clustering","data analysis","data mining","wireless sensor networks","regression analysis","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy-efficiency","Virtualization","DVFS","VM-Consolidation","VM-Migration","Cloud Datacentres","VM-Allocation."]}],"abstract":"The following topics are dealt with: learning (artificial intelligence);

The capacitive sensors can meet stringent privacy, power, cost, and unobtrusiveness requirements, they do not rely on wearables or specific human interactions, but they may need significant on-board data processing to increase their performance. We comparatively analyze in terms of overall processing time and energy several data processing implementations of multilayer perceptron neural networks (NNs) on board capacitive sensors. The NN architecture, optimized using augmented experimental data, consists of six 17-bit inputs, two hidden layers with eight neurons each, and one four-bit output. For the software (SW) NN implementation, we use two STMicroelectronics STM32low-power ARM microcontrollers (MCUs): one MCU optimized for power and one for performance. For hardware (HW) implementations, we use four ultralow-power field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), with different sizes, dedicated computation blocks, and data communication interfaces (one FPGA from the Lattice iCE40 family and three FPGAs from the Microsemi IGLOO family). Our shortest SW implementation latency is 54.4 \u03bcs and the lowest energy per inference is 990 nJ, while the shortest HW implementation latency is 1.99 \u03bcs and the lowest energy is 39 nJ (including the data transfer between MCU and FPGA). The FPGAs active power ranges between 6.24 and 34.7 mW, while their static power is between 79 and 277 \u03bcW. They compare very favorably with the static power consumption of Xilinx and Altera low-power device families, which is around 40 mW. The experimental results show that NN inferences offloaded to external FPGAs have lower latency and energy than SW ones (even when using HW multipliers), and the FPGAs with dedicated computational blocks (multiply-accumulate) perform best.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Very Low Power Neural Network FPGA Accelerators for Tag-Less Remote Person Identification Using Capacitive Sensors","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931392","startPage":"102217","endPage":"102231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08777074.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777074","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"Very Low Power Neural Network FPGA Accelerators for Tag-Less Remote Person Identification Using Capacitive Sensors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8777074/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2019","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18880392","isOpenAccess":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Very Low Power Neural Network FPGA Accelerators for Tag-Less Remote Person Identification Using Capacitive Sensors","sourcePdf":"access-lazarescu-2931392-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152981S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8777074","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8777080,"authors":[{"name":"Constandinos X.

Amharic is a low-resource language and suffers from the problems of training data scarcity, sparsity, and unevenness. Consequently, fundamental acoustic units-based speech recognizers perform worse compared with the speech recognizers of technologically favored languages. This paper presents the results of our contributions to the use of various hybrid acoustic modeling units for the Amharic language. The fundamental acoustic units, namely, syllable, phone, and rounded phone units-based deep neural network (DNN) models have been developed. Various hybrid acoustic units have been investigated by jointly training the fundamental acoustic units via the MTL technique. Those hybrid units and the fundamental units are discussed and compared. The experimental results demonstrate that all the fundamental units-based DNN models outperform the Gaussian mixture models (GMM) with relative performance improvements of 14.14%-23.31%. All the hybrid units outperform the fundamental acoustic units with relative performance improvements of 1.33%-4.27%. The syllable and phone units exhibit higher performance under sufficient and limited training datasets, respectively. All the hybrid units are useful with both sufficient and limited training datasets and outperformed the fundamental units. Overall, our results show that DNN is an effective acoustic modeling technique for the Amharic language. The context-dependent (CD) syllable is the more suitable unit if a sufficient training corpus is available and the accuracy of the recognizer is prioritized. The CD phone is a superior unit if the available training dataset is limited and realizes the highest accuracy and fast recognition speed. The hybrid acoustic units perform the best under both sufficient and limited training datasets and achieve the highest accuracy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Task analysis","Training","Speech recognition","Hidden Markov models","Data models","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural language processing","neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["various hybrid acoustic modeling units","multitask learning","deep neural network technique","low-resource language","fundamental acoustic units-based speech recognizers","technologically favored languages","Amharic language","phone units-based deep neural network models","hybrid acoustic units","fundamental units-based DNN models","relative performance improvements","syllable","sufficient training datasets","limited training datasets","effective acoustic modeling technique","suitable unit","superior unit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acoustic modeling units","Amharic","hybrid acoustic modeling units","low-resource language","multitask learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777085","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931391","startPage":"105593","endPage":"105608","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08777085.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931391","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777085/","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of Various Hybrid Acoustic Modeling Units via a Multitask Learning and Deep Neural Network Technique for LVCSR of the Low-Resource Language, Amharic","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","volume":"7","publicationDate":"2019","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18897530","htmlLink":"/document/8777085/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572211, 61173114 and 61202300"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Investigation of Various Hybrid Acoustic Modeling Units via a Multitask Learning and Deep Neural Network Technique for LVCSR of the Low-Resource Language, Amharic","sourcePdf":"access-fantaye-2931391-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118188S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8777085","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8777086,"authors":[{"name":"Longlong He","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8777086/he-2931361-small.gif","p":["Longlong He received the B.Eng. and M.A.Eng. degrees from the Xi\u2019an University of Science and Technology, Xi\u2019an, China.

In order to answer those interconnecting issues, this paper firstly proposes a connectivism framework to clarify the compressive relationship of problem-to-problem, knowledge-to-knowledge and problem-to-knowledge with knowledge integration, knowledge matching, and problem-solving layers. Then, based on the framework, an ontology-based MK graph (MKG) is constructed with a unified MK-filter to collect and integrate multifactor and multilevel MK, and a graph-oriented meta-knowledge model (MKM) is proposed to represent the details between the knowledge entities (i.e., concept and instance), which also shows the contribution to knowledge reasoning. After that, driven by a structure temporal query (i.e., 5W2H), a semantics-based knowledge computation is developed to compute the intrinsic term similarity (IS) and relational term similarity (RS) between two knowledge entities in the MKG. Finally, a case study is taken to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931361","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08777086.pdf","startPage":"101231","endPage":"101244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Manufacturing Knowledge Graph: A Connectivism to Answer Production Problems Query With Knowledge Reuse","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Manufacturing Knowledge Graph: A Connectivism to Answer Production Problems Query With Knowledge Reuse","volume":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2019","accessionNumber":"18880507","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","htmlLink":"/document/8777086/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777086/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technologies through the Innovation Method Fund of China","grantNumber":"2016IM010100"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"71571142"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Manufacturing Knowledge Graph: A Connectivism to Answer Production Problems Query With Knowledge Reuse","sourcePdf":"access-jiang-2931361-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092051S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8777086","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8777092,"authors":[{"name":"Han Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/8845828/8777092/han-2931206-small.gif","p":["Han Yan received the B.E. degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2013, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA, in 2015.

Due to the necessity of using antenna arrays for IA in millimeter-wave (mmW) systems, BS simultaneously performs beam training to acquire angular channel state information. The state-of-the-art directional IA (DIA) uses a set of narrow sounding beams in IA, where different beam pairs are sequentially measured, and the best candidate is determined. However, the directional beam training accuracy depends on scanning beam angular resolution, and consequently its improvement requires additional dedicated radio resources, access latency, and overhead. To remedy the problem of access latency and overhead in DIA, this paper proposes to use quasi-omni pseudorandom sounding beams for IA, and develops an algorithm for joint initial access and fine resolution initial beam training without requiring additional radio resources. It comprehensively models realistic timing and frequency synchronization errors encountered in IA. We provide the analysis of the proposed algorithm's miss detection rate under timing synchronization errors, and we further derive Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound of angular estimation under frequency offset, considering the 5G-NR compliant IA procedure. To accommodate the ever increasing bandwidth for beam training in standard evolution beyond 5G, we design the beam squint robust algorithm. For realistic performance evaluation under mmW channels, we use QuaDRiGa simulator with mmMAGIC model at 28 GHz to show that the proposed approach is advantageous to DIA. The proposed algorithm offers orders of magnitude access latency saving compared to DIA, when the same discovery, post training SNR, and overhead performance are targeted. This conclusion holds true in various propagation environments and three-dimensional locations of a mmW pico-cell with up to 140 m radius. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the proposed beam squint robust algorithm is able to retain unaffected performance with increased beam training bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2019.2931206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2019.2931206","startPage":"1151","endPage":"1166","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/8845828/08777092.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8845828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Initial Access and Beamforming Training for Millimeter-Wave Cellular Systems","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4200690/8845828/8777092-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Initial Access and Beamforming Training for Millimeter-Wave Cellular Systems","volume":"13","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2019","accessionNumber":"19010634","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8777092/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1718742"},{"fundingName":"ComSenTer and CONIX Research Centers"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Compressive Initial Access and Beamforming Training for Millimeter-Wave Cellular Systems","sourcePdf":"jstsp-yan-2931206-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141881S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"8845828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8845828","articleId":"8777092","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8777094,"authors":[{"name":"Tingting Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Intelligentization, Dongguan University of Technology, Dongguan, China","Navigation College, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8777094/yang-2931459-small.gif","p":["Tingting Yang (M\u201913) received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Dalian Maritime University, China, in 2004 and 2010, respectively.

Specifically, unmanned surface vehicle (USV), as a flexible and lightweight intelligent device deployment integration platform, is the main tool to move towards the water container. However, how to sense the real-time navigation status information of the USV, integrate the information, and eventually distribute it to the ground control center, is still a difficult point for us. To successfully rescue the water container, three aspects of research are needed: information collection of the USV, information fusion, and data distribution to the ground control center. For the information collection part, we mainly use nine-axis, ultrasonic, global positioning system (GPS), and ultra wide band (UWB) sensors to complete the information collection for the USV. For the information fusion part, we set up a computational model to solve it. The USV computational model in previous works is mainly based on large ships, ignoring the modeling of wind, wave, and current for small underactuated USV. We use the classical Nomoto model, combined with the actual any slight wind, wave, and current forces on the USV, and finally combined with the proportion integration differentiation (PID) algorithm to model the USV. For the data distribution to the ground control center part, we have set up a communication protocol for the USV so that it can communicate normally. In addition, we wrote a Browser/Server (B/S) architecture to enable the ground control center to communicate with the host computer. Finally, our proposed control and communication schemes are carried out on actual USV. The real experiments show that the proposed schemes can reduce the ship surge and satisfy the ship navigation.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931459","publicationTitle":"IEEE

(TSVs), improves the system-on-chip (SoC) performance. However, redundancy schemes are required to cope with the relatively poor TSV manufacturing yield. Existing redundancy schemes do not exploit technological heterogeneity between the dies. Hardware costs can differ for the individual dies. This demands asymmetrical schemes with low complexity in costly mixed signal or RF dies. Furthermore, redundant TSVs are only used in the case of a defect. In the most probable case of correct manufacturing, they are unused. Another emerging technique using redundant lines is low-power coding (LPC). This paper presents a hybrid TSV redundancy technique based on coding, which can be used for LPC and for yield enhancement. Furthermore, the approach is strongly asymmetric. In case of a fault, a configuration is only required for the encoder or decoder located in the cheaper die, while in the costly die, a minimal set of XOR gates is sufficient. A case study for an existing heterogeneous SoC shows that the proposed technique decreases area overhead and power consumption compared to the best previous technique by over 69 % and 33%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2019.2923633","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8848667/08777096.pdf","startPage":"2317","endPage":"2330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8848667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2019.2923633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding-Based Low-Power Through-Silicon-Via Redundancy Schemes for Heterogeneous 3-D SoCs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Coding-Based Low-Power Through-Silicon-Via Redundancy Schemes for Heterogeneous 3-D SoCs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777096/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19011238","htmlLink":"/document/8777096/","volume":"27","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"German Research Foundation (DFG)","grantNumber":"GA 763/7-1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding-Based Low-Power Through-Silicon-Via Redundancy Schemes for Heterogeneous 3-D SoCs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-bamberg-2923633-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100445S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8848667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"8848667","articleId":"8777096","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8777106,"authors":[{"name":"Seunghun Baik","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, DGIST, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seunghun","lastName":"Baik","orcid":"0000-0001-6593-9391","id":"37086949684"},{"name":"Hyeokjin Kwon","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, DGIST, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyeokjin","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37086950499"},{"name":"Chuck Paeng","affiliation":["CTO, Lam Research Corporation, Fremont, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chuck","lastName":"Paeng","id":"37086362856"},{"name":"He Zhang","affiliation":["CTO, Lam Research Corporation, Fremont, CA, USA"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0001-9028-9263","id":"37086953367"},{"name":"Bodo Kalkofen","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics, Halle"],"firstName":"Bodo","lastName":"Kalkofen","orcid":"0000-0002-5250-7992","id":"37086363171"},{"name":"Jae Eun Jang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, DGIST, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Eun","lastName":"Jang","id":"37086949976"},{"name":"Y.

Data are one of the most important commodities in IoT. To maximize the utility of the collected data, it is crucial to design an open IoT data market that enables data owners and consumers to carry out data trading securely and efficiently. To address the challenge of security presented by an untrusted and nontransparent data market, we propose an edge/cloud-computing-assisted, blockchain-enhanced data market framework to support secure and efficient IoT data trading, with a particular focus on an optimal pricing mechanism. In this mechanism, an authorized market-agency works as a scheduler, determining the win-owner and its pricing strategy to the consumer. We formulate a two-stage Stackelberg game to solve the pricing and purchasing problem of the data consumer and the market-agency. In the first stage of the game, the market-agency gives the win-owner and its pricing strategy. In the second stage, the data consumer decides on its purchasing quantity of data. We consider competition between data owners and propose a competition-enhanced pricing scheme (CPS). We apply backward induction to analyze the subgame perfect equilibrium at each stage for both independent and CPSs. Lastly, we validate the existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg equilibrium, and the numerical results show the efficiency of the CPS.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777113/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","volume":"6","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"19275700","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2019","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8777113/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Pricing Mechanism for Data Market in Blockchain-Enhanced Internet of Things","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Plan","grantNumber":"2018YFB1003803"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61802450 and 61722214"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2018A030313005"},{"fundingName":"Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams","grantNumber":"2017ZT07X355"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Pricing Mechanism for Data Market in Blockchain-Enhanced Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"jiot-chen-2931370-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116491S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8931267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8931267","articleId":"8777113","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8777116,"authors":[{"name":"Li Wei","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering/Institute for Advanced Ocean Study, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China","Laboratory for Regional Oceanography and Numerical Modeling, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Wei","orcid":"0000-0001-9131-5929","id":"37088351673"},{"name":"Lei Guan","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering/Institute for Advanced Ocean Study, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China","Laboratory for Regional Oceanography and Numerical Modeling, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Guan","orcid":"0000-0001-9902-8035","id":"37553195800"},{"name":"Liqin Qu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering/Institute for Advanced Ocean Study, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China","Laboratory for Regional Oceanography and Numerical Modeling, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Liqin","lastName":"Qu","orcid":"0000-0002-9190-2944","id":"37066444000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"8777116","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":481},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ocean temperature","Training","Predictive models","Sea surface","Neurons","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["climatology","geophysics computing","neural nets","numerical analysis","ocean temperature","oceanographic regions","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prediction accuracy","SST difference","OSTIA SST","12-month lead time SST prediction","neural network models","monthly anomaly data sets","climatological monthly mean","SST time series data","SST variations","prediction errors","ANN's training","time series SST data","training ANN models","Ice Analysis data","Operational SST","numerical models","SST predictions","air-sea interactions","artificial neural networks","South China Sea","Sea surface temperature"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural networks (ANNs)","multilayer perceptrons (MLPs)","prediction","sea surface temperature (SST)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777116","abstract":"Sea surface temperature (SST) significantly affects the processes of air-sea interactions, and, thus, forms an important indicator of climate changes. In SST predictions, the approach of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is data-driven, unlike that of the numerical models, which are physics-based. In this letter, Operational SST and Ice Analysis (OSTIA) data set were used for training ANN models and verifying prediction results. Typically, time series SST data of a certain period were directly used for ANN's training. To reduce the prediction errors caused by SST variations, the authors propose to separate SST time series data into climatological monthly mean and monthly anomaly data sets and construct two neural network models. The combination of these two models gives the final SST prediction results. This method was used for 12-month lead time SST prediction in the South China Sea. The average bias and standard deviation between the predicted SST and OSTIA SST are -0.16 \u00b0C and 0.37 \u00b0C, respectively. The percentage of SST difference between the predicted SST and OSTIA SST, within \u00b10.5 \u00b0C and \u00b11 \u00b0C, is 71.24% and 95.22%, respectively. The results indicate that the proposed training method gives good prediction accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2019.2926992","startPage":"558","endPage":"562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and

interest in the fields of photogrammetry, remote sensing, and computer vision. In this letter, we aim at tackling a general and typical feature learning problem in 3-D point cloud classification- how to represent geometric features by structurally considering a point and its surroundings in a more effective and discriminative fashion? Recently, enormous efforts have been made to design the geometric features, yet it is less investigated to fully explore the potentials of the features. For that, there have been many filter-based studies proposed by selecting a subset of the whole feature space for better representing the local geometry structure. However, such a hard-threshold selection strategy inevitably suffers from information loss. In addition, the construction of the geometric features is relatively sensitive to the size of the neighborhood. To this end, we propose to extract multi-scaled feature representations and locally embed them into a low-dimensional and robust subspace where a more compact representation with the intrinsic structure preservation of the data is expected to be obtained, thereby further yielding a better classification performance. In our case, we apply a popular manifold learning approach, that is, locality-preserving projections, for the task of learning low-dimensional embedding. Experimental results conducted on one LiDAR point cloud data set provided by the 2018 IEEE Data Fusion Contest demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with several commonly used state-of-the-art baselines.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2019.2927779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9046933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2019.2927779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/9046933/08777118.pdf","startPage":"721","endPage":"725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Scale Local Context Embedding for LiDAR Point Cloud Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Scale Local Context Embedding for LiDAR Point Cloud Classification","volume":"17","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2020","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8777118/","publicationDate":"April 2020","accessionNumber":"19487508","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777118/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Scale Local Context Embedding for LiDAR Point Cloud Classification","sourcePdf":"lgrs-huang-2927779-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085915S","chronDate":"April  2020","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"9046933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"9046933","articleId":"8777118","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8777122,"authors":[{"name":"Nagendra Krishnapura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Madras, Chennai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8818466/8777122/krish-2926143-small.gif","p":["Nagendra Krishnapura (M\u201998) received the B.Tech. degree from IIT Madras, India, and the Ph.D. degree from Columbia University, New York.

This allows the data rate to be increased well beyond what is implied by the channel bandwidth. In the proposed scheme, the two sides of the link are resonated at the highest possible quality factor, maximizing link gain, and minimizing interference. The transmit signal is a binary matched pulse which maximizes the received signal for a given transmitter voltage limit. High-efficiency switching transmitters can be used for this type of signal. The proposed technique can be applied to communication links in which channel state variables are accessible for reset. For increasing the data rate, it is shown that the proposed state-variable reset technique results in a higher signal-to-noise ratio of the received signal and a higher energy efficiency compared to reducing the quality factor to widen the bandwidth, using equalization, or using multilevel signaling. The technique is demonstrated on a chip-tochip link with coupled 1.5 mm \u00d7 1.5 mm planar inductors separated by 0.5 mm in a 0.18\u03bcm CMOS process. 500 Mb/s data rate is achieved over a link which has a band-pass bandwidth of 185 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2019.2926143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8818466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2019.2926143","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8818466/08777122.pdf","startPage":"3531","endPage":"3543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximizing the Data Rate of an Inductively Coupled Chip-to-Chip Link by Resetting the Channel State Variables","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Maximizing the Data Rate of an Inductively Coupled Chip-to-Chip Link by Resetting the Channel State Variables","volume":"66","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8777122/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"18952972","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777122/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximizing the Data Rate of an Inductively Coupled Chip-to-Chip Link by Resetting the Channel State Variables","sourcePdf":"tcsi-krishnapura-2926143-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122636S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8818466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8818466","articleId":"8777122","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8777124,"authors":[{"name":"Botao Xiong","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, China"],"firstName":"Botao","lastName":"Xiong","orcid":"0000-0003-4336-9732","id":"37086537089"},{"name":"Lei Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37088410208"},{"name":"Tao Cao","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Cao","orcid":"0000-0002-3225-3489","id":"37663275300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8777124","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Tuning","Resistance","Reflection coefficient","Detectors","Transmission line measurements","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit feedback","computational complexity","electric impedance measurement","electric sensing devices","impedance matching","optimisation","search problems","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient descent-based algorithms","impedance sensor","binary search scheme","tuning method","impedance matching network","linear fractional transformation","antenna impedance variation","LFT","computational complexity","feedback circuits","analog to digital converters","ADC","electromagnetic simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear fractional transformation","detector for the sign of S\u2081\u2081","binary search algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Correction of antenna impedance variation in real time with low cost is a challenge.

Previous work in audio tagging focused on relatively small datasets limited to recognizing a small number of sound classes. We investigate audio tagging on AudioSet, which is a dataset consisting of over 2 million audio clips and 527 classes. AudioSet is weakly labelled, in that only the presence or absence of sound classes is known for each clip, whereas the onset and offset times are unknown. To address the weakly labelled audio tagging problem, we propose attention neural networks as a way to attend the most salient parts of an audio clip. We bridge the connection between attention neural networks and multiple instance learning (MIL) methods, and propose decision-level and feature-level attention neural networks for audio tagging. We investigate attention neural networks modeled by different functions, depths, and widths. Experiments on AudioSet show that the feature-level attention neural network achieves a state-of-the-art mean average precision of 0.369, outperforming the best MIL method of 0.317 and Google's deep neural network baseline of 0.314. In addition, we discover that the audio tagging performance on AudioSet-embedding features has a weak correlation with the number of training samples and the quality of labels of each sound class.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2019.2930913","startPage":"1791","endPage":"1802","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2019.2930913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8784423","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/8784423/08777125.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weakly Labelled AudioSet Tagging With Attention Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777125/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Weakly Labelled AudioSet Tagging With Attention Neural Networks","volume":"27","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/8777125/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18920764","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/N014111/1"},{"fundingName":"Research Scholarship from the China Scholarship Council","grantNumber":"201406150082"},{"fundingName":"Studentship","grantNumber":"1976218"},{"fundingName":"EPSRC Doctoral Training Partnership","grantNumber":"EP/N509772/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weakly Labelled AudioSet Tagging With Attention Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"taslp-kong-2930913-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128514S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"8784423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8784423","articleId":"8777125","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":8777126,"authors":[{"name":"Qianru Jiang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/9006961/8777126/jiang-2931400-small.gif","p":["Qianru Jiang received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering in 2011 from Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering.","Her research interests include compressed sensing and digital image processing."]},"firstName":"Qianru","lastName":"Jiang","orcid":"0000-0001-8317-2139","id":"37085432742"},{"name":"Sheng Li","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/9006961/8777126/li-2931400-small.gif","p":["Sheng Li (S\u201908\u2013M\u201911) received the bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT), Hangzhou, China, in 2006 and the M.Sc. degree in communications engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the University of York, York, U.K., in 2007 and 2010, respectively.

With the knowledge of the probability for each atom of the dictionary being used, a diagonal weighted matrix is obtained and then the sensing matrix is designed by minimizing a weighted function such that the Gram of the equivalent dictionary is as close to the Gram of dictionary as possible. An analytical solution for the corresponding sensing matrix is derived that requires low computational complexity. We also exploit this prior information through the sparse recovery stage and propose a probability-driven orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm that improves the accuracy of the recovery. Simulations for synthetic data and application scenarios of video streaming are carried out to compare the performance of the proposed methods with some existing algorithms. The results reveal that the proposed compressed sensing (CS) approach outperforms existing CS systems.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2019.2931400","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/9006961/08777126.pdf","startPage":"594","endPage":"609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2019.2931400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9006961","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Compressed Sensing System With Probability-Based Prior Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777126/","displayDocTitle":"Design of Compressed Sensing System With Probability-Based Prior Information","volume":"22","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2020","accessionNumber":"19392022","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8777126/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61503339, 61801159, 61873239, 61771430 and 61675183"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"LY18F010023"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico"},{"fundingName":"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Compressed Sensing System With Probability-Based Prior Information","sourcePdf":"tmm-li-2931400-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.256178S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"9006961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"9006961","articleId":"8777126","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8777130,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Zaruba","affiliation":["ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8880704/8777130/zarub-2926114-small.gif","p":["Florian Zaruba (S\u201918) received the B.Sc. degree from TU Wien, 1040 Vienna, Austria, in 2014, and the M.Sc. degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, in 2017, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Integrated Systems Laboratory.","His current research interests include design of very large scale integration circuits and high-performance computer architectures."]},"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Zaruba","orcid":"0000-0002-8194-6521","id":"37086690740"},{"name":"Luca Benini","affiliation":["ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8880704/8777130/benin-2926114-small.gif","p":["Luca Benini (F\u201907) holds the Chair of Digital Circuits and Systems at ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland.

The ISA is designed to scale from microcontrollers to server-class processors. Furthermore, openness promotes the availability of various open-source and commercial implementations. Our main contribution in this paper is a thorough power, performance, and efficiency analysis of the RISC-V ISA targeting baseline \u201capplication class\u201d functionality, i.e., supporting the Linux OS and its application environment based on our open-source single-issue in-order implementation of the 64-bit ISA variant (RV64GC) called Ariane. Our analysis is based on a detailed power and efficiency analysis of the RISC-V ISA extracted from silicon measurements and calibrated simulation of an Ariane instance (RV64IMC) taped-out in GlobalFoundries 22FDX technology. Ariane runs at up to 1.7-GHz, achieves up to 40-Gop/sW energy efficiency, which is superior to similar cores presented in the literature. We provide insight into the interplay between functionality required for the application-class execution (e.g., virtual memory, caches, and multiple modes of privileged operation) and energy cost. We also compare Ariane with RISCY, a simpler and a slower microcontroller-class core. Our analysis confirms that supporting application-class execution implies a nonnegligible energy-efficiency loss and that compute performance is more cost-effectively boosted by instruction extensions (e.g., packed SIMD) rather than the high-frequency operation.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2019.2926114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2019.2926114","startPage":"2629","endPage":"2640","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8880704/08777130.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8880704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Cost of Application-Class Processing: Energy and Performance Analysis of a Linux-Ready 1.7-GHz 64-Bit RISC-V Core in 22-nm FDSOI Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"The Cost of Application-Class Processing: Energy and Performance Analysis of a Linux-Ready 1.7-GHz 64-Bit RISC-V Core in 22-nm FDSOI Technology","volume":"27","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19100722","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8777130/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program through the Project \u201cOPRECOMP\u201d","grantNumber":"732631"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Cost of Application-Class Processing: Energy and Performance Analysis of a Linux-Ready 1.7-GHz 64-Bit RISC-V Core in 22-nm FDSOI Technology","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-zaruba-2926114-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125629S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8880704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8880704","articleId":"8777130","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8777131,"authors":[{"name":"Korok Chatterjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Korok","lastName":"Chatterjee","orcid":"0000-0001-8603-4559","id":"37085694791"},{"name":"Sangwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sangwan","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0002-6492-7740","id":"37086021513"},{"name":"Golnaz Karbasian","affiliation":["Applied Materials, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Golnaz","lastName":"Karbasian","id":"38474104600"},{"name":"Daewoong Kwon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Daewoong","lastName":"Kwon","orcid":"0000-0001-8261-4337","id":"37402105900"},{"name":"Ava J.

Subject to maximum power constraints, a constrained maximization problem on energy efficiency (EE) is formulated. Based on theoretical analysis, the optimal beamforming is shown to be aligned with the channel direction that renders the joint design problem to be a PA optimization one. It is shown that the optimization problem is strictly pseudo-concave with a unique maximum. Thus, an optimal PA scheme based on a gradient projection method is proposed to obtain the global solution. To speed up the gradient projection method, a closed-form initialization is derived. Furthermore, a low-complexity optimal PA schemes based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions is proposed. This optimal scheme has a closed-form PA expression for a certain condition or else computes the PA by the Lambert function or the bisection method, and gives the same EE performance as that of the optimal gradient-based scheme. The performances of these two optimal schemes are optimal and verified to be valid in contrast to the inaccurate optimal scheme in the literature. For large maximum power, the closed-form initial PA will become the optimal solution and can be considered as a suboptimal solution with no iterative computation. Making use of the tight upper and lower bounds of the Lambert function, a very low-complexity suboptimal PA scheme is developed. Simulation results show that the proposed suboptimal scheme can achieve nearly optimal performance. Maximum EE and maximum channel power, which are optimal and suboptimal criteria, are adopted for antenna selection. The simple suboptimal criterion can provide EE performance very close to that of the optimal one. The D-MIMO with AS is shown to give considerable EE gain over the single receive antenna system. Moreover, the proposed three PA schemes can be used for multiuser diversity D-MIMO systems to achieve superior EE performance.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2019.2931291","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8840987/08777141.pdf","startPage":"8966","endPage":"8981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2019.2931291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8840987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocation for Energy Efficient Optimization of Distributed MIMO System With Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777141/","displayDocTitle":"Power Allocation for Energy Efficient Optimization of Distributed MIMO System With Beamforming","volume":"68","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"18991457","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8777141/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571225 and 61571224"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Research Projects in Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions","grantNumber":"18KJB510018"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province in China","grantNumber":"BK20181289"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund Key Laboratory of Wireless Sensor Network and Communication of Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"2017006"},{"fundingName":"CityU","grantNumber":"7004840"},{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR, China","grantNumber":"11272516"},{"fundingName":"Theme Based Research","grantNumber":"T42-103/16-N"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Allocation for Energy Efficient Optimization of Distributed MIMO System With Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tvt-yu-2931291-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151522S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8840987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8840987","articleId":"8777141","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8777145,"authors":[{"name":"Chuang Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China","National Engineering Laboratory for Offshore Oil Exploration, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Chuang","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-1132-0491","id":"37088350984"},{"name":"Jinghuai Gao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China","National Engineering Laboratory for Offshore Oil Exploration, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Jinghuai","lastName":"Gao","id":"37310259600"},{"name":"Rongrong Wang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Microwave Imaging Technology, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","School of Electronics, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rongrong","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0003-1484-7037","id":"37088349844"},{"name":"Zhaoqi Gao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China","National Engineering Laboratory for Offshore Oil Exploration, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoqi","lastName":"Gao","orcid":"0000-0002-2728-1637","id":"37085438608"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"8777145","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"abstract":"Subsurface scatters are sometimes masked by reflectors in seismic migration images, because the diffractions are much weaker in energy than the reflections. We propose a novel imaging method, named reflection-damped plane-wave least-squares reverse time migration (RD_PLSRTM), to enhance the scatters in the migration image. We formulate seismic imaging as an inverse problem that minimizes a weighted residual between the modeled and observed seismic data. In the proposed approach, we use the plane-wave destruction filter to separate the diffractions from the reflections in the data residual. A reflection-damped weighting matrix is then used to govern the fitting of the diffractions and the reflections, and therefore emphasize the updates of the scatters. The inverse problem is finally solved by using an iteratively reweighted least-squares (IRLS) algorithm. The proposed method provides a generalized formulation that could be reduced to conventional PLSRTM and PLSRTM of diffractions (PLSRTM_D) by using specific damping factors. We conduct imaging tests on synthetic and field data that prove the superiority of the proposed method over PLSRTM in imaging deep scatters and subsalt scatters. Compared with PLSRTM_D, it could produce high-quality images of not only the scatters but also the reflectors.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diffraction","Damping","Imaging","Inverse problems","Numerical models","Data models","Oils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","geophysical signal processing","geophysical techniques","inverse problems","least squares approximations","seismic waves","seismology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["named reflection-damped plane-wave least-squares","novel imaging method","seismic migration images","subsurface scatters","reflectors","high-quality images","subsalt scatters","deep scatters","synthetic field data","specific damping factors","PLSRTM_D","conventional PLSRTM","least-squares algorithm","data residual","reflections","diffractions","plane-wave destruction filter","observed seismic data","modeled data","weighted residual","inverse problem","seismic imaging","migration image","RD_PLSRTM","time migration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inverse problems","iteratively reweighted least-squares (IRLS)","reverse time migration (RTM)","seismic imaging","subsurface scatters"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2019.2928061","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/9046933/08777145.pdf","startPage":"706","endPage":"710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9046933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2019.2928061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing Subsurface Scatters Using Reflection-Damped Plane-Wave Least-Squares Reverse Time Migration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Subsurface Scatters Using Reflection-Damped Plane-Wave Least-Squares Reverse Time Migration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777145/","volume":"17","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8777145/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19487510","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2019M653650"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of China through the National Key Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2018YFC0603500, 2018YFC0603501 and 2018YFC1504200"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91730306"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2016ZX05024-001-007 and 2017ZX05069"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing Subsurface Scatters Using Reflection-Damped Plane-Wave Least-Squares Reverse Time Migration","sourcePdf":"lgrs-li-2928061-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057815S","chronDate":"April  2020","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"9046933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"9046933","articleId":"8777145","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":8777147,"authors":[{"name":"Guowu Zhang","affiliation":["South China Academy of Advanced Optoelectronics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"p":["Guowu Zhang received the B.E. degree in optical information science and technology from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2015, and the M.S. degree in optical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2018.

In this paper, the nonlinear equalization in VLC systems is deemed to be a sparse recovery problem. Three different greedy sparse recovery algorithms, namely matching pursuit (MP), orthogonal MP (OMP), and regularized OMP (ROMP) are employed in constructing the sparsity-aware nonlinear equalizer for LED-based VLC systems. By adopting these greedy algorithms, the number of kernels in the nonlinear equalizer can be significantly reduced with minor performance loss, which enables low-complexity and high-performance nonlinear equalization. The performance of the proposed sparsity-aware nonlinear equalizers is investigated experimentally in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based VLC systems with commercially available red-green-blue LEDs. The results show that, with the help of greedy sparse recovery algorithms, the number of kernels in nonlinear equalization can be reduced by 32.5%~62.5% for only 0.5-dB signal-to-noise ratio loss. The compatibility of the proposed sparsity-aware nonlinear equalizer in a ~1 Gbit/s adaptive bit-power loading OFDM VLC system is also experimentally demonstrated. The ROMP-based nonlinear equalizer is found to be the best choice that offers the optimal balance between performance and complexity, which achieves almost the same performance as the conventional Volterra time domain nonlinear equalizer in OFDM VLC systems with approximately halved number of kernels.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2019.2931330","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8853408/08777147.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2019.2931330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8853408","startPage":"5273","endPage":"5281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparsity-Aware Nonlinear Equalization With Greedy Algorithms for LED-Based Visible Light Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777147","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sparsity-Aware Nonlinear Equalization With Greedy Algorithms for LED-Based Visible Light Communication Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15, 15 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777147/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"20","publicationDate":"15 Oct.15, 2019","accessionNumber":"19076451","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8777147/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61605047"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2016A030313438"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparsity-Aware Nonlinear Equalization With Greedy Algorithms for LED-Based Visible Light Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-hong-2931330-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081527S","chronDate":"Oct.15, 15 2019","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8853408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8853408","articleId":"8777147","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8777151,"authors":[{"name":"Dilip Kumar Choudhary","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines) Dhanbad, Dhanbad, India"],"firstName":"Dilip Kumar","lastName":"Choudhary","orcid":"0000-0001-5450-4034","id":"37085685620"},{"name":"Raghvendra Kumar Chaudhary","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines) Dhanbad, Dhanbad, India"],"firstName":"Raghvendra Kumar","lastName":"Chaudhary","orcid":"0000-0001-6186-4089","id":"37863944400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8777151","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":670},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Band-pass filters","Microwave filters","Resonator filters","Strips","Filtering theory","Dual band","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","impedance matching","LC circuits","low-pass filters","strip line filters","UHF filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impedance matching","dual-band bandpass filter","compact filter structure","controllable transmission zero","controllable center frequencies","controllable passband bandwidth","tank circuit","dispersion diagram","size 7.2 mm","frequency 1.05 GHz","size 15.5 mm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lowpass filter","bandpass filter","metamaterial","transmission zero","selectivity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777151","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/9103104/08777151.pdf","startPage":"1044","endPage":"1048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2019.2931446","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2019.2931446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9103104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact Lowpass and Dual-Band Bandpass Filter With Controllable Transmission Zero/Center Frequencies/Passband Bandwidth","abstract":"A simple and compact filter structure for lowpass and dual-band bandpass response with controllable transmission zeros/center frequencies/3-dB bandwidth is proposed in this brief.

To this end, we first formulate the omnidirectional precoding design as a semidefinite program (SDP) with rank constraint. An iterative rank-reduction algorithm is then proposed to produce omnidirectional transmission solution with a minimum number of precoding vectors. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can always obtain three precoding vectors (i.e., a rank-3 precoding matrix) to generate a perfectly omnidirectional power radiation pattern for any P \u00d7 Q URA with min{P, Q} > 2, or yield an omnidirectional transmission solution with (theoretically minimum) two precoding vectors for any P \u00d7 Q URA with min{P, Q} \u2264 2. In addition, to facilitate analog precoding design, we further impose constant-modulus constraints for every entries of the precoding matrix. Through judicious (re-)formulation, we develop an efficient Newton's method, which can compute four constant-modulus precoding vectors to generate an omnidirectional power radiation pattern for any URA configuration. The numerical results demonstrate the merits of the proposed schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8794696/08777153.pdf","startPage":"4772","endPage":"4781","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2019.2931208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2019.2931208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8794696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Omnidirectional Precoding for Massive MIMO With Uniform Rectangular Array\u2014Part II: Numerical Optimization Based Schemes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Precoding","Signal processing algorithms","MIMO communication","Optimization","Antenna radiation patterns","Iterative algorithms","Newton method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","Newton method","omnidirectional antennas","optimisation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["omnidirectional precoding design","rank constraint","iterative rank-reduction algorithm","omnidirectional transmission solution","rank-3 precoding matrix","perfectly omnidirectional power radiation pattern","constant-modulus precoding vectors","massive MIMO","uniform rectangular array","massive multiple-input multiple-output system","URA configuration","numerical optimization based schemes","semidefinite program","analog precoding design","constant-modulus constraints","Newton method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Omnidirectional precoding","common signal","rank reduction","Newton's method","uniform rectangular array"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15, 15 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Omnidirectional Precoding for Massive MIMO With Uniform Rectangular Array\u2014Part II: Numerical Optimization Based Schemes","volume":"67","issue":"18","htmlLink":"/document/8777153/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Sept.15, 2019","accessionNumber":"18920778","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671154 and 61771005"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission","grantNumber":"17510710400"},{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1801103"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Omnidirectional Precoding for Massive MIMO With Uniform Rectangular Array\u2014Part II: Numerical Optimization Based Schemes","sourcePdf":"tsp-jiang-2931208-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089686S","chronDate":"Sept.15, 15 2019","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8794696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8794696","articleId":"8777153","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8777156,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Jamali","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen\u2013N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687308/8822508/8777156/jamal-2931338-small.gif","p":["Vahid Jamali (S\u201912) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees (Hons.) in electrical engineering from the K.

The motivation for studying these MC systems is that they can realize the concept of constructive and destructive signal superposition, which leads to favorable properties, such as inter-symbol interference (ISI) reduction and avoiding environmental contamination due to continuous release of signaling molecules into the channel. This paper first presents a general formulation for binary modulation schemes that employ two types of signaling molecules and proposes several modulation schemes as special cases. Moreover, two types of receivers are considered: 1) a receiver that is able to observe both types of signaling molecules (2TM) and 2) a simpler receiver that can observe only one type of signaling molecules (1TM). For both of these receivers, the maximum likelihood (ML) detector for general binary modulation is derived under the assumption that the detector has perfect knowledge of the ISI-causing sequence. The performance of this genie-aided ML detector yields an upper bound on the performance of any practical detector. In addition, two suboptimal detectors of different complexity are proposed, namely, an ML-based detector that employs an estimate of the ISI-causing sequence and a detector that neglects the effect of ISI. The proposed detectors, except for the detector that neglects ISI for the 2TM receiver, require knowledge of the channel response (CR) of the considered MC system. Moreover, the CR is needed for performance evaluation of all proposed detectors. However, deriving the CR of MC systems with reactive signaling molecules is challenging since the underlying partial differential equations that describe the reaction-diffusion mechanism are coupled and non-linear. Therefore, we develop an algorithm for efficient computation of the CR and validate its accuracy via particle-based simulation. Simulation results obtained using this CR computation algorithm confirm the effectiveness of the proposed modulation and detection schemes. Moreover, these results show that MC systems with reactive signaling have superior performance relative to those with non-reactive signaling due to the reduction of ISI enabled by the chemical reactions.","doi":"10.1109/TMBMC.2019.2931338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMBMC.2019.2931338","startPage":"171","endPage":"188","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687308/8822508/08777156.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8822508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diffusive Molecular Communications With Reactive Molecules: Channel Modeling and Signal Design","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6687308/8822508/8777156-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Diffusive Molecular Communications With Reactive Molecules: Channel Modeling and Signal Design","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2019","accessionNumber":"18953291","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8777156/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","grantNumber":"SCHO 831/7-1"},{"fundingName":"Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen\u2013N\u00fcrnberg through the Emerging Fields Initiative"},{"fundingName":"STAEDTLER Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"NSF-CCF-0939370"},{"fundingName":"German Academic Exchange Service"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Diffusive Molecular Communications With Reactive Molecules: Channel Modeling and Signal Design","sourcePdf":"tmbmc-jamali-2931338-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17804S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6687308","isNumber":"8822508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687308","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8822508","articleId":"8777156","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8777157,"authors":[{"name":"Anupam Golder","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8910476/8777157/golde-2926324-small.gif","p":["Anupam Golder (S\u201919) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2015.

This work presents profiling-based cross-device power SCA attacks using deep-learning techniques on 8-bit AVR microcontroller devices running AES-128. First, we show the practical issues that arise in these profiling-based cross-device attacks due to significant device-to-device variations. Second, we show that utilizing principal component analysis (PCA)-based preprocessing and multidevice training, a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based 256-class classifier can achieve an average accuracy of 99.43% in recovering the first keybyte from all the 30 devices in our data set, even in the presence of significant interdevice variations. Results show that the designed MLP with PCA-based preprocessing outperforms a convolutional neural network (CNN) with four-device training by ~20% in terms of the average test accuracy of cross-device attack for the aligned traces captured using the ChipWhisperer hardware. Finally, to extend the practicality of these cross-device attacks, another preprocessing step, namely, dynamic time warping (DTW) has been utilized to remove any misalignment among the traces, before performing PCA. DTW along with PCA followed by the 256-class MLP classifier provides \u226510.97% higher accuracy than the CNN-based approach for cross-device attack even in the presence of up to 50 time-sample misalignments between the traces.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2019.2926324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2019.2926324","startPage":"2720","endPage":"2733","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8910476/08777157.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8910476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical Approaches Toward Deep-Learning-Based Cross-Device Power Side-Channel Attack","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Practical Approaches Toward Deep-Learning-Based Cross-Device Power Side-Channel Attack","volume":"27","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2019","accessionNumber":"19157463","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8777157/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS 17-19235"},{"fundingName":"NSF through the Center for Advanced Electronics through Machine Learning (CAEML) and its industry members","grantNumber":"CNS 16-24810"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Approaches Toward Deep-Learning-Based Cross-Device Power Side-Channel Attack","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-golder-2926324-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13021S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8910476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8910476","articleId":"8777157","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8777168,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyu Gao","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8794696/8777168/gao-2931202-small.gif","p":["Xinyu Gao (S\u201914) received the B.E. degree in communication engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2014.

However, most of the existing beamspace channel estimation schemes have been designed for narrowband systems, while the rather scarce wideband solutions tend to assume that the sparse beamspace channel exhibits a common support in the frequency domain, which has a limited validity owing to the effect of beam squint caused by the wide bandwidth in practice. In this paper, we investigate the wideband beamspace channel estimation problem without the common support assumption. Specifically, by exploiting the effect of beam squint, we first prove that each path component of the wideband beamspace channel exhibits a unique frequency-dependent sparse structure. Inspired by this structure, we then propose a successive support detection (SSD) based beamspace channel estimation scheme, which successively estimates all the sparse path components following the classical idea of successive interference cancellation. For each path component, its support at different frequencies is jointly estimated to improve the accuracy by utilizing the proved sparse structure, and its influence is removed to estimate the remaining path components. The performance analysis shows that the proposed SSD-based scheme can accurately estimate the wideband beamspace channel at a low complexity. Simulation results verify that the proposed SSD-based scheme enjoys a reduced pilot overhead, and yet achieves an improved channel estimation accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777168/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15, 15 2019","volume":"67","issue":"18","accessionNumber":"18901144","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2019","publicationDate":"15 Sept.15, 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8777168/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wideband Beamspace Channel Estimation for Millimeter-Wave MIMO Systems Relying on Lens Antenna Arrays","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China for Outstanding Young Scholars","grantNumber":"61722109"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2018ZX03001004-003"},{"fundingName":"Royal Academy of Engineering under the UK-China Industry Academia Partnership Programme Scheme","grantNumber":"UK-CIAPP\\49"},{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1801102"},{"fundingName":"US.

However, adjustment of the focal position with respect to the tissue surface is crucial for optimal energy input and minimised trauma. Advantageous laser delivery without tissue contact poses challenges and demands for assistance. This contribution introduces three novel concepts for user assistance during focal adaptation in noncontact laser surgery with robotic teleoperation. Visual, haptic, and visuo-haptic feedback modalities are designed based on real-time scene reconstruction and laser-to-camera registration. The performance of proposed methods was assessed in a phantom study with positioning tasks under different assistance conditions using a teleoperated extensible continuum robot. Focal position error and task execution time were selected as performance metrics. In total, 15 subjects conducted trials under four different conditions (N = 240). A mean error reduction from 1.2 mm for non-assisted to 0.25 mm for visuo-haptic feedback was revealed and error outliers were eliminated efficiently. Mean execution times of below 13 s were achieved for applied conditions. Presented work decreased the error to one-fifth in comparison to absence of assistance in teleoperation. The results strongly motivate prospective integration to surgical devices for noncontact laser delivery.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8809235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Robotics and Bionics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Robotics and Bionics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8253409/8809235/08777169.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMRB.2019.2931438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMRB.2019.2931438","startPage":"145","endPage":"157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward Assistive Technologies for Focus Adjustment in Teleoperated Robotic Non-Contact Laser Surgery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777169/","displayDocTitle":"Toward Assistive Technologies for Focus Adjustment in Teleoperated Robotic Non-Contact Laser Surgery","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8777169/","volume":"1","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"18937887","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100011102","fundingName":"Seventh Framework Programme","grantNumber":"\u03bcRALP - n\u00b0 288663"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Assistive Technologies for Focus Adjustment in Teleoperated Robotic Non-Contact Laser Surgery","sourcePdf":"tmrb-kundrat-2931438-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154739S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8253409","isNumber":"8809235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8253409","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8809235","articleId":"8777169","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8777172,"authors":[{"name":"Salam Doumiati","affiliation":["American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8906190/8777172/doumi-2931319-small.gif","p":["Salam Doumiati received the M.E. degree in computer and communications engineering from the American University of Beirut (AUB), Lebanon, in 2015.

Some emerging systems that require FHE include wearables, energy-harvesting devices, sensory networks, and electrocardiogram monitors. These systems require designers to account for different flexible actions, such as stretching, bending, twisting, etc. Accounting for different flexible actions requires models for different components that capture the behavior under these actions. This work focuses on characterizing the effects of bending two components, namely, printed microstrip transmission lines and power inductors. In this work, both the mechanical and electrical aspects are captured specifically for aerosol jet-printed (AJP) transmission lines, screen-printed (SP) transmission lines, and SP power inductors on flexible substrates using 3-D finite element modeling (FEM), which are then correlated with the measurements. The challenges in such multiphysics modeling and measurements are discussed, including the effect of bending.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777174/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8777174/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19178113","volume":"9","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Physics Modeling and Characterization of Components on Flexible Substrates","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation","grantNumber":"2712.024"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006602","fundingName":"Air Force Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"FA8650-15-2-5401"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Physics Modeling and Characterization of Components on Flexible Substrates","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-sivapurapu-2931452-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103032S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"8874597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8874597","articleId":"8777174","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8777180,"authors":[{"name":"Kui Xiong","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Southwest University, Chongqing, China","Chongqing Key Laboratory of Nonlinear Circuits and Intelligent Information Processing, Southwest University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Xiong","orcid":"0000-0002-7810-3865","id":"37086607540"},{"name":"Wei Shi","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Southwest University, Chongqing, China","Chongqing Key Laboratory of Nonlinear Circuits and Intelligent Information Processing, Southwest University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Shi","id":"37086992626"},{"name":"Shiyuan Wang","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Southwest University, Chongqing, China","Chongqing Key Laboratory of Nonlinear Circuits and Intelligent Information Processing, Southwest University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Shiyuan","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-5028-5839","id":"37965023100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8777180","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":390},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777180","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Noise measurement","Bandwidth","Artificial neural networks","Convergence","Estimation error","Dictionaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","computational complexity","impulse noise","least mean squares methods","mean square error methods","Monte Carlo methods","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kernel least mean square","impulsive noises","multikernel method","computational efficiency","multikernel maximum correntropy algorithm","online vector quantization strategy","quantized MKMC algorithm","robust multikernel maximum correntropy filters","multikernel adaptive filters","minimum mean square error criterion","QMKMC algorithm","Monte Carlo simulations","MMSE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multikernel algorithm","maximum correntropy criterion","robust adaptive filter","vector quantization"]}],"abstract":"The multikernel adaptive filters based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion have been proposed to improve the performance of the kernel least mean square (KLMS), efficiently. However, these multikernel methods suffer from large computational burden as well as instability in impulsive noises. To address these issues, a novel multikernel method is proposed by replacing the trace operation of a matrix with the inner product of two vectors, thus leading to higher computational efficiency, significantly. Based on the maximum correntropy criterion, the multikernel maximum correntropy (MKMC) algorithm is therefore proposed. To further reduce the complexity, an online vector quantization strategy is presented for MKMC to generate the quantized MKMC (QMKMC) algorithm. Monte Carlo simulations on different nonlinear examples validate the superiorities of the proposed two algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2019.2931409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9103104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2019.2931409","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/9103104/08777180.pdf","startPage":"1159","endPage":"1163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Multikernel Maximum Correntropy Filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Robust Multikernel Maximum Correntropy Filters","volume":"67","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2020","dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8777180/","publicationDate":"June 2020","accessionNumber":"19650487","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777180/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671389"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"XDJK2019B011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Multikernel Maximum Correntropy Filters","sourcePdf":"tcsii-wang-2931409-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072735S","chronDate":"June  2020","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"9103104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"9103104","articleId":"8777180","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8777190,"authors":[{"name":"Joonyoung Kim","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Joonyoung Kim received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea, in 2013.

To realize the cost/bandwidth-efficient and low-latency-inducing indoor 5G DAS network, we exploit the radio-over-fiber (RoF) system that is based on the intermediate frequency-over-fiber (IFoF) technology. To be more specific, we make simultaneous use of wavelength- and frequency-division multiplexing in the IFoF link so as to transport 4 \u00d7 4 MIMO 5G signal of which the bandwidth is effectively 3.2 GHz (= 4 \u00d7 800 MHz, where each antenna deals with 800 MHz 5G signal). The 4 \u00d7 4 MIMO-supporting IFoF link has error vector magnitude (EVM) performance of <; 4.5% at all channels of downlink and uplink for up to 2 km. The whole RoF system, exploiting the IFoF link, mmWave frequency conversion module, and control /management plane, proves itself to meet the 3GPP-defined EVM requirement (i.e., 8%) at all channels. Based on the RoF system, we demonstrate the indoor 5G DAS network in conjunction with Korea Telecom 5G mobile network, i.e., 5G baseband unit and RRH, investigating the downlink and uplink throughputs. We achieve ~4 Gb/s total throughput for end user, where the additional latency induced by the DAS network is only a few hundreds of nanoseconds other than the single mode fiber transmission delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777190/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2020","volume":"38","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"19244298","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2019","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8777190/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-Supporting Radio-Over-Fiber System and its Application in mmWave-Based Indoor 5G Mobile Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning","grantNumber":"GK19N0300"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-Supporting Radio-Over-Fiber System and its Application in mmWave-Based Indoor 5G Mobile Network","sourcePdf":"jlt-kim-2931318-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112909S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8946923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8946923","articleId":"8777190","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":8777193,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Tian","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Tian","id":"37088349277"},{"name":"Xutao Li","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Xutao","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-1894-984X","id":"37406921600"},{"name":"Yunming Ye","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yunming","lastName":"Ye","orcid":"0000-0002-1807-8581","id":"37405072200"},{"name":"Pengfei Xie","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Xie","orcid":"0000-0002-4773-7128","id":"37088352082"},{"name":"Yan Li","affiliation":["Shenzhen PolyTechnic, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Li","id":"37089085273"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"8777193","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":709},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777193","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Extrapolation","Radar imaging","Image sequences","Optical imaging","Optical network units"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extrapolation","image sequences","learning (artificial intelligence)","meteorological radar","neural nets","recurrent neural nets","weather forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical flow","state-of-the-art extrapolation methods ConvGRU","adversarial learning scheme","convolution neural network-based discriminator","ConvGRU-based generator","adversarial learning systems","GA-ConvGRU","generative adversarial ConvGRU model","skewed intensity distribution","blurring extrapolation images","deep learning techniques","convolutional gated recurrent unit method","optical-flow method","radar echo map extrapolation","operational weather forecasts","generative adversarial gated recurrent unit model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep learning","image sequence prediction","nowcasting","radar echo extrapolation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2019.2926776","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/9046933/08777193.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","startPage":"601","endPage":"605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9046933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2019.2926776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generative Adversarial Gated Recurrent Unit Model for Precipitation Nowcasting","abstract":"Precipitation nowcasting is an important task in operational weather forecasts. The key challenge of the task is the radar echo map extrapolation. The problem is mainly solved by an optical-flow method in existing systems. However, the method cannot model rapid and nonlinear movements. Recently, a convolutional gated recurrent unit (ConvGRU) method is developed, which aims to model such movements based on deep learning techniques. Despite the promising performance, ConvGRU tends to yield blurring extrapolation images and fails to multi-modal and skewed intensity distribution. To overcome the limitations, we propose in this letter a generative adversarial ConvGRU (GA-ConvGRU) model. The model is composed of two adversarial learning systems, which are a ConvGRU-based generator and a convolution neural network-based discriminator. The two systems are trained by playing a minimax game. With the adversarial learning scheme, GA-ConvGRU can yield more realistic and more accurate extrapolation. Experiments on real data sets have been conducted and the results demonstrate that the proposed GA-ConvGRU significantly outperforms state-of-the-art extrapolation methods ConvGRU and optical flow.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777193/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19487495","volume":"17","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8777193/","publicationDate":"April 2020","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Generative Adversarial Gated Recurrent Unit Model for Precipitation Nowcasting","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2018YFB0504900 and 2018YFB0504905"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Science and Technology Program","grantNumber":"JCYJ20170811160212033, JCYJ20180507183823045 and JCYJ20170413105929681"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61602132"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generative Adversarial Gated Recurrent Unit Model for Precipitation Nowcasting","sourcePdf":"lgrs-ye-2926776-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070158S","chronDate":"April  2020","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"9046933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"9046933","articleId":"8777193","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8777194,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoqiang Xia","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/9006961/8777194/xia-2931351-small.gif","p":["Zhaoqiang Xia (M\u201915) received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees from the Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2008 and 2014, respectively.

Plenty of handcrafted or learned features have been employed for a variety of classifiers and achieved promising performances for recognizing micro-expressions. However, the micro-expression recognition is still challenging due to the subtle spatiotemporal changes of micro-expressions. To exploit the merits of deep learning, we propose a novel deep recurrent convolutional networks based micro-expression recognition approach, capturing the spatiotemporal deformations of micro-expression sequence. Specifically, the proposed deep model is constituted of several recurrent convolutional layers for extracting visual features and a classificatory layer for recognition. It is optimized by an end-to-end manner and obviates manual feature design. To handle sequential data, we exploit two ways to extend the connectivity of convolutional networks across temporal domain, in which the spatiotemporal deformations are modeled in views of facial appearance and geometry separately. Besides, to overcome the shortcomings of limited and imbalanced training samples, two temporal data augmentation strategies as well as a balanced loss are jointly used for our deep network. By performing the experiments on three spontaneous micro-expression datasets, we verify the effectiveness of our proposed micro-expression recognition approach compared to the state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2019.2931351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9006961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2019.2931351","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/9006961/08777194.pdf","startPage":"626","endPage":"640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatiotemporal Recurrent Convolutional Networks for Recognizing Spontaneous Micro-Expressions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Spatiotemporal Recurrent Convolutional Networks for Recognizing Spontaneous Micro-Expressions","volume":"22","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8777194/","publicationDate":"March 2020","accessionNumber":"19392026","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777194/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61702419 and 61702491"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China","grantNumber":"2018JQ6090"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatiotemporal Recurrent Convolutional Networks for Recognizing Spontaneous Micro-Expressions","sourcePdf":"tmm-gao-2931351-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.30473S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"9006961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"9006961","articleId":"8777194","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25","associateArticle":[{"associateType":"ChildErratum","associateDoi":"10.1109/TMM.2020.2980722","associateId":"9046174"}]},{"_id":8777291,"authors":[{"name":"Heng Deng","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9091650/8777291/deng-2928615-small.gif","p":["Heng Deng received the B.S. degree in control science and engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2015.

The existing platforms usually lack a generic and complete solution allowing for software and hardware design. For such a purpose, this paper presents the design and implementation of a comprehensive multi-camera-based testbed for 3-D tracking and control of UAVs. First, the testbed software consists of a multi-camera system and a ground control system, which performs image processing, camera calibration, 3-D reconstruction, pose estimation, and motion control. In the multi-camera system, the positions and orientations of UAVs are first reconstructed by using epipolar geometric constraints and triangulation methods and then filtered by an extended Kalman filter (EKF). In the ground control system, a classical proportional-derivative (PD) controller is designed to receive the navigation data from the multi-camera system and then generates control commands to the target vehicles. Then, the testbed hardware employs smart cameras with field-programmable gate array (FPGA) modules to allow for real-time computation at a frame rate of 100 Hz. Lightweight quadcopter Parrot Bebop drones are chosen as the target UAVs, which does not require any modification to the hardware. Artificial infrared reflective markers are asymmetrically mounted on target vehicles and observed by multiple infrared cameras located around the flight region. Finally, extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate that the proposed testbed is a comprehensive and complete platform with good scalability applicable for research on a variety of advanced guidance, navigation, and control algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2019.2928615","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/9091650/08777291.pdf","startPage":"3139","endPage":"3156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2019.2928615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9091650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indoor Multi-Camera-Based Testbed for 3-D Tracking and Control of UAVs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777291/","displayDocTitle":"Indoor Multi-Camera-Based Testbed for 3-D Tracking and Control of UAVs","volume":"69","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2020","accessionNumber":"19610732","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8777291/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Project of Research and Development Plan","grantNumber":"2016YFC1402500"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indoor Multi-Camera-Based Testbed for 3-D Tracking and Control of UAVs","sourcePdf":"tim-quan-2928615-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101125S","chronDate":"June  2020","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9091650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"9091650","articleId":"8777291","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8777292,"authors":[{"name":"Shancang Li","affiliation":["University of the West of England, Bristol, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570650/8929036/8777292/li-2927431-small.gif","p":["Shancang Li (M\u201912\u2013SM\u201919) is currently with the Department of Computer Science and Creative Technologies, University of the West of England, Bristol, U.K. His current research interests include digital forensics for emerging technologies, cyber security, IoT security, data privacy preserving, Internet of Things, Blockchain technology, and the lightweight cryptography in resource constrained devices.

Given the order of magnitude of the transmitted powers in play, we focus on the issue of interference mitigation at the communication receiver. We explicitly account for the reverberation produced by the (typically high-power) radar transmitter whose signal hits scattering centers (whether targets or clutter) producing interference onto the communication receiver, which is assumed to operate in an un-synchronized and un-coordinated scenario. We first show that the receiver design amounts to solve a joint (non-convex) interference removal and data demodulation problem. Next, we introduce two algorithms exploiting sparsity of a proper representation of the interference and the vector containing demodulation errors of the data block. The first algorithm is basically a relaxed constrained atomic norm minimization, while the latter relies on a two-stage processing structure and is based on alternating minimization. The merits of these algorithms are demonstrated through extensive simulations; interestingly, the two-stage alternating minimization algorithm turns out to achieve satisfactory performance with moderate computational complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777296/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","volume":"18","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"19115262","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8777296/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2019","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Interference Removal for Radar/Communication Co-Existence: The Random Scattering Case","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11833001"},{"fundingName":"National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"61625103"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Removal for Radar/Communication Co-Existence: The Random Scattering Case","sourcePdf":"twc-zheng-2929772-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.176278S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8863562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8863562","articleId":"8777296","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8777299,"authors":[{"name":"Nuri Mert Vural","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Nuri Mert","lastName":"Vural","orcid":"0000-0002-2820-2806","id":"37086925755"},{"name":"Hakan Gokcesu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hakan","lastName":"Gokcesu","orcid":"0000-0002-5113-0118","id":"37086547403"},{"name":"Kaan Gokcesu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Kaan","lastName":"Gokcesu","orcid":"0000-0001-7333-419X","id":"37085826105"},{"name":"Suleyman S.

To this aim, this paper considers the design of a narrow transition band finite impulse response (FIR) filter operated in an interpolated bandpass filtering approach. An optimization problem is formulated that minimizes the complexity measure of the narrow transition band FIR filter under the constraints of length of the filter and normalized peak ripple magnitude (NPRM) threshold. Closed-form expressions for the optimal interpolation factor as well as the passband and stopband edges to obtain the narrow transition band are derived. A designed filter is subsequently implemented on Altera's Cyclone IV field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip and supremacy of the suggested design has strongly been established by correlating its hardware cost with many of the state-of-the-art FIR filters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777300/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","volume":"66","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"19096833","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2019","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8777300/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Order Minimization of Interpolated Bandpass Method Based Narrow Transition Band FIR Filter Design","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001843","fundingName":"Science and Engineering Research Board","grantNumber":"ECR/2017/000440"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Order Minimization of Interpolated Bandpass Method Based Narrow Transition Band FIR Filter Design","sourcePdf":"tcsi-roy-2928052-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081314S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8883027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8883027","articleId":"8777300","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8777303,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroki Iimori","affiliation":["Advanced Wireless and Communication Research Center (AWCC), University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8863562/8777303/iimor-2929759-small.gif","p":["Hiroki Iimori (S\u201918) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering and the M.Eng. degree (Hons.) in advanced electrical, electronic and computer systems from Ritsumeikan University, Kyoto, Japan, in 2017 and 2019, respectively.

The first is a transmit (TX) beamforming scheme designed via a Fractional Programming (FP) approach, matched with a minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamformer at the receiver. In this benchmark, the FP-based method, the signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints are relaxed via the quadratic transform (QT), which allows for the SINR-constrained TX-power minimization problem to be solved using interior point methods. Motivated by the high complexity of the latter, three low-complexity alternatives are then derived, in which power minimization is performed via the Perron-Frobenius (PF) approach, while the TX-BF vectors are obtained, respectively, via direct Gradient Projection (GP), QT-relaxation, and via a Double Rayleigh Quotient (DRQ) reformulation of the original optimization problem. The simulation results confirm the significant gains achieved by all four schemes over the SotA, revealing the GP and DRQ as the overall best alternatives depending on power limitation, and HW/CSI qualities.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2019.2929759","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8863562/08777303.pdf","startPage":"4816","endPage":"4830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2019.2929759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8863562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Beamforming Schemes for Hybrid SIC FD Radios With Imperfect Hardware and CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777303","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777303/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Beamforming Schemes for Hybrid SIC FD Radios With Imperfect Hardware and CSI","volume":"18","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","accessionNumber":"19115243","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8777303/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"JP17K06448"},{"fundingName":"Telecommunication Advancement Foundation (TAF) of Japan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Beamforming Schemes for Hybrid SIC FD Radios With Imperfect Hardware and CSI","sourcePdf":"twc-freitasdeabreu-2929759-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168985S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8863562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8863562","articleId":"8777303","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8777304,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Hung Lin","affiliation":["Yuan Ze University, Zhongli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8883027/8777304/lin-2927362-small.gif","p":["Cheng-Hung Lin (S\u201905\u2013M\u201910) received the Ph.D. degree from the Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2009.","In 2010, he joined the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Jungli, Taiwan, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

Furthermore, parallel dual-mode decoding kernels are proposed to alternatively decode the long-term evolution (LTE)-compatible convolutional codes (CCs) and turbo codes (TCs) using a parity-enhanced soft-input soft-output maximum a-posteriori algorithm. However, decoding the high-constraint-length CC results in complicated interconnections among the parallel decoding kernels and unroutable back-end chip implementation. Therefore, a minimized global route (MGR) design is proposed for the dual-mode decoder to further simplify the global data transfers and reduce the routing complexity. Using a 40-nm CMOS process, the proposed dual-mode decoder achieves a 48% area reduction compared with the individual single-mode TC and single-mode CC decoders. The global routing length of the proposed decoding kernels is reduced by 32% using the MGR design. Because of the feasible placements and routing, the proposed dual-mode decoder is implemented in an application-specific integrated circuit of 2.88-mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n core area at the maximum operating frequency of 364 MHz.

Two numerical simulations have been carried out to illustrate the validity and flexibility of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2019.2930118","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8949681/08777307.pdf","startPage":"360","endPage":"365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2019.2930118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8949681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switchable Truncations Between the 1st- and 2nd-Order DZT-CFS-UPMLs for Relevant FDTD Problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777307","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777307/","displayDocTitle":"Switchable Truncations Between the 1st- and 2nd-Order DZT-CFS-UPMLs for Relevant FDTD Problems","volume":"68","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2020","accessionNumber":"19244904","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8777307/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11734012, 11574218, 6173000222, U1830116 and 61376122"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004739","fundingName":"Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"2014193"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Applied Optics Independent Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switchable Truncations Between the 1st- and 2nd-Order DZT-CFS-UPMLs for Relevant FDTD Problems","sourcePdf":"tap-feng-2930118-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07718S","chronDate":"Jan.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8949681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8949681","articleId":"8777307","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8777310,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Delgado","affiliation":["Universidad de Alcal\u00e1, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8915887/8777310/delga-2930187-small.gif","p":["Carlos Delgado received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in telecommunications engineering from the University of Alcal\u00e1, Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Spain, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.","He was a Visiting Scholar in 2005 and a Visiting Post-Doctoral Fellow in 2007 with the Electromagnetic Communication Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, USA.

Specific filtering response with radiation nulls is firstly realized for the dual-polarized antenna element by symmetrically loading defected ground structures (DGSs), a cross slot, and eight shorting pins without extra circuits. The DGS with pins can generate a lower edge radiation null for a sharp roll-off rate and simultaneously introduce extra in-band resonance for wide passband. Meanwhile, the cross slot with pins can offer an upper edge null and an in-band resonance. Combining with inherent higher order-mode null of the patch itself, the skirt selectivity and stopband suppression at upper band can be significantly improved. Meanwhile, the |Sdd11| at the upper and lower stopbands is close to 0 dB to achieve high stopband suppressions. As a result, a compact high-gain dual-polarized filtering patch antenna is readily constructed. Thanks for complete symmetry of above structures, the proposed method is very suitable for dual-polarized antennas, where all the performance for both polarizations are identical. For demonstration, a prototype of the proposed antenna is fabricated and measured. Good agreements between the measured and simulated results are observed, indicating good performance with a large bandwidth of about 23% and a peak gain of up to 8.9 dBi within the passband, as well as out-of-band suppression levels of more than 20 dB. Compared with other reported filtering antennas, the proposed filtering patch antenna not only exhibits good wideband dual-polarization radiation but also features high gain in a compact structure for very high aperture efficiency and ultralow cross-polarization level due to the differential feeding and complete symmetry.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8915887/08777317.pdf","startPage":"7261","endPage":"7271","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2019.2930213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2019.2930213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8915887","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Compact High-Gain Differential-Fed Dual-Polarized Filtering Patch Antenna","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Pins","Band-pass filters","Patch antennas","Resonator filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","band-pass filters","broadband antennas","defected ground structures","electromagnetic wave polarisation","microstrip antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["specific filtering response","radiation nulls","dual-polarized antenna element","cross slot","shorting pins","lower edge radiation null","in-band resonance","upper edge null","inherent higher order-mode null","skirt selectivity","high stopband suppressions","compact high-gain dual-polarized filtering patch antenna","out-of-band suppression levels","dual-polarization radiation","cross-polarization level","symmetrically loading defected ground structures","compact high-gain differential-fed dual-polarized filtering patch antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential fed","dual polarized","filtering antenna","high gain","radiation null"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Novel Compact High-Gain Differential-Fed Dual-Polarized Filtering Patch Antenna","volume":"67","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8777317/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","accessionNumber":"19189771","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Guangdong Province Key Project of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2018B010115001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012541","fundingName":"Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program","grantNumber":"2017ZT07X032"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571231, 61601224 and 61822110"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Compact High-Gain Differential-Fed Dual-Polarized Filtering Patch Antenna","sourcePdf":"tap-che-2930213-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078703S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8915887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8915887","articleId":"8777317","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8777325,"authors":[{"name":"Khadijeh Masumnia-Bisheh","affiliation":["Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8915887/8777325/masum-2930171-small.gif","p":["Khadijeh Masumnia-Bisheh (S\u201915) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Babol Noshirvani University of Technology, Babol, Iran, in 2011 and 2015, respectively.

On one hand, it is easy to access, less time consuming, user friendly, easily conveyable socially relevant news, possibility for obtaining various perspective of a single news and is being updated in every minute. On other hand, news is being manipulated by various networking sites based on private opinions or interest. Fake news is misinformation or manipulated news that is spread across the social media with an intention to damage a person, agency and organization. Due to the dissemination of fake news, there is need for computational methods to detect them. Fake news detection aims to help users to expose varieties of fabricated news. We can decide whether the news is solid or forged based on formerly witnessed fake or real news. We can use various models to access deceptive news in social media. Our contribution is bifold. First, we must introduce the datasets which contain both fake and real news and conduct various experiments to organize fake news detector. We use Natural Language Processing, Machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify the datasets. We yield a comprehensive audit of detecting fake news by including fake news categorization, existing algorithms from machine learning techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777343/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Dec. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18868523","htmlLink":"/document/8777343/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","conferenceDate":"14-15 Dec. 2018","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fake News Detection Using A Deep Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fake News Detection Using A Deep Neural Network","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"ICCCA2018_Paper466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042479S","chronDate":"14-15 Dec. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8766336","isNumber":"8777330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766336","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8777330","articleId":"8777343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8777346,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Ruiz Cabello","affiliation":["University of Granada, Granada, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8915887/8777346/cabel-2930107-small.gif","p":["Miguel Ruiz Cabello was born in Granada, Spain.

The inspiration comes from a dipole fed by a differential line which can be considered a DM feed. What will happen if the DM feed is transformed into a CM feed? Some interesting features are provided in this article. By symmetrically placing one DM antenna and one CM antenna together, a DM/CM antenna can be achieved. Benefitting from the coupling cancellation of antiphase currents and the different distributions of the radiation currents, a DM/CM antenna can obtain high isolation and complementary patterns, even if the radiators of the DM and CM antennas are overlapped. Therefore, good MIMO performance can be realized in a very compact volume. To validate the concept, a miniaturized DM/CM antenna unit is designed for mobile phones. The 24.2 dB isolation and complementary patterns are achieved in the dimension of 0.330\u03bb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n \u00d7 0.058\u03bb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n \u00d7 0.019\u03bb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n at 3.5 GHz.

In this paper, a topology based on independent double-gate (IDG) FinFET devices is proposed for classifying high-dimensional input data into multi-class output space with less power and area as compared with state-of-the-art MOSFET classifiers. To facilitate a high-resolution multiplication as a part of the classifier predictions, ML features and feature weights are, respectively, fed to the back and front gate inputs of the individual IDG-FinFET transistors. A classifier that considers the decisions of the individual predictors is designed at 30 nm FinFET technology node and operates at 333 MHZ with nominal supply voltage of one volt. To evaluate the performance of the classifier, a reduced MNIST dataset is generated. The original resolution is reduced from 28\u00d728 features to 9\u00d79 features and the most important features are selected with sequential backward selection algorithm. The system is simulated in SPICE, exhibiting prediction accuracy of 90%, energy consumption of 25 pJ per classification (over four times lower than similar state-of-the-art classifiers), area of 1,365 \u03bcm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, and a stable response under a wide range of system variations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777350/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","volume":"66","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"19096818","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2019","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8777350/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging Independent Double-Gate FinFET Devices for Machine Learning Classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging Independent Double-Gate FinFET Devices for Machine Learning Classification","sourcePdf":"tcsi-vaisband-2927441-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121889S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8883027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8883027","articleId":"8777350","onlineDate":"26 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8777403,"authors":[{"name":"Sajid Nazir","affiliation":["School of Computing, Engineering and Built Environment, Glasgow Caledonian University, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Sajid","lastName":"Nazir","id":"37886698000"},{"name":"Muhammad Kaleem","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, COMSATS University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Kaleem","id":"37086677188"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0447-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0448-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8777403","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777403","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Protocols","Quality of service","Smart homes","Security","Temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["home automation","image capture","infrared detectors","infrared imaging","Internet of Things","mobile computing","power consumption","protocols","queueing theory","radiotelemetry","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message queuing telemetry transport","publish-subscribe communications protocols","sensor node","Internet of Things applications","power consumption","image capture","passive infrared sensor","intrusion event","Raspberry Pi implementation","smart home security system","IoT applications","MQTT protocol","low-powered device communications","communications protocols","low-power messages","reliable event notifications","low-powered battery operated devices","reliable image notifications","data transfer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Notifications","Internet of Things","M2M","home security","power measurements","image communications"]}],"abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) applications utilize low-powered battery operated devices and reliable event notifications depend on low-power messages from the sensors node to the server and vice versa over bandwidth constrained unreliable channels.

These protocols have enabled IoT applications such as smart home, fleet management, oil pipelines and space exploration that heavily depend on reliable communications.

A stored database of the subjects is manipulated using image processing techniques to accomplish this task. This paper proposes a frame work of smart glasses that can recognize the faces. Implementing facial recognition using portable smart glasses can aid law enforcement agencies to detect a suspect's face. The advantage over security cameras is their portability and good frontal view capturing. The techniques used for the whole process of face recognition are machine learning based because of their high accuracy as compared with other techniques. Face detection is the pre-step for face recognition that is performed using Haar-like features. Detection rate of this method is 98% using 3099 features. Face recognition is achieved using Deep Learning's sub-field that is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is a multi-layer network trained to perform a specific task using classification. Transfer learning of a trained CNN model that is AlexNet is done for face recognition. It has an accuracy of 98.5% using 2500 variant images in a class.

Specifically, digital images suffer from noise contamination and blurring effect which poses difficulties in extracting useful information from those images. This necessitates the removal of noises from those digital images as well as de-blurring of such images in real-time. In this article, we have proposed a low area and highly accurate VLSI architecture of 2D Wiener filter which can be applied for any1D/2D real-time signal efficiently. The applicability of inherently highly accurate Wiener filter throttles due to its computational complexities. Our focus in this article is to overcome the barrier by reducing the computational complexity using Toeplitz matrix formation and its QR decomposition. We have proposed an area efficient multiplier-less VLSI architecture for realizing 2D Wiener filter. We have exploited the concept of Givens rotation based QR decomposition and also we have utilized the CORDIC algorithm to achieve high performance of our design. We have also applied our proposed hardware in real-time audio signal and image denoising. The supremacy of our proposed design can be proved from the analysis of pictorial and also numerical results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Matrix decomposition","Real-time systems","Wiener filters","Hardware","Signal processing","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","digital arithmetic","image denoising","image filtering","image restoration","Toeplitz matrices","VLSI","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CORDIC algorithm","Toeplitz matrix formation","Wiener filter throttles","signal processing applications","real-time signal processing","image denoising","real-time audio signal","multiplier-less VLSI architecture","digital images","2D Wiener filter","QR decomposition","multiplierless VLSI architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["2D Wiener Filter","VLSI Architecture","QR Decomposition","Autocorrelation","Image De-noising"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777458","doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2018.8777458","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Computing Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Computing Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766336/8777330/08777458.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8777330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2018.8777458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777458/","displayDocTitle":"A Multiplierless VLSI Architecture of QR Decomposition Based 2D Wiener Filter for 1D/2D Signal Processing With High Accuracy","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Dec. 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18868548","htmlLink":"/document/8777458/","conferenceDate":"14-15 Dec. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiplierless VLSI Architecture of QR Decomposition Based 2D Wiener Filter for 1D/2D Signal Processing With High Accuracy","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"ICCCA2018_Paper521.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049043S","chronDate":"14-15 Dec. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8766336","isNumber":"8777330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766336","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8777330","articleId":"8777458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8777460,"authors":[{"name":"Nikitasha Sharma","affiliation":["Dept. of CS & IT, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Nikitasha","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37086921123"},{"name":"Mansi Goel","affiliation":["Dept. of CS & IT, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Mansi","lastName":"Goel","id":"37086918180"},{"name":"Aakash Verma","affiliation":["Dept. of CS & IT, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Aakash","lastName":"Verma","id":"37086917533"},{"name":"Abhinav Jain","affiliation":["Dept. of CS & IT, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Abhinav","lastName":"Jain","id":"37086868684"},{"name":"Rajat Parashar","affiliation":["Dept. of CS & IT, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Rajat","lastName":"Parashar","id":"37086872191"},{"name":"Prantik Biswas","affiliation":["Dept. of CS & IT, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Prantik","lastName":"Biswas","id":"37085483148"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6947-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6946-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6948-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-7354"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2641-8134"}],"articleNumber":"8777460","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"abstract":"Recognizing motifs in DNA sequences is a traditional conjunctional problem in the discipline of bioinformatics. Motif refers to the biologically functional short, recurring common sequence pattern in DNA strands involved in important processes taking place at the genetic level in an organism. Motif discovery is integral to problems such as antibody biomarker identification and transcription factor binding sites (TBFS) in the field of genetics and holds a greater importance to enable advances in understanding human genetics, biology and health. This problem has been comprehensively examined over the years but the complexity of most of the existing algorithms is still very high. This paper advocates an efficient methodology using some operations on the given sequences and tries to reduce the time and space complexity. The algorithm HMBMF illustrated in this paper is applicable for non-mutated motifs of known or unknown length collectively. The demonstrated algorithm uses hash-map to store all the suitable candidates and modified binary search is to find the pertinent motif. In this algorithm, a single DNA sequence is used to generate the possible suitable l-mers and stored in a hash map. The provided sequences are further iterated to narrow down the suitable l-mers. Finally, binary search is applied to ascertain the motif from the produced suitable candidates. The collective use of hash map and binary search results in an algorithm with comparatively low complexity. This algorithm can also be used for string matching and pattern detection etc.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Computing Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766336/8777330/08777460.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Computing Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2018.8777460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2018.8777460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8777330","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discovering Non-Mutated Motifs in DNA Sequences: A HashMap Based Binary Search Motif Finder","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DNA","Information technology","Complexity theory","Heuristic algorithms","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","computational complexity","data structures","DNA","genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sequence pattern","nonmutated motifs","time complexity","HMBMF","space complexity","human genetics","motif discovery","genetic level","DNA strands","binary search motif finder","HashMap","DNA sequences"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Motif finding problem","DNA sequences","Hash","Map","Binary Search","Transcription factors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Dec. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Discovering Non-Mutated Motifs in DNA Sequences: A HashMap Based Binary Search Motif Finder","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8777460/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18868513","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","conferenceDate":"14-15 Dec. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discovering Non-Mutated Motifs in DNA Sequences: A HashMap Based Binary Search Motif Finder","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"ICCCA2018_Paper474.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096506S","chronDate":"14-15 Dec. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8766336","isNumber":"8777330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766336","xplore-issue":"8777330","articleId":"8777460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8777475,"authors":[{"name":"Kshitij Shinghal","affiliation":["Dept. of E&C Engg., Moradabad Institute of Technology Moradabad, U.P., India"],"firstName":"Kshitij","lastName":"Shinghal","id":"37085875503"},{"name":"Amit Saxena","affiliation":["Dept. of E&C Engg., Moradabad Institute of Technology Moradabad, U.P., India"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Saxena","id":"37086932048"},{"name":"Rajul Misra","affiliation":["Dept. of E&C Engg., Moradabad Institute of Technology Moradabad, U.P., India"],"firstName":"Rajul","lastName":"Misra","id":"37086815151"},{"name":"Alok Agarwal","affiliation":["Dept. of E&C Engg., Moradabad Institute of Technology Moradabad, U.P., India"],"firstName":"Alok","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37086812394"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1253-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-7281-1252-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1254-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8777475","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"abstract":"Satellites are the backbone of modern communication system.

The IoT is a system that connects various devices which are intelligently communicates with other objects, machines, infrastructures and also environments [1]. This research paper highlights the important components of a model \u201cSmart and Digital Green Educational Campus\u201d. A smart campus is enabled through Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology. A Smart campus links server, peripherals, campus infrastructure and people connected to the Internet of Things. And also the smart campus uses inter-connected with networks and Internet of Things (IoT) to well connect campus infrastructure on the IP network., such as outdoor lighting, building, lighting, heating, cooling power systems, security surveillance and physical access systems, parking facilities, and more. In this way in a smart campus everything share infrastructure of campus through Internet of Things. The campus becomes a platform for innovation [2]. Smart campus brings in new experiences like location based and context - aware services, smart parking, smart lighting, smart transits and smart building climate control. It also increases safety and security within the campus with connected surveillance IP cameras, smart locks, asset tracking and smart emergency services. It enables tracking of the facilities / resources and use them more efficiently. This helps in reducing the cost by the intelligent use of water, electricity and building controls. Innovative learning environment in a smart campus enhances the learning outcomes and the campus experience. It also improves the higher education facilities and operational efficiencies. Moreover, conserving electricity and reducing carbon footprint results in a greener smart campus [2] In this paper describes the importance of configuring the Green campus. The Green campus provides the connected computer and servers that is very useful for well established technology in a campus. This includes cloud computing, big data maintenance, Internet of Things enabled and wireless sensors network campus. By establishing the sensor network and Internet of Things in a green campus, the data and information will be collected in a cloud database then after the store of the data, process the data and analysis the data will be carried out time to time [4].

However, current fixed radio spectrum policy holds up the efficient use of radio spectrum due to which large part of the spectrum remain under-utilized. This requires a complete transformation of how currently spectrum is managed, from fixed spectrum assignment to dynamically accessing the spectrum. This step will help to considerably minimize the burden on bounded spectrum resources due to the expanded growth of wireless services. Recently, cognitive radio networks technology is gaining much attention due to its ability to use the spectrum more intelligently and flexibly. This technology of cognitive radio allows unlicensed users to exploit the idle spectrum channel dynamically while licensed users are not transmitting. This requires participation and agreement of licensed user to allow the use of their resources by the unlicensed users opportunistically. Thus, new incentive design mechanism in cognitive radio networks is required such that participation of licensed user nodes is ensured. Contract theory is an incentive design mechanism where participants are offered appropriately designed reward to encourage cooperation. To achieve this, the interaction between the licensed users and unlicensed users is modeled as a labor market using contract theory. In this work, first introduction to cognitive radio networks is provided followed by the survey of use of contract theory in the Next Generation Wireless Networks in the literature. The work is concluded with the possible future directions in this area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 April 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18869000","htmlLink":"/document/8777498/","conferenceDate":"18-19 April 2019","displayDocTitle":"Contract Theory Based Incentive Mechanism Design Approaches in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Survey","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contract Theory Based Incentive Mechanism Design Approaches in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Survey","confLoc":"Ghaziabad, India","sourcePdf":"9_02_12_Paperid_148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087519S","chronDate":"18-19 April 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8767165","isNumber":"8777333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8767165","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8777333","articleId":"8777498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8777503,"authors":[{"name":"Lalit Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Kamla Nehru Institute of Technology, Sultanpur, India"],"firstName":"Lalit","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086924886"},{"name":"Neelendra Badal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Kamla Nehru Institute of Technology, Sultanpur, India"],"firstName":"Neelendra","lastName":"Badal","id":"37085660650"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1253-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-7281-1252-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1254-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8777503","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Cloud computing","Ions","Ciphers","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography","data integrity","data privacy","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud storage user","hybrid encryption","single encryption algorithm","cloud computing","data privacy","AES","FHE","data confidentiality","data integrity","flow chart"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","Encryption","Decryption","Cipher Text","Hybrid encryption"]}],"abstract":"In today world scenario, user wants to keep our data in storage as well as on cloud, so in cloud user uses cloud storage.

Recent image processing system offers high definition (HD) images at high frame rates; to process this image data complex computations are required. Conversely, in several applications rapid processing is needed. Central Processing Unit (CPU) is insufficient to perform these type of applications, as they accomplish the computations with insufficient speed. To minimize the computational time and increasing the processing speed, algorithms can be implemented on hardware accelerators like field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). While hardware implementation of image processing algorithms designer will face a lot of problems (type of FPGA used, available tools, ways of implementing the algorithms).

In this paper, a static hand gesture recognition system is developed for American Sign Language using deep Convolutional Neural Network. The system architecture is light weight to make the system easily deployable and mobile.

The basic logic depiction in QCA does not use voltage level; rather it represents the binary state by polarization of electrons in the Quantum Cell, which is fundamental element of QCA. This technology has great potential to provide high space density, ultra-low power dissipation that enables us to build QCA circuits with faster speed, smaller size & high performance for integration and computation. QCA presents proficient solutions for several arithmetic circuits, such as comparators, multipliers, adders, etc. This paper presents a thorough analysis of QCA based Universal FNZ gate [1] with its stability proof upon which a new design of 2:1 multiplexer has been proposed. The proposed work uses novel implementation approaches, procedures and new interpretations of simple logic equations to create the proposed designs competent enough in terms of cell count, area, polarization etc. The functionality of universal FNZ Gate based 2:1 multiplexer has been tested by QCA Designer where a comprehensive evaluation with the formerly described designs confirm the consistent recital and high efficiency of the proposed designs.","doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2018.8777663","publicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Computing Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Computing Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766336/8777330/08777663.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8777330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2018.8777663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Cryptographic Design in Quantum Dot Cellular Automata","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Dec. 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Cryptographic Design in Quantum Dot Cellular Automata","htmlLink":"/document/8777663/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18868435","conferenceDate":"14-15 Dec. 2018","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Cryptographic Design in Quantum Dot Cellular Automata","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"ICCCA2018_Paper450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069615S","chronDate":"14-15 Dec. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8766336","isNumber":"8777330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766336","xplore-issue":"8777330","articleId":"8777663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8777667,"authors":[{"name":"Rajesh Kumar","affiliation":["RCERT, Jaipur, India"],"firstName":"Rajesh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086930035"},{"name":"Om Prakash Mahela","affiliation":["RRVPNL, Jaipur, India"],"firstName":"Om Prakash","lastName":"Mahela","id":"37085350360"},{"name":"Mahendra Kumar","affiliation":["RCERT, Jaipur, India"],"firstName":"Mahendra","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086515516"},{"name":"Nitin Kumar Suyan","affiliation":["RCERT, Jaipur, India"],"firstName":"Nitin Kumar","lastName":"Suyan","id":"37086409927"},{"name":"Neeraj Kumar","affiliation":["RCERT, Jaipur, India"],"firstName":"Neeraj","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086516404"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1253-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-7281-1252-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1254-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8777667","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Power transmission lines","Indexes","Transmission line measurements","Wavelet transforms","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision trees","fault diagnosis","power engineering computing","power transmission faults","power transmission protection","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current based algorithm","transmission line protection","current based scheme","harmonic wavelet","based decision tree","fault index","transmission line faults"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Faults","harmonic wavelet transform","power system","rule based decision tree","transmission line"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an algorithm to provide current based scheme for protection of transmission line.

In this paper researchers are tend use All convolution network method in replacement of FULL CONVOLUTION NETWORK and to detect brain tumor more effectively and accurately we are going to use a combination of DEEP LEARNING and MACHINE LEARNING which will make detection in a better way. The ALL CONVOLUTION NETWORK will use CONV which are designed for a modern convolution network. In the case of assessing and identifying the tumor instead of using 2d detection and dice cut here we are going to use 3d segmentation in detection which makes it more accurate. Different algorithms are work best for different sub regions and fusing several best algorithms will yield a good result in full segmentation with the help of FCN. And FCN to CONV layer replacement means great reduction in the number of parameters. It's cool to save the memory, but it's loss of flexibility nevertheless. In my experiments, CIFAR-10 classification accuracy dropped slightly after this single change, though it was certainly within one standard deviation.

For a traditional system architecture on multi-target vital-signs monitoring, complicated systems are required such as phased array radar or continuous wave (CW) radar with beamforming technology. In contrast, this architecture has the advantage of enhanced resolution capability, relatively simple circuit, and low cost. By using advanced signal processing such as adaptive boundary, we can detect multi-target vital signs even though the difference of the distances to the two targets is less than the range resolution of FMCW radar. In terms of demodulation, heart rate (HR) is susceptible to the harmonic of respiratory rate (RR) using complex signal demodulation (CSD). Therefore, this paper uses an ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) algorithm to extract the intrinsic mode functions of RR and HR. Experiments show that, we can improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and accuracy significantly using this algorithm. And the vital sign errors of the two targets separated at 70 cm and 50 cm are averagely 2.35% and 4.44%, respectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar detection","Doppler radar","Demodulation","Time-frequency analysis","Frequency modulation","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","CW radar","demodulation","FM radar","Hilbert transforms","medical signal processing","object detection","phased array radar","radar detection","radar resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multitarget vital signs","FMCW radar","frequency modulation continuous wave radar","vital-signs monitoring","phased array radar","vital sign errors","complex signal demodulation","harmonic of respiratory rate","ensemble empirical mode decomposition algorithm","EEMD algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CSD demodulation","EEMD Algorithm","frequency modulation continuous wave (FMCW) radar","multitarget monitoring","non-contact vital sign detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IMBIOC.2019.8777810","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Biomedical Conference (IMBioC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Biomedical Conference (IMBioC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766265/8777735/08777810.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8777735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMBIOC.2019.8777810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Detection of Multi-Target Vital Signs Using EEMD Algorithm Based on FMCW Radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Detection of Multi-Target Vital Signs Using EEMD Algorithm Based on FMCW Radar","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777810/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8777810/","accessionNumber":"18867735","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Detection of Multi-Target Vital Signs Using EEMD Algorithm Based on FMCW Radar","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"WA1B_04_43_3_0.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02886S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766265","isNumber":"8777735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766265","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8777735","articleId":"8777810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8777818,"authors":[{"name":"Qiangli Xi","affiliation":["Laboratoty of Applied Research on Electromagnetics, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qiangli","lastName":"Xi","id":"37086919277"},{"name":"He Wang","affiliation":["Laboratoty of Applied Research on Electromagnetics, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086837947"},{"name":"Shiwei Dong","affiliation":["Xi'an Institute of Space Radio Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shiwei","lastName":"Dong","id":"37086918851"},{"name":"Lixin Ran","affiliation":["Laboratoty of Applied Research on Electromagnetics, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lixin","lastName":"Ran","id":"37272889200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7396-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8777818","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Radar antennas","Doppler radar","Signal to noise ratio","Antenna arrays","RF signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","biomedical measurement","interference suppression","radar applications","radar clutter","radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable active beamforming array","biomedical radar applications","low-power biomedical radars","human vital signs detection","unwanted interferences","stationary clutters","indoor environments","reconfigurable beamforming array","receiving antenna","beamforming technology","biomedical radar-based applications"]}],"abstract":"Low-power biomedical radars designed for human vital signs detection suffer from unwanted interferences and strong scattering due to stationary clutters in indoor environments.

However, it suffers from the computational complexity and performance constraints caused by the extra PA modeling. In this paper, a novel DLA-based digital predistortion technique, which uses instantaneous complex gain(ICG) model to replace PA model in traditional DLA in order to avoid PA modeling, was proposed. This technique improves the adaptive algorithm for coefficients extraction and can greatly reduce the computational complexity with good linearization performance. The simulation results show that the computational complexity can be reduced by 50.03%.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linearisation techniques","radiofrequency power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital predistortion techniques","high realtime capability","computational complexity","PA model","DLA-based digital predistortion technique","power amplifier","instantaneous complex gain model","coefficients extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power amplifier","ICG","Direct learning architecture"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IMBIOC.2019.8777858","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Biomedical Conference (IMBioC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Biomedical Conference (IMBioC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766265/8777735/08777858.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8777735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMBIOC.2019.8777858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel DLA-Based Digital Predistortion Technique for Power Amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel DLA-Based Digital Predistortion Technique for Power Amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777858/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8777858/","accessionNumber":"18867738","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel DLA-Based Digital Predistortion Technique for Power Amplifier","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"TAP_19_140_2_0.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046764S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766265","isNumber":"8777735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766265","xplore-issue":"8777735","articleId":"8777858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8777864,"authors":[{"name":"Takuya Sakamoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuya","lastName":"Sakamoto","id":"37085696520"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7396-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8777864","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":330},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","MIMO communication","Heart rate","Signal to noise ratio","Array signal processing","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical measurement","cardiology","diversity reception","health care","millimetre wave antenna arrays","MIMO radar","omnidirectional antennas","patient monitoring","radar antennas","ultra wideband radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncontact measurement","human vital signs","radar-based noncontact measurements","human bodies","healthcare applications","unobtrusive sensing","physical health","mental health","high-power microwaves","public health regulations","signal-to-noise ratio","multiple-input multiple-output antenna array","instantaneous heart rate","low-gain omnidirectional antennas","low-power millimeter-wave ultrawideband MIMO array radar","maximum ratio combining technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","radar","vital signs","ultrawideband"]}],"abstract":"Radar-based noncontact measurements of human bodies have increasingly been attracting attention in healthcare applications because such measurements allow for the unobtrusive sensing of vital signs without sensors being attached to the body. In particular, measurement of the heart rate is considered to be important because it provides various types of information on the physical and mental health of the person under test. In such applications, it is preferable to use low-gain omni-directional antennas so that the person under test does not have to be located at a specific spot. In addition, the use of high-power microwaves is not allowed in many countries owing to public health regulations. Because of such factors, the signal-to-noise ratio is relatively low in these applications although the target person might be within a few meters of the antennas. To overcome this difficulty, we adopt the maximum ratio combining technique with a multiple-input multiple-output antenna array for improving the signal-to-noise ratio and accuracy in measuring the instantaneous heart rate.","doi":"10.1109/IMBIOC.2019.8777864","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Biomedical Conference (IMBioC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Biomedical Conference (IMBioC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766265/8777735/08777864.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMBIOC.2019.8777864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8777735","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncontact Measurement of Human Vital Signs during Sleep Using Low-power Millimeter-wave Ultrawideband MIMO Array Radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777864/","displayDocTitle":"Noncontact Measurement of Human Vital Signs during Sleep Using Low-power Millimeter-wave Ultrawideband MIMO Array Radar","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18867786","htmlLink":"/document/8777864/","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncontact Measurement of Human Vital Signs during Sleep Using Low-power Millimeter-wave Ultrawideband MIMO Array Radar","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"MP2B_06_168_2_0.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065593S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766265","isNumber":"8777735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766265","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8777735","articleId":"8777864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8777895,"authors":[{"name":"Die Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Radar Imaging and Microwave Photonics, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Die","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086922068"},{"name":"Daiyin Zhu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Radar Imaging and Microwave Photonics, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Daiyin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37273232400"},{"name":"Rui Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Radar Imaging and Microwave Photonics, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086922391"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7395-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7394-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7396-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8777895","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Azimuth","Synthetic aperture radar","Imaging","Field programmable gate arrays","Interpolation","Parallel processing","Radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","interpolation","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Xilinx Virtex7-XC7VX690T-2FFG1761 development board","Video SAR high-speed processing technology","FPGA","Video Synthetic Aperture Radar","Field Programmable Gate Array","imaging processing speed","high-speed processing scheme","PFA imaging algorithm","video SAR imaging processing","multipulse parallel range processing","data processing","SINC interpolation parallel azimuth processing","radar imaging","frequency 200.0 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["programmable logic gate array","video synthetic aperture radar","frame rate","high speed processing"]}],"abstract":"Designing and implementing a Video SAR (Video Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR) high-speed processing system through a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), which can achieve an imaging processing speed of 5 frames per second.

However, due to the coupling between the range and angle, the joint range and angle estimation for the FDA inevitably increases the complexity. In this paper, we focus on the frequency diverse array with random frequency increment to avoid the range and angle coupling, and combine it with the MIMO radar to achieve high-resolution range and angle estimation. An atomic norm-based method is proposed to localize the targets, in which the range and angle estimation problem is formulated as a structured low-rank matrix recovery problem. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better performance than the sparse recovery-based method.","doi":"10.1109/IMBIOC.2019.8777927","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Biomedical Conference (IMBioC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Biomedical Conference (IMBioC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766265/8777735/08777927.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMBIOC.2019.8777927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8777735","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Target Localization for FDA-MIMO Radar with Random Frequency Increment via Atomic Norm Minimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8777927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Target Localization for FDA-MIMO Radar with Random Frequency Increment via Atomic Norm Minimization","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8777927/","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2019","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18867758","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8777927/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target Localization for FDA-MIMO Radar with Random Frequency Increment via Atomic Norm Minimization","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"WAP_19_179_2_0.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059338S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766265","isNumber":"8777735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766265","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8777735","articleId":"8777927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8777942,"authors":[{"name":"Xiyuan Tang","affiliation":["The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Xiyuan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085611577"},{"name":"Begum Kasap","affiliation":["The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Begum","lastName":"Kasap","id":"37086918700"},{"name":"Linxiao Shen","affiliation":["The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Linxiao","lastName":"Shen","id":"37086054732"},{"name":"Xiangxing Yang","affiliation":["The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Xiangxing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086700747"},{"name":"Wei Shi","affiliation":["The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Shi","id":"37086698083"},{"name":"Nan Sun","affiliation":["The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37590237800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-86348-720-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0914-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5636"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2158-5601"}],"articleNumber":"8777942","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1339},"abstract":"This paper presents an energy-efficient comparator with a novel dynamic pre-amplifier (pre-amp).

In addition to that, the proposed scheme enables direct DVFS switching due to the voltage variation tolerance with minimized performance penalty. The LPDDR5 PHY in an 8nm technology demonstrated 6.4Gb/s/pin with 0.31UI at 640mV and 7.3Gb/s/pin with 0.25UI at 790mV, respectively.

With novel 4-tap pixel structure, we achieved motion artifact-free depth map. Column fixed-pattern phase noise (FPPN) is reduced by introducing alternative control of the clock delay propagation path in the photo-gate driver. As a result, motion artifact and column FPPN are not noticeable in the depth map. The proposed ToF sensor shows depth noise less than 0.62% with 940-nm illuminator over the working distance up to 400 cm, and consumes 197 mW for VGA, which is 0.64 pW/pixel.","doi":"10.23919/VLSIC.2019.8778090","publicationTitle":"2019 Symposium on VLSI Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 Symposium on VLSI Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766307/8777931/08778090.pdf","startPage":"C258","endPage":"C259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/VLSIC.2019.8778090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8777931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 640\u00d7480 Indirect Time-of-Flight CMOS Image Sensor with 4-tap 7-\u03bcm Global-Shutter Pixel and Fixed-Pattern Phase Noise Self-Compensation Scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 June 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778090/","displayDocTitle":"A 640\u00d7480 Indirect Time-of-Flight CMOS Image Sensor with 4-tap 7-\u03bcm Global-Shutter Pixel and Fixed-Pattern Phase Noise Self-Compensation Scheme","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18867956","htmlLink":"/document/8778090/","conferenceDate":"9-14 June 2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 640\u00d7480 Indirect Time-of-Flight CMOS Image Sensor with 4-tap 7-\u03bcm Global-Shutter Pixel and Fixed-Pattern Phase Noise Self-Compensation Scheme","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"C21-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076474S","chronDate":"9-14 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766307","isNumber":"8777931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766307","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8777931","articleId":"8778090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"JSAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778095,"authors":[{"name":"Chandrakanth R.

This is particularly difficult since these parameters (bandwidth, linearity, efficiency, and VSWR tolerance) trade off strongly with each other in a power amplifier (PA). In this paper, we present a PA architecture that exploits mutual load pulling through a multi-port network in a nonlinear fashion to achieve VSWR tolerance while demonstrating Doherty-like operation across 26-42 GHz. The PA designed in 65-nm bulk CMOS generates P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sat</sub>\n>19 dBm with PAE\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">peak</sub>\n>20% across all bands and achieves up to 3.35x and 4.84x enhancement in PAE at back-off power levels of 6 and 9.6 dB over class-A operation. In addition, the PA demonstrates strong tolerance to VSWR events with only 2 dB degradation over a VSWR 4:1 load circle and supports 64QAM OFDM modulation with 8 Gbps across 28-40GHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 June 2019","publicationDate":"June 2019","conferenceDate":"9-14 June 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8778095/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18868006","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 26-42 GHz Broadband, Back-off Efficient and Vswr Tolerant CMOS Power Amplifier Architecture for 5G Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 26-42 GHz Broadband, Back-off Efficient and Vswr Tolerant CMOS Power Amplifier Architecture for 5G Applications","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"C2-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.231531S","chronDate":"9-14 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766307","isNumber":"8777931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766307","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8777931","articleId":"8778095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"JSAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8778100,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In addition to improving FPGA performance, toolchains for the development of FPGAs in OpenCL have been developed and offered by FPGA vendors that reduce the programming effort required. These improvements reveal the possibility of implementing a concept to enable on-the-fly offloading computation at which CPUs/GPUs perform poorly to FPGAs while performing low-latency data movement. We think that this concept is key to improving the performance of heterogeneous supercomputers using accelerators such as the GPU. In this paper, we propose an OpenCL-enabled data movement method to directly access the global memory of the GPU and show how to implement cooperative GPU-FPGA computation using it. The results of experiments show that our proposed method can achieve a latency of 0.59 \u03bcs and a data transfer rate as high as 7.0 GB/s between the GPU and the FPGA, thus confirming that it is effective at realizing high-performance cooperative GPU-FPGA computation.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00090","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765855/8778198/08778224.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU-FPGA Heterogeneous Computing with OpenCL-Enabled Direct Memory Access","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GPU-FPGA Heterogeneous Computing with OpenCL-Enabled Direct Memory Access","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18867676","publicationDate":"May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8778224/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778224/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2019","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU-FPGA Heterogeneous Computing with OpenCL-Enabled Direct Memory Access","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"555500a489.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062777S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765855","isNumber":"8778198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765855","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8778198","articleId":"8778224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778234,"authors":[{"name":"Jeremy Kepner","affiliation":["MIT Department of Mathematics"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Kepner","id":"37297354300"},{"name":"Ryan Robinett","affiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Robinett","id":"37086919559"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3510-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3511-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8778234","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Network topology","Decision trees","Nickel","Feedforward neural networks","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","sparse matrices","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse neural network topologies","RadiX-Net","structured sparse matrices","deep neural networks","sparse DNNs","dense DNNs","sparse topology","parent dense DNN","sparse DNN topologies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sparse neural networks, sparse matrices, artificial intelligence"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00051","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765855/8778198/08778234.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00051","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RadiX-Net: Structured Sparse Matrices for Deep Neural Networks","abstract":"The sizes of deep neural networks (DNNs) are rapidly outgrowing the capacity of hardware to store and train them. Research over the past few decades has explored the prospect of sparsifying DNNs before, during, and after training by pruning edges from the underlying topology. The resulting neural network is known as a sparse neural network. More recent work has demonstrated the remarkable result that certain sparse DNNs can train to the same precision as dense DNNs at lower runtime and storage cost. An intriguing class of these sparse DNNs is the X-Nets, which are initialized and trained upon a sparse topology with neither reference to a parent dense DNN nor subsequent pruning. We present an algorithm that deterministically generates RadiX-Nets: sparse DNN topologies that, as a whole, are much more diverse than X-Net topologies, while preserving X-Nets' desired characteristics. We further present a functional-analytic conjecture based on the longstanding observation that sparse neural network topologies can attain the same expressive power as dense counterparts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18867698","htmlLink":"/document/8778234/","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2019","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"RadiX-Net: Structured Sparse Matrices for Deep Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RadiX-Net: Structured Sparse Matrices for Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"555500a268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072539S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765855","isNumber":"8778198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765855","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8778198","articleId":"8778234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778248,"authors":[{"name":"Enrico Reggiani","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Reggiani","id":"37085844285"},{"name":"Marco Rabozzi","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Rabozzi","id":"37085366233"},{"name":"Anna Maria Nestorov","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Anna Maria","lastName":"Nestorov","id":"37086007304"},{"name":"Alberto Scolari","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Scolari","id":"37085411095"},{"name":"Luca Stornaiuolo","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Stornaiuolo","id":"37086110841"},{"name":"Marco Santambrogio","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Santambrogio","id":"37300243700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3510-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3511-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8778248","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":336},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Convolution","Parallel processing","Computer architecture","Kernel","Acceleration","Pareto optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","field programmable gate arrays","integer programming","learning (artificial intelligence)","linear programming","logic design","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSE configurations","AlexNet network","Xilinx Virtex-7 XC7VX485T","FPGA","pareto optimal design space exploration","accelerated CNN","Convolutional Neural Networks","server-class contexts","Graphics Processing Units","Field Programmable Gate Arrays","resources time-sharing","optimal kernel configurations","resource consumption","integer linear programming","ILP","GPU"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CNN","FPGA","Design Space Exploration","pareto","integer linear programming","dataflow","hardware description language","high level synthesis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00028","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765855/8778198/08778248.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pareto Optimal Design Space Exploration for Accelerated CNN on FPGA","abstract":"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are at the base of many applications, both in embedded and in server-class contexts. While Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are predominantly used for training, solutions for inference often rely on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) since they are more flexible and cost-efficient in many scenarios. However, existing approaches fall short to accomplish several conflicting goals, like efficiently using resources on multiple platforms while retaining deep configurability and allowing a quick Design Space Exploration (DSE) towards the best solution. This paper proposes a solution composed of highly configurable kernels designed for resources time-sharing with an analytical model of their resource/performance characteristics. Building on such models, we propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based approach to effectively identify pareto optimal kernel configurations in terms of throughput and resource consumption. We evaluate our DSE on two state-of-the-art CNNs, showing how it identifies hundreds of pareto optimal solutions in less than a minute. Guided from the DSE configurations of the AlexNet network, we quickly identified a candidate design for a Xilinx Virtex-7 XC7VX485T FPGA and achieved a peak throughput of 4.05 ms per image, while we measured a maximum estimation error of 6.69% with respect to the proposed analytical models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18867670","htmlLink":"/document/8778248/","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2019","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Pareto Optimal Design Space Exploration for Accelerated CNN on FPGA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pareto Optimal Design Space Exploration for Accelerated CNN on FPGA","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"555500a107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121627S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765855","isNumber":"8778198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765855","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8778198","articleId":"8778248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778249,"authors":[{"name":"Cristina Heghedus","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Stavanger, Norway"],"firstName":"Cristina","lastName":"Heghedus","id":"37085994703"},{"name":"Antorweep Chakravorty","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Stavanger, Norway"],"firstName":"Antorweep","lastName":"Chakravorty","id":"38241546500"},{"name":"Chunming Rong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Stavanger, Norway"],"firstName":"Chunming","lastName":"Rong","id":"37411450600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3510-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3511-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8778249","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":346},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778249","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Graphics processing units","Task analysis","Computational modeling","Public transportation","Predictive models","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","decision making","Internet of Things","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","parallel programming","public transport","traffic information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["public transportation prediction","sensors","decision making","IoT devices","permanent downhole gauges","petroleum industry","GPS devices","electricity forecasting","renewable energy production","gas production","solar radiation","wind power","public transportation data","optimization","Tensorflow","PyTorch","parallel programming","data parallelism","neural network frameworks","energy informatics","electricity usage","machine learning","deep learning models","neural networks","energy tasks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine learning","PyTorch","Tensorflow","Parallel training","GPU programming","Public transportation"]}],"abstract":"In the era of Internet of Things (IoT), huge amount of data is being produced, by humans, sensors and machines. Thus prediction, modeling and decision making, in the majority of fields, have become highly data driven. In the vast field of Energy Informatics, IoT devices include video/photo cameras, smart meter (recording electricity usage), permanent downhole gauges (PDG - used in petroleum industry), GPS devices (used in transportation), etc. Constant research is being conducted on topics such as electricity forecasting, renewable energy production, public transit optimization and prediction, oil and gas production, solar radiation, wind power and so on. The interest in this paper is centered around public transportation data. Related works, on all kinds of Energy tasks, are meticulous and fruitful, always showing improvements. However, the topic is not by far exhausted, due to the constant evolution of technology and emergence of new methods. Implementing a model for forecasting, optimization or other tasks, is user and field dependent. In this work, a parallel between two high level implementation methods, Tensorflow and PyTorch, is presented, highlighting the advantages of each, regarding computational requirements, learning, parallel programming, data parallelism, accuracy, etc. Four Neural Networks are tested for this scope, two Machine Learning and two Deep Learning models, implemented in Tensorflow and in PyTorch. The results show that models implemented in Tensorflow are slightly more accurate, however, models in PyTorch are faster in training and easier to implement.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00138","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765855/8778198/08778249.pdf","startPage":"842","endPage":"849","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Frameworks.

Although the biggest problem in utilizing FPGAs for HPC applications is in the difficulty of developing FPGAs, this problem is being solved by High Level Synthesis (HLS). We focus on very high-performance inter-FPGA communication capabilities. The absolute floating-point performance of an FPGA is lower than that of other common accelerators such as GPUs. However, we consider that we can apply FPGAs to a wide variety of HPC applications if we can combine computations and communications on an FPGA. The purpose of this paper is to implement a parallel processing system running applications implemented by HLS combining computations and communications in FPGAs. We propose the Channel over Ethernet (CoE) system that connects multiple FPGAs directly for OpenCL parallel programming. \"Channel\"' is one of the new extensions provided by the Intel OpenCL environment. They are ordinally used for intra-kernel communication inside an FPGA, but we extend them to external communication through the CoE system. In this paper, we introduce two benchmarks as demonstration of the CoE system. We achieved 29.77 Gbps in throughput (approximately 75% of the theoretical peak of 40Gbps) and 950 ns in latency on our system using the pingpong benchmark, which was implemented on Intel Arria10 FPGA. In addition, we evaluated the Himeno benchmark which is a sort of 3D-Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on the system, and we achieved 23689MFLOPS with 4 FPGAs on a problem of size M. We also notice strong scalability, with a 3.93 times speedup compared to a single FPGA run, on the same problem size.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00089","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765855/8778198/08778264.pdf","startPage":"479","endPage":"488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Processing on FPGA Combining Computation and Communication in OpenCL Programming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Processing on FPGA Combining Computation and Communication in OpenCL Programming","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8778264/","accessionNumber":"18867638","publicationDate":"May 2019","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Processing on FPGA Combining Computation and Communication in OpenCL Programming","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"555500a479.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059719S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765855","isNumber":"8778198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765855","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8778198","articleId":"8778264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778272,"authors":[{"name":"Xiongwei Fei","affiliation":["College of Information and Electronic Engineering, Hunan City University, Yiyang, China"],"firstName":"Xiongwei","lastName":"Fei","id":"37086112153"},{"name":"Kenli Li","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Kenli","lastName":"Li","id":"38540610000"},{"name":"Wangdong Yang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Wangdong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37535346600"},{"name":"Keqin Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, State University of New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Keqin","lastName":"Li","id":"37277618700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3510-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3511-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8778272","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"abstract":"Encryption plays an important role in protecting data, especially data transferred on the Internet. However, encryption is computationally expensive and this leads to high energy costs. Parallel encryption solutions using more CPU/GPU cores can achieve high performance. If we consider energy efficiency to be cost effective using parallel encryption solutions at the same time, this problem can be alleviated effectively. Because many CPU/GPU cores and encryption are pervasive currently, saving energy cost by parallel encrypting has become an unavoidable problem. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient parallel Advance Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm for CPU-GPU heterogeneous platforms. These platforms, such as the Green 500 computers, are popular in both high performance and general computing. Parallelizing AES, using both GPUs and CPUs, balances the workload between CPUs and GPUs based on their computing capacities. This approach also uses the Nvidia Management Library (NVML) to adjust GPU frequencies, overlaps data transfers and computation, and fully utilizes GPU computing resources to reduce energy consumption as much as possible. Experiments conducted on a platform with one K20M GPU and two Xeon E5-2640 v2 CPUs show that this approach can reduce energy consumption by 74% compared to CPU-only parallel AES and 21% compared to GPU-only parallel AES on the same platform. Its energy efficiency is 4.66 MB/Joule on average higher than both CPU-only parallel AES (1.15 MB/Joule) and GPU-only parallel AES (3.65 MB/Joule). As an energy-efficient parallel AES solution, it can be used to encrypt data on heterogeneous platforms to save energy, especially for the computers with thousands of heterogeneous nodes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765855/8778198/08778272.pdf","startPage":"499","endPage":"508","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778198","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Energy Efficiency of a Parallel AES Algorithm for CPU-GPU Heterogeneous Platforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Energy consumption","Encryption","Parallel processing","Power demand","Libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","cryptography","graphics processing units","multiprocessing systems","parallel algorithms","parallel architectures","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU-only parallel AES","energy-efficient parallel AES solution","energy efficiency","parallel AES algorithm","CPU-GPU heterogeneous platforms","high energy costs","parallel encryption solutions","energy cost","parallel encrypting","Green 500 computers","general computing","parallelizing AES","computing capacities","GPU frequencies","data transfers","energy consumption","CPU-only parallel AES","energy-efficient parallel advance encryption standard algorithm","voltage 2640.0 V","memory size 4.66 MByte","memory size 1.15 MByte","memory size 3.65 MByte"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Advanced Encryption Standard, CPU parallelism, energy efficiency, frequency adjustment, GPU parallelism, heterogeneous platform, occupancy, overlap, workload balancing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778272/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Energy Efficiency of a Parallel AES Algorithm for CPU-GPU Heterogeneous Platforms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8778272/","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18867641","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Energy Efficiency of a Parallel AES Algorithm for CPU-GPU Heterogeneous Platforms","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"555500a499.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096472S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765855","isNumber":"8778198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765855","xplore-issue":"8778198","articleId":"8778272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778276,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroya Ikeda","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Takayama, Ikoma, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroya","lastName":"Ikeda","id":"37086589463"},{"name":"Hiroki Yamane","affiliation":["Departrment of Electronics and Informatics, Ryukoku University, Seta, Otsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Yamane","id":"37086431880"},{"name":"Mutsumi Kimura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Takayama, Ikoma, Japan"],"firstName":"Mutsumi","lastName":"Kimura","id":"37309652900"},{"name":"Yuki Shibayama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Takayama, Ikoma, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Shibayama","id":"37086427815"},{"name":"Yasuhiko Nakashima","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Takayama, Ikoma, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuhiko","lastName":"Nakashima","id":"37646839900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3510-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3511-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8778276","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778276","abstract":"As the performance of integrated circuits has improved, attention has focused on functions of the brain having the most advanced information processing capability. Therefore, attempts to realize the functions with engineering approach have been actively conducted around the world.

Therefore, it is expected that neuromorphic computing has unprecedented innovative processing functions. The time required for information processing of brain-type computing is determined by the response time of the memory. Therefore, conventional digital computers require several tens of steps for the associated memory operations, but analog neuromorphic systems can do so in one step. In this article, we have implemented and evaluated neuromorphic hardware modeling human brain neurons using cellular neural networks and oxide semiconductor a-IGZO. A cellular neural network is used because it is suitable for large-scale integration of electronic equipment. Since oxide semiconductor elements can be used as synaptic elements by improved Hebb learning, deterioration in characteristics is thereof used as strength plasticity of synaptic connection. A letter correction system is developed by a cellular neural network and oxide semiconductor synapses, and the letter correction rate is evaluated by logic simulation.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00105","startPage":"603","endPage":"608","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765855/8778198/08778276.pdf","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Neuromorphic Hardware using Cellular Neural Networks and Oxide Semiconductors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Synapses","Biological neural networks","Cellular neural networks","Neuromorphics","Hardware","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain models","cellular neural nets","Hebbian learning","neural chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information processing functions","information processing capability","oxide semiconductor synapses","improved Hebb learning","large-scale integration","cellular neural network","cellular neural networks","human brain neurons","analog neuromorphic systems","associated memory operations","response time","brain-type computing","neuromorphic computing","distributed functions","integrated circuits","neuromorphic hardware"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neuromorphic","Cellular neural network","Oxide semiconductor","Letter correction system","Synapse device"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Neuromorphic Hardware using Cellular Neural Networks and Oxide Semiconductors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8778276/","publicationDate":"May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2019","accessionNumber":"18867700","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Neuromorphic Hardware using Cellular Neural Networks and Oxide Semiconductors","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"555500a603.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060032S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765855","isNumber":"8778198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765855","xplore-issue":"8778198","articleId":"8778276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8778282,"authors":[{"name":"Andrinandrasana David Rasamoelina","affiliation":["Ecole Nationale d'Informatique, Universit\u00e9 de Fianarantsoa, Madagascar"],"firstName":"Andrinandrasana David","lastName":"Rasamoelina","id":"37086923982"},{"name":"Fouzia Adjailia","affiliation":["Dep.

There have been attempts to accelerate FPGA routing using algorithmic improvements, multi-core or multi-CPU platforms. Instead, we propose porting FPGA routing to a CPU+FPGA platform. Motivated by the approaches used in FPGA-accelerated graph processing, we propose and implement three acceleration strategies: (1) reducing the number of expensive random memory accesses, (2) parallel and pipelined computation, and (3) efficient hardware priority queues. To test and evaluate the router performance, we implement it on DE1-SoC, a mid-end ARM+FPGA platform of Intel. Our router works and produces good quality results. Moreover, we succeed in accelerating the software router running on the embedded ARM. However, when compared to the latest VPR router running on a powerful Intel Core-i5 CPU, our CPU+FPGA router is slower. This is not unexpected, given the limited performance of the chosen hardware platform. Since this design can easily be ported to newer and higher-end CPU+FPGA systems, we estimate the performance it could achieve; the results indicate that a non-negligible speedup over the software-only router could indeed be obtained.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00034","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765855/8778198/08778298.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-Assisted Deterministic Routing for FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778298/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Assisted Deterministic Routing for FPGAs","htmlLink":"/document/8778298/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18867707","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2019","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Assisted Deterministic Routing for FPGAs","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"555500a155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091854S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765855","isNumber":"8778198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765855","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8778198","articleId":"8778298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778301,"authors":[{"name":"Beno\u00eet Gallet","affiliation":["School of Informatics, Computing and Cyber Systems, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ"],"firstName":"Beno\u00eet","lastName":"Gallet","id":"37086921785"},{"name":"Michael Gowanlock","affiliation":["School of Informatics, Computing and Cyber Systems, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Gowanlock","id":"37085358905"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3510-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3511-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8778301","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"abstract":"The distance similarity self-join is widely used in database applications and is defined as joining a table on itself using a distance predicate. The similarity self-join is often used in spatial applications and is a building block of other algorithms, such as those used for data analysis. In this paper, we propose several new optimizations mitigating load imbalance of a GPU-accelerated self-join algorithm. The data-dependent nature of the self-join makes the algorithm potentially unsuitable for the GPU's architecture, due to variance in workloads assigned to threads. Consequently, we propose a method that reduces load imbalance and subsequent thread divergence between threads executing in a warp by considering the total workload assigned to each thread, and forcing the GPU's hardware scheduler to group threads with similar workloads within the same warp. Also, by leveraging a grid-based index, we propose a new balanced computational pattern for both reducing the number of distance calculations and the workload variance between threads. Moreover, we exploit additional parallelism by increasing the workload granularity to further improve computational throughput and workload balance within warps. Our solution achieves a speedup of up to 9.7x and 1.6x on average against another GPU algorithm, and up to 10.7x with an average of 2.5x against a CPU state-of-the-art parallel

Robustness of Heterogeneous Serverless Computing Systems via Probabilistic Task Pruning","abstract":"Cloud-based serverless computing is an increasingly popular computing paradigm. In this paradigm, different services have diverse computing requirements that justify deploying an inconsistently Heterogeneous Computing (HC) system to efficiently process them. In an inconsistently HC system, each task needed for a given service, potentially exhibits different execution times on each type of machine. An ideal resource allocation system must be aware of such uncertainties in execution times and be robust against them, so that Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of users are met. This research aims to maximize the robustness of an HC system utilized to offer a serverless computing system, particularly when the system is oversubscribed. Our strategy to maximize robustness is to develop a task pruning mechanism that can be added to existing task-mapping heuristics without altering them. Pruning tasks with a low probability of meeting their deadlines improves the likelihood of other tasks meeting their deadlines, thereby increasing system robustness and overall QoS. To evaluate the impact of the pruning mechanism, we examine it on various configurations of heterogeneous and homogeneous computing systems. Evaluation results indicate a considerable improvement (up to 35%) in the system robustness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2019","publicationDate":"May 2019","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8778313/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18867703","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improving Robustness of Heterogeneous Serverless Computing Systems via Probabilistic Task Pruning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Robustness of Heterogeneous Serverless Computing Systems via Probabilistic Task Pruning","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"555500a006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095777S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765855","isNumber":"8778198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765855","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8778198","articleId":"8778313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778326,"authors":[{"name":"Tomokazu Higuchi","affiliation":["The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomokazu","lastName":"Higuchi","id":"37086917551"},{"name":"Naoki Yoshifuji","affiliation":["Fixstars Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Yoshifuji","id":"37086922210"},{"name":"Tomoya Sakai","affiliation":["Fixstars Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoya","lastName":"Sakai","id":"37086921085"},{"name":"Yoriyuki Kitta","affiliation":["Fixstars Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoriyuki","lastName":"Kitta","id":"37086922501"},{"name":"Ryousei Takano","affiliation":["AIST, Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryousei","lastName":"Takano","id":"37086048913"},{"name":"Tsutomu Ikegami","affiliation":["AIST, Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsutomu","lastName":"Ikegami","id":"37086917283"},{"name":"Kenjiro Taura","affiliation":["The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenjiro","lastName":"Taura","id":"37284826400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3510-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3511-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8778326","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ClPy: A NumPy-Compatible Library Accelerated with OpenCL","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Graphics processing units","Programming","Libraries","Python","Runtime","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","coprocessors","field programmable gate arrays","graphics processing units","learning (artificial intelligence)","parallel architectures","program compilers","software libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ClPy","Python library","Chainer machine learning framework","OpenCL support","NVIDIA GPUs","nonNVIDIA GPUs","developing cross-platform machine learning frameworks","interface compatible","CUDA Python","NumPy-compatible interface","machine learning applications","GPU-accelerated libraries","FPGA","CPU","OpenCL","NumPy-compatible library","BLAS","NumPy-like interface"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OpenCL","NumPy","Python","Deep Learning","GPU"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778326","abstract":"We developed ClPy, a Python library that supports OpenCL with a simple NumPy-like interface, and an extension of Chainer machine learning framework for OpenCL support. OpenCL emerged as a parallel computing standard with the goal of supporting a wide range of accelerators including GPUs (NVIDIA and others), FPGAs, DSPs, and CPUs. In contrast, many machine learning frameworks including Chainer have been built on top of CUDA, a predominant API for programming NVIDIA GPUs. As such, they cannot leverage other devices including non-NVIDIA GPUs and FPGAs. To facilitate developing cross-platform machine learning frameworks, ClPy is designed with an interface compatible with CuPy (CUDA Python), which itself has a NumPy-compatible interface and is used in Chainer to support both CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs. ClPy extends Chainer to any platform supporting OpenCL and can potentially do the same for other machine learning frameworks. This paper describes the design and implementation of ClPy and demonstrates it achieves reasonable performance on several machine learning applications. Our experiments show that the overhead of ClPy itself and serious performance degradation was caused by the lack of GPU-accelerated libraries of OpenCL including BLAS.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00159","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765855/8778198/08778326.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778198","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","startPage":"933","endPage":"940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"ClPy: A NumPy-Compatible Library Accelerated with OpenCL","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8778326/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18867653","publicationDate":"May 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ClPy: A NumPy-Compatible Library Accelerated with OpenCL","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"555500a933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093511S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765855","isNumber":"8778198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765855","xplore-issue":"8778198","articleId":"8778326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778332,"authors":[{"name":"Mauricio A.

Specific hardware structures have been designed to solve these problems in different platforms such as FPGAs and even ASICs. Although there are surveys about this subject, they do not present a clear criteria to real implementations, detailed explanation of design techniques and applied metrics. Presenting a different approach, this work analyzes reconfigurable hardware based structures designed to optimize deep learning algorithms.

Since that release, multiple libraries that conform to the GraphBLAS C specification have been produced. In this position paper, we launch the next phase of this ongoing community effort: a project to assemble a set of high level graph algorithms built on top of the GraphBLAS. While many of these algorithms are well-known with high quality implementations available, they have not been assembled in one place and integrated with the GraphBLAS. We call this project the LAGraph graph algorithms project and with this position paper, we put out a call for collaborators to join us.

These devices are generating unprecedented amounts of data at the edges of the infrastructure. Although the generated data provides great potential, identifying and processing relevant data points hidden in streams of unimportant data, and doing this in near real time, remains a significant challenge. Existing stream processing platforms require the data to be transported to the cloud for processing, resulting in latencies that can prevent timely decision making or may reduce the amount of data processed. To tackle this problem, we designed an IoT Edge Framework, called R-Pulsar, that extends cloud capabilities to local devices and provides a programming model for deciding what, when, and where data get collected and processed. In this paper, we discuss motivating use cases and the architectural design of R-Pulsar. We have deployed and tested R-Pulsar on embedded devices (Raspberry Pi and Android phone) and present an experimental evaluation that demonstrates that R-Pulsar can enable timely data analytics by effectively leveraging edge and cloud resources.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00146","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765855/8778198/08778344.pdf","startPage":"885","endPage":"894","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Edge-Based Framework for Enabling Data-Driven Pipelines for IoT Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"An Edge-Based Framework for Enabling Data-Driven Pipelines for IoT Systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8778344/","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18867648","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778344/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Edge-Based Framework for Enabling Data-Driven Pipelines for IoT Systems","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"555500a885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080608S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765855","isNumber":"8778198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765855","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8778198","articleId":"8778344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8778349,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Benevenuti","affiliation":["Instituto de Inform\u00e1tica- PGMICRO, Univ.

It includes blending of experimental or well-proven legacy software executing on microprocessors with out-of-core accelerators and dedicated logic circuits, or even the conversion of such software to logic circuits using high-level synthesis (HLS). An additional feature discussed in this work, which is relevant to the scientific mission of the NanosatC-BR2 nanosatellite, is the use of SRAM-based FPGA as radiation particle sensor exploiting the susceptibility of SRAM memory to bit-flips caused by radiation. The process for bit-flip recording by bitstream readback is presented as well as a set of experimental designs implemented on the FPGA for data processing. As the status of these experimental designs must be reliably tracked by a supervisory circuit implemented on the same SRAM-based FPGA, errors caused by the bit-flips must be considered. Mitigation using triple modular redundancy (TMR) is analyzed using fault injection, suggesting that a fine grain distributed TMR approach can increase mission time of the supervisory module by 8x at a target reliability of 95%, but with a penalty of 40% in the estimated total power consumption of the FPGA. Conversely, a blockwise TMR approach can increase mission time of the supervisory module by 6x at the same target reliability with no increase in the estimated total power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00032","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765855/8778198/08778349.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Applications on SRAM-Based FPGA for the NanosatC-BR2 Scientific Mission","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2019","accessionNumber":"18867640","htmlLink":"/document/8778349/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","publicationDate":"May 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Applications on SRAM-Based FPGA for the NanosatC-BR2 Scientific Mission","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"555500a140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096718S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765855","isNumber":"8778198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765855","xplore-issue":"8778198","articleId":"8778349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778361,"authors":[{"name":"Jens Rettkowski","affiliation":["Embedded Systems of Information Technology, Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Rettkowski","id":"37085350368"},{"name":"Safdar Mahmood","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Brandenburg University of Technology, Cottbus, Germany"],"firstName":"Safdar","lastName":"Mahmood","id":"37086640041"},{"name":"Arij Shallufa","affiliation":["Embedded Systems of Information Technology, Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Arij","lastName":"Shallufa","id":"37086919544"},{"name":"Michael H\u00fcbner","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Brandenburg University of Technology, Cottbus, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"H\u00fcbner","id":"37300247900"},{"name":"Diana G\u00f6hringer","affiliation":["Adaptive Dynamic Systems Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Diana","lastName":"G\u00f6hringer","id":"37393007400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3510-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3511-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8778361","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Neurons","Biological neural networks","Field programmable gate arrays","Training","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic reconfiguration","hardware security","malicious bitstream manipulation","spy-wares","energy thirsty hardware modules","energy critical applications","FPGA bitstream analysis","artificial neural networks","hardware designs","FPGAs","partial bitstreams inspection","machine learning techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Partial Bitstreams","Machine Learning","FPGA Analysis","Inspection"]}],"abstract":"Incorporating FPGAs in embedded designs, both for research and industry related applications, is getting increasingly common. Due to the inherent capability of an FPGA to reconfigure itself during run-time, entirely or partially, it has become a very cost effective and time efficient solution for end-users with ever-changing needs for their embedded and custom hardware designs. This capability allowing dynamic reconfiguration of FPGAs, unfortunately also poses a threat to hardware security in terms of malicious bitstream manipulation that can include attacks through intended hardware changes by insertion of hardware trojans, spy-wares or even energy thirsty hardware modules which eventually have adverse effects on energy critical applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to tackle this problem using machine learning techniques for FPGA bitstream analysis. By making use of different Neural Networks, we present how it paves a way to analyze partial FPGA bistreams to trace a certain module, or to find inconsistencies which can be malicious to the target hardware. In contrast to traditional methods to inspect bitstreams, our method saves a significant amount of time.","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765855/8778198/08778361.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"86","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inspection of Partial Bitstreams for FPGAs Using Artificial Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00023","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778361/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"Inspection of Partial Bitstreams for FPGAs Using Artificial Neural Networks","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18867635","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8778361/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inspection of Partial Bitstreams for FPGAs Using Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"555500a083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051831S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765855","isNumber":"8778198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765855","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8778198","articleId":"8778361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778374,"authors":[{"name":"Adrianno A.

On one hand, there are fast ways of rendering an image that often cannot portray the light behavior accurately. On the other hand, the most accurate methods, like the Ray-Tracing algorithm, are very costly regarding computing resources and takes a substantial amount of time to render a single frame. Many new techniques were conceived with the purpose of accelerating ray-tracing applications while obtaining results close to the desired. Moreover, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have recently become useful not only to prototype novel systems but also to run specialized parallel accelerators to execute the critical path of a given application. Nonetheless, embedded devices with processing capabilities and internet access generate a substantial increase of network traffic against distributed systems and cloud services, stimulating the development of Edge/Fog/In-Situ architectures and technologies. Thus, in this work, we present and analyze a Re-configurable Vector Accelerator specified in High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and the concept of a fog system that may use it. The accelerator is specialized in computing ray-triangle intersections and can be used in a distributed rendering environment. It has been implemented in a Xilinx Kintex Ultrascale FPGA (xcku060-ffva1156-2-e) using Xilinx Vivado tools. Experimental performance and energy consumption results show that the accelerator can efficiently render a simplified version of the Stanford Bunny model using different configurations with 1,2,4 and 8 Vector Cores.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00136","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765855/8778198/08778374.pdf","startPage":"826","endPage":"833","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Re-Configurable Ray-Triangle Vector Accelerator for Emerging Fog Architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778374","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778374/","displayDocTitle":"A Re-Configurable Ray-Triangle Vector Accelerator for Emerging Fog Architectures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18867682","htmlLink":"/document/8778374/","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Re-Configurable Ray-Triangle Vector Accelerator for Emerging Fog Architectures","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"555500a826.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055143S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765855","isNumber":"8778198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765855","xplore-issue":"8778198","articleId":"8778374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778385,"authors":[{"name":"Ma\u00ebl Kerbiriou","affiliation":["INRIA Lille - Nord Europe, Universite de Lille, Lille, France"],"firstName":"Ma\u00ebl","lastName":"Kerbiriou","id":"37086921632"},{"name":"Rayan Chikhi","affiliation":["C3BI USR3756, Institut Pasteur & CNRS, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Rayan","lastName":"Chikhi","id":"37086919117"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3510-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3511-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8778385","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DNA","Indexes","Bioinformatics","Compression algorithms","Sequential analysis","Parallel algorithms","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","data compression","DNA","parallel algorithms","random processes","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel decompression","gzip-compressed files","random access","DNA sequences","gzip program","DEFLATE compression algorithm","sequencing data experiments","parallel algorithm","gzip-compressed FASTQ file","data compression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compression","bioinformatics","DNA sequences","parallel algorithms"]}],"abstract":"Decompressing a file made by the gzip program at an arbitrary location is in principle impossible, due to the nature of the DEFLATE compression algorithm. Consequently, no existing program can take advantage of parallelism to rapidly decompress large gzip-compressed files. This is an unsatisfactory bottleneck, especially for the analysis of large sequencing data experiments. Here we propose a parallel algorithm and an implementation, pugz, that performs fast and exact decompression of any text file. We show that pugz is an order of magnitude faster than gunzip, and 5x faster than a highly-optimized sequential implementation (libdeflate). We also study the related problem of random access to compressed data. We give simple models and experimental results that shed light on the structure of gzip-compressed files containing DNA sequences. Preliminary results show that random access to sequences within a gzip-compressed FASTQ file is almost always feasible at low compression levels, yet is approximate at higher compression levels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Decompression of Gzip-Compressed Files and Random Access to DNA Sequences","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00042","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765855/8778198/08778385.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778198","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Decompression of Gzip-Compressed Files and Random Access to DNA Sequences","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8778385/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18867678","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Decompression of Gzip-Compressed Files and Random Access to DNA Sequences","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"555500a209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094591S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765855","isNumber":"8778198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765855","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8778198","articleId":"8778385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778393,"authors":[{"name":"Marius Knaust","affiliation":["Zuse Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Knaust","id":"37086919933"},{"name":"Florian Mayer","affiliation":["Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Friedrich-Alexander University, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Mayer","id":"37086919237"},{"name":"Thomas Steinke","affiliation":["Zuse Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Steinke","id":"37976813100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3510-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3511-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8778393","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Kernel","Runtime","Tools","Task analysis","Prototypes","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","electronic engineering computing","field programmable gate arrays","high level synthesis","message passing","parallel processing","public domain software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analytics systems","highly-parallel data processing","high-level synthesis","FPGA vendor","FPGA offloading prototype","field-programmable gate arrays","OpenMP","OpenCL SDK","high-performance computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OpenMP","FPGA","offloading","heterogeneous","accelerators","reconfigurable"]}],"abstract":"Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are of great interest for future high-performance computing and data analytics systems, since they are capable of efficient, highly-parallel data processing.

Therefore, this work presents an FD solution based on a DCNN on a distributed, embedded system with FPGAs, proposing a general approach to reduce the DCNN size and to design its FPGA cores and investigating its accuracy, performance, and energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00025","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765855/8778198/08778395.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778198","startPage":"91","endPage":"94","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Case Study for an Accelerated DCNN on FPGA-Based Embedded Distributed System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Case Study for an Accelerated DCNN on FPGA-Based Embedded Distributed System","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778395/","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2019","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18867660","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8778395/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Case Study for an Accelerated DCNN on FPGA-Based Embedded Distributed System","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"555500a091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056492S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765855","isNumber":"8778198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765855","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8778198","articleId":"8778395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778414,"authors":[{"name":"Syed Waqar Nabi","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow"],"firstName":"Syed Waqar","lastName":"Nabi","id":"37688298100"},{"name":"Wim Vanderbauwhede","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow"],"firstName":"Wim","lastName":"Vanderbauwhede","id":"37430017300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3510-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-3511-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8778414","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Buffer storage","Random access memory","Boundary conditions","Registers","System-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-chip memory resources","arbitrary stencil shapes","static buffers","buffer configuration","FPGA","4-point stencil","circular boundaries","smart-cache","DRAM","memory access optimisation","smart-caching framework","Smache"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable architectures, FPGA, Stencil code, Memory architecture, High performance computing, Dataflow computing"]}],"abstract":"A key requirement for high performance on FPGAs is to maintain continuous data streaming from the DRAM. An impediment in many computations, especially in the scientific computing domain, is irregular stencils and boundary conditions, requiring memory accesses that are random, redundant, or both. To address this problem, we present Smache, a novel smart-caching framework that uses FPGA on-chip memory resources for optimising access for arbitrary stencil shapes and boundary conditions. We propose a combination of stream and static buffers, and it is the latter that allows arbitrarily large offsets in stencils. The architecture is complemented by a formal model for determining buffer configuration. We propose a hybrid use of the block and distributed RAM on the FPGA. The design is validated for a 2D grid, 4-point stencil with circular boundaries.","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765855/8778198/08778414.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"90","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart-Cache: Optimising Memory Accesses for Arbitrary Boundaries and Stencils on FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00024","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2019","displayDocTitle":"Smart-Cache: Optimising Memory Accesses for Arbitrary Boundaries and Stencils on FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","publicationDate":"May 2019","accessionNumber":"18867689","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8778414/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart-Cache: Optimising Memory Accesses for Arbitrary Boundaries and Stencils on FPGAs","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"555500a087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053944S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765855","isNumber":"8778198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765855","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8778198","articleId":"8778414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778416,"authors":[{"name":"Youness Moukafih","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, TICLab, Morocco"],"firstName":"Youness","lastName":"Moukafih","id":"37086925099"},{"name":"Hakim Hafidi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, TICLab, Morocco"],"firstName":"Hakim","lastName":"Hafidi","id":"37086930876"},{"name":"Mounir Ghogho","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, TICLab, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mounir","lastName":"Ghogho","id":"37284467100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1862-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1861-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1863-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8778416","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":529},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Roads","Feature extraction","Acceleration","Time series analysis","Accidents","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","driver information systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","road safety","road traffic","time series","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aggressive driving detection","deep learning-based time series classification","driver aggressiveness","traffic accidents","intelligent transportation systems","aggressive driving behavior","traffic safety","drivers","driving session","naturalistic driving data","driving monitoring application","ITS","long short term memory fully convolutional network","LTSM-FCN","F-measure score","machine learning models","driver behavior classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aggressive driving","Deep learning","Smartphone"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778416","abstract":"Driver aggressiveness is a major cause of traffic accidents.

We formulate the problem as a time series classification and test the validity of our approach on the UAH-DriveSet, a public dataset that provides a large amount of naturalistic driving data obtained from smartphones via a driving monitoring application.

The message passing approach involves estimation of the channel states, approximation of the Gaussian mixtures and estimation of the correlated Gaussian samples. Correlation of channel states and correlation of input samples results in a loopy factor graph. To implement message passing on a loopy factor graph, we divide the graph in two main parts that exchange their messages by using a parallel iterative schedule.

To address this problem, we propose a new way to design an end-to-end deep CNN framework i.e., PVSNet that works in two major steps: first, an encoder-decoder network is used to learn generative domain-specific features followed by a Siamese network in which convolutional layers are pre-trained in an unsupervised fashion as an autoencoder. The proposed model is trained via triplet loss function that is adjusted for learning feature embeddings in a way that minimizes the distance between embedding-pairs from the same subject and maximizes the distance with those from different subjects, with a margin. In particular, a triplet Siamese matching network using an adaptive margin based hard negative mining has been suggested. The hyper-parameters associated with the training strategy, like the adaptive margin, have been tuned to make the learning more effective on biometric datasets. In extensive experimentation, the proposed network outperforms most of the existing deep learning solutions on three type of typical vein datasets which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 5th International Conference on Identity, Security, and Behavior Analysis (ISBA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8767100/8778452/08778623.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 5th International Conference on Identity, Security, and Behavior Analysis (ISBA)","doi":"10.1109/ISBA.2019.8778623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBA.2019.8778623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778452","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PVSNet: Palm Vein Authentication Siamese Network Trained using Triplet Loss and Adaptive Hard Mining by Learning Enforced Domain Specific Features","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Veins","Feature extraction","Training","Convolution","Deep learning","Task analysis","Iron"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","convolutional neural nets","image classification","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","vein recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive hard mining","end-to-end deep learning network","biometric features","PVSNet","encoder-decoder network","generative domain-specific features","triplet loss function","triplet Siamese matching network","adaptive margin","hard negative mining","training strategy","palm vein authentication Siamese network","domain specific features","end-to-end deep CNN framework","feature embeddings","deep learning solutions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2019","displayDocTitle":"PVSNet: Palm Vein Authentication Siamese Network Trained using Triplet Loss and Adaptive Hard Mining by Learning Enforced Domain Specific Features","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8778623/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18868801","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PVSNet: Palm Vein Authentication Siamese Network Trained using Triplet Loss and Adaptive Hard Mining by Learning Enforced Domain Specific Features","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"08-PVSNet.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056155S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8767100","isNumber":"8778452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8767100","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8778452","articleId":"8778623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778639,"authors":[{"name":"Feng-Ping An","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8778639/an-2931616-small.gif","p":["Feng-Ping An received the B.S. degree from the School of Economic and Management, Hefei University, Hefei, China, in 2008, the M.S. degree from the School of Economics and Management, Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Science and Technology.

The traditional pattern recognition method is difficult to adapt to the complex mapping relationship between the high-dimensional feature space and the state space. The deep learning method has high-dimensional feature adaptive analysis ability, which is suitable for the intelligent analysis of the high-dimensional feature space in fault states. The feedforward deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved some success in mechanical fault diagnosis. However, the rolling bearing fault signal is complex, and there are many interference factors. The CNN relying on the simple feedforward method cannot effectively meet the actual needs in the field of fault diagnosis. Although there are some CNNs with feedback methods, the CNNs of these feedback methods cannot systematically obtain the characteristic information of rolling bearing faults. Therefore, they do not solve the feature extraction problem of rolling bearing faults well. In view of this, this paper provides a specific mathematical definition of the feedback mechanism for constructing the feedback mechanism in the deep CNN, models the feedback mechanism into an optimization problem, determines the basic framework of the feedback mechanism, and an effective feedback mechanism calculation model is proposed. Based on this, a solution algorithm based on the gradient descent method is proposed. Then, an effective supervised feature extraction method based on sparse expression is proposed. It maps the sample features to the feature domain through the effective transform method. In the process, the wavelet packet transform (WPT) transform is used as the basis function to construct a dictionary with structural effects, and mixed penalty terms are introduced to further optimize the performance of structural sparse expression. Finally, the sparse expression is combined with the feedback mechanism CNN (FCNN) to establish a sub-module fault diagnosis network so that a diagnosis can determine the fault severity while assessing the bearing fault location. The example shows that the method proposed in this paper has high accuracy in determining the state of rolling bearings and has great application potential in engineering.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rolling Bearing Fault Diagnosis Algorithm Based on FMCNN-Sparse Representation","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931616","startPage":"102249","endPage":"102263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08778639.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"Rolling Bearing Fault Diagnosis Algorithm Based on FMCNN-Sparse Representation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8778639/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2019","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18880609","isOpenAccess":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701188"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2019M650512"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004480","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province","grantNumber":"201801D221171"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Rolling Bearing Fault Diagnosis Algorithm Based on FMCNN-Sparse Representation","sourcePdf":"access-an-2931616-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120821S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8778639","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778641,"authors":[{"name":"Zeming Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8778641/li-2931657-small.gif","p":["Zeming Li is currently pursuing the master\u2019s degree with the Department of Computer Science and Technology, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China.

Meanwhile, due to the advantages of cellular networks (e.g., excellent coverage and mobility/roaming support), cellular-enabled M2M communication is a promising solution for M2M-based applications. However, there are significant challenges in cellular-enabled M2M communications due to the special features of M2M-based applications [e.g., massive concurrent uplink transmissions, small bursty traffic, and the high requirements of energy efficiency (EE)]. On the other hand, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can simultaneously serve multiple users at the same frequency and time by splitting different users in the power domain and thus increase the number of concurrent connections. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient resource allocation scheme with hybrid time division multiple access (TDMA)-non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for cellular-enabled M2M networks. First, we configure the user equipments (UEs) as the machine type communication gateways (MTCGs). Then, we propose our time sharing scheme. Next, we formulate the resource allocation problems as a noncooperative game. Finally, in order to obtain the optimal EE of machine type communication devices (MTCDs) and UEs in the game to confirm the power allocation, we transform each non-convex optimization problem into the convex form by using nonlinear fractional programming and solve the transformed problem by Dinkelbach's method and Lagrangian duality theory. The simulation results show that our scheme can dramatically shorten the total transmission time at the cost of a little more total energy when compared to the existing works.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931657","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08778641.pdf","startPage":"105800","endPage":"105815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation With Hybrid TDMA\u2013NOMA for Cellular-Enabled Machine-to-Machine Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778641/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation With Hybrid TDMA\u2013NOMA for Cellular-Enabled Machine-to-Machine Communications","volume":"7","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18897520","htmlLink":"/document/8778641/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation With Hybrid TDMA\u2013NOMA for Cellular-Enabled Machine-to-Machine Communications","sourcePdf":"access-gui-2931657-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115372S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8778641","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778643,"authors":[{"name":"Runnan He","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8778643/he-2931500-small.gif","p":["Runnan He received the B.S. degree in biomedical engineering from the Shenyang University of Technology, China, in 2012, and the M.S. degree in biomedical engineering from Northeastern University, China, in 2014.

Due to the simplicity and non-invasive nature, the ECG has been widely used for detecting arrhythmias and there is an urgent need for automatic ECG detection. Up to date, some algorithms have been proposed for automatic classification of cardiac arrhythmias based on the features of the ECG; however, their stratification rate is still poor due to unreliable features of signal characteristics or limited generalization capability of the classifier, and therefore, it remains a challenge for automatic diagnosis of arrhythmias. In this paper, we propose a new method for automatic classification of arrhythmias based on deep neural networks (DNNs). The two DNN models constitutive of residual convolutional modules and bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) layers are trained to extract features from raw ECG signals.

Currently, to reduce the maintenance cost of data, personal health records are usually outsourced to a third party such as the cloud service provider. In this case, patients may lose direct control over their personal health records and the semi-trusted cloud service provider may tamper with or reveal personal health records. Therefore, ensuring the privacy and integrity of personal health records and realizing the fine-grained access control are crucial issues when personal health records are shared. As a distributed architecture with decentralized and tamper-proof features, blockchain provides a new way to protect the personal health records sharing system. In this paper, we propose a new personal health records sharing scheme with data integrity verifiable based on blockchain. Aiming at the problems of privacy disclosure, limited keyword search ability and loss of control rights in the process of personal health record sharing, the new scheme uses searchable symmetric encryption and attribute-based encryption techniques to achieve privacy protection, keyword search, and fine-grained access control. Compared with the existing similar schemes, the new scheme allows patients to distribute attribute private key for users, avoiding many security problems caused by the existing of attribute authority in the scheme. Furthermore, the new scheme uses blockchain to manage keys in the scheme, avoiding the single point failure problem of centralized key management. In particular, the new scheme stores the hash values of encrypted personal health records in blockchain, and the related index set is stored in smart contract, which can further improve the efficiency of data integrity verification. Finally, performance evaluation and security analysis indicate that our scheme is secure and feasible for practical use.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931531","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08778648.pdf","startPage":"102887","endPage":"102901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blockchain-Based Personal Health Records Sharing Scheme With Data Integrity Verifiable","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"Blockchain-Based Personal Health Records Sharing Scheme With Data Integrity Verifiable","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8778648/","accessionNumber":"18880455","volume":"7","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572019"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007128","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2016JZ001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Blockchain-Based Personal Health Records Sharing Scheme With Data Integrity Verifiable","sourcePdf":"access-dan-2931531-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109957S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8778648","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778666,"authors":[{"name":"Ajith Sivadhasan Ramani","affiliation":["Semtech, Burlington, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8883027/8778666/raman-2927541-small.gif","p":["Ajith Sivadhasan Ramani received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, India, in 2014, and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2017.

VCSEL diodes are normally driven single-ended with pseudo-differential current-mode drivers to maintain signal integrity. However, such conventional drivers consume significant power and are often unable to compensate for supply switching noise due to package parasitics at high data-rates. We propose a differential push-pull voltage-mode VCSEL driver to mitigate bondwire parasitics, reduce power consumption, and leverage CMOS process scaling to its maximum advantage. A proof-of-concept prototype in 65-nm CMOS process achieves the highest ever-reported PCE of 18.7 % for VCSEL drivers when normalized to VCSEL slope efficiency. It uses an asymmetric 3-tap rise and fall-based pre-emphasis to achieve a total energy/bit of 1.52 pJ/b at 16 Gb/s with an average optical power output of 1.34 dBm, OMA of 2.1 dBm, and extinction ratio of 5.92 dB.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2019.2927541","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8883027/08778666.pdf","startPage":"4147","endPage":"4157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8883027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2019.2927541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Differential Push-Pull Voltage Mode VCSEL Driver in 65-nm CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","displayDocTitle":"A Differential Push-Pull Voltage Mode VCSEL Driver in 65-nm CMOS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778666/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19096832","htmlLink":"/document/8778666/","volume":"66","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Differential Push-Pull Voltage Mode VCSEL Driver in 65-nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"tcsi-sivadhasanramani-2927541-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077151S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8883027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8883027","articleId":"8778666","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778668,"authors":[{"name":"Neil Sahota","affiliation":["Subject Matter Expert on AI for the United Nations"],"bio":{"p":["Neil Sahota is a sought-after business consultant and serves as the AI subject matter expert for the United Nations, working to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals through AI and build a better future for all.

We use fractional programming to solve an energy efficiency maximization problem and exploit the Dinkelbach method (DM)-based framework to optimize the number of active RF chains and data streams. This solution is updated dynamically based on the current channel conditions, where the analog/digital (A/D) hybrid precoder and combiner matrices at the transmitter and the receiver, respectively, are designed using a codebook-based fast approximation solution called gradient pursuit (GP). The GP algorithm shows less run time and complexity while compared to the state-of-the-art orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) solution. The energy and spectral efficiency performance of the proposed framework is compared with the existing state-of-the-art solutions, such as the brute force (BF), the digital beamformer, and the analog beamformer. The codebook-free approaches to design the precoders and combiners, such as alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) and singular value decomposition (SVD)-based solution are also shown to be incorporated into the proposed framework to achieve better energy efficiency performance.","doi":"10.1109/TGCN.2019.2931613","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/7511293/8907532/08778669.pdf","startPage":"886","endPage":"900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGCN.2019.2931613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8907532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic RF Chain Selection for Energy Efficient and Low Complexity Hybrid Beamforming in Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778669/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic RF Chain Selection for Energy Efficient and Low Complexity Hybrid Beamforming in Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems","volume":"3","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8778669/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/P000703/1 and EP/L026147/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic RF Chain Selection for Energy Efficient and Low Complexity Hybrid Beamforming in Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tgcn-kaushik-2931613-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1039S","chronDate":"Dec.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7511293","isNumber":"8907532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7511293","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8907532","articleId":"8778669","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778670,"authors":[{"name":"Pingyang Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Pingyang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086638515"},{"name":"Jun Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-6767-3328","id":"37598871100"},{"name":"Long Shi","affiliation":["Science and Math Cluster, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Shi","orcid":"0000-0001-6124-5173","id":"37531266100"},{"name":"Ming Ding","affiliation":["Data61, CSIRO, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Ding","orcid":"0000-0002-3690-0321","id":"37085385420"},{"name":"Kui Cai","affiliation":["Science and Math Cluster, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Cai","orcid":"0000-0003-2059-0071","id":"37391393000"},{"name":"Fuli Yang","affiliation":["China Unicom Jiangsu Branch, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Fuli","lastName":"Yang","id":"37087041814"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8778670","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":969},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Wireless communication","Reinforcement learning","Markov processes","Heuristic algorithms","Decision making","Toy manufacturing industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","decision making","learning (artificial intelligence)","Markov processes","recurrent neural nets","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic content update strategy","cache-enabled base station","wireless caching network","reinforcement learning","wireless edge caching","deep Q-network-based algorithms","short-term memory network","Markov decision process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Content update","Markov decision process","deep reinforcement learning","cache hit rate","long-term reward"]}],"abstract":"This letter studies a basic wireless caching network, where a source server is connected to a cache-enabled base station (BS) that serves multiple requesting users. A critical problem is how to improve cache hit rate under dynamic content popularity. To solve this problem, the primary contribution of this letter is to develop a novel dynamic content update strategy with the aid of deep reinforcement learning. Considering that the BS is unaware of content popularities, the proposed strategy dynamically updates the BS cache according to the time-varying requests and the BS cached contents. Toward this end, we model the problem of cache update as a Markov decision process and put forth an efficient algorithm that builds upon the long short-term memory network and external memory to enhance the decision making ability of the BS. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve not only a higher average reward than deep Q-network but also a higher cache hit rate than the existing replacement policies, such as the least recently used, first-in first-out, and deep Q-network-based algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2019.2931688","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8863555/08778670.pdf","startPage":"1773","endPage":"1777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8863555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2019.2931688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Content Update for Wireless Edge Caching via Deep Reinforcement Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778670","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Content Update for Wireless Edge Caching via Deep Reinforcement Learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778670/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19046125","htmlLink":"/document/8778670/","volume":"23","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program","grantNumber":"2018YFB1004800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61872184 and 61727802"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001459","fundingName":"Ministry of Education - Singapore","grantNumber":"MOE2016-T2-2-054 and SUTD-ZJU Grant ZJURP1500102"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Content Update for Wireless Edge Caching via Deep Reinforcement Learning","sourcePdf":"lcomm-shi-2931688-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103605S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8863555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8863555","articleId":"8778670","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778671,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Zhou","affiliation":["Wireless@VT, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8906190/8778671/zhou-2931538-small.gif","p":["Bo Zhou (S\u201916\u2013M\u201919) received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering from the South China University of Technology, China, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, in 2017.

In this paper, a real-time IoT monitoring system is considered, in which the IoT devices sample a physical process with a sampling cost and send the status packet to a given destination with an updating cost. This joint status sampling and updating process is designed to minimize the average age of information (AoI) at the destination node under an average energy cost constraint at each device. This stochastic problem is formulated as an infinite horizon average cost constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and transformed into an unconstrained Markov decision process (MDP) using a Lagrangian method. For the single IoT device case, the optimal policy for the CMDP is shown to be a randomized mixture of two deterministic policies for the unconstrained MDP, which is of threshold type. This reveals a fundamental tradeoff between the average AoI at the destination and the sampling and updating costs. Then, a structure-aware optimal algorithm to obtain the optimal policy of the CMDP is proposed and the impact of the wireless channel dynamics is studied while demonstrating that channels having a larger mean channel gain and less scattering can achieve better AoI performance. For the case of multiple IoT devices, a low-complexity semi-distributed suboptimal policy is proposed with the updating control at the destination and the sampling control at each IoT device. Then, an online learning algorithm is developed to obtain this policy, which can be implemented at each IoT device and requires only the local knowledge and small signaling from the destination. The proposed learning algorithm is shown to converge almost surely to the suboptimal policy. Simulation results show the structural properties of the optimal policy for the single IoT device case; and show that the proposed policy for multiple IoT devices outperforms a zero-wait baseline policy, with average AoI reductions reaching up to 33%.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2931538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8906190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2931538","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8906190/08778671.pdf","startPage":"7468","endPage":"7482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Status Sampling and Updating for Minimizing Age of Information in the Internet of Things","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Joint Status Sampling and Updating for Minimizing Age of Information in the Internet of Things","volume":"67","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8778671/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778671/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1633363, CNS-1836802 and CNS-1460316"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Status Sampling and Updating for Minimizing Age of Information in the Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zhou-2931538-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133045S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8906190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"8906190","articleId":"8778671","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778681,"authors":[{"name":"Jingtao Ding","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/9319888/8778681/ding-2931327-small.gif","p":["Jingtao Ding received the BS degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2015.

It is widely known that the performance of BPR depends largely on the quality of negative sampler. In this paper, we make two contributions with respect to BPR. First, we find that sampling negative items from the whole space is unnecessary and may even degrade the performance. Second, focusing on the purchase feedback of E-commerce, we propose a negative sampler for BPR by leveraging the additional view data. In our proposed sampler, users' viewed interactions are considered as an intermediate feedback between the purchased and unobserved interactions. We jointly learn the pairwise rankings of user preference among these three types of interactions and design a user-oriented weighting strategy during learning process, which is more effective and flexible. Compared to the vanilla BPR that applies a uniform sampler on all candidates, our view-enhanced sampler enhances BPR with a relative improvement over 36.64 and 16.40 percent on Beibei and Tmall datasets, respectively. Empirical studies demonstrate the importance of considering users' additional feedback when modeling their preference on different items, which can effectively improve the quality of sampled negative items towards learning a better personalized ranking function.

Considering mMIMO application in 5G, frequency division duplexing (FDD) can provide higher data rate and wider coverage than the time division duplexing (TDD) mode. However, since the uplink/downlink channel is not straightforwardly reciprocal, FDD downlink channel estimation requires heavier training and computation than TDD mode due to the massive number of antennas. In addition, fast channel variation renders the real time estimation even more difficult. In this paper, we propose a downlink channel prediction scheme for FDD mMIMO, which requires only the TDD overhead. Specifically, the downlink channel matrix is represented by three components: steering matrix (frequency dependent), fading coefficients (time varying), and time delays (semi-static). By the proposed scheme, these three components can be obtained through uplink training. In addition, fast tracking and prediction is leveraged to obtain the real time channel state information. Simulation results show that accurate channel prediction is obtained via low cost and complexity by the proposed scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/8845828/08778685.pdf","startPage":"1090","endPage":"1102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2019.2931671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2019.2931671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8845828","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink Channel Prediction for Time-Varying FDD Massive MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Uplink","Fading channels","Channel estimation","Delay effects","Training","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","communication complexity","fading channels","MIMO communication","prediction theory","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast channel variation renders","time estimation","downlink channel prediction scheme","downlink channel matrix","steering matrix","time delays","time channel state information","time-varying FDD massive MIMO systems","frequency division duplexing","time division duplexing mode","FDD downlink channel estimation","massive multiple-input multiple-output application","FDD mMIMO application","TDD overhead mode","fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","FDD","downlink","channel prediction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Channel Prediction for Time-Varying FDD Massive MIMO Systems","volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8778685/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"19010625","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771214, 61771216 and 61631015"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"61325004"},{"fundingName":"Innovative Project of Shenzhen City in China","grantNumber":"JCYJ20170307171931096"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Southeast University","grantNumber":"2018D10"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Channel Prediction for Time-Varying FDD Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"jstsp-jiang-2931671-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102953S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"8845828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8845828","articleId":"8778685","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778686,"authors":[{"name":"Junchao Ma","affiliation":["Key Lab of Information Coding and Transmission, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China","Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8906190/8778686/ma-2931556-small.gif","p":["Junchao Ma (S\u201916) received the M.E. degree from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Key Laboratory of Information Coding and Transmission, School of Information Science and Technology.

In this paper, we study the caching placement policy with consideration of cooperative transmission for a two-hop relay-enabled device-to-device (D2D) network. In the caching placement phase, the probabilistic caching placement policy is considered, and in the content transmission phase, the hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) scheme with soft information combining [i.e., energy accumulation (EA) and mutual-information accumulation (MIA)] is utilized to improve the content retrieval experience. Cache-aided successful transmission probability (CSTP) is adopted as the main performance metric in this paper. By using tools from stochastic geometry, analytical expressions for the CSTP under different transmission schemes are derived. In moderate or high SIR regime, the optimal caching placement policy is identified based on the analytical expression and the CSTP performance is maximized accordingly. Evaluation results suggest that the MIA-based caching strategy performs better as opposed to existing strategies in most cases, but this outperformance vanishes when the transmission environment becomes severe or when users\u2019 requests become concentrated.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2931556","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8906190/08778686.pdf","startPage":"7444","endPage":"7455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8906190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2931556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cache-Aided Cooperative Device-to-Device (D2D) Networks: A Stochastic Geometry View","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Cache-Aided Cooperative Device-to-Device (D2D) Networks: A Stochastic Geometry View","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778686/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8778686/","volume":"67","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61731017"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61661146003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013314","fundingName":"Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project","grantNumber":"111-2-14"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1802710, ECCS-1811497 and CNS-1811720"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cache-Aided Cooperative Device-to-Device (D2D) Networks: A Stochastic Geometry View","sourcePdf":"tcomm-liu-2931556-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115223S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8906190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8906190","articleId":"8778686","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778695,"authors":[{"name":"Hoda Bahonar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/9317867/8778695/bahon-2929519-small.gif","p":["Hoda Bahonar received the BSc degree in computer engineering from Payam noor University, in 2005, and the MSc degree in computer engineering from Tarbiat Modares Unviersity, in 2009.

Frequency filtering amplifies or attenuates selected frequencies using appropriate filter functions. Here, heat, anti-heat, part-sine and identity filter sets are proposed as the filter functions. A generalized version of FFE named GeFFE is also proposed by defining pseudo-Fourier operators. This method can be considered as a general framework for formulating some previously defined invariants in other works by choosing a suitable filter bank and defining suitable pseudo-Fourier operators. This flexibility empowers GeFFE to adapt itself to the properties of each graph dataset unlike the previous spectral embedding methods and leads to superior classification accuracy relative to the others. Utilizing the proposed part-sine filter set, which its members filter different parts of the spectrum in turn, improves the classification accuracy of GeFFE method.

Correntropy has been used with real, complex, and quaternion data. However, there is no literature studying the correntropy with geometric algebra data.

From the probabilistic view, this brief presents a novel geometric algebra correntropy (GAC) which represents the similarity measure between two random geometric algebra (multivector valued) variables.

Simulation is conducted to verify the advantages of the proposed adaptive algorithm under the non-Gaussian environment.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2019.2931507","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/9103104/08778696.pdf","startPage":"1164","endPage":"1168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9103104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2019.2931507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geometric Algebra Correntropy: Definition and Application to Robust Adaptive Filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2020","displayDocTitle":"Geometric Algebra Correntropy: Definition and Application to Robust Adaptive Filtering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778696/","publicationDate":"June 2020","dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2020","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19650495","htmlLink":"/document/8778696/","volume":"67","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Doctoral Innovation Fund Program of Southwest Jiaotong University, National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871461, 61571374 and 61433011"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012542","fundingName":"Sichuan Science and Technology Program","grantNumber":"19YYJC0681"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometric Algebra Correntropy: Definition and Application to Robust Adaptive Filtering","sourcePdf":"tcsii-zhao-2931507-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076486S","chronDate":"June  2020","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"9103104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"9103104","articleId":"8778696","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778700,"authors":[{"name":"Gijs van der Bent","affiliation":["TNO, The Hague, AK, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8824019/8778700/bent-2927562-small.gif","p":["Gijs van der Bent (M\u201906\u2013SM\u201913) was born in Leiden, The Netherlands, in 1975.

Potential benefits of the increased supply voltage are reduced supply currents and a lower matching ratio at the output of the amplifier. Furthermore, an increased output power per chip area is obtained due to the reduction in passive structures resulting in more area-efficient power combining. In this paper, the procedure for the design of integrated microwave stacked-FET is discussed. Several options for the correct distribution of RF voltage and current swings are investigated and the relationship between the number of stacked transistors and bandwidth is addressed. The procedure is demonstrated by the design of an S-band GaAs stacked-FET containing three transistors. This stacked-FET is applied in an S-band HPA that has a PAE of more than 40% at an output power of 20 W, which is more than twice the output power of any previously reported GaAs stacked-FET HPA.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8824019","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2019.2927562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/8824019/08778700.pdf","startPage":"3716","endPage":"3731","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2019.2927562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Procedure for Integrated Microwave GaAs Stacked-FET High-Power Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Design Procedure for Integrated Microwave GaAs Stacked-FET High-Power Amplifiers","volume":"67","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/8778700/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"18954394","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778700/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Dutch Radar Centre of Expertise (DRACE), which is a strategic alliance of Thales Netherlands and TNO"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Procedure for Integrated Microwave GaAs Stacked-FET High-Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tmtt-vanderbent-2927562-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090019S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8824019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8824019","articleId":"8778700","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":8778702,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Zahid Yalcin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, TOBB University of Economics and Technology, Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8871140/8778702/yalci-2931580-small.gif","p":["Ahmet Zahid Yalcin received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering from the TOBB University of Economics and Technology, Ankara, Turkey, in 2010, 2012, and 2018, respectively.

The multiple antenna base station communicates with K clusters, each with L users. There is a common message destined to all users and a private multicast message for each cluster. We study the weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem for two different schemes: 1) the base station transmits the superposition of common and multicast messages and 2) the base station concatenates the multicast message vector with the common message. We also formulate a second problem, weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) minimization, and prove that WSR maximization and WMMSE minimization are equivalent at the optimal solution. Inspired by the WMMSE problem, we suggest a suboptimal algorithm, based on alternating optimization. We apply this algorithm to the two transmission schemes and understand that there is a fundamental difference between the two. We compare the results with maximal ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) precoding and investigate the effects of the number of base station antennas, the number of groups, and the number of users in a group. Finally, we study imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receivers and show that the first transmission scheme is more robust.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2931580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2931580","startPage":"7302","endPage":"7315","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8871140/08778702.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8871140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoder Design For Multi-Group Multicasting With a Common Message","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Precoder Design For Multi-Group Multicasting With a Common Message","volume":"67","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19115050","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8778702/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoder Design For Multi-Group Multicasting With a Common Message","sourcePdf":"tcomm-yalcin-2931580-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083957S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8871140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8871140","articleId":"8778702","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778707,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Injudicious driving reacting to sudden changes in traffic signal can lead to additional energy consumption and increase of travel time. This paper presents a learning-based event-driven ecological (eco) driving system (EDS) that generates the optimal velocity from self-driving data of a vehicle. Currently, full autonomy of vehicles and proper infrastructure development for vehicle-to-vehicle and infrastructure-to-vehicle communications are not widespread; however, the proposed system can be beneficial for driving scenarios in the existing traffic environment. We design a Gaussian process model using a Bayesian network for naturalistic learning from driving data and traffic signal condition to estimate the probability of a vehicle crossing the intersection within a signal phase. Based on the estimated probability, the optimal velocity is generated and the vehicle (driver) will be advised to either slow down earlier (to avoid aggressive braking) at the red signal or speed up (to cross the intersection) at the green signal. Finally, microscopic simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme.

In this way, knowledge graph is compatible with numerical machine learning models. Major knowledge embedding methods employ geometric translation to design score function, which is weak-semantic for natural language processing. To overcome this disadvantage, in this paper, we propose our model based on multi-view clustering framework, which could generate semantic representations of knowledge elements (i.e., entities/relations). With our semantic model, we also present an empowered solution to entity retrieval with entity description. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves substantial improvements against baselines on the task of knowledge graph completion, triple classification, entity classification, and entity retrieval.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Numerical models","Knowledge representation","Task analysis","Neural networks","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","information retrieval","knowledge engineering","knowledge representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural language processing","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge graph embedding","multiview clustering framework","knowledge engineering","artificial intelligence","knowledge representation methodology","low-dimensional vectors","continuous vectors","numerical machine learning models","knowledge embedding methods","semantic representations","knowledge elements","semantic model","entity retrieval","knowledge graph completion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Knowledge graph","semantic analysis","knowledge representation","multi-view clustering"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778709","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2019.2931548","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/9319888/08778709.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2019.2931548","startPage":"585","endPage":"596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9319888","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge Graph Embedding Based on Multi-View Clustering Framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge Graph Embedding Based on Multi-View Clustering Framework","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778709/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 1 2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","volume":"33","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8778709/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2021","publicationDate":"1 Feb. 2021","accessionNumber":"20287055","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing and Intelligent Control","grantNumber":"MJUKF-IPIC201804"},{"fundingName":"Xiamen University Principal Fund","grantNumber":"20720190030"},{"fundingName":"Xiamen University Malaysia Research Fund","grantNumber":"XMUMRF/2019-C4/IECE/0009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge Graph Embedding Based on Multi-View Clustering Framework","sourcePdf":"tkde-xiao-2931548-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127325S","chronDate":"Feb. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"9319888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9319888","articleId":"8778709","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778710,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Sliwa","affiliation":["Communication Networks Institute, TU Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/9151912/8778710/sliwa-2930109-small.gif","p":["Benjamin Sliwa (S\u201916) received the M.Sc. degree from TU Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany, in 2016.","He is currently a Research Assistant with the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Communication Networks Institute, TU Dortmund University.

However, the massive increases in Machine-type Communication (MTC) highly stress the capacities of the network infrastructure. With the system-immanent limitation of resources in cellular networks and the resource competition between human cell users and MTC, more resource-efficient channel access methods are required in order to improve the coexistence of the different communicating entities. In this paper, we present a machine learning-enabled transmission scheme for client-side opportunistic data transmission. By considering the measured channel state as well as the predicted future channel behavior, delay-tolerant MTC is performed with respect to the anticipated resource-efficiency. The proposed mechanism is evaluated in comprehensive field evaluations in public Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, where it is able to increase the mean data rate by 194% while simultaneously reducing the average power consumption by up to 54%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Boosting Vehicle-to-Cloud Communication by Machine Learning-Enabled Context Prediction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2019.2930109","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/9151912/08778710.pdf","startPage":"3497","endPage":"3512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2019.2930109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9151912","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778710/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2020","displayDocTitle":"Boosting Vehicle-to-Cloud Communication by Machine Learning-Enabled Context Prediction","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8778710/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2020","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2020","accessionNumber":"19950636","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876 Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Analysis under Projects A1, A4, and B4"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Boosting Vehicle-to-Cloud Communication by Machine Learning-Enabled Context Prediction","sourcePdf":"tits-sliwa-2930109-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12605S","chronDate":"Aug.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"9151912","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"9151912","articleId":"8778710","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":8778715,"authors":[{"name":"Morteza Esmaeili","affiliation":["Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8906190/8778715/esmae-2931571-small.gif","p":["Morteza Esmaeili received the M.S. degree in mathematics from the Teacher Training University of Tehran, Iran, in 1988, and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics (coding theory) from Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada, in 1996.

The specially designed tone mapping function, which is based on local histogram equalization, controls global, and local characteristics individually. In contrast to other tonemap operators, our algorithm manages light/dark halos separately and by using local tonemap function alone, it can effectively suppress noise. We validated the effectiveness of our algorithms using subjective and objective assessment. Using an average of the bins, we achieve fast smoothed local histogram estimation with fewer bins while maintaining high accuracy. Our new implementation method requires minimal data access and reduced memory as it operates with a downscaled frame size of 240 \u00d7 135 pixels. Relative local area size is 248 \u00d7 248 @Full-HD resolution (1920 \u00d7 1080). For low-latency pixel output, the system performs the tone mapping using pixel information from the previous frame. When we implemented the system on FPGA (TB-7K-325TIMG and Xilinx Kintex-7), we achieved lightweight hardware as the total usage rate is about 25% of the available FPGA resource.

Second, in change awareness foraging, participants consumed similar diets, but in subtly different ways than in other situations; this calls for further investigations into change awareness foraging. Third, while committing changes, participants attempted to enable future foragers, but the competing needs of different foraging situations led to tensions that participants failed to balance: this opens up a new avenue for research at the intersection of IFT and SE, namely, creating forageable information.

The identification of disease-related miRNAs is critical to understand the molecular mechanisms of human diseases. Most existing computational methods require diverse features to predict miRNA-disease associations. However, diverse features are not available for all miRNAs or diseases. In addition, most methods can't predict links for miRNAs or diseases without association information. In this paper, we propose a fast linear neighborhood similarity-based network link inference method, named FLNSNLI, to predict miRNA-disease associations. First, known miRNA-disease associations are formulated as a bipartite network, and miRNAs (or diseases) are expressed as association profiles. Second, miRNA-miRNA similarity and disease-disease similarity are calculated by fast linear neighborhood similarity measure and association profiles. Third, the label propagation algorithm is respectively implemented on two sides to score candidate miRNA-disease associations. Finally, FLNSNLI adopts the weighted average strategy and makes predictions. Moreover, we develop a link complementing approach, and extend FLNSNLI to predict links for miRNAs (or diseases) without known associations. In computational experiments, FLNSNLI produces high-accuracy performances, and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, FLNSNLI requires less information but performs well. Case studies on three popular diseases show that FLNSNLI is useful for the microRNA-disease association prediction.","doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2019.2931546","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8857/9391749/08778729.pdf","startPage":"405","endPage":"415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9391749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2019.2931546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Linear Neighborhood Similarity-Based Network Link Inference Method to Predict MicroRNA-Disease Associations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April 1 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Linear Neighborhood Similarity-Based Network Link Inference Method to Predict MicroRNA-Disease Associations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778729/","publicationDate":"1 March-April 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2021","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"31369383","htmlLink":"/document/8778729/","volume":"18","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772381 and 61572368"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2042017kf0219 and 2042018kf0249"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2018YFC0407904"},{"fundingName":"Huazhong Agricultural University Scientific & Technological Self-innovation Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Linear Neighborhood Similarity-Based Network Link Inference Method to Predict MicroRNA-Disease Associations","sourcePdf":"tcbb-zhang-2931546-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.30067S","chronDate":"March-April 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"9391749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"9391749","articleId":"8778729","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778730,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud Sadollahi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8818466/8778730/sadol-2928591-small.gif","p":["Mahmoud Sadollahi (S\u201912\u2013M\u201919) received the B.S. degree from Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, the M.Sc. degree from Urmia University, Urmia, Iran, and the Ph.D. degree from Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA, in 2018, all in electrical engineering.

A noise-coupled voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based quantizer is used to achieve second or higher order of noise shaping. This structure is power and area efficient as well as simple to implement, since it consists mostly of digital blocks. A 2-2 MASH modulator has been implemented by employing the NC-VCO-based quantizer as the second stage. This helps to overcome the VCO nonlinearity issue, since it only processes the quantization error of the first stage, and improve the dynamic range (DR). The first stage is implemented as a second-order modulator in modified feedback (CIFB) architecture. It consists of two integrators and a 4-bit quantizer. For enhanced power efficiency, opamp sharing is used between the second integrator of the first stage and the adder of second stage.

However, successful beamforming relies on intelligent user selection which requires, in turn, extensive overhead of channel calibration between the AP and each of the candidate users. The large overhead involved in the user selection procedure overwhelms the multiuser gain and hinders the utilization of multiuser MIMO. The phenomenon is even more acute when APs handle large groups of mobile users, which frequently associate and disconnect, making the process of acquiring channel state from all users and selecting the appropriate group even harder. Thus, the subtle relation between the achievable rate of a scheduling algorithm and the overhead it requires is significant for the 802.11ac performance analysis. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of distributed algorithms that schedule a group of users for the downlink. In particular, we accommodate common scheduling methods for the 802.11ac protocol and analyze both their achievable rate and their calibration process overhead. Both analysis and extensive simulations depict the superiority of simple threshold-based methods in terms of the throughput.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2019.2931301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/9210948/08778735.pdf","startPage":"2548","endPage":"2561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2019.2931301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9210948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Different Approaches to Distributed Multiuser MIMO in the 802.11ac","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 1 2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778735/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Different Approaches to Distributed Multiuser MIMO in the 802.11ac","volume":"19","issue":"11","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2020","accessionNumber":"20022236","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8778735/","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Israeli MOITAL NEPTUN consortium"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1824529"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Different Approaches to Distributed Multiuser MIMO in the 802.11ac","sourcePdf":"tmc-kampeas-2931301-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11675S","chronDate":"Nov. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"9210948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","xplore-issue":"9210948","articleId":"8778735","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778742,"authors":[{"name":"Antonios Somarakis","affiliation":["Division of Image Processing, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, ZA, the Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2945/9269519/8778742/somar-2931299-small.gif","p":["Antonios Somarakis received the MSc degree in electrical and computer engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece, in 2016.

Vehicles in an autonomous platoon can exploit vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications to collect environmental information so as to maintain the target velocity and inter-vehicle distance. However, due to the uncertainty of the wireless channel, V2V communications within a platoon will experience a wireless system delay. Such system delay can impair the vehicles\u2019 ability to stabilize their velocity and distances within their platoon. In this paper, the problem of integrated communication and control system is studied for wireless connected autonomous vehicular platoons. In particular, a novel framework is proposed for optimizing a platoon\u2019s operation while jointly taking into account the delay of the wireless V2V network and the stability of the vehicle\u2019s control system. First, stability analysis for the control system is performed and the maximum wireless system delay requirements which can prevent the instability of the control system are derived. Then, delay analysis is conducted to determine the end-to-end delay, including queuing, processing, and transmission delay for the V2V link in the wireless network. Subsequently, using the derived wireless delay, a lower bound and an approximated expression of the reliability for the wireless system, defined as the probability that the wireless system meets the control system\u2019s delay needs, are derived. Then, the parameters of the control system are optimized in a way to maximize the derived wireless system reliability. Simulation results corroborate the analytical derivations and study the impact of parameters, such as the packet size and the platoon size, on the reliability performance of the vehicular platoon. More importantly, the simulation results shed light on the benefits of integrating control system and wireless network design while providing guidelines for designing an autonomous platoon so as to realize the required wireless network reliability and control system stability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778746/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","volume":"67","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2019","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8778746/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint Communication and Control for Wireless Autonomous Vehicular Platoon Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1513697, CNS-1739642, CNS-1941348 and IIS-1633363"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Communication and Control for Wireless Autonomous Vehicular Platoon Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zeng-2931583-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12956S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8906190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8906190","articleId":"8778746","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778747,"authors":[{"name":"Lifan Xu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China","Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology of the Chinese Academy of Science, Shanghai, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lifan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086390506"},{"name":"Xiong Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China","State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiong","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0001-9193-8181","id":"37966540200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2469-7249"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2469-7257"}],"articleNumber":"8778747","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":646},"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"Experimental setup of the FMBH-MITAI modality and complete procedure of the computational study.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"1463 KB","file":"/ielx7/7397573/9097827/8778747/graphical_abstract/jerm-gagraphic-2931623.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/7397573/9097827/8778747/graphical_abstract/jerm-gagraphic-2931623.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave imaging","Microwave theory and techniques","Microwave antenna arrays","Breast","Electromagnetic heating","Tumors","Focusing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","cancer","compressed sensing","hyperthermia","medical image processing","patient monitoring","phantoms","thermoacoustics","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse acoustic measurement","FMBH-MITAI modality","compressive sensing imaging","thermoacoustic numerical simulation","microwave simulation","power deposition monitoring task","microwave-induced thermoacoustic imaging","microwave power deposition","breast tumors","focused microwave breast hyperthermia","breast phantoms","thermoacoustic images","iterative optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Breast cancer","compressive sensing (CS)","focused microwave breast hyperthermia (FMBH)","hyperthermia","microwave-induced thermoacoustic imaging (MITAI)","power deposition monitoring"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778747","abstract":"Focused microwave breast hyperthermia (FMBH) represents a newly emerging technique endowed with advantages of high accuracy and low side effect for treating breast tumors. Practical application of the FMBH approach requires monitoring of microwave power deposition in the breast. Microwave-induced thermoacoustic imaging (MITAI) is naturally feasible for such power deposition monitoring task. This work conducts a computational study to evaluate feasibility of the novel FMBH-MITAI modality using realistic breast phantoms. Basic configuration and rationale of both FMBH and MITAI are introduced. Compressive sensing (CS) technique has to be applied in MITAI for sparse acoustic measurement in the FMBH-MITAI modality. Procedure of the computational study consists of microwave simulation, thermoacoustic numerical simulation, CS imaging, and performing the iterative optimization. Simulated results show that CS based MITAI is able to serve as a reliable monitoring mechanism to efficiently guide the iterative optimization toward the best obtainable focusing condition in most of the simulated scenarios. Finally obtained thermoacoustic images agree well with simulated power deposition distribution well.

Therefore, these sensors have applications requiring near instantaneous obstacle avoidance in its field-of-view. However, the obstacle detection algorithms used by current compound vision systems are insufficient to enable these capabilities due to their ability to only detect horizontal or vertical edges.

Those devices communicate with computing infrastructure servers over network infrastructures to send relevant collected data in order to link physical objects to the cyber world. As the number of IoT devices increases rapidly, the volume of collected data likewise increases prodigiously. Thus, how to search for and through specific IoT datasets among the enormous amount of data become critical issues for potential data consumers. Moreover, various IoT devices and applications establish IoT-based systems, also known as the smart-world systems or smart cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as smart grids, smart transportation, smart healthcare, smart cities, smart homes, and smart manufacturing systems, among others. However, the individual CPS are independently designed and deployed, such that they collect and analyze data independently, with no information sharing or interconnection, raising serious challenges in searching for valuable information. Thus, in order to efficiently and precisely utilize the IoT datasets, suitable search techniques designed for the IoT environments are fundamental. In this paper, we first summarize popular web search techniques and survey existing research on the search and analysis related to the IoT. We then outline the opportunities and challenges of the IoT search techniques. Furthermore, we propose a problem space for the IoT search techniques and provide a clear view of potential future research directions.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6287639/8600701/8778752-aam.pdf","topic":"Data Mining for Internet of Things","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778752/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","volume":"7","accessionNumber":"18880730","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2019","publicationDate":"2019","htmlLink":"/document/8778752/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Search Engine for the Internet of Things: Lessons From Web Search, Vision, and Opportunities","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS 1350145"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008510","fundingName":"University of Maryland"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Search Engine for the Internet of Things: Lessons From Web Search, Vision, and Opportunities","sourcePdf":"access-yu-2931659-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.21695S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8600701","topics":["Data Mining for Internet of Things"],"articleId":"8778752","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778753,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Yang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8818466/8778753/yang-2928682-small.gif","p":["Chen Yang received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2004, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, in 2007 and 2016, respectively.

This paper proposed a Winograd-based highly efficient and dynamically Reconfigurable Accelerator (named WRA) for quickly evolving CNN models. A cost-effective convolution decomposition method (CDW) was proposed, and it extends the application of the fast Winograd algorithm. Based on CDW, a high-throughput and reconfigurable processing element (PE) array was designed to exploit the parallelism of Winograd. Besides, a highly compact memory structure employed four levels of data reuse schemes to achieve maximal data reuse and minimize external bandwidth requirement. Provided with dynamically reconfigurable capability, WRA implements CDW and other convolutions (e.g., standard convolution, depthwise separable convolution, and group convolution) on a unified hardware architecture. The WRA accelerator was implemented on a Xilinx XCVU9P platform running at 330 MHz clock frequency, controlled by a POWER8 processor via a coherent accelerator processor interface (CAPI) interface. At different configurations, WRA can provide 2.2-6.3 TOPS performance for different convolution shapes. The average performance and energy efficiency for VGG16/AlexNet/MobileNetV1/MobileNetV2 are 5288 GOP/s at 151.2 GOPs/W, 3478 GOP/s at 99.4 GOPs/W, 2674 GOP/s at 76.4 GOPs/W, and 2194 GOP/s at 62.7 GOPs/W.

In this paper, we consider the design of optimal transmit polarizations for deceptive jamming suppression in the main lobe using a game theory framework. We propose a co-located polarization multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system that combines the advantages of MIMO radar and those offered by optimally choosing the transmit polarization to improve the jamming suppression performance. In the polarization MIMO radar, polarization diversity is employed in the transmit array, and 2-D vector sensors are adopted in the receive array to separately measure the horizontal and vertical components of the received signals. Furthermore, based on the concepts and advantages of game theory, we formulate a polarization design problem for this radar system as a two-player zero-sum (TPZS) game between the radar and jammers. Additionally, we propose two design methods for different cases: a unilateral game for dumb jammers, and a strategic game for smart jammers. The optimal strategy and Nash equilibrium solution for two cases are presented. The simulation results demonstrate that jamming can be effectively suppressed with the proposed radar configuration and that improved jamming suppression performance can be achieved when the transmit polarization scheme is designed using the game theory approach.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931604","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08778759.pdf","startPage":"114191","endPage":"114202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Game Theory Design for Deceptive Jamming Suppression in Polarization MIMO Radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778759","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778759/","displayDocTitle":"Game Theory Design for Deceptive Jamming Suppression in Polarization MIMO Radar","volume":"7","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18914141","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8778759/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"61525105"},{"fundingName":"Fund for Foreign Scholars in University Research and Teaching Programs (the 111 Project)","grantNumber":"B18039"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JB180215"},{"fundingName":"Program for Cheung Kong Scholars and Innovative Research Team in Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Game Theory Design for Deceptive Jamming Suppression in Polarization MIMO Radar","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-2931604-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143408S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8778759","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778763,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Although PWV was introduced over a century ago, only in recent decades, due to various technological advancements, has emphasis been directed toward its measurement from a single arterial section or from piecewise segments of a target arterial section. This emerging worldwide trend in the exploration of instrumental solutions for local PWV measurement has produced several invasive and noninvasive methods. As of yet, however, a univocal opinion on the ideal measurement method has not emerged. Neither have there been extensive comparative studies on the accuracy of the available methods. Recognizing this reality, makes apparent the need to establish guideline-recommended standards for the measurement methods and reference values, without which clinical application cannot be pursued. This paper enumerates all major local PWV measurement methods while pinpointing their salient methodological considerations and emphasizing the necessity of global standardization. Further, a summary of the advancements in measuring modalities and clinical applications is provided. Additionally, a detailed discussion on the minimally explored concept of incremental local PWV is presented along with suggestions of future research questions.","doi":"10.1109/RBME.2019.2931587","publicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/4664312/8963780/08778763.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8963780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RBME.2019.2931587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Pulse Wave Velocity: Theory, Methods, Advancements, and Clinical Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778763","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2020","displayDocTitle":"Local Pulse Wave Velocity: Theory, Methods, Advancements, and Clinical Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778763/","publicationDate":"2020","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2020","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19281000","pubMedId":"31369386","htmlLink":"/document/8778763/","volume":"13","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001843","fundingName":"Science and Engineering Research Board"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010218","fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"IUSSTF/NIBIB_DST/ABPM/2013-2014/EOI_12"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local Pulse Wave Velocity: Theory, Methods, Advancements, and Clinical Applications","sourcePdf":"rbme-pm-2931587-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.367788S","chronDate":"2020","xplore-pub-id":"4664312","isNumber":"8963780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4664312","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8963780","articleId":"8778763","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778775,"authors":[{"name":"Zijun Ren","affiliation":["Unmanned System Research Institute, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8778775/ren-2931646-small.gif","p":["Zijun Ren received the M.S. degree in aerospace engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University, in 2015, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Compared to conventional IMU output, the phase-advanced information provided by angular acceleration measurement is more beneficial for flight stability. This paper presents a general and systematic approach to enhance the attitude stability of small fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. The methodology begins by designing a virtual angular accelerometer (VAA), which is based on 4 MEMS IMUs measurement fusion. Then, the angular acceleration is exploited to estimate and compensate disturbances. Finally, an enhanced attitude control scheme is developed to improve attitude tracking performance, where linear or nonlinear control approaches can be adopted. A VAA-based backstepping controller (BS) is designed and its stability is analyzed via Lyapunov function. Three simulation cases are carried out to verify the performance of tracking accuracy, robustness, and disturbance rejection. PID and backstepping methods are applied to the scheme. As a comparison, a widely used nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO)-based robust controller (RC) is studied. The simulation results show the excellent performance of the sensor-based VAA to observe the fast time-varying disturbance, where the NDO causes the time delay and phase lag. The tracking accuracy of the enhanced controllers (PID+VAA, BS+VAA, and RC+VAA), compared to the basic controllers, are improved by 14.3%-93.7% and the closed-loop control systems gain notable robustness.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Accelerometers","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Attitude control","Observers","Sensors","Airplanes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acceleration measurement","accelerometers","adaptive control","aircraft control","attitude control","autonomous aerial vehicles","closed loop systems","control nonlinearities","control system synthesis","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear control systems","observers","remotely operated vehicles","robust control","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual angular accelerometer","turbulent environment","low operational altitude","conventional IMU output","phase-advanced information","angular acceleration measurement","flight stability","general approach","systematic approach","attitude stability","fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles","enhanced attitude control scheme","attitude tracking performance","nonlinear control approaches","VAA-based backstepping controller","tracking accuracy","disturbance rejection","sensor-based VAA","fast time-varying disturbance","PID+VAA","BS+VAA","RC+VAA","basic controllers","closed-loop control systems","nonlinear disturbance observer-based robust controller","nonlinear disturbance observer-based robust controller","MEMS IMUs measurement fusion","linear control approaches","PID methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Small UAV","attitude control","multi-IMUs","EKF","angular acceleration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778775","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931646","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08778775.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931646","startPage":"104330","endPage":"104343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Attitude Control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based on Virtual Angular Accelerometer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Attitude Control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based on Virtual Angular Accelerometer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778775/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8778775/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2019","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18880565","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1630127 and U1730135"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Enhanced Attitude Control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based on Virtual Angular Accelerometer","sourcePdf":"access-ren-2931646-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096785S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8778775","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778776,"authors":[{"name":"Yizhe Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8871140/8778776/zhao-2931545-small.gif","p":["Yizhe Zhao (S\u201916) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Xidian University in 2014, and the M.S. degree in information and communication engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2017, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Information and Communication Engineering.

By further exploiting the advanced non-orthogonal-multiple-access (NOMA) technique, we are capable of improving the spectrum efficiency of the resource-limited SWIPT system. In our SWIPT system, a hybrid access point (H-AP) superimposes the modulated symbols destined to multiple WIT users by exploiting the power-domain NOMA, while WPT users are capable of harvesting the energy carried by the superposition symbols. In order to maximize the amount of energy transferred to the WPT users, we propose a joint design of the energy interleaver and the constellation rotation-based modulator in the symbol-block level by constructively superimposing the symbols destined to the WIT users in the power domain. Furthermore, a transmit power allocation scheme is proposed to guarantee the symbol-error-ratio (SER) of all the WIT users. By considering the sensitivity of practical energy harvesters, simulation results demonstrate that our scheme is capable of substantially increasing the WPT performance without any remarkable degradation of the WIT

The four-stage PETs have multiple output ports, good controllability, and flexibility, but are limited by multiple power conversion stages, complex structure, and low efficiency. Therefore, a novel modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based PET topology with mixed-frequency modulation is proposed to reduce the power conversion stage. The power decoupling circuits are designed to realize multiple output ports, including medium voltage ac (MVAC) port, medium voltage dc (MVDC) port, and low voltage dc (LVDC) port. The equivalent circuit and controllability of proposed PET are analyzed. The proposed PET topology provides the same multiple output ports by only three power conversion stages, therefore, the PET structure is simplified.

A suited way of measuring the global efficiency of a distributed power control scheme is to use the long-term utility region. First, we provide the utility region characterization for general utility functions when the channel state obeys an independent block fading law and the observation structure is memoryless. Second, the corresponding theorem is exploited to construct an iterative algorithm, which provides one-shot power control strategies. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed for energy-efficient and spectrally efficient communications and shown to perform much better than state-of-the-art techniques, with the additional advantage of being applicable even in the presence of arbitrary observation structures such as those corresponding to noisy channel gain estimates.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2019.2931605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8840987","startPage":"8982","endPage":"8994","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8840987/08778781.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2019.2931605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Power Control With Partial Channel State Information: Performance Characterization and Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Transmitters","Limiting","Receivers","Noise measurement","Microcell networks","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","fading channels","iterative methods","MIMO communication","power control","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial channel state information","performance characterization","distributed power control strategies","global channel state","global efficiency","distributed power control scheme","long-term utility region","utility region characterization","general utility functions","independent block fading law","observation structure","iterative algorithm","one-shot power control strategies","spectrally efficient communications","arbitrary observation structures","noisy channel gain estimates"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless communication","distributed algorithm","resource management","feedback communications","information theory","game theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Power Control With Partial Channel State Information: Performance Characterization and Design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778781/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2019","volume":"68","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/8778781/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18991522","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Power Control With Partial Channel State Information: Performance Characterization and Design","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2931605-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117832S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8840987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8840987","articleId":"8778781","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8778784,"authors":[{"name":"Byeong Gwan Bhang","affiliation":["Next Generation Photovoltaic Module and Power System Research Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503869/8809931/8778784/bhang-2928461-small.gif","p":["Byeong Gwan Bhang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2017 and 2019.

Particularly, bifacial PV modules would have the advantage of lower power loss in shaded environments than monofacial PV modules, thanks to the light absorbed through the rear side. To predict the power of a bifacial PV module in a shaded environment, modeling is suggested by considering the shaded areas, the operational status of the bypass diodes, and the temperature of the bifacial PV module. To verify the power prediction of a bifacial PV module with a shaded area, modeled and measured powers are compared, showing error rates of 7.28%. From the results of the power loss experiments for bifacial and monofacial PV modules in shaded environments, it is confirmed that the bifacial PV module shows a relatively low power loss rate when compared with the monofacial PV module, with a power loss rate being 87.26% of the rate for the monofacial PV module.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOTOV.2019.2928461","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503869/8809931/08778784.pdf","startPage":"1413","endPage":"1420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8809931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOTOV.2019.2928461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Performance of Bifacial c-Si PV Modules With Different Shading Ratios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Power Performance of Bifacial c-Si PV Modules With Different Shading Ratios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778784/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18938120","htmlLink":"/document/8778784/","volume":"9","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"New and Renewable Energy Technology Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007053","fundingName":"Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003052","fundingName":"Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy","grantNumber":"20183010014260"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Power Performance of Bifacial c-Si PV Modules With Different Shading Ratios","sourcePdf":"jphotov-ahn-2928461-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099525S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5503869","isNumber":"8809931","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503869","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8809931","articleId":"8778784","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8778785,"authors":[{"name":"Siddharth Joshi","affiliation":["University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8883027/8778785/joshi-2926447-small.gif","p":["Siddharth Joshi (S\u201914\u2013M\u201917) received the B.Tech. degree in information and communication technology from the Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Technology (DA-IICT), Gandhinagar, India, in 2008, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at San Diego, CA, USA, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering.

The proposed PA fulfills zero voltage switching (ZVS) and zero voltage derivative switching (ZVDS) conditions, resulting in a theoretical dc-to-RF efficiency of 100%. Explicit design equations for the load-network parameters are derived, and the analytical results are confirmed by harmonic-balance simulations. Two PA prototypes were constructed with one designed at low frequency and the other at high frequency. The first PA, which employs a MOSFET and a lumped-element load-network, delivered a peak drain efficiency (DE) of 93.3% and a peak output power of 37 dBm at 1 MHz. The second PA, which employs a GaN HEMT and a transmission-line (TL) load-network to provide the drain of the transistor with the required load impedances at the fundamental frequency as well as even and odd harmonic frequencies, delivered a peak DE of 90.2% and a peak output power of 39.8 dBm at 1.37 GHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8778788/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"18920926","volume":"67","issue":"8","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Class-E Power Amplifier With Shunt Capacitance and Shunt Filter","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/P013031/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Generalized Class-E Power Amplifier With Shunt Capacitance and Shunt Filter","sourcePdf":"tmtt-safarimugisho-2923514-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112934S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8804276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8804276","articleId":"8778788","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8778800,"authors":[{"name":"Claudia Campolo","affiliation":["University Mediterranea of Reggio Calabria, Reggio Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudia","lastName":"Campolo","orcid":"0000-0003-3281-6680","id":"37402824300"},{"name":"Antonella Molinaro","affiliation":["University Mediterranea of Reggio Calabria, Reggio Calabria, Italy","Laboratoire des Signaux et Syst\u00e8mes (L2S), CentraleSup\u00e9lec-CNRS-Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Antonella","lastName":"Molinaro","orcid":"0000-0003-2731-300X","id":"37268951900"},{"name":"Antoine O.

A multiscale wavelet decomposition and reconstruction method is used to extract PD signals and a two-dimensional spectral frame representation of the PD signals is obtained by the mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC). The experimental results based on 1280 training samples and 832 test samples have demonstrated high values of precision, sensitivity, and specificity for each event (up to 96.3%, 96.4%, and 98.7%, respectively), which means that the combination of multiscale wavelet decomposition and reconstruction, the MFCC and CNN may be a promising event recognition method for the FDAS systems.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08778802.pdf","startPage":"101758","endPage":"101764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial Discharge Recognition Based on Optical Fiber Distributed Acoustic Sensing and a Convolutional Neural Network","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6287639/8600701/8778802-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778802/","displayDocTitle":"Partial Discharge Recognition Based on Optical Fiber Distributed Acoustic Sensing and a Convolutional Neural Network","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8778802/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2019","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2019","accessionNumber":"18880524","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61675157"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy","grantNumber":"LW-18IN060209 and DE-FE00029063"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Partial Discharge Recognition Based on Optical Fiber Distributed Acoustic Sensing and a Convolutional Neural Network","sourcePdf":"access-che-2931040-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089494S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8778802","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778803,"authors":[{"name":"Dongdong Cheng","affiliation":["College of Computer Engineering, Yangtze Normal University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/9319888/8778803/cheng-2930056-small.gif","p":["Dongdong Cheng received the bachelor's degree in computer science from Chongqing Normal University, in 2013, and the doctor's degree from Chongqing University, in 2018.

It is a great challenge for most existing clustering algorithms to discover clusters with arbitrary shapes. Clustering algorithms based on Minimum spanning tree (MST) are able to discover clusters with arbitrary shapes, but they are time consuming and susceptible to noise points. In this paper, we employ local density peaks (LDP) to represent the whole data set and define a shared neighbors-based distance between local density peaks to better measure the dissimilarity between objects on manifold data. On the basis of local density peaks and the new distance, we propose a novel MST-based clustering algorithm called LDP-MST. It first uses local density peaks to construct MST and then repeatedly cuts the longest edge until a given number of clusters are found. The experimental results on synthetic data sets and real data sets show that our algorithm is competent with state-of-the-art methods when discovering clusters with complex structures.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering with Local Density Peaks-Based Minimum Spanning Tree","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2019.2930056","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/9319888/08778803.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2019.2930056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9319888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778803","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778803/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 1 2021","displayDocTitle":"Clustering with Local Density Peaks-Based Minimum Spanning Tree","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8778803/","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2021","publicationDate":"1 Feb. 2021","accessionNumber":"20287054","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Chongqing Education Commission","grantNumber":"KJZH17104"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61502060 and 61702060"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering with Local Density Peaks-Based Minimum Spanning Tree","sourcePdf":"tkde-zhu-2930056-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.175389S","chronDate":"Feb. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"9319888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"9319888","articleId":"8778803","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778837,"authors":[{"name":"Kanglong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Kanglong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086921802"},{"name":"Lu Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086432873"},{"name":"Mengjun Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Mengjun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086920016"},{"name":"Hongxing Zheng","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Hongxing","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37274921900"},{"name":"Erping Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Erping","lastName":"Li","id":"37086918643"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7111-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7110-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7112-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8778837","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HIE-FDTD","three-dimensional electromagnetic problem","fine scale structure","convolutional perfectly matched layer absorbing boundary","CPU time","3-d hybrid implicit-explicit FDTD method","hybrid implicit-explicit finite-difference time-domain method","FDTD-CPML","Courant-Friedrich-Levy number"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["finite-difference time-domain method","hybrid implicit-explicit method","convolutional perfectly matched layer"]}],"abstract":"To improve the hybrid implicit-explicit finite-difference time-domain (HIE-FDTD) method in solving three-dimensional electromagnetic problem with fine scale structure, an effective method combining HIE-FDTD with convolutional perfectly matched layer (CPML) absorbing boundary is developed.

Two ways of splitting the operator matrices are attempted for the M1-D ADI-FDTD method. It is shown that the direct way of splitting based on self-mutual separation will reduce naturally to the equations for uncoupled transmission lines when the mutual terms are omitted. They also lead to update equations with left-hand sides involving tridiagonal matrices which can be solved efficiently. However, using the split matrices based on self-mutual separation, the resultant M1-D ADI-FDTD method for coupled transmission lines is not unconditionally stable. This is demonstrated through numerical stability analysis based on von Neumann method. Meanwhile, the proposed alternative way of splitting will also lead to update equations with left-hand sides involving tridiagonal matrices. Further numerical stability analysis is complemented to show that the proposed method is capable of treating coupled transmission lines using time step larger than the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) limit.","doi":"10.1109/COMPEM.2019.8778865","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Computational Electromagnetics (ICCEM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Computational Electromagnetics (ICCEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766331/8778832/08778865.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPEM.2019.8778865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778832","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical Stability Analysis of M1-D ADI-FDTD Method for Coupled Transmission Lines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Numerical Stability Analysis of M1-D ADI-FDTD Method for Coupled Transmission Lines","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 March 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778865/","conferenceDate":"20-22 March 2019","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18868214","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8778865/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical Stability Analysis of M1-D ADI-FDTD Method for Coupled Transmission Lines","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045285S","chronDate":"20-22 March 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766331","isNumber":"8778832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766331","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8778832","articleId":"8778865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8778866,"authors":[{"name":"Chu-Bin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Chu-Bin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086090247"},{"name":"Yong-Dan Kong","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Yong-Dan","lastName":"Kong","id":"37573006500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7111-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7110-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7112-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8778866","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Numerical stability","Perfectly matched layers","Stability analysis","Mathematical model","Reflection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","matrix algebra","Maxwell equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symmetric operation","HIE-FDTD method","hybrid implicit explicit finite difference time domain method","neraly perfectly matched layer","NPML","Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy numbers","Maxwell's equation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time domain (FDTD)","hybrid implicit-explicit (HIE)","nearly perfectly matched layer (NPML)","weakly conditionally stable"]}],"abstract":"The nearly perfectly matched layer (NPML) is incorporated into a novel four-steps weakly conditionally stable hybrid implicit explicit finite difference time domain (HIE-FDTD) method in three-dimensional (3-D) domains in this paper.

Instead of adopting the most common way of combining array antennas with beamforming networks to achieve beam steering, the proposed DRA has a very simple structure, with only a single rectangular dielectric resonator (DR) as its radiator. Three microstrip lines are employed to feed the DRA through three slots etched on the ground plane respectively. Between every two microstrip lines lies a decoupling network to improve the isolation of the ports. When one of the three ports is excited and the other two are terminated to 50 \u03a9 impedance, the radiator is fed accordingly at different positions and can generate three different tilted radiation beams in total. As a result, beam steering can be achieved using a single DRA without beamforming network. For demonstration, a single beam-steering DRA without beamforming network working at 5.25 GHz is designed and simulated. The proposed antenna has a bandwidth of 5% and an isolation higher than 15 dB at the center frequency. The three main beams are tilted to -40\u00b0, 0\u00b0 and 40\u00b0, with an antenna gain of around 7.45 dBi.","doi":"10.1109/COMPEM.2019.8778969","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Computational Electromagnetics (ICCEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766331/8778832/08778969.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPEM.2019.8778969","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Computational Electromagnetics (ICCEM)","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Beam-Steering Dielectric Resonator Antenna without Beamforming Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 March 2019","displayDocTitle":"A Beam-Steering Dielectric Resonator Antenna without Beamforming Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778969/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8778969/","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18868359","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","conferenceDate":"20-22 March 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Beam-Steering Dielectric Resonator Antenna without Beamforming Network","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056459S","chronDate":"20-22 March 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766331","isNumber":"8778832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766331","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8778832","articleId":"8778969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8778973,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyan Wang","affiliation":["Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hongyan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086346844"},{"name":"Yoichi Ishizuka","affiliation":["Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoichi","lastName":"Ishizuka","id":"37301312700"},{"name":"Takafumi Fujimoto","affiliation":["Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Takafumi","lastName":"Fujimoto","id":"37086349529"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7111-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7110-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7112-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8778973","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO communication","Energy consumption","Wireless sensor networks","Modulation","Upper bound","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","error statistics","MIMO communication","phase shift keying","space-time block codes","telecommunication power management","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MPSK modulation scheme","energy efficiency","total energy consumption","optimal constellation size","cooperative MIMO wireless sensor networks","bit error rate","space time block coding","cooperative MIMO WSN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Modulation","Energy efficiency","Bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"We consider the energy efficiency for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) where all the nodes operate on batteries so that the total energy consumption should be minimized. One feasible and effective approach is to treat several individual single-antenna nodes which cooperative at the transmitter and receiver as multiple-antenna, i.e., cooperative MIMO. In this context, for the given bit error rate, we first analyze the total energy consumption under the MPSK modulation scheme by using space time block coding in the cooperative MIMO WSNs. Meanwhile, the upper bound of total energy consumption will be deduced. For both short and long transmission distance, we show the trend of the total energy consumption over the constellation size and obtain the optimal constellation size especially achieving the lowest system energy consumption. Additionally, the total energy consumption can be significantly saved by utilizing cooperative MIMO especially at long transmission distance.","doi":"10.1109/COMPEM.2019.8778973","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Computational Electromagnetics (ICCEM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Computational Electromagnetics (ICCEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766331/8778832/08778973.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPEM.2019.8778973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency for Cooperative MIMO Wireless Sensor Networks with Optimal Constellation Size under MPSK Modulation Scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778973","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 March 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8778973/","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency for Cooperative MIMO Wireless Sensor Networks with Optimal Constellation Size under MPSK Modulation Scheme","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18868211","htmlLink":"/document/8778973/","conferenceDate":"20-22 March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency for Cooperative MIMO Wireless Sensor Networks with Optimal Constellation Size under MPSK Modulation Scheme","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"366.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03873S","chronDate":"20-22 March 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766331","isNumber":"8778832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766331","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8778832","articleId":"8778973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":8778986,"authors":[{"name":"Baiyan Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, DongHua University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Baiyan","lastName":"Li","id":"37599140500"},{"name":"Xiang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, DongHua University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086921366"},{"name":"Hui Song","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, DongHua University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Song","id":"37589009500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7111-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7110-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7112-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8778986","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","edge detection","feature extraction","image segmentation","roads","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road element extraction","fully convolutional network","high-resolution satellite photos","deep learning techniques","traditional road extraction algorithms","VGG16 network model","trained network model","roads","road edges","fully convolution network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Semantic Segmentation","Road Element Extraction","3D Road Reconstruction","Fully Convolution Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8778986","abstract":"Aiming at the problem of extracting road elements from high-resolution satellite photos, a new method based on deep learning techniques is proposed and implemented in this paper.

Then, each large subdomain is distributed to a MPI process and further decomposed into smaller ones to achieve good computation efficiency. Our preconditioner is based on this hierarchical parallel structure. It is specially designed to accelerate the convergence of iterative solution and reduce both the time and memory consumption of the reduced interface problems from FEM-DDM by constructing symmetric Gauss-Seidel preconditioner (SGS) for each large subdomain. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency, scalability, and capability of this specially designed BD-SGS preconditioner.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Computational Electromagnetics (ICCEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766331/8778832/08779131.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Computational Electromagnetics (ICCEM)","doi":"10.1109/COMPEM.2019.8779131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPEM.2019.8779131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778832","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel FEM-DDM with BD-SGS Preconditioner for 3D Scattering by Large Inhomogeneous Objects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element analysis","Electromagnetics","Convergence","Memory management","Electromagnetic scattering","Scalability","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","convergence of numerical methods","finite element analysis","Gaussian processes","iterative methods","message passing","parallel processing","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MPI process","hierarchical parallel structure","symmetric Gauss-Seidel preconditioner","inhomogeneous objects","hierarchical domain decomposition scheme","parallel FEM-DDM","BD-SGS preconditioner","3D scattering","block diagonal symmetric Gauss-Seidel","memory consumption reduction","time consumption reduction","electromagnetic simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Domain decomposition method","finite element method","preconditioner","parallel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779131/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 March 2019","displayDocTitle":"Parallel FEM-DDM with BD-SGS Preconditioner for 3D Scattering by Large Inhomogeneous Objects","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8779131/","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18868376","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","conferenceDate":"20-22 March 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel FEM-DDM with BD-SGS Preconditioner for 3D Scattering by Large Inhomogeneous Objects","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048814S","chronDate":"20-22 March 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766331","isNumber":"8778832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766331","xplore-issue":"8778832","articleId":"8779131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8779141,"authors":[{"name":"Di Mu","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Mu","id":"37086919886"},{"name":"Yi Wang","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086589925"},{"name":"Qunsheng Cao","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qunsheng","lastName":"Cao","id":"37330237900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7111-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7110-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7112-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8779141","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Mathematical model","Phase control","Reflection","Color"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic metamaterials","electromagnetic wave transmission","finite difference time-domain analysis","phase control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GSTC-FDTD method","controllable phase","finite-difference time domain method","metasurface properties","generalized sheet transition conditions","arbitrary transmission properties","controllable Metasurface"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["metasurface design","FDTD","generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs)"]}],"abstract":"Properties of metasurface with controllable phase and amplitude are studied using the finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method.

Traditional fault diagnosis methods require manual feature extraction or selection which brings great limitations to the practical application. In our paper, a real-time intelligent fault diagnosis method is proposed based on wavelet transform algorithm and deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model. Firstly, original vibration signals of different kinds of fault is collected. Then, original signals are converted into time frequency image using wavelet transform method. Finally, these time-frequency images are fed into the DCNN to train the constructed model, and real-time signals are input into the trained model to achieve classification of the running state of the bearing. A real experiment is provided to estimate the effectiveness of the approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has high diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time intelligent fault diagnosis using deep convolutional neural networks and wavelet transform","doi":"10.1109/USYS.2018.8779186","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/USYS.2018.8779186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8778850","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 8th International Conference on Underwater System Technology: Theory and Applications (USYS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 8th International Conference on Underwater System Technology: Theory and Applications (USYS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8767906/8778850/08779186.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2018","displayDocTitle":"Real-time intelligent fault diagnosis using deep convolutional neural networks and wavelet transform","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8779186/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18869130","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time intelligent fault diagnosis using deep convolutional neural networks and wavelet transform","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"PID29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06059S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8767906","isNumber":"8778850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8767906","xplore-issue":"8778850","articleId":"8779186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8779236,"authors":[{"name":"Ze-Kai Hu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Electromic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hnagzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ze-Kai","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086616949"},{"name":"Yu-Han Zhong","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Electromic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hnagzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yu-Han","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37086618222"},{"name":"Yi-Wen Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Electromic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hnagzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yi-Wen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086618769"},{"name":"Yu-Fei Shu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Electromic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hnagzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yu-Fei","lastName":"Shu","id":"37085716669"},{"name":"Xing-Chang Wei","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Electromic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hnagzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xing-Chang","lastName":"Wei","id":"37335827500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7111-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7110-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-7112-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8779236","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic moments","Artificial neural networks","Transmission line matrix methods","Magnetic fields","Correlation coefficient","Iterative methods","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","electromagnetic fields","electromagnetic waves","magnetic moments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic source reconstruction","radiation source","equivalent magnetic dipoles array","magnetic moments","equivalent dipoles","near-field pattern","artificial neural network method","near-field amplitude"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural network","magnetic dipoles","source reconstruction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779236","abstract":"In this paper, the artificial neural network is used to reconstruct the electromagnetic source.

Simulation results show that the proposed approach is able to achieve 90% accuracy of the spectrum allocation with low computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/CADSM.2019.8779301","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 15th International Conference on the Experience of Designing and Application of CAD Systems (CADSM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CADSM.2019.8779301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8779238","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 15th International Conference on the Experience of Designing and Application of CAD Systems (CADSM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766330/8779238/08779301.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Spectrum Management in 5G Mobile Networks based on Recurrent Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779301/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Spectrum Management in 5G Mobile Networks based on Recurrent Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8779301/","accessionNumber":"18868104","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","conferenceDate":"26 Feb.-2 March 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 26 2019-March 2 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Spectrum Management in 5G Mobile Networks based on Recurrent Neural Networks","confLoc":"Polyana, Ukraine","sourcePdf":"CADSM2019paper108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059994S","chronDate":"Feb. 26 2019-March 2 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8766330","isNumber":"8779238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8766330","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8779238","articleId":"8779301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8779325,"authors":[{"name":"Andrii Rubel","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technologies, National Aerospace University \"KhAI\", Kharkiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Andrii","lastName":"Rubel","id":"37085792019"},{"name":"Oleksii Rubel","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technologies, National Aerospace University \"KhAI\", Kharkiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Oleksii","lastName":"Rubel","id":"37085582295"},{"name":"Vladimir Lukin","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technologies, National Aerospace University \"KhAI\", Kharkiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Lukin","id":"37284917600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0053-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0054-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-0055-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2572-7591"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2572-7583"}],"articleNumber":"8779325","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779325","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Image quality","Discrete cosine transforms","Feature extraction","AWGN","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","discrete cosine transforms","feature extraction","image denoising","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noisy images","multilayer neural networks","image processing","visual quality metrics","neural network training","image visual quality degradation","imaging systems","feature extraction","discrete cosine transform","additive white Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image quality","artificial neural networks","multilayer perceptrons","prediction algorithms","additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)","blind assessment of noisy image quality"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CADSM.2019.8779325","pdfPath":"/iel7/8766330/8779238/08779325.pdf","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 15th International Conference on the Experience of Designing and Application of CAD Systems (CADSM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 15th International Conference on the Experience of Designing and Application of CAD Systems (CADSM)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8779238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CADSM.2019.8779325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network-based Prediction of Visual Quality for Noisy Images","abstract":"Noise is one of the main factors that degrade image visual quality.

Thus, we expect that the negative effect of the added mass will be lower for a powered hip exoskeleton than a powered ankle and knee prosthesis. Consequently, residual-hip assistance may more easily lead to a net reduction of metabolic effort. To preliminarily assess this hypothesis, we measured the physiological cost index (PCI) while an above-knee subject walked with and without a powered hip exoskeleton.

However, the added-value of such devices is significantly impacted by their limited energetic autonomy, excessive weight and cost, thus preventing their full appropriation by the users. There is thus a strong incentive to produce active yet affordable, lightweight and energy efficient devices. To address these issues, we developed the ELSA (Efficient Lockable Spring Ankle) prosthesis embedding both a lockable parallel spring and a series elastic actuator, tailored to the walking dynamics of a sound ankle. The first contribution of this paper concerns the developement of a bio-inspired, lightweight and stiffness-adjustable parallel spring, comprising an energy efficient ratchet and pawl mechanism with servo actuation. The second contribution is the addition of a complementary rope-driven series elastic actuator to generate the active push-off. The system produces a sound ankle torque pattern during flat ground walking. Up to 50% of the peak torque is generated passively at a negligible energetic cost (0.1 J/stride). By design, the total system is lightweight (1.2kg) and low cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 16th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765245/8779358/08779421.pdf","startPage":"411","endPage":"416","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 16th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR)","doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2019.8779421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2019.8779421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8779358","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired design and validation of the Efficient Lockable Spring Ankle (ELSA) prosthesis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Springs","Prosthetics","Actuators","Legged locomotion","Foot","Pulleys"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","gait analysis","medical robotics","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient lockable spring ankle prosthesis","walking dynamics","bio-inspired parallel spring","lightweight parallel spring","daily life locomotion activities","required positive energy balance","transfemoral amputees","physiological gait","lower-limb prostheses","bio-inspired design","sound ankle torque pattern","complementary rope-driven series elastic actuator","pawl mechanism","energy efficient ratchet","stiffness-adjustable parallel spring","lockable parallel spring","ELSA prosthesis","lightweight energy efficient devices","affordable energy efficient devices","mass 1.2 kg"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Amputees","Ankle","Ankle Joint","Artificial Limbs","Biomechanical Phenomena","Gait","Humans","Prosthesis Design","Robotics","Walking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779421/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2019","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired design and validation of the Efficient Lockable Spring Ankle (ELSA) prosthesis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8779421/","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18920166","pubMedId":"31374664","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired design and validation of the Efficient Lockable Spring Ankle (ELSA) prosthesis","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061977S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765245","isNumber":"8779358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765245","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8779358","articleId":"8779421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8779467,"authors":[{"name":"Dongwon Kim","affiliation":["University of Maryland"],"firstName":"Dongwon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085699669"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2755-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2756-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-7901"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1945-7898"}],"articleNumber":"8779467","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"abstract":"In the author's previous study, an origami-structured compliant actuator, named OSCA, was invented for human-robot interaction where sufficient moment output is required under a limited power supply. In this study, the compressibility of airflow within the actuator that essentially provides elasticity as well as backdriveability is in the spotlight. Elasticity can increase the actuator's power output in the same way as does a series elastic actuator (SEA). This study demonstrates that an OSCA operated with a servo valve is equivalent to an SEA with a typical spring. That is, power output amplification can be achieved with congruent stiffness of the air within the actuator.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Elasticity","Pistons","Pneumatic systems","Force","Robots","Servomotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bending","elasticity","human-robot interaction","hydraulic actuators","springs (mechanical)","valves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["origami-structured compliant actuator","human-robot interaction","sufficient moment output","power supply","essentially provides elasticity","backdriveability","series elastic actuator","power output amplification","origami-structured actuator","OSCA","congruent stiffness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Soft actuator","Rigid origami","Series elastic actuator","Backdriveability","Power amplification"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Elasticity","Equipment Design","Humans","Robotics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2019.8779467","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 16th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 16th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765245/8779358/08779467.pdf","startPage":"1278","endPage":"1282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8779358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2019.8779467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis on an Origami-structured Actuator that Enhances Both Backdriveability and Power Amplification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779467","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis on an Origami-structured Actuator that Enhances Both Backdriveability and Power Amplification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779467/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8779467/","accessionNumber":"18867580","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2019","pubMedId":"31374805","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis on an Origami-structured Actuator that Enhances Both Backdriveability and Power Amplification","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052907S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765245","isNumber":"8779358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765245","xplore-issue":"8779358","articleId":"8779467","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8779475,"authors":[{"name":"Kyoung-Soub Lee","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering Department of Korea, Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, S.

detection is an important issue during gait rehabilitation training. This paper proposes an approach for pre-impact fall detection during gait rehabilitation training based on a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN). Firstly, pre-training data is collected and used to pre-train the 3D CNN to differentiate between a normal walking and a fall based on their general spatio-temporal patterns. Secondly, fine-tuning data is created by combining the pre-training data with a 3second normal walking sample collected from a new trainee whose falls are to be detected. The pre-trained 3D CNN is further fine-tuned by the fine-tuning data to learn the spatiotemporal patterns of the new trainee. Finally, a temporal sliding window is used to feed video snippets into the fine-tuned 3D CNN for fall detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pre-impact fall detection approach based on a 3D CNN using RGB images. Moreover, the training strategy used to train the 3D CNN can alleviate the generalization issue of the 3D CNN when only limited training data is available in gait rehabilitation training. With 225 testing trials from 5 trainees, the proposed pre-impact fall detection approach achieves a detection accuracy of 100% within 0.5 second after falls start. Experiment results show that this approach is efficient, accurate, and practical in achieving intelligent fall detection during gait rehabilitation training.","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 16th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 16th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765245/8779358/08779504.pdf","startPage":"1173","endPage":"1178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pre-Impact Fall Detection Using 3D Convolutional Neural Network","doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2019.8779504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8779358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2019.8779504","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779504/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2019","displayDocTitle":"Pre-Impact Fall Detection Using 3D Convolutional Neural Network","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18867592","pubMedId":"31374788","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8779504/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pre-Impact Fall Detection Using 3D Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095868S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765245","isNumber":"8779358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765245","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8779358","articleId":"8779504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8779547,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed H.

The proposed solution was a pulley flexion mechanism inspired by the human musculoskeletal system to enable a natural and comfortable finger flexion. A biomechanical constraint for the finger flexion motion states that the relation between the proximal interphalangeal joint angle of the finger should always be flexed around 1.5 times the distal interphalangeal joint angle. The study aimed to comply with this constraint, by simultaneously distributing the forces over the distal and middle finger phalanges. For evaluation, the voluntary and exoskeleton flexions were compared based on the relation between the proximal and distal interphalangeal joint angles. The results showed that during the exoskeleton flexion the relation between the interphalangeal joints complied with the biomechanical constraint, where the proximal interphalangeal joint angle was 1.5 times larger than the distal interphalangeal joint. This ensures that the mechanism flexes the finger comfortably. The proposed solution is therefore a promising design for a novel soft exoskeleton that will be used for training and assistance of patients with hand paralysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired tendon driven mechanism for simultaneous finger joints flexion using a soft hand exoskeleton","publicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 16th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR)","doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2019.8779547","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 IEEE 16th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8765245/8779358/08779547.pdf","startPage":"1073","endPage":"1078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2019.8779547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8779358","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779547/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2019","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired tendon driven mechanism for simultaneous finger joints flexion using a soft hand exoskeleton","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8779547/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18920159","pubMedId":"31374772","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired tendon driven mechanism for simultaneous finger joints flexion using a soft hand exoskeleton","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071092S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8765245","isNumber":"8779358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8765245","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8779358","articleId":"8779547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Union","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8779591,"authors":[{"name":"Li Yan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Coding and Transmission, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8863562/8779591/yan-2930193-small.gif","p":["Li Yan received the B.E. degree in communication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information systems from Southwest Jiaotong University, China, in 2012 and 2018, respectively.

Nevertheless, during mmWave vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) handovers, the coverage blindness of directional beams makes it a significant challenge to discover target mmWave remote radio units (mmW-RRUs) whose active beams may radiate somewhere that the handover vehicles are not in. Besides, fast and soft handovers are also urgently needed in vehicular networks. Based on these observations, to solve the target discovery problem, we utilize channel state information (CSI) of sub-6 GHz bands and Kernel-based machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict vehicles' positions and then use them to pre-activate target mmW-RRUs. Considering that the regular movement of vehicles on almost linearly paved roads with finite corner turns will generate some regularity in handovers, to accelerate handovers, we propose to use historical handover data and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) ML algorithms to predict handover decisions without involving time-consuming target selection and beam training processes. To achieve soft handovers, we propose to employ vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connections to forward data for V2I links. The theoretical and simulation results are provided to validate the feasibility of the proposed schemes.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless

This paper studies data collection from a set of sensor nodes (SNs) in WSNs enabled by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We aim to minimize the maximum mission completion time among all UAVs by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, as well as the wake-up scheduling and association for SNs, while ensuring that each SN can successfully upload the targeting amount of data with a given energy budget. The formulated problem is a non-convex problem which is difficult to be solved directly. To tackle this problem, we first propose a simple scheme that each UAV only collects data while hovering, termed as hovering mode (Hmode). For this mode, in order to find the optimized hovering locations for each SN and the serving order among all locations, we propose an efficient algorithm by leveraging the min-max multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (min-max m-TSP) and convex optimization techniques. Furthermore, we propose the more general scheme that enables continuous data collection even while flying, termed as flying mode (Fmode). By leveraging bisection method and time discretization technique, the original problem is transformed into a discretized equivalent with a finite number of optimization variables, based on which a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution is obtained by applying the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. The simulation results show that the proposed multi-UAV enabled data collection with joint trajectory and communication design achieves significant performance gains over the benchmark schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2019.2930190","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8863562/08779596.pdf","startPage":"4859","endPage":"4872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2019.2930190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8863562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Completion Time Minimization for Multi-UAV-Enabled Data Collection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Completion Time Minimization for Multi-UAV-Enabled Data Collection","volume":"18","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2019","accessionNumber":"19115253","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8779596/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779596/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61702426"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"XDJK2019C084"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Completion Time Minimization for Multi-UAV-Enabled Data Collection","sourcePdf":"twc-zeng-2930190-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084006S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8863562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"8863562","articleId":"8779596","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8779597,"authors":[{"name":"Jyotsna Bahl","affiliation":["Centre for Research in Nanotechnology and Science, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Jyotsna","lastName":"Bahl","id":"37085724292"},{"name":"Pankaj Priyadarshi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Pankaj","lastName":"Priyadarshi","id":"37086363499"},{"name":"Bhaskaran Muralidharan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Bhaskaran","lastName":"Muralidharan","id":"37705163800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9383"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9646"}],"articleNumber":"8779597","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Superlattices","Phase change materials","Germanium","Couplings","Electric potential","Switches","Phase change memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antimony compounds","band-pass filters","germanium compounds","Green's function methods","low-power electronics","phase change memories","semiconductor superlattices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy bandpass filtering","superlattice phase change memory","antireflection heterostructures","nonequilibrium Green's function approach","electronic transport simulations","high-resistance covalent state","low-resistance resonant state","superlattice structures","antireflection units","memory device","PCM superlattice configurations","germanium telluride","RESET voltage","GeTe-Sb2Te3"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antireflection coating (ARC)","energy bandpass filtering","germanium telluride (GeTe)","germanium antimony telluride (GST)","interfacial PCM (iPCM)","nonequilibrium Green\u2019s function (NEGF)","phase change memory (PCM)","Sb\u2082 Te\u2083","superlattice"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779597","abstract":"We propose energy bandpass filtering employed using the idea of antireflection heterostructures as means to reduce the energy requirements of a superlattice phase change memory (PCM) based on germanium telluride (GeTe) and Sb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nTe\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\n heterostructures.

Our electronic transport simulations calculate the coupling parameter for the high-resistance covalent state, to 97% that of the stable low-resistance resonant state, maintaining the ON/OFF ratio of 100 for a reliable read operation. By examining various configurations of the superlattice structures, we conclude that the inclusion of antireflection units on both sides of the superlattice increases the overall ON/OFF ratio by an order of magnitude which can further help in scaling down of the memory device. It is also observed that the device with such antireflection units exhibits 32% lesser RESET voltage than the most common PCM superlattice configurations. Moreover, we also find that the ON/OFF ratio in these devices is also resilient to the variations in the periodicity of the superlattice.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8809231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/8809231/08779597.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TED.2019.2928486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2019.2928486","startPage":"3809","endPage":"3815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Bandpass Filtering in Superlattice Phase Change Memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779597/","displayDocTitle":"Energy Bandpass Filtering in Superlattice Phase Change Memories","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8779597/","volume":"66","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"18937646","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2019","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"IIT Bombay SEED Grant"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008628","fundingName":"Ministry of Electronics and Information technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Bandpass Filtering in Superlattice Phase Change Memories","sourcePdf":"ted-bahl-2928486-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161077S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"8809231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","xplore-issue":"8809231","articleId":"8779597","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8779598,"authors":[{"name":"Mazen Soliman","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8883027/8779598/solim-2927999-small.gif","p":["Mazen Soliman (S\u201909) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Cairo University, Egypt, in 2011 (valedictorian) and 2014, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Pittsburgh, PA, USA, in 2018.

This parameter, in conjunction with the high Q, is of paramount importance in providing for passive voltage amplification and filtering of the input signal. The CMOS demodulator is a 9-stage differential cross-coupled passive rectifier circuit designed with a differential output. It demodulates the signal from the MEMS resonator with the same gain as that could be achieved by a single-ended rectifier, but with half the charging time for double the single-ended bitrate. The rectifier's output is AC-coupled and fed to a two-stage differential voltage amplifier. Finally, an active latch rectifier is used to trigger a wake-up signal. The wake-up receiver is tested with an on-off keying modulated signal with carrier frequency around 400 MHz achieving a bit rate up to 100 kbps.

The novel LKF complements some coupling information between the neuron activation function and other state variables. Second, a new delay-dependent stability criterion is proposed via the above LKF application.

The quality of detection of the strongest user signals often decides about the quality of the whole system and minimizes the error propagation effect. In this paper, we propose an improved detection algorithm, which allows for using the NOMA transmission in a much smaller range of power differences between the terminals sharing common radio resources in the uplink, as compared with standard successive cancellation. The idea lies in the application of tentative decisions about weaker signals in the detection of stronger ones and then, after improved detection of stronger user signals, achieving more reliable decisions about the weaker ones. The simulation results reported in the paper confirm our idea, showing a much higher detection quality of the proposed receiver when compared with the standard solution.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931809","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08779614.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","startPage":"103325","endPage":"103335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Detection in Successive Interference Cancellation NOMA OFDM Receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved Detection in Successive Interference Cancellation NOMA OFDM Receiver","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779614/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"7","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18880442","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8779614/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004239","fundingName":"Politechnika Pozna\u0144ska","grantNumber":"DSMK/08/81/8125 and DSPB/08/81//8132"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Improved Detection in Successive Interference Cancellation NOMA OFDM Receiver","sourcePdf":"access-wesolowski-2931809-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080033S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8779614","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8779616,"authors":[{"name":"Bilal Tariq Malik","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8779616/malik-2931772-small.gif","p":["Bilal Tariq Malik was born in Pakistan, Islamabad, in 1988.

The ILA designs consist of an extended hemispherical lens, fed by two different types of source antennas, a substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) slot antenna array and a microstrip patch antenna (MPA) array. Results from comprehensive parametric analyses of the infill pattern and density of the 3D printed dielectric lenses are also intensively investigated and characterized for their electromagnetic properties, e.g., electric-field distribution. The ILAs are fabricated using polylactic acid (PLA) as the fused deposition modelling (FDM) polymer with an optimized infill density of 50%, which speeds up prototyping time and decreases the relative permittivity, dielectric loss, manufacturing cost, and overall mass of the lens. These features are illustrated through experimental verification and characterization of at least three samples. From the measurement results, the ILAs achieve a fractional bandwidth of 10.7%, ranging from 26.5 to 29.4 GHz with a maximum gain of 15.6 dBi at boresight and half power beam-width of approximately 58\u00b0 and 75\u00b0 in the E and H planes, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931772","startPage":"102467","endPage":"102476","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08779616.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna Gain Enhancement by Using Low-Infill 3D-Printed Dielectric Lens Antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"Antenna Gain Enhancement by Using Low-Infill 3D-Printed Dielectric Lens Antennas","publicationDate":"2019","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2019","volume":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8779616/","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18880532","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779616/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/N010523/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Antenna Gain Enhancement by Using Low-Infill 3D-Printed Dielectric Lens Antennas","sourcePdf":"access-malik-2931772-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085116S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8779616","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8779625,"authors":[{"name":"Yixuan Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8779625/wang-2931767-small.gif","p":["Yixuan Wang received the B.E. degree from the School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, in 2015, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

In this study, to prolong the flight duration and enhance the power and efficiency of a UAV, an aircraft engine is analyzed based on the fuel injection control system and output power characteristics. First, the mathematical model of a fuel-controlled engine is constructed. In addition, the experimental stations of the aircraft engine are set up to verify the mathematical model. Furthermore, the effects of key parameters on the engine power characteristics are examined. By the experimental and simulation studies validity of the mathematical model is effectively verified which indicates that the increased rotating speed decreases the power efficiency of the aircraft engine, and reducing the fuel injection pulse width from 5 ms to 3.5 ms increases the power efficiency by 10%. Moreover, increasing the advance angle of ignition from 10\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 improves the power efficiency by 5%. In addition, when the fuel injection delay width increases from 0.5 mm to 1.5 mm at an engine speed between 3500 rpm and 4000 rpm, the power efficiency is improved by 6%. Finally, when the engine speed is higher than 4000 rpm, increasing the propeller rotor diameter from 650 mm to 800 mm enhances the power efficiency of the aircraft engine by approximately 5%. This research can be considered as the fuel injection system optimization and cruising duration improvement of a fuel-powered UAV.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08779625.pdf","startPage":"109246","endPage":"109258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of Fuel-Controlled Aircraft Engine for Fuel-Powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle: Energy Conversion Analysis and Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuels","Engines","Aircraft propulsion","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Mathematical model","Atmospheric modeling","Manifolds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace engines","autonomous aerial vehicles","fuel systems","ignition","internal combustion engines","propellers","rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuel injection delay width","output power characteristics","fuel injection control system","fuel-powered unmanned aerial vehicle","fuel-controlled aircraft engine","fuel-powered UAV","fuel injection system optimization","engine speed","fuel injection pulse width","power efficiency","engine power characteristics","fuel-controlled engine","mathematical model","time 3.5 ms to 5.0 ms","size 0.5 mm to 1.5 mm","size 650.0 mm to 800.0 mm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aircraft engine","fuel injection control system","power characteristics","efficiency","fuel-powered unmanned aerial vehicle"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Study of Fuel-Controlled Aircraft Engine for Fuel-Powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle: Energy Conversion Analysis and Optimization","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8779625/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18896357","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51605013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Study of Fuel-Controlled Aircraft Engine for Fuel-Powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle: Energy Conversion Analysis and Optimization","sourcePdf":"access-shi-2931767-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190168S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8779625","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8779629,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyou Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Power Electronics for Energy Conservation and Motor Drive of Hebei Province, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8779629/liu-2931710-small.gif","p":["Zhiyou Liu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the North China University of Science and Technology, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

Under perfect channel state information (CSI), the considered RA problem is formulated as a multivariate nonlinear programming problem with constraints on the maximum interference power of MUs, the minimum rate requirement of each femto user, and the maximum transmit power of the femto base station. The original fractional programming problem is converted into a convex optimization problem by using Dinkelbach's method, the logarithmic transformation method, and the successive convex approximation method, where the closed-form solution is obtained with the Lagrangian dual approach. Moreover, with imperfect CSI consideration, the original problem is reformulated as a robust RA problem that is transformed into a deterministic and convex optimization problem by using an inequality transformation approach. In addition, the computational complexity and the cost of robustness are also analyzed. The simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm has better interference efficiency and robustness by comparing with the existing algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08779633.pdf","startPage":"102406","endPage":"102416","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal and Robust Interference Efficiency Maximization for Multicell Heterogeneous Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Resource management","Quality of service","Robustness","Heterogeneous networks","Wireless communication","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","computational complexity","femtocellular radio","optimisation","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femto user","maximum transmit power","femto base station","original fractional programming problem","convex optimization problem","logarithmic transformation method","successive convex approximation method","imperfect CSI consideration","robust RA problem","deterministic optimization problem","inequality transformation approach","multicell heterogeneous networks","energy efficiency","macro users","robust resource allocation problem","perfect channel state information","multivariate nonlinear programming problem","maximum interference power","minimum rate requirement","computational complexity","Lagrangian dual approach","optimal interference efficiency maximization","robust interference efficiency maximization","RA problem","Dinkelbach method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterogeneous wireless networks","interference efficiency","robust resource allocation","successive convex approximation"]}],"topic":"New Waveform Design and Air-Interface for Future Heterogeneous Network towards 5G","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Optimal and Robust Interference Efficiency Maximization for Multicell Heterogeneous Networks","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8779633/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18880660","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601071"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007957","fundingName":"Chongqing Municipal Education Commission","grantNumber":"KJQN201800606"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund from the Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Wireless Communication Technologies","grantNumber":"SDKLWCT-2019-04"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Optimal and Robust Interference Efficiency Maximization for Multicell Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"access-xu-2931863-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108945S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8600701","topics":["New Waveform Design and Air-Interface for Future Heterogeneous Network towards 5G"],"articleId":"8779633","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8779638,"authors":[{"name":"Guanghai Bao","affiliation":["Fujian Key Laboratory of New Energy Generation and Power Conversion, Fuzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8779638/bao-2931704-small.gif","p":["Guanghai Bao received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Fuzhou University, Fujian, China, in 2000 and 2011, respectively.

The frame circuit breaker can quickly break the transmission lines in case of the short-circuit faults to achieve the purpose of protecting the power system. At present, the method for detecting the short-circuit faults in the low-voltage distribution system by the intelligent release in the frame circuit breaker is mostly the rate of change of current or the effective value of current. Detection of the short-circuit faults by the rate of change of current has poor anti-interference ability. Detection of the short-circuit faults by the effective value will take a long time. In order to shorten the short-circuit fault detection time of the intelligent release, this paper proposes the wavelet packet decomposition as the short-circuit fault detection algorithm of the intelligent release. The multi-scale wavelet algorithm has a certain ability to filter white noise, and the singular value of the detail decomposition can be used to fast detection of the short-circuit faults when the short circuit occurs, which can shorten the detection time of the short-circuit faults. The results of the authoritative institutional tests prove that the intelligent release designed in this paper can detect the fault characteristics and send out the tripping signal within 0.5 ms after the short-circuit faults occur. The method proposed in this paper can be used in the low-voltage distribution system, as well as in medium-voltage and high-voltage situations to detect the short-circuit faults.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931704","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08779638.pdf","startPage":"104228","endPage":"104240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Short-Circuit Detection Intelligent Release Using Discrete Wavelet Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779638/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Short-Circuit Detection Intelligent Release Using Discrete Wavelet Algorithm","htmlLink":"/document/8779638/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2019","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18880342","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Design of a Short-Circuit Detection Intelligent Release Using Discrete Wavelet Algorithm","sourcePdf":"access-zeng-2931704-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10399S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8600701","articleId":"8779638","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8779642,"authors":[{"name":"Xinwen Gao","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8779642/gao-2931820-small.gif","p":["Xinwen Gao received the M.E. degree in computer application from Guizhou University, Guizhou, China, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from Shanghai University, Shanghai, China, where he is currently a Teacher with the School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation.

By successful implementation of automatic surveillance of abnormal events, a significant amount of human resources in video monitoring can be economized. One solution to this application is computer vision technology. This approach utilizes an image processing algorithm to extract specific features and then uses discriminator algorithms to give an alert. In this paper, we propose to apply a particle filter-based algorithm to feature series extracted from videos in order to give alerts when abnormal events occur. The whole process consists of feature series generation and particle filter tracking. To represent the features of a video, an L2-norm extractor is designed based on the optical flow. Then, the particle filter keeps track of these feature series. The occurrence of abnormal events will cause the shift of feature series and a large error in PF tracking. This, in turn, will allow computers to understand and define the occurrences of anomalies. Experiments on UMN dataset show that our algorithm reaches 90% accuracy in frame-level detection.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931820","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8600701/08779642.pdf","startPage":"107550","endPage":"107559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8600701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Filter-Based Prediction for Anomaly Detection in Automatic Surveillance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779642","topic":"Urban Computing and Intelligence","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779642/","displayDocTitle":"Particle Filter-Based Prediction for Anomaly Detection in Automatic Surveillance","volume":"7","publicationDate":"2019","accessionNumber":"18897553","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8779642/","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003399","fundingName":"Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality","grantNumber":"18DZ1201204"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003399","fundingName":"Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality","grantNumber":"17DZ1204203"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Particle Filter-Based Prediction for Anomaly Detection in Automatic Surveillance","sourcePdf":"access-xu-2931820-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073127S","chronDate":"2019","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8600701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8600701","topics":["Urban Computing and Intelligence"],"articleId":"8779642","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8779643,"authors":[{"name":"Xue Bai","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8779643/bai-2931781-small.gif","p":["Xue Bai received the B.Eng. degree from Hainan University, in 2017.

hypoglycemia and associated complications. The latest continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology allows people to observe glucose in real-time. However, an accurate glucose forecast remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce GluNet, a framework that leverages on a personalized deep neural network to predict the probabilistic distribution of short-term (30-60 minutes) future CGM measurements for subjects with T1D based on their historical data including glucose measurements, meal information, insulin doses, and other factors. It adopts the latest deep learning techniques consisting of four components: data pre-processing, label transform/recover, multilayers of dilated convolution neural network (CNN), and post-processing. The method is evaluated in-silico for both adult and adolescent subjects. The results show significant improvements over existing methods in the literature through a comprehensive comparison in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) (8.88 \u00b1 0.77 mg/dL) with short time lag (0.83 \u00b1 0.40 minutes) for prediction horizons (PH) = 30 mins (minutes), and RMSE (19.90 \u00b1 3.17 mg/dL) with time lag (16.43 \u00b1 4.07 mins) for PH = 60 mins for virtual adult subjects. In addition, GluNet is also tested on two clinical data sets. Results show that it achieves an RMSE (19.28 \u00b1 2.76 mg/dL) with time lag (8.03 \u00b1 4.07 mins) for PH = 30 mins and an RMSE (31.83 \u00b1 3.49 mg/dL) with time lag (17.78 \u00b1 8.00 mins) for PH = 60 mins.

It is difficult to utilize the incomplete datasets to build an effective data-driven model to improve the industry productivity. To overcome this problem, a data-knowledge-based fuzzy neural network (DK-FNN) was developed in this article. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed DK-FNN consists of the following obvious advantages. First, through the multilayered connectionist structure, this proposed DK-FNN could not only make full use of the data from the current scene, but also use the existing knowledge from the source scene to improve the learning performance. Second, an integrated-form transfer learning (ITL) method was developed to improve the learning performance of DK-FNN. This first reported ITL method was able to integrate the internal information from the datasets in the source scene and the knowledge from the current scene to offset the data shortage in the learning process. Third, a mutual attraction strategy (MAS) was designed to balance the difference of data distributions to reduce the identification errors of DK-FNN. Then, the proposed DK-FNN was able to satisfy the nonlinear dynamical systems. Finally, the effectiveness and the merit of DK-FNN were validated by applying it to several practical systems.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2019.2931870","startPage":"2209","endPage":"2221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2019.2931870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9184168","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/9184168/08779649.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Knowledge-Based Fuzzy Neural Network for Nonlinear System Identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779649/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Data-Knowledge-Based Fuzzy Neural Network for Nonlinear System Identification","volume":"28","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/8779649/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"20014020","publicationDate":"Sept. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013290","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research","grantNumber":"2018YFC1900800-5"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61890930-5 and 61622301"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"4172005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Knowledge-Based Fuzzy Neural Network for Nonlinear System Identification","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-han-2931870-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.216562S","chronDate":"Sept.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"9184168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"9184168","articleId":"8779649","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8779657,"authors":[{"name":"Mads Graungaard Taul","affiliation":["Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/9084070/8779657/taul-2931477-small.gif","p":["Mads Graungaard Taul (S\u201917) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in energy technology with specializing in electrical energy engineering and power electronics and drives from Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, in 2016 and 2019, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in power electronic systems with the Department of Energy Technology.","His current research interests include renewable energy sources and grid-connected converters, especially modeling and control of power electronic-based power systems under grid fault conditions."]},"firstName":"Mads Graungaard","lastName":"Taul","orcid":"0000-0001-9584-1379","id":"37086454899"},{"name":"Xiongfei Wang","affiliation":["Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/9084070/8779657/wang-2931477-small.gif","p":["Xiongfei Wang (S\u201910\u2013M\u201913\u2013SM\u201917) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China, in 2006, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in energy technology from Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, in 2013.","Since 2009, he has been with the Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, where he became an Assistant Professor in 2014, an Associate Professor in 2016, a Full Professor, and a Research Program Leader for Electronic Power Grid Infrastructure in 2018.

Consequently, grid-forming converters have been proposed as a promising solution as they are compatible with the conventional synchronous-machine-based power system. However, most research focuses on the grid-forming control during normal operating conditions without considering the fundamental distinction between a grid-forming converter and a synchronous machine when considering its short-circuit capability. The current limitation of grid-forming converters during fault conditions is not well described in the available literature and present solutions often aim to switch the control structure to a grid-following structure during the fault. Yet, for a future converter-based power system with no or little integration of synchronous machines, the converters need to preserve their voltage-mode characteristics and be robust toward weak-grid conditions. To address this issue, this article discusses the fundamental issue of grid-forming converter control during grid fault conditions and proposes a fault-mode controller which keeps the voltage-mode characteristics of the grid-forming structure while simultaneously limiting the converter currents to an admissible value. The proposed method is evaluated in a detailed simulation model and verified through an experimental test setup.","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2019.2931477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/9084070/08779657.pdf","startPage":"1062","endPage":"1073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9084070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2019.2931477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current Limiting Control With Enhanced Dynamics of Grid-Forming Converters During Fault Conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2020","displayDocTitle":"Current Limiting Control With Enhanced Dynamics of Grid-Forming Converters During Fault Conditions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779657/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"June 2020","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2020","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19650572","htmlLink":"/document/8779657/","volume":"8","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Reliable Power Electronic-Based Power System (REPEPS) Project at the Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University"},{"fundingName":"Villum Investigator Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008398","fundingName":"Villum Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Current Limiting Control With Enhanced Dynamics of Grid-Forming Converters During Fault Conditions","sourcePdf":"jestpe-graungaardtaul-2931477-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.225631S","chronDate":"June  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"9084070","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"9084070","articleId":"8779657","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8779663,"authors":[{"name":"Lingxiang Wu","affiliation":["Global Big Data Technologies Centre, School of Electrical and Data Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/9006961/8779663/wu-2931815-small.gif","p":["Lingxiang Wu received the B.E. degree from the Computer Science and Engineering Department, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2015.

The existing encoder-decoder model and its variants, which are the most popular models for image captioning, use the image features in three ways: first, they inject the encoded image features into the decoder only once at the initial step, which does not enable the rich image content to be explored sufficiently while gradually generating a text caption; second, they concatenate the encoded image features with text as extra inputs at every step, which introduces unnecessary noise; and, third, they using an attention mechanism, which increases the computational complexity due to the introduction of extra neural nets to identify the attention regions. Different from the existing methods, in this paper, we propose a novel network, Recall Network, for generating captions that are consistent with the images. The recall network selectively involves the visual features by using a GridLSTM and, thus, is able to recall image contents while generating each word. By importing the visual information as the latent memory along the depth dimension LSTM, the decoder is able to admit the visual features dynamically through the inherent LSTM structure without adding any extra neural nets or parameters. The Recall Network efficiently prevents the decoder from deviating from the original image content. To verify the efficiency of our model, we conducted exhaustive experiments on full and dense image captioning. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that our recall network outperforms the conventional encoder-decoder model by a large margin and that it performs comparably to the state-of-the-art methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779663/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 2020","accessionNumber":"19392015","htmlLink":"/document/8779663/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2020","volume":"22","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Recall What You See Continually Using GridLSTM in Image Captioning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recall What You See Continually Using GridLSTM in Image Captioning","sourcePdf":"tmm-xu-2931815-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099661S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"9006961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"9006961","articleId":"8779663","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8779664,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Zhou","affiliation":["School Of Information Technology, Deakin University, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Zhou","orcid":"0000-0002-4273-9562","id":"37087039876"},{"name":"Keshav Sood","affiliation":["School Of Information Technology, Deakin University, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Keshav","lastName":"Sood","orcid":"0000-0002-2127-1438","id":"37085556791"},{"name":"Yong Xiang","affiliation":["School Of Information Technology, Deakin University, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37286573200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8779664","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":449},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Computer crime","Probability distribution","Current measurement","Protocols","Measurement uncertainty","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","entropy","statistical distributions","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed denial-of-service attacks","entropy-based methods","probability distribution","sophisticated attack strategies","network traffic patterns","entropy rate measurement","ERM","DDoS attacks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Entropy","entropy rate","DDoS"]}],"abstract":"The challenges from Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are severe and still increasing significantly. We observe that the existing entropy-based methods only consider the probability distribution of traffic flows that have high false negative rates. On the other hand, sophisticated attack strategies, increasing attack strength and dynamic nature of network traffic patterns make it more difficult to detect the DDoS attacks with high accuracy. In this letter, we present an accurate approach, entropy rate measurement (ERM), to detect DDoS attacks. The proposed approach is based on the differences between the probability distributions and the number of flows. Both theoretical proofs and the results of experiments using real datasets demonstrate that our method has high detection accuracy rate compared to the existing measurements.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2019.2931832","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8863555/08779664.pdf","startPage":"1700","endPage":"1703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8863555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2019.2931832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ERM: An Accurate Approach to Detect DDoS Attacks Using Entropy Rate Measurement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","displayDocTitle":"ERM: An Accurate Approach to Detect DDoS Attacks Using Entropy Rate Measurement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779664/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19090808","htmlLink":"/document/8779664/","volume":"23","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ERM: An Accurate Approach to Detect DDoS Attacks Using Entropy Rate Measurement","sourcePdf":"lcomm-zhou-2931832-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062565S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8863555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8863555","articleId":"8779664","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8779672,"authors":[{"name":"Likai Zhu","affiliation":["Fiberhome Telecom Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Likai","lastName":"Zhu","orcid":"0000-0001-6494-1027","id":"37086821288"},{"name":"Jianying Zhou","affiliation":["Fiberhome Telecom Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jianying","lastName":"Zhou","orcid":"0000-0003-4938-0465","id":"37086948211"},{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["Fiberhome Telecom Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086947766"},{"name":"Qun Zhang","affiliation":["Neophotonics Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-8852-4882","id":"37307996700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"8779672","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":461},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Peak to average power ratio","Modulation","Frequency response","Optical transmitters","Optical noise","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","digital-analogue conversion","elemental semiconductors","equalisers","frequency response","optical modulation","optical transmitters","quadrature amplitude modulation","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Tx optical power","DAC output","bandwidth compensation","optimized pure digital pre-equalization","100G Baud 16 QAM","analog bandwidth","Tx analog frequency response roll-off slope","bandwidth limitation","100-G-Baud 32 QAM all-silicon transmitter","transmitter frequency response","high-baud rate transmission performances","QAM transmission","high-pass digital filter","digital to analog converter","all-silicon photonics IQ modulator","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Equalizers","quantization","peak to average power ratio","quadrature amplitude modulation","silicon photonics modulator","coherent communications"]}],"abstract":"Pre-equalizer as high-pass digital filter compensates for transmitter (Tx) frequency response to improve high-baud rate transmission performances; however, it also increases the signal peak to average power ratio (PAPR) at the digital to analog converter (DAC). The increased PAPR induces performance penalty due to the reduced signal-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio (SINAD) at the DAC. It also reduces the Tx optical power due to the limited peak-to-peak amplitude of the DAC output. As a tradeoff between bandwidth compensation and the PAPR, the pre-equalization can be optimized for the best transmission performance. With the optimized pure digital pre-equalization, 100G Baud 16 QAM and 32 QAM transmission is performed with all-silicon photonics IQ modulator.

Such algorithms typically employ a discretization strategy based on the trapezoidal rule with fixed sampling step, though this is not the only option. In fact, alternative discretization strategies (possibly with an adaptive sampling step) can be quite advantageous, particularly when dealing with nonlinear systems characterized by stiff equations. In this paper, we propose a unified approach for modeling capacitors and inductors in the WD domain using generic linear multi-step discretization methods with variable time-step size, and provide generalized adaptation conditions. We also show that the proposed approach for implementing dynamic (energy-storing) elements in the WD domain is particularly suitable to be combined with a recently developed technique for efficiently solving a class of circuits with multiple one-port nonlinearities, called Scattering Iterative Method. Finally, as examples of application, we develop WD models for a Van Der Pol oscillator and a dynamic diode-based ring modulator, which use different discretization methods.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2019.2931759","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/8784423/08779678.pdf","startPage":"1763","endPage":"1776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8784423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2019.2931759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Multistep Discretization Methods With Variable Step-Size in Nonlinear Wave Digital Structures for Virtual Analog Modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779678","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Linear Multistep Discretization Methods With Variable Step-Size in Nonlinear Wave Digital Structures for Virtual Analog Modeling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779678/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18900822","htmlLink":"/document/8779678/","volume":"27","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Multistep Discretization Methods With Variable Step-Size in Nonlinear Wave Digital Structures for Virtual Analog Modeling","sourcePdf":"taslp-bernardini-2931759-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125397S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"8784423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8784423","articleId":"8779678","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-23"},{"_id":8779680,"authors":[{"name":"Dongqing Wang","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8966383/8779680/wang-2931792-small.gif","p":["Dongqing Wang received the Ph.D. degree in power electronics and power transmission from the College of Automation Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2006.","She joined the College of Electrical Engineering, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China, in 1988, and has been a Professor in complex system modeling with College of Electrical Engineering at Qingdao University since 2011.

The novel EM method relaxes the requirements on an autoregression model with one parameter vector, interactively maximizes the expectation over multiple parameter vectors in a more general model, and uses the output of an auxiliary model to substitute the missing outputs in the information vector in iteration processes. A numerical simulation is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed novel EM method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8966383/08779680.pdf","startPage":"2500","endPage":"2508","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2019.2931792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2019.2931792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8966383","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel EM Identification Method for Hammerstein Systems With Missing Output Data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Informatics","Estimation","Computational modeling","Data systems","Gallium nitride","Nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","iterative methods","maximum likelihood estimation","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information vector","missing outputs","auxiliary model","parameter vector","autoregression model","multiple parameter vectors","EM method","data loss","novel auxiliary-model-based expectation maximization estimation method","missing output data","Hammerstein systems","novel EM identification method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data loss","expectation maximization (EM) algorithm","Hammerstein systems","parameter identification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"A Novel EM Identification Method for Hammerstein Systems With Missing Output Data","volume":"16","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8779680/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2020","accessionNumber":"19283512","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61873138, 61573205, 61673155 and 61877033"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013158","fundingName":"Tai'shan Scholar Engineering Construction Fund of Shandong Province of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel EM Identification Method for Hammerstein Systems With Missing Output Data","sourcePdf":"tii-wang-2931792-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154587S","chronDate":"April  2020","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8966383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8966383","articleId":"8779680","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8779682,"authors":[{"name":"Atul Kumar","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Atul","lastName":"Kumar","orcid":"0000-0002-0016-1061","id":"37086005064"},{"name":"Maurizio Magarini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Magarini","orcid":"0000-0001-9288-0452","id":"37268262100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8779682","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Interference","Discrete Fourier transforms","Receivers","Complexity theory","Frequency division multiplexing","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete transforms","error statistics","frequency division multiplexing","intersymbol interference","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood estimation","receivers","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum mean-squared error","symbol error rate performance","ISSI","inter-sub-symbol interference","GFDM transmission","frequency selective channel","discrete Gabor transform structure","channel impulse response","maximum likelihood receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete Gabor transform (DGT)","maximum likelihood detection","generalized frequency division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"Inter-sub-symbol interference (ISSI) refers to the interference that independently affects each group of sub-symbols transmitted on the same sub-carrier in generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM).

The proposed model, which is derived by exploiting the discrete Gabor transform structure of GFDM, allows for the exact computation of the channel impulse response associated with each sub-carrier.

We propose a fixation prediction network based on recurrent neural network, which leverages sensor and content features. The content features are derived by computer vision (CV) algorithms, which may suffer from inferior performance due to various types of distortion caused by diverse 3600 video projection models. We propose a unified approach with overlapping virtual viewports to eliminate such negative effects, and we evaluate our proposed solution using several CV algorithms, such as saliency detection, face detection, and object detection. We find that overlapping virtual viewports increase the performance of these existing CV algorithms that were not trained for 3600 videos. We next fine-tune our fixation prediction network with diverse design options, including: 1) with or without overlapping virtual viewports, 2) with or without future content features, and 3) different feature sampling rates. We empirically choose the best fixation prediction network and use it in a 3600 video streaming system. We conduct extensive trace-driven simulations with a large-scale dataset to quantify the performance of the 3600 video streaming system with different fixation prediction algorithms. The results show that our proposed fixation prediction network outperforms other algorithms in several aspects, such as: 1) achieving comparable video quality (average gaps between -0.05 and 0.92 dB), 2) consuming much less bandwidth (average bandwidth reduction by up to 8 Mb/s), 3) reducing the rebuffering time (on average 40 s in bandwidth-limited 4G cellular networks), and 4) running in real-time (at most 124 ms).","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2019.2931807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9006961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2019.2931807","endPage":"759","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/9006961/08779683.pdf","startPage":"744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Fixation Prediction Using Recurrent Neural Networks for 360- Video Streaming in Head-Mounted Virtual Reality","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779683/","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Fixation Prediction Using Recurrent Neural Networks for 360<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^{\\circ }$</tex-math></inline-formula> Video Streaming in Head-Mounted Virtual Reality","volume":"22","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"19392018","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8779683/","publicationDate":"March 2020","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"#107-2221-E-007-091-MY3 and #107-2221-E-009-028-MY3"},{"fundingName":"NOVATEK"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Fixation Prediction Using Recurrent Neural Networks for 360<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^{\\circ }$</tex-math></inline-formula> Video Streaming in Head-Mounted Virtual Reality","sourcePdf":"tmm-hsu-2931807-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14265S","chronDate":"March  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"9006961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"9006961","articleId":"8779683","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8779684,"authors":[{"name":"Emranul Haque","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Independent University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Emranul","lastName":"Haque","orcid":"0000-0003-1717-8078","id":"37085800778"},{"name":"Subaha Mahmuda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Primeasia University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Subaha","lastName":"Mahmuda","orcid":"0000-0002-0735-8772","id":"38489071000"},{"name":"Md.

When nodes are unaware of each other's local clocks and the global channels and have no pre-assigned CH strategies or identifiers (IDs), it is particularly challenging to guarantee blind rendezvous within a finite period of time, which has not been solved yet by using only one radio. In this paper, we propose a novel quaternary-encoding-based CH (QECH) algorithm to tackle the above issue. The QECH algorithm encodes a randomly selected channel into a quaternary string according to the 6B/8B encoding. We also append a common prefix string as well as the randomly selected channel before the quaternary string to guarantee overlaps in the asynchronous scenario. For all kinds of quaternary digits, we construct four mutually co-prime numbers to enumerate all possible combinations of the common available channels. We theoretically analyze the deterministic rendezvous principle and the upper bounded rendezvous latency of the QECH algorithm. We also verify the effectiveness of the QECH algorithm through extensive simulations. Evaluation results show the superiority of the QECH algorithm in terms of rendezvous latency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779687/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","volume":"67","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"19115091","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2019","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8779687/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Quaternary-Encoding-Based Channel Hopping Algorithm for Blind Rendezvous in Distributed IoTs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61732017 and 61872028"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2018M631582"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Quaternary-Encoding-Based Channel Hopping Algorithm for Blind Rendezvous in Distributed IoTs","sourcePdf":"tcomm-liu-2931691-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172318S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8871140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8871140","articleId":"8779687","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8779688,"authors":[{"name":"Anushka M.

Autonomous control of DCMG is primarily based on the droop control. Typically, the droop coefficients of each distributed generator (DG) are fixed and assigned based on their capacity. This article introduces a multiobjective optimization (MOO) based intelligent computation approach to derive the optimal droop coefficients for DGs in an islanded DCMG. The proposed approach takes into consideration not only the capacities of the DGs but also the system voltage regulation, system total loss minimization, and enhanced current sharing among the DGs. The Pareto optimal front of the constructed MOO problem is obtained using the elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II). A best compromise solution is extracted from the generated Pareto optimal front by employing a fuzzy membership function approach. Moreover, a state feedback linearization based controller is introduced to facilitate the control actions to experimentally validate the effectiveness and the applicability of the generated optimal droop relationships. The proposed approach was tested with a parallel connected dc 9-bus system, IEEE 30-bus system, and experimentally validated on a 5-bus system. However, the same concept can be extended to any other bus system without loss of generality.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2019.2931837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2019.2931837","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8966383/08779688.pdf","startPage":"2423","endPage":"2435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8966383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779688/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2020","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization of Droop-Controlled Distributed Generators in DC Microgrids","volume":"16","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19283524","htmlLink":"/document/8779688/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2020","publicationDate":"April 2020","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Optimization of Droop-Controlled Distributed Generators in DC Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tii-dissanayake-2931837-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168038S","chronDate":"April  2020","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8966383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8966383","articleId":"8779688","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8779691,"authors":[{"name":"Hamilton Carrillo-Nu\u00f1ez","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K."],"firstName":"Hamilton","lastName":"Carrillo-Nu\u00f1ez","orcid":"0000-0002-5042-3664","id":"37085541627"},{"name":"Nadezhda Dimitrova","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K."],"firstName":"Nadezhda","lastName":"Dimitrova","orcid":"0000-0003-0879-3044","id":"37086948918"},{"name":"Asen Asenov","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K."],"firstName":"Asen","lastName":"Asenov","id":"37268766900"},{"name":"Vihar Georgiev","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K."],"firstName":"Vihar","lastName":"Georgiev","orcid":"0000-0001-6473-2508","id":"38552141500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"8779691","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1218},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Numerical models","Silicon","Ions","Computational modeling","Training","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic engineering computing","elemental semiconductors","field effect transistors","junctionless nanowire transistors","learning (artificial intelligence)","nanoelectronics","neural nets","semiconductor device models","semiconductor doping","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["activated density gradient quantum corrections","statistical numerical experiments","silicon body","statistical simulations","subthreshold slope","statistical variability","Si junctionless nanowire transistors","multilayer neural network","hierarchical multiscale simulation study","silicon junctionless nanowire field-effect transistor","Si channel","drift-diffusion formalism","random distribution","machine learning","JL-NWT","discrete dopants","general linear model","size 8.0 nm","size 150.0 nm","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nanowires","TCAD simulations","statistical variability","deep learning","neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779691","abstract":"This letter investigates the possibility to replace numerical TCAD device simulations with a multi-layer neural network (NN).

From those statistical simulations, we extract important figures of merit (FoM) such as OFF-current (IOFF) and ON-current (ION), subthreshold slope (SS), and voltage threshold (VTH). Based on those statistical simulations, we train a multi-layer NN and we compare the obtained results with a general linear model (GLM).

There has been a common belief that the access efficiency can always be improved by the use of carrier sensing, which is indeed based on an implicit assumption that the packet length is much larger than the sensing time. For machine-to-machine (M2M) communications featured with short packets, the benefit of sensing may not overweigh the cost any more. It is therefore of paramount importance to identify the conditions for CSMA to outperform Aloha. In this paper, the sum rate performance of CSMA networks with two representative receiver structures, i.e., the collision model and the capture model, is characterized and optimized, based on which a comparative study of the optimal sum rate performance between Aloha and CSMA is conducted to establish criteria for beneficial sensing. The analysis shows that the maximum sum rates of CSMA with both receiver structures logarithmically increase with the mean received SNR \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\rho $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n at the high SNR region, and the rate gain of the capture model over the collision model is significant only when \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\rho $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n is small. The critical threshold for the ratio of the sensing time to the packet length for beneficial sensing is characterized under various scenarios, and found to be close to zero at the low SNR region when the capture model is adopted, indicating that the packet length needs to be extremely large for CSMA to outperform Aloha in that case. The analysis sheds important light on the access design of M2M communications, and suggests that Aloha could be a more favorable option when short packets are sent by a massive amount of low-power machine-type devices.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2931694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8906190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2931694","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8906190/08779696.pdf","startPage":"7587","endPage":"7603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"To Sense or Not To Sense: A Comparative Study of CSMA With Aloha","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"To Sense or Not To Sense: A Comparative Study of CSMA With Aloha","volume":"67","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8779696/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779696/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"20190901"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002663","fundingName":"Northwestern Polytechnical University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002920","fundingName":"Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee","grantNumber":"CityU 11212018"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"To Sense or Not To Sense: A Comparative Study of CSMA With Aloha","sourcePdf":"tcomm-sun-2931694-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.188661S","chronDate":"Nov.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8906190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8906190","articleId":"8779696","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8779699,"authors":[{"name":"Qijie Lin","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qijie","lastName":"Lin","id":"37087041295"},{"name":"Feng Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-3492-3714","id":"37085391176"},{"name":"Jie Xu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Xu","orcid":"0000-0002-4854-8839","id":"37070344700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8779699","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":780},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779699","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Task analysis","Device-to-device communication","Energy consumption","Convex functions","Wireless communication","Ad hoc networks","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","energy conservation","energy consumption","mobile computing","power aware computing","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal task offloading scheduling","energy-efficient computation offloading designs","time-varying computation task arrivals","computation loads","weighted sum-energy consumption","finite time horizon","local computing","completion constraints","convex optimization technique","optimal solution","bidirectional computation","system energy consumption","task causality","energy efficient D2D cooperative computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile edge computing (MEC)","cooperative computing","device-to-device offloading","convex optimization"]}],"abstract":"This letter investigates energy-efficient computation offloading designs for device-to-device (D2D) cooperative computing between the two users, in which each user has time-varying computation task arrivals.

In particular, we minimize the weighted sum-energy consumption of both users over a finite time horizon, by jointly optimizing their local computing and task exchange (offloading) decisions over time, subject to the newly introduced task causality and completion constraints. By applying the convex optimization technique, we obtain the well-structured optimal solution to this problem.

of imperfect channel state information (CSI) on quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes for a multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) variable gain non-regenerative cooperative network over the generalized Nakagami-m fading channel. Energy-efficient and standardized transmit antenna selection strategy is employed, to evaluate the system performance by considering the antenna link, which maximizes the received signal power. Framework for the upper-bound outage probability (OP), asymptotic OP and the average symbol error rate for hexagonal QAM, rectangular QAM, and 32-cross QAM are provided. Useful insights are drawn from comparative ASER analysis of various QAM schemes by considering the impact of both the fading parameter and the imperfect CSI for MIMO channels. Finally, the derived analytical results are validated through Monte-Carlo simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779706/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","volume":"23","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"19090823","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2019","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8779706/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On Impact of Imperfect CSI Over Hexagonal QAM for TAS/MRC-MIMO Cooperative Relay Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Impact of Imperfect CSI Over Hexagonal QAM for TAS/MRC-MIMO Cooperative Relay Network","sourcePdf":"lcomm-shaik-2931433-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062477S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8863555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8863555","articleId":"8779706","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8779707,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Jiang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Jiang","orcid":"0000-0002-5337-890X","id":"37086334485"},{"name":"Yansha Deng","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, King\u2019s College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Yansha","lastName":"Deng","orcid":"0000-0003-1001-7036","id":"37085372750"},{"name":"Osvaldo Simeone","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, King\u2019s College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Osvaldo","lastName":"Simeone","orcid":"0000-0001-9898-3209","id":"37269653500"},{"name":"Arumugam Nallanathan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Arumugam","lastName":"Nallanathan","orcid":"0000-0001-8337-5884","id":"37269846800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8779707","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":379},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Method of moments","Supervised learning","Recurrent neural networks","Maximum likelihood estimation","Prediction methods","Memory architecture","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","method of moments","recurrent neural nets","resource allocation","supervised learning","telecommunication computing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online supervised learning","framed-ALOHA networks","traffic model","temporal memory","online learning-based adaptive traffic load prediction method","recurrent neural networks","long short-term memory architecture","online training","online predictor","resource allocation","complex packet generation statistics","LSTM architecture","approximate labeling technique","method of moments estimators","MOM estimators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Traffic load prediction","framed-ALOHA","online supervised learning","recurrent neural network"]}],"abstract":"Predicting the current backlog, or traffic load, in framed-ALOHA networks enables the optimization of resource allocation, e.g., of the frame size. However, this prediction is made difficult by the lack of information about the cardinality of collisions and by possibly complex packet generation statistics. Assuming no prior information about the traffic model, apart from a bound on its temporal memory, this letter develops an online learning-based adaptive traffic load prediction method that is based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) and specifically on the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. In order to enable online training in the absence of feedback on the exact cardinality of collisions, the proposed strategy leverages a novel approximate labeling technique that is inspired by the method of moments (MOM) estimators. Numerical results show that the proposed online predictor considerably outperforms conventional methods and is able to adapt changing traffic statistics.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2019.2931693","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8863555/08779707.pdf","startPage":"1778","endPage":"1782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8863555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2019.2931693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Supervised Learning for Traffic Load Prediction in Framed-ALOHA Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8779707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Online Supervised Learning for Traffic Load Prediction in Framed-ALOHA Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779707/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19090824","htmlLink":"/document/8779707/","volume":"23","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/R006466/1"},{"fundingName":"European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovative programme","grantNumber":"725731"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Supervised Learning for Traffic Load Prediction in Framed-ALOHA Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-deng-2931693-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064297S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8863555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8863555","articleId":"8779707","onlineDate":"29 July 2019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8779777,"authors":[{"name":"Arjun Ramamurthy","affiliation":[""],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7261654/8779765/8779777/ramam-2917597-small.gif","p":["Arjun Ramamurthy is currently the senior vice president of technology with Twentieth Century Fox, Los Angeles, CA.

Digital storage for the M&E industry has demanding characteristics that are often very different from typical IT storage because of the performance requirements of realtime video in capture, editing, and post-production, as well as distribution. These trends are driving demand for flash memory in post-production as well as content delivery. On the other hand, the growing archive of long-tail digital content and increasing digitized historical analog content is swelling the demand for cold as well as warm archives using tape, optical discs, and hard drive arrays. The growth of IP-based workflows is driving demand for block, file, and object storage for various M&E applications. As a result, the prices of digital storage have declined. At the same time, the availability of digital storage hardware, software, and online services has increased. This brings up the question of what sort of storage systems and services do M&E professionals require for various parts of their workflows. What drives their storage decisions and how are these demands changing over time? Coughlin Associates, Inc. has been conducting a survey of M&E professionals from all over the world on various digital storage topics for nine years. The surveys were broken down into several usage segments to reflect broad differences in storage requirements, including content capture, editing and post-production, content delivery, as well as archiving and digital preservation. Results from the nine years of this survey will be compared to show changing storage trends for these various M&E applications, including storage capacity growth, cloud storage, flash memory, hard disk drive, tape, and optical disc demand. These surveys served as a basis for our annual Digital Storage in Media and Entertainment report, and some projections on the drivers and growth of digital storage will give insights on the future of digital storage for the M&E industry.","doi":"10.5594/JMI.2019.2918035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.5594/JMI.2019.2918035","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7261654/8779765/08779780.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8779765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nine Years of Media and Entertainment Digital Storage Surveys","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8779780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 July 2019","displayDocTitle":"Nine Years of Media and Entertainment Digital Storage Surveys","volume":"128","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8779780/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nine Years of Media and Entertainment Digital Storage Surveys","sourcePdf":"jmi-coughlin-2918035-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096598S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7261654","isNumber":"8779765","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7261654","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8779765","articleId":"8779780","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"SMPTE Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8779790,"authors":[{"name":"Shuyin Xia","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Computational Intelligence, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8600701/8779790/sxia-2912908-small.gif","p":["Shuyin Xia received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from the Chongqing University of Technology, China, in 2008 and 2012, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, China.

The transfer learning using DCNN (TCNN) reuses pre-trained layers to generate a mid-level image representation so that the optimization of more than millions CNN parameters can be avoided. By this way, overfitting problem in small-scale data can be alleviated. However, although now many public DCNNs have been trained and can be reused, the existing TCNNs are formed by only a single pre-trained DCNN structure and cannot make full use of multiple structures of pre-trained DCNNs. At the same time, the existing ensemble CNNs have not enough good representation ability. To address this problem, we combine the conventional ideas of ensemble CNNs and propose three ensemble TCNNs (TECNN). They are the voting method based on the combination of all TCNNs, the PickOver method by finding the optimal combination, and weighted method by finding weighted combination. Different from the existing ensemble CNNs, the proposed methods do not need to retrain the component CNNs and generate ensemble transferring representations by transferring the pre-trained mid-level parameters. The mathematical models of those three methods are also provided. Their versions of using fine-tuning are also compared in the experiments. In addition, we replace the Softmax classifier with ensemble linear classifiers in the full-connection layer. They outperform the current state of the art algorithms on Caltech ImageNet and some internet image data. All this research has released as an open source library called Transferring Image Ensemble Representations using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (TECNN).

In this paper authors aim to structure existing and potential use of blockchain-based cybersecurity solutions from the perspective of attackers and defenders to assess whether the intersection will tip the scales in favor of one of these groups. Historically blockchain has been mainly associated with innovative financial services (including crypto-currencies) but it has other emerging use cases within e-government, supply chain management as well as security (e.g. encryption, identity and authentication, data security). On the other hand, blockchain-based platforms are increasingly a target of malicious actors and could be used as an initial attack vector. Therefore, there is a case to be made weather further adoption of blockchain-based solutions should be encouraged or not from a security standpoint and if the overall potential for change could be net positive.","doi":"10.1109/ACITT.2019.8779855","publicationTitle":"2019 9th International Conference on Advanced Computer Information Technologies (ACIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2019 9th International Conference on Advanced Computer Information Technologies (ACIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8767904/8779853/08779855.pdf","startPage":"447","endPage":"451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACITT.2019.8779855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8779853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blockchain\u2019s Future Role in Cybersecurity.
