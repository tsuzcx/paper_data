As one can easily imagine, real-life devices are not ideal and information may leak through different physical channels.This paper gives a rigorous definition of leakage immunity and presents several leakage detection tests. In these tests, failure confirms the probable existence of secret-correlated emanations and indicates how likely the leakage is. Success does not refute the existence of emanations but indicates that significant emanations were not detected on the strength of the evidence presented, which of course, leaves the door open to reconsider the situation if further evidence comes to hand at a later date.","author":["Jean-Sebastien Coron","David Naccache","Paul Kocher"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 3","Issue 3","August 2004","pp   492\u2013508","https://doi.org/10.1145/1015047.1015050"],"date":"01 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"Anderson, R. and Kuhn, M. 1996.

Our divide phase produces a tree whose leaves are the elements of the set. For this phase, we use an efficient spectral algorithm. The merge phase quickly finds an optimal tree-respecting partition for many natural objective functions, e.g., k-means, min-diameter, min-sum, correlation clustering, etc., We present a meta-search engine that uses this methodology to cluster results from web searches.

One of the most commonly-used and successful recommendation algorithms is collaborative filtering, which explores the correlations within user-item interactions to infer user interests and preferences. However, the recommendation quality of collaborative filtering approaches is greatly limited by the data sparsity problem. To alleviate this problem we have previously proposed graph-based algorithms to explore transitive user-item associations. In this paper, we extend the idea of analyzing user-item interactions as graphs and employ link prediction approaches proposed in the recent network modeling literature for making collaborative filtering recommendations. We have adapted a wide range of linkage measures for making recommendations. Our preliminary experimental results based on a book recommendation dataset show that some of these measures achieved significantly better performance than standard collaborative filtering algorithms.","author":["Zan Huang","Xin Li","Hsinchun Chen"],"issue":["JCDL '05: Proceedings of the 5th ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on Digital libraries","June 2005","Pages   141\u2013142","https://doi.org/10.1145/1065385.1065415"],"date":"07 June 2005","ref":[{"text":"Adamic, L.A. and Adar, E.

Since circuit optimization effects the entire shape of the circuit delay distribution, it is difficult to capture the quality of a distribution with a single metric. Hence, we first introduce a new objective function that provides an effective measure for the quality of a delay distribution for both ASIC and high performance designs. We then propose an efficient and exact sensitivity based pruning algorithm based on a newly proposed theory of perturbation bounds. A heuristic approach for sensitivity computation which relies on efficient computation of statistical slack is then introduced. Finally, we show how the pruning and statistical slack based approaches can be combined to obtain nearly identical results compared with the brute-force approach but with an average run-time improvement of up to 89x. We also compare the optimization results against that of a deterministic optimizer and show an improvement up to 16% in the 99-percentile circuit delay and up to 31% in the standard deviation for the same circuit area.","author":["Aseem Agarwal","Kaviraj Chopra","David Blaauw","Vladimir Zolotov"],"issue":["DAC '05: Proceedings of the 42nd annual Design Automation Conference","June 2005","Pages   321\u2013324","https://doi.org/10.1145/1065579.1065663"],"date":"13 June 2005","ref":[{"text":"S.

We exploit the high computation power and memory bandwidth of graphics processors and present a new sorting algorithm that performs rasterization operations on the GPUs. We use sorting as the main computational component for histogram approximation and construction of \u03b5-approximate quantile and frequency summaries. Our algorithms for numerical statistics computation on data streams are deterministic, applicable to fixed or variable-sized sliding windows and use a limited memory footprint. We use GPU as a co-processor and minimize the data transmission between the CPU and GPU by taking into account the low bus bandwidth. We implemented our algorithms on a PC with a NVIDIA GeForce FX 6800 Ultra GPU and a 3.4 GHz Pentium IV CPU and applied them to large data streams consisting of more than 100 million values. We also compared the performance of our GPU-based algorithms with optimized implementations of prior CPU-based algorithms. Overall, our results demonstrate that the graphics processors available on a commodity computer system are efficient stream-processor and useful co-processors for mining data streams.","author":["Naga K.

We suggest a new fail-partial failure model for disks, which incorporates realistic localized faults such as latent sector errors and block corruption. We then develop and apply a novel failure-policy fingerprinting framework, to investigate how commodity file systems react to a range of more realistic disk failures. We classify their failure policies in a new taxonomy that measures their Internal RObustNess (IRON), which includes both failure detection and recovery techniques. We show that commodity file system failure policies are often inconsistent, sometimes buggy, and generally inadequate in their ability to recover from partial disk failures. Finally, we design, implement, and evaluate a prototype IRON file system, Linux ixt3, showing that techniques such as in-disk checksumming, replication, and parity greatly enhance file system robustness while incurring minimal time and space overheads.","author":["Vijayan Prabhakaran","Lakshmi N.

As high-capacity flash memory is becoming more affordable than ever, the dilemma of how to manage the RAM space or how to improve the access performance is emerging for many vendors. In this article, we propose a tree-based management scheme which adopts multiple granularities in flash-memory management. Our objective is to not only reduce the run-time RAM footprint but also manage the write workload, due to housekeeping. The proposed method was evaluated under realistic workloads, where significant advantages over existing approaches were observed, in terms of the RAM space, access performance, and flash-memory lifetime.","author":["Li-Pin Chang","Tei-Wei Kuo"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 1","Issue 4","November 2005","pp   381\u2013418","https://doi.org/10.1145/1111609.1111610"],"date":"01 November 2005","ref":[{"text":"Adelson-Velskii, G.

This paper proposes software-controlled fault tolerance, a concept allowing designers and users to tailor their performance and reliability for each situation. Several software-controllable fault-detection techniques are then presented: SWIFT, a software-only technique, and CRAFT, a suite of hybrid hardware/software techniques. Finally, the paper introduces PROFiT, a technique which adjusts the level of protection and performance at fine granularities through software control. When coupled with software-controllable techniques like SWIFT and CRAFT, PROFiT offers attractive and novel reliability options.","author":["George A.

Our alternative uses a hybrid model to de-emphasize tedious keyword entry in favor of iterative data filtering. We propose navigation and selection of hierarchical metadata (facet navigation), with incremental text entry to further narrow the results. We conducted a formative evaluation to understand the relative advantages of keyword entry versus facet navigation for both browse and search tasks on the phone. We found keyword entry to be more powerful when the name of the search target is known, while facet navigation is otherwise more effective and strongly preferred.","author":["Amy K.

This application discovers various 'semantic associations' between the reviewers and authors in a populated ontology to determine a degree of Conflict of Interest. This ontology was created by integrating entities and relationships from two social networks, namely \"knows,\" from a FOAF (Friend-of-a-Friend) social network and \"co-author,\" from the underlying co-authorship network of the DBLP bibliography. We describe our experiences developing this application in the context of a class of Semantic Web applications, which have important research and engineering challenges in common. In addition, we present an evaluation of our approach for real-life COI detection.","author":["Boanerges Aleman-Meza","Meenakshi Nagarajan","Cartic Ramakrishnan","Li Ding","Pranam Kolari","Amit P.

Conventional blind deconvolution methods typically assume frequency-domain constraints on images, or overly simplified parametric forms for the motion path during camera shake. Real camera motions can follow convoluted paths, and a spatial domain prior can better maintain visually salient image characteristics. We introduce a method to remove the effects of camera shake from seriously blurred images. The method assumes a uniform camera blur over the image and negligible in-plane camera rotation. In order to estimate the blur from the camera shake, the user must specify an image region without saturation effects. We show results for a variety of digital photographs taken from personal photo collections.","author":["Rob Fergus","Barun Singh","Aaron Hertzmann","Sam T. Roweis","William T.

Backwards Sequential Elimination (BSE) is a wrapper technique for attribute elimination that has proved effective at this task. We explore a new technique, Lazy Elimination (LE), which eliminates highly related attribute-values at classification time without the computational overheads inherent in wrapper techniques. We analyze the effect of LE and BSE on a state-of-the-art semi-naive Bayesian algorithm Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE). Our experiments show that LE significantly reduces bias and error without undue computation, while BSE significantly reduces bias but not error, with high training time complexity. In the context of AODE, LE has a significant advantage over BSE in both computational efficiency and error.","author":["Fei Zheng","Geoffrey I.

These implementations are time consuming to design and difficult to verify. A programmable hardware platform capable of supporting software implementations of the physical layer, or software defined radio, has a number of advantages. These include support for multiple protocols, faster time-to-market, higher chip volumes, and support for late implementation changes. The challenge is to achieve this without sacrificing power. In this paper, we present a design study for a fully programmable architecture, SODA, that supports software defined radio a high-end signal processing application. Our design achieves high performance, energy efficiency, and programmability through a combination of features that include single-instruction multiple- data (SIMD) parallelism, and hardware optimized for 16bit computations. The basic processing element is an asymmetric processor consisting of a scalar and SIMD pipeline, and a set of distributed scratchpad memories that are fully managed in software. Results show that a four processor design is capable of meeting the throughput requirements of theW-CDMA and 802.11a protocols, while operating within the strict power constraints of a mobile terminal.","author":["Yuan Lin","Hyunseok Lee","Mark Woh","Yoav Harel","Scott Mahlke","Trevor Mudge","Chaitali Chakrabarti","Krisztian Flautner"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 34","Issue 2","May 2006","pp   89\u2013101","https://doi.org/10.1145/1150019.1136494"],"date":"01 May 2006","ref":[{"text":"{1} ANSI/IEEE Std 802.11, 1999 Edition, Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications.","order":1},{"text":"{2} ARM Cortex-M3: http://www.arm.com/products/CPUs/ARM-Cortex- M3.html.","order":2},{"text":"{3} DSP Developers' Village, Texas Instruments: http://dspvillage.ti.com.","order":3},{"text":"{4} Predictive Technology Model: http://www.eas.asu.edu/ptm/.","order":4},{"text":"{5} QuickSilver Technology: http://www.qstech.com/.","order":5},{"text":"{6} J.

These applications involve a large number of examples n as well as a large number of features N, while each example has only s << N non-zero features. This paper presents a Cutting Plane Algorithm for training linear SVMs that provably has training time 0(s,n) for classification problems and o(sn log (n))for ordinal regression problems. The algorithm is based on an alternative, but equivalent formulation of the SVM optimization problem. Empirically, the Cutting-Plane Algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster than decomposition methods like svm light for large datasets.","author":["Thorsten Joachims"],"issue":["KDD '06: Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2006","Pages   217\u2013226","https://doi.org/10.1145/1150402.1150429"],"date":"20 August 2006","ref":[{"text":"R.

Specifically, these are codes accompanied with tests that make a constant number of (random) queries into any given word and reject non-codewords with probability proportional to their distance from the code.Locally testable codes are believed to be the combinatorial core of PCPs. However, the relation is less immediate than commonly believed. Nevertheless, we show that certain PCP systems can be modified to yield locally testable codes. On the other hand, we adapt techniques that we develop for the construction of the latter to yield new PCPs.Our main results are locally testable codes and PCPs of almost-linear length. Specifically, we prove the existence of the following constructs:---Locally testable binary (linear) codes in which k information bits are encoded by a codeword of length k \u22c5 exp(\u00d5(\u221a(log k))). This improves over previous results that either yield codewords of exponential length or obtained almost quadratic length codewords for sufficiently large nonbinary alphabet.---PCP systems of almost-linear length for SAT. The length of the proof is n \u22c5 exp(\u00d5(\u221a(log n))) and verification in performed by a constant number (i.e., 19) of queries, as opposed to previous results that used proof length n(1 + O(1/q)) for verification by q queries.The novel techniques in use include a random projection of certain codewords and PCP-oracles that preserves local-testability, an adaptation of PCP constructions to obtain \u201clinear PCP-oracles\u201d for proving conjunctions of linear conditions, and design of PCPs with some new soundness properties---a direct construction of locally testable (linear) codes of subexponential length.","author":["Oded Goldreich","Madhu Sudan"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 53","Issue 4","July 2006","pp   558\u2013655","https://doi.org/10.1145/1162349.1162351"],"date":"01 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"Alon, N., Kaufman, T., Krivelevich, M., Litsyn, S., and Ron, D. 2003.

Run-time reconfigurable embedded systems can deliver promising benefits over implementations in application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or microprocessors. These systems can often provide substantially more computational power than microprocessors and support higher exibility than ASICs. The compilation of hardware during run time, however, can add significant run-time overhead to these systems. We introduce a novel compilation technique called incremental elaboration, which enables circuits to be dynamically generated during run time. We propose a set-based model for incremental elaboration, and explain how it can be used in the hardware compilation process. Our approach is illustrated by various designs, particulary those for pattern matching and shape-adaptive template matching.","author":["Arran Derbyshire","Tobias Becker","Wayne Luk"],"issue":["CASES '06: Proceedings of the 2006 international conference on Compilers, architecture and synthesis for embedded systems","October 2006","Pages   93\u2013102","https://doi.org/10.1145/1176760.1176773"],"date":"22 October 2006","ref":[{"text":"T.

This restriction is due to the static nature of the acceleration structures used. While the best reported frame rates for static geometric models have been achieved using carefully constructed kd-trees, this article shows that bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs) can be used to efficiently ray trace large static models.More importantly, the BVH can be used to ray trace deformable models (sets of triangles whose positions change over time) with little loss of performance. A variety of efficiency techniques are used to achieve this performance, but three algorithmic changes to the typical BVH algorithm are mainly responsible. First, the BVH is built using a variant of the surface area heuristic conventionally used to build kd-trees. Second, the topology of the BVH is not changed over time so that only the bounding volumes need to be refit from frame-to-frame. Third, and most importantly, packets of rays are traced together through the BVH using a novel integrated packet-frustum traversal scheme. This traversal scheme elegantly combines the advantages of both packet traversal and frustum traversal and allows for rapid hierarchy descent for packets that hit bounding volumes as well as rapid exits for packets that miss. A BVH-based ray tracing system using these techniques is shown to achieve performance for deformable models comparable to that previously available only for static models.","author":["Ingo Wald","Solomon Boulos","Peter Shirley"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 26","Issue 1","January 2007","pp   6\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.1145/1189762.1206075"],"date":"01 January 2007","ref":[{"text":"Adams, B., Keiser, R., Pauly, M., Guibas, L.

We are considering a cell library composed of several templates (3-5) for each type of cell. These templates differ in area, driving capabilities, intrinsic delay, and capacitive loading. When realizing a logically synthesized circuit, we select the best templates from the cell library to minimize the total area of the cells under delay constraints. We have found a very successful heuristic approach to attack this discrete optimization problem.\nExperimental results show that this approach runs very fast, with the complexity of \u039f(n2), and improves the results obtained from the technology mapping of misII.

Recent studies have attempted to reduce leakage power using integrated architecture and compiler power-gating mechanisms. This approach involves compilers inserting instructions into programs to shut down and wake up components, as appropriate. While early studies showed this approach to be effective, there are concerns about the large amount of power-control instructions being added to programs due to the increasing amount of components equipped with power-gating controls in SoC design platforms. In this article we present a sink-n-hoist framework for a compiler to generate balanced scheduling of power-gating instructions. Our solution attempts to merge several power-gating instructions into a single compound instruction, thereby reducing the amount of power-gating instructions issued. We performed experiments by incorporating our compiler analysis and scheduling policies into SUIF compiler tools and by simulating the energy consumption using Wattch toolkits. The experimental results demonstrate that our mechanisms are effective in reducing the amount of power-gating instructions while further reducing leakage power compared to previous methods.","author":["Yi-Ping You","Chung-Wen Huang","Jenq Kuen Lee"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 12","Issue 4","September 2007","pp   51\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.1145/1278349.1278364"],"date":"01 September 2007","ref":[{"text":"Bellas, N., Hajj, I.

This approach has been shown to be successful in identifying similar documents across languages - or more precisely, retrieving the most similar document in one language to a query in another language. However, the approach has severe drawbacks when applied to a related task, that of clustering documents \"language-independently\", so that documents about similar topics end up closest to one another in the semantic space regardless of their language. The problem is that documents are generally more similar to other documents in the same language than they are to documents in a different language, but on the same topic. As a result, when using multilingual LSA, documents will in practice cluster by language, not by topic. We propose a novel application of PARAFAC2 (which is a variant of PARAFAC, a multi-way generalization of the singular value decomposition [SVD]) to overcome this problem. Instead of forming a single multilingual term-by-document matrix which, under LSA, is subjected to SVD, we form an irregular three-way array, each slice of which is a separate term-by-document matrix for a single language in the parallel corpus. The goal is to compute an SVD for each language such that V (the matrix of right singular vectors) is the same across all languages. Effectively, PARAFAC2 imposes the constraint, not present in standard LSA, that the \"concepts\" in all documents in the parallel corpus are the same regardless of language. Intuitively, this constraint makes sense, since the whole purpose of using a parallel corpus is that exactly the same concepts are expressed in the translations. We tested this approach by comparing the performance of PARAFAC2 with standard LSA in solving a particular CLIR problem. From our results, we conclude that PARAFAC2 offers a very promising alternative to LSA not only for multilingual document clustering, but also for solving other problems in cross-language information retrieval.","author":["Peter A.

This paper looks at power dissipation too, but also considers the circuitry needed to drive a computation. Initial results are very encouraging and indicate that clocked magnetic logic could - in the worst case - match equivalent low power CMOS circuits and - in the best-case - potentially provide more than 2 orders of magnitude improvement when one considers energy per operation.","author":["M.

They require an efficient index structure to locate a particular item quickly from a huge amount of directory entries or database records. This paper proposes \u03bc-Tree, a new ordered index structure tailored to the characteristics of NAND flash memory. \u03bc-Tree is a balanced tree similar to B+-Tree. In \u03bc-Tree, however, all the nodes along the path from the root to the leaf are put together into a single flash memory page in order to minimize the number of flash write operations when a leaf node is updated. Our experimental evaluation shows that \u03bc-Tree outperforms B+-Tree by up to 28% for traces extracted from real workloads. With a small in-memory cache of 8 Kbytes, \u03bc-Tree improves the overall performance by up to 90% compared to B+-Tree with the same cache size.","author":["Dongwon Kang","Dawoon Jung","Jeong-Uk Kang","Jin-Soo Kim"],"issue":["EMSOFT '07: Proceedings of the 7th ACM & IEEE international conference on Embedded software","September 2007","Pages   144\u2013153","https://doi.org/10.1145/1289927.1289953"],"date":"30 September 2007","ref":[{"text":"A.

By examining many samples of human-produced translation, SMT algorithms automatically learn how to translate. SMT has made tremendous strides in less than two decades, and new ideas are constantly introduced. This survey presents a tutorial overview of the state of the art. We describe the context of the current research and then move to a formal problem description and an overview of the main subproblems: translation modeling, parameter estimation, and decoding. Along the way, we present a taxonomy of some different approaches within these areas. We conclude with an overview of evaluation and a discussion of future directions.","author":["Adam Lopez"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 40","Issue 3","August 2008","Article No.: 8","pp   1\u201349","https://doi.org/10.1145/1380584.1380586"],"date":"13 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"Aho, A.

The network architecture typically consists of a tree of routing and switching elements with progressively more specialized and expensive equipment moving up the network hierarchy. Unfortunately, even when deploying the highest-end IP switches/routers, resulting topologies may only support 50% of the aggregate bandwidth available at the edge of the network, while still incurring tremendous cost. Non-uniform bandwidth among data center nodes complicates application design and limits overall system performance.In this paper, we show how to leverage largely commodity Ethernet switches to support the full aggregate bandwidth of clusters consisting of tens of thousands of elements. Similar to how clusters of commodity computers have largely replaced more specialized SMPs and MPPs, we argue that appropriately architected and interconnected commodity switches may deliver more performance at less cost than available from today's higher-end solutions. Our approach requires no modifications to the end host network interface, operating system, or applications; critically, it is fully backward compatible with Ethernet, IP, and TCP.","author":["Mohammad Al-Fares","Alexander Loukissas","Amin Vahdat"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 38","Issue 4","October 2008","pp   63\u201374","https://doi.org/10.1145/1402946.1402967"],"date":"17 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"Cisco Data Center Infrastructure 2.5 Design Guide. http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/solution/dcidg21.pdf.","order":1},{"text":"InfiniBand Architecture Specification Volume 1, Release 1.0. http://www.infinibandta.org/specs.","order":2},{"text":"Juniper J-Flow. http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/software/erx/junose61/swconfig-routing-vol1/html/ip-jflow-stats-config2.html.","order":3},{"text":"Sun Datacenter Switch 3456 Architecture White Paper. http://www.sun.com/products/networking/datacenter/ds3456/ds3456_wp.pdf.","order":4},{"text":"M.

Optimus compiles programs written in a high level streaming language to either software or hardware implementations. The compiler uses a hierarchical compilation strategy that separates concerns between macro- and micro-functional requirements. Macro-functional concerns address how components (modules) are assembled to implement larger more complex applications. Micro-functional issues deal with synthesis issues of the module internals. Optimus thus allows software developers who lack deep hardware design expertise to transparently leverage the advantages of hardware customization without crossing the semantic gap between high level languages and hardware description languages. Optimus generates streaming hardware that achieves on average 40x speedup over our baseline embedded processor for a fraction of the energy. Additionally, our results show that streaming-specific optimizations can further improve performance by 255% and reduce the area requirements by 16% in average. These designs are competitive with Handel-C implementations for some of the same benchmarks.","author":["Amir Hormati","Manjunath Kudlur","Scott Mahlke","David Bacon","Rodric Rabbah"],"issue":["CASES '08: Proceedings of the 2008 international conference on Compilers, architectures and synthesis for embedded systems","October 2008","Pages   41\u201350","https://doi.org/10.1145/1450095.1450105"],"date":"19 October 2008","ref":[{"text":"AMD torrenza architecture, 2008. http://enterprise.amd.com/us-en/AMDBusiness/Technology-Home/Torrenza.aspx.","order":1},{"text":"Intel quickassist technology, 2008. http://www.intel.com/technology/platforms/quickassist/index.htm.","order":2},{"text":"K.

While there is much research on the integration of heterogeneous information systems, most commercial systems stop short of the actual integration of available data. Data fusion is the process of fusing multiple records representing the same real-world object into a single, consistent, and clean representation.This article places data fusion into the greater context of data integration, precisely defines the goals of data fusion, namely, complete, concise, and consistent data, and highlights the challenges of data fusion, namely, uncertain and conflicting data values. We give an overview and classification of different ways of fusing data and present several techniques based on standard and advanced operators of the relational algebra and SQL. Finally, the article features a comprehensive survey of data integration systems from academia and industry, showing if and how data fusion is performed in each.","author":["Jens Bleiholder","Felix Naumann"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 41","Issue 1","January 2009","Article No.: 1","pp   1\u201341","https://doi.org/10.1145/1456650.1456651"],"date":"15 January 2009","ref":[{"text":"Adali, S., Candan, K.

This paper describes a new version of the toolset that includes four significant features: first, it now supports a broad range of single-driver routing architectures [29, 4, 16]. Single-driver routing has significantly different architectural and electrical properties from the multi-driver approach previously modelled, and is now employed in the majority of FPGAs sold. Second, the new release can now model a heterogeneous selection of hard logic blocks, which could include the hard memory and multipliers that are now ubiquitous in FPGAs. Third, we provide optimized electrical models of a wide range of architectures in different process technologies, including a range of area-delay tradeoffs for each single architecture. Prior releases of VPR did not publish even one architecture file with accurate resistance and capacitance parameters. Finally, to maintain robustness and to support future development the release includes a set of regression tests to check functionality and quality of result of the output of the tools. To illustrate the use of the new features, we present a new look at the FPGA area vs. logic block LUT size question that shows that small LUT sizes, with the use of carefully optimized electrical design and single-driver architectures, have better area (relative to 4-LUTs) than previously thought. Another experiment shows that several of the previous architectural results are invariant in moving from multi-driver to single-driver routing architecture and across a range of process technologies.","author":["Jason Luu","Ian Kuon","Peter Jamieson","Ted Campbell","Andy Ye","Wei Mark Fang","Jonathan Rose"],"issue":["FPGA '09: Proceedings of the ACM/SIGDA international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2009","Pages   133\u2013142","https://doi.org/10.1145/1508128.1508150"],"date":"22 February 2009","ref":[{"text":"International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors 2007 Edition, December 2007. http://www.itrs.net/reports.html.","order":1},{"text":"E.

Traditional multi-level SRAM-based cache hierarchies, especially in the context of chip multiprocessors (CMPs), present many challenges in area requirements, core-to-cache balance, power consumption, and design complexity. New advancements in technology enable caches to be built from other technologies, such as Embedded DRAM (EDRAM), Magnetic RAM (MRAM), and Phase-change RAM (PRAM), in both 2D chips or 3D stacked chips. Caches fabricated in these technologies offer dramatically different power and performance characteristics when compared with SRAM-based caches, particularly in the areas of access latency, cell density, and overall power consumption. In this paper, we propose to take advantage of the best characteristics that each technology offers, through the use of Hybrid Cache Architecture (HCA) designs. We discuss and evaluate two types of hybrid cache architectures: inter cache Level HCA (LHCA), in which the levels in a cache hierarchy can be made of disparate memory technologies; and intra cache level or cache Region based HCA (RHCA), where a single level of cache can be partitioned into multiple regions, each of a different memory technology. We have studied a number of different HCA architectures and explored the potential of hardware support for intra-cache data movement and power consumption management within HCA caches. Utilizing a full-system simulator that has been validated against real hardware, we demonstrate that an LHCA design can provide a geometric mean 7% IPC improvement over a baseline 3-level SRAM cache design under the same area constraint across a collection of 25 workloads. A more aggressive RHCA-based design provides 12% IPC improvement over the baseline. Finally, a 2-layer 3D cache stack (3DHCA) of high density memory technology within the same chip footprint gives 18% IPC improvement over the baseline. Furthermore, up to 70% reduction in power consumption over a baseline SRAM-only design is achieved.","author":["Xiaoxia Wu","Jian Li","Lixin Zhang","Evan Speight","Ram Rajamony","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 37","Issue 3","June 2009","pp   34\u201345","https://doi.org/10.1145/1555815.1555761"],"date":"20 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"D.

Programming thousands of massively parallel threads is a big challenge for software engineers, but understanding the performance bottlenecks of those parallel programs on GPU architectures to improve application performance is even more difficult. Current approaches rely on programmers to tune their applications by exploiting the design space exhaustively without fully understanding the performance characteristics of their applications.To provide insights into the performance bottlenecks of parallel applications on GPU architectures, we propose a simple analytical model that estimates the execution time of massively parallel programs. The key component of our model is estimating the number of parallel memory requests (we call this the memory warp parallelism) by considering the number of running threads and memory bandwidth. Based on the degree of memory warp parallelism, the model estimates the cost of memory requests, thereby estimating the overall execution time of a program. Comparisons between the outcome of the model and the actual execution time in several GPUs show that the geometric mean of absolute error of our model on micro-benchmarks is 5.4% and on GPU computing applications is 13.3%. All the applications are written in the CUDA programming language.","author":["Sunpyo Hong","Hyesoon Kim"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 37","Issue 3","June 2009","pp   152\u2013163","https://doi.org/10.1145/1555815.1555775"],"date":"20 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"ATI Mobility RadeonTM HD4850/4870 Graphics-Overview. http://ati.amd.com/products/radeonhd4800.","order":1},{"text":"Intel Core2 Quad Processors. http://www.intel.com/products/processor/core2quad.","order":2},{"text":"NVIDIA GeForce series GTX280, 8800GTX, 8800GT. http://www.nvidia.com/geforce.","order":3},{"text":"NVIDIA Quadro FX5600. http://www.nvidia.com/quadro.","order":4},{"text":"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Specifically, we consider the Netflix Prize data set, and its leading algorithms, adapted to the framework of differential privacy. Unlike prior privacy work concerned with cryptographically securing the computation of recommendations, differential privacy constrains a computation in a way that precludes any inference about the underlying records from its output. Such algorithms necessarily introduce uncertainty--i.e., noise--to computations, trading accuracy for privacy. We find that several of the leading approaches in the Netflix Prize competition can be adapted to provide differential privacy, without significantly degrading their accuracy. To adapt these algorithms, we explicitly factor them into two parts, an aggregation/learning phase that can be performed with differential privacy guarantees, and an individual recommendation phase that uses the learned correlations and an individual's data to provide personalized recommendations. The adaptations are non-trivial, and involve both careful analysis of the per-record sensitivity of the algorithms to calibrate noise, as well as new post-processing steps to mitigate the impact of this noise. We measure the empirical trade-off between accuracy and privacy in these adaptations, and find that we can provide non-trivial formal privacy guarantees while still outperforming the Cinematch baseline Netflix provides.","author":["Frank McSherry","Ilya Mironov"],"issue":["KDD '09: Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","June 2009","Pages   627\u2013636","https://doi.org/10.1145/1557019.1557090"],"date":"28 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"C.

It is fair to say that SQL and the various implementations of RDBMSs became the backbone of enterprise systems. In those days. we believed that business planning, transaction processing and analytics should reside in one single system. Despite the incredible improvements in computer hardware, high-speed networks, display devices and the associated software, speed and flexibility remained an issue. The nature of RDBMSs, being organized along rows, prohibited us from providing instant analytical insight and finally led to the introduction of so-called data warehouses. This paper will question some of the fundamentals of the OLAP and OLTP separation. Based on the analysis of real customer environments and experience in some prototype implementations, a new proposal for an enterprise data management concept will be presented. In our proposal, the participants in enterprise applications, customers, orders, accounting documents, products, employees etc. will be modeled as objects and also stored and maintained as such. Despite that, the vast majority of business functions will operate on an in memory representation of their objects. Using the relational algebra and a column-based organization of data storage will allow us to revolutionize transactional applications while providing an optimal platform for analytical data processing. The unification of OLTP and OLAP workloads on a shared architecture and the reintegration of planning activities promise significant gains in application development while simplifying enterprise systems drastically. The latest trends in computer technology -- e.g. blade architecture, multiple CPUs per blade with multiple cores per CPU allow for a significant parallelization of application processes. The organization of data in columns supports the parallel use of cores for filtering and aggregation. Elements of application logic can be implemented as highly efficient stored procedures operating on columns. The vast increase in main memory combined with improvements in L1--, L2--, L3--caching, together with the high data compression rate column storage will allow us to support substantial data volumes on one single blade. Distributing data across multiple blades using a shared nothing approach provides further scalability.","author":["Hasso Plattner"],"issue":["SIGMOD '09: Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data","June 2009","Pages   1\u20132","https://doi.org/10.1145/1559845.1559846"],"date":"29 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"D.J.

The methods are illustrated in a broad domain: answering general-knowledge questions using an on-line encyclopedia.\nA closed-class question is a question stated in natural language, which assumes some definite answer typified by a noun phrase rather than a procedural answer. The methods hypothesize noun phrases that are likely to be the answer, and present the user with relevant text in which they are marked, focussing the user's attention appropriately. Furthermore, the sentences of matching text that are shown to the user are selected to confirm phrase relations implied by the question, rather than being selected solely on the basis of word  frequency.\nThe corpus is accessed via an information retrieval (IR) system that supports boolean search with proximity constraints. Queries are automatically constructed from the phrasal content of the question, and passed to the IR system to find relevant text. Then the relevant text is itself analyzed; noun phrase hypotheses are extracted and new queries are independently made to confirm phrase relations for the various hypotheses.\nThe methods are currently being implemented in a system called MURAX and although this process is not complete, it is sufficiently advanced for an interim evaluation to be presented.","author":["Julian Kupiec"],"issue":["SIGIR '93: Proceedings of the 16th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval","July 1993","Pages   181\u2013190","https://doi.org/10.1145/160688.160717"],"date":"01 July 1993","ref":[{"text":"D.R.

However, new byte-addressable, persistent memory technologies such as phase change memory (PCM) offer fast, fine-grained access to persistent storage. In this paper, we present a file system and a hardware architecture that are designed around the properties of persistent, byteaddressable memory. Our file system, BPFS, uses a new technique called short-circuit shadow paging to provide atomic, fine-grained updates to persistent storage. As a result, BPFS provides strong reliability guarantees and offers better performance than traditional file systems, even when both are run on top of byte-addressable, persistent memory. Our hardware architecture enforces atomicity and ordering guarantees required by BPFS while still providing the performance benefits of the L1 and L2 caches. Since these memory technologies are not yet widely available, we evaluate BPFS on DRAM against NTFS on both a RAM disk and a traditional disk. Then, we use microarchitectural simulations to estimate the performance of BPFS on PCM. Despite providing strong safety and consistency guarantees, BPFS on DRAM is typically twice as fast as NTFS on a RAM disk and 4-10 times faster than NTFS on disk. We also show that BPFS on PCM should be significantly faster than a traditional disk-based file system.","author":["Jeremy Condit","Edmund B.

In this work, we propose a novel application of a key-based obfuscation technique to achieve security against hardware Trojans. The obfuscation scheme is based on modifying the state transition function of a given circuit by expanding its reachable state space and enabling it to operate in two distinct modes -- the normal mode and the obfuscated mode. Such a modification obfuscates the rareness of the internal circuit nodes, thus making it difficult for an adversary to insert hard-to-detect Trojans. It also makes some inserted Trojans benign by making them activate only in the obfuscated mode. The combined effect leads to higher Trojan detectability and higher level of protection against such attack. Simulation results for a set of benchmark circuits show that the scheme is capable of achieving high levels of security at modest design overhead.","author":["Rajat Subhra Chakraborty","Swarup Bhunia"],"issue":["ICCAD '09: Proceedings of the 2009 International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2009","Pages   113\u2013116","https://doi.org/10.1145/1687399.1687424"],"date":"02 November 2009","ref":[{"text":"S.

This paper argues for a new approach to datacenter storage called RAMCloud, where information is kept entirely in DRAM and large-scale systems are created by aggregating the main memories of thousands of commodity servers. We believe that RAMClouds can provide durable and available storage with 100-1000x the throughput of disk-based systems and 100-1000x lower access latency. The combination of low latency and large scale will enable a new breed of dataintensive applications.","author":["John Ousterhout","Parag Agrawal","David Erickson","Christos Kozyrakis","Jacob Leverich","David Mazi\u00e8res","Subhasish Mitra","Aravind Narayanan","Guru Parulkar","Mendel Rosenblum","Stephen M.

Despite the promising physical characteristics of storage-class memory, its scale is an order of magnitude smaller than the current storage device scale. This fact makes it less than desirable for use as an independent storage device. We carefully analyze in-memory and on-disk file system objects in a log-structured file system, and exploit memory and storage aspects of the storage-class memory to overcome the drawbacks of the current log-structured file system. FRASH provides a hybrid view storage-class memory. It harbors an in-memory data structure as well as a on-disk structure. It provides nonvolatility to key data structures which have been maintained in-memory in a legacy log-structured file system. This approach greatly improves the mount latency and effectively resolves the robustness issue. By maintaining on-disk structure in storage-class memory, FRASH provides byte-addressability to the file system object and metadata for page, and subsequently greatly improves the I/O performance compared to the legacy log-structured approach. While storage-class memory offers byte granularity, it is still far slower than its DRAM counter part. We develop a copy-on-mount technique to overcome the access latency difference between main memory and storage-class memory. Our file system was able to reduce the mount time by 92% and file system I/O performance was increased by 16%.","author":["Jaemin Jung","Youjip Won","Eunki Kim","Hyungjong Shin","Byeonggil Jeon"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 6","Issue 1","March 2010","Article No.: 3","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/1714454.1714457"],"date":"05 April 2010","ref":[{"text":"Bityuckiy, A.

These cameras extend DOF by deblurring a captured image with a single spatially-invariant PSF. For these cameras, the quality of recovered images depends both on the magnitude of the PSF spectrum (MTF) of the camera, and the similarity between PSFs at different depths. While researchers have compared the MTFs of different extended DOF cameras, relatively little attention has been paid to evaluating their depth invariances. In this paper, we compare the depth invariance of several cameras, and introduce a new camera that improves in this regard over existing designs, while still maintaining a good MTF.Our technique utilizes a novel optical element placed in the pupil plane of an imaging system. Whereas previous approaches use optical elements characterized by their amplitude or phase profile, our approach utilizes one whose behavior is characterized by its scattering properties. Such an element is commonly referred to as an optical diffuser, and thus we refer to our new approach as diffusion coding. We show that diffusion coding can be analyzed in a simple and intuitive way by modeling the effect of a diffuser as a kernel in light field space. We provide detailed analysis of diffusion coded cameras and show results from an implementation using a custom designed diffuser.","author":["Oliver Cossairt","Changyin Zhou","Shree Nayar"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 29","Issue 4","July 2010","Article No.: 31","pp   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/1778765.1778768"],"date":"26 July 2010","ref":[{"text":"Ashok, A., and Neifeld, M. 2003.

Many global illumination methods such as path tracing and photon mapping use ray tracing and generate lots of rays to simulate various realistic visual effects. However, these rays tend to be very incoherent and show lower cache utilizations during ray tracing of models. In order to address this problem and improve the ray coherence, we propose a novel Hit Point Heuristic (HPH) to compute a coherent ordering of rays. The HPH uses the hit points between rays and the scene as a ray reordering measure. We reorder rays by using a space-filling curve based on their hit points. Since a hit point of a ray is available only after performing the ray intersection test with the scene, we compute an approximate hit point for the ray by performing an intersection test between the ray and simplified representations of the original models. Our method is a highly modular approach, since our reordering method is decoupled from other components of common ray tracing systems. We apply our method to photon mapping and path tracing and achieve more than an order of magnitude performance improvement for massive models that cannot fit into main memory, compared to rendering without reordering rays. Also, our method shows a performance improvement even for ray tracing small models that can fit into main memory. This performance improvement for small and massive models is caused by reducing cache misses occurring between different memory levels including the L1/L2 caches, main memory, and disk. This result demonstrates the cache-oblivious nature of our method, which works for various kinds of cache parameters. Because of the cache-obliviousness and the high modularity, our method can be widely applied to many existing ray tracing systems and show performance improvements with various models and machines that have different cache parameters.","author":["Bochang Moon","Yongyoung Byun","Tae-Joon Kim","Pio Claudio","Hye-Sun Kim","Yun-Ji Ban","Seung Woo Nam","Sung-Eui Yoon"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 29","Issue 3","June 2010","Article No.: 28","pp   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/1805964.1805972"],"date":"02 July 2010","ref":[{"text":"Arge, L., Brodal, G.

This burden is especially troublesome when it comes to optimizing software on modern computing systems. Autonomic or adaptive computing has been proposed as one method to help application programmers handle this complexity. In an autonomic computing environment, system services monitor applications and automatically adapt their behavior to increase the performance of the applications they support. Unfortunately, applications often run as performance black-boxes and adaptive services must infer application performance from low-level information or rely on system-specific ad hoc methods. This paper proposes a standard framework, Application Heartbeats, which applications can use to communicate both their current and target performance and which autonomic services can use to query these values. The Application Heartbeats framework is designed around the well-known idea of a heartbeat. At important points in the program, the application registers a heartbeat. In addition, the interface allows applications to express their performance in terms of a desired heart rate and/or a desired latency between specially tagged heartbeats. Thus, the interface provides a standard method for an application to directly communicate its performance and goals while allowing autonomic services access to this information. Thus, Heartbeat-enabled applications are no longer performance black-boxes. This paper presents the Applications Heartbeats interface, characterizes two reference implementations (one suitable for clusters and one for multicore), and illustrates the use of Heartbeats with several examples of systems adapting behavior based on feedback from heartbeats.","author":["Henry Hoffmann","Jonathan Eastep","Marco D.

One approach that tries to address this problem is that of counterexample guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR), wherein one starts with a coarse abstraction of the system, and progressively refines it, based on invalid counterexamples seen in prior model checking runs, until either an abstraction proves the correctness of the system or a valid counterexample is generated. While CEGAR has been successfully used in verifying nonprobabilistic systems automatically, CEGAR has only recently been investigated in the context of probabilistic systems. The main issues that need to be tackled in order to extend the approach to probabilistic systems is a suitable notion of \u201ccounterexample\u201d, algorithms to generate counterexamples, check their validity, and then automatically refine an abstraction based on an invalid counterexample. In this article, we address these issues, and present a CEGAR framework for Markov decision processes.","author":["Rohit Chadha","Mahesh Viswanathan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Computational Logic","Volume 12","Issue 1","October 2010","Article No.: 1","pp   1\u201349","https://doi.org/10.1145/1838552.1838553"],"date":"26 November 2010","ref":[{"text":"Aljazzar, H., Hermanns, H., and Leue, S. 2005.

Moreover, RNA sequences are populating genome databases at a pace unmatched by gains in standard processor performance. While software tools such as Infernal can efficiently find homologies among RNA families and genome databases of modest size, the continuous advent of new RNA families and the explosive growth in volume of RNA sequences necessitate a faster approach.This work introduces two different architectures for accelerating the task of finding homologous RNA molecules in a genome database. The first architecture takes advantage of the tree-like configuration of the covariance models used to represent the consensus secondary structure of an RNA family and converts it directly into a highly-pipelined processing engine. Results for this architecture show a 24\u00d7 speedup over Infernal when processing a small RNA model. It is estimated that the architecture could potentially offer several thousands of times speedup over Infernal on larger models, provided that there are sufficient hardware resources available.The second architecture is introduced to address the steep resource requirements of the first architecture.

The first wave of proposals focused on designing pure packet-switched networks that provide full bisection bandwidth. However, these proposals significantly increase network complexity in terms of the number of links and switches required and the restricted rules to wire them up. On the other hand, optical circuit switching technology holds a very large bandwidth advantage over packet switching technology. This fact motivates us to explore how optical circuit switching technology could benefit a data center network. In particular, we propose a hybrid packet and circuit switched data center network architecture (or HyPaC for short) which augments the traditional hierarchy of packet switches with a high speed, low complexity, rack-to-rack optical circuit-switched network to supply high bandwidth to applications. We discuss the fundamental requirements of this hybrid architecture and their design options. To demonstrate the potential benefits of the hybrid architecture, we have built a prototype system called c-Through. c-Through represents a design point where the responsibility for traffic demand estimation and traffic demultiplexing resides in end hosts, making it compatible with existing packet switches. Our emulation experiments show that the hybrid architecture can provide large benefits to unmodified popular data center applications at a modest scale. Furthermore, our experimental experience provides useful insights on the applicability of the hybrid architecture across a range of deployment scenarios.","author":["Guohui Wang","David G.

Ocelot includes a dynamic binary translator from Parallel Thread eXecution ISA (PTX) to many-core processors that leverages the Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) code generator to target x86 and other ISAs. The dynamic compiler is able to execute existing CUDA binaries without recompilation from source and supports switching between execution on an NVIDIA GPU and a many-core CPU at runtime. It has been validated against over 130 applications taken from the CUDA SDK, the UIUC Parboil benchmarks [1], the Virginia Rodinia benchmarks [2], the GPU-VSIPL signal and image processing library [3], the Thrust library [4], and several domain specific applications. This paper presents a high level overview of the implementation of the Ocelot dynamic compiler highlighting design decisions and trade-offs, and showcasing their effect on application performance. Several novel code transformations are explored that are applicable only when compiling explicitly parallel applications and traditional dynamic compiler optimizations are revisited for this new class of applications. This study is expected to inform the design of compilation tools for explicitly parallel programming models (such as OpenCL) as well as future CPU and GPU architectures.","author":["Gregory Frederick Diamos","Andrew Robert Kerr","Sudhakar Yalamanchili","Nathan Clark"],"issue":["PACT '10: Proceedings of the 19th international conference on Parallel architectures and compilation techniques","September 2010","Pages   353\u2013364","https://doi.org/10.1145/1854273.1854318"],"date":"11 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"}}IMPACT, \"The parboil benchmark suite,\" 2007..","order":1},{"text":"}}S.

In this article, direct NCT-based synthesis of a given k-cycle in a cycle-based synthesis scenario is examined. To this end, a set of seven building blocks is proposed that reveals the potential of direct synthesis of a given permutation to reduce both quantum cost and average runtime. To synthesize a given large cycle, we propose a decomposition algorithm to extract the suggested building blocks from the input specification. Then, a synthesis method is introduced that uses the building blocks and the decomposition algorithm. Finally, a hybrid synthesis framework is suggested that uses the proposed cycle-based synthesis method in conjunction with one of the recent NCT-based synthesis approaches which is based on Reed-Muller (RM) spectra.The time complexity and the effectiveness of the proposed synthesis approach are analyzed in detail. Our analyses show that the proposed hybrid framework leads to a better quantum cost in the worst-case scenario compared to the previously presented methods. The proposed framework always converges and typically synthesizes a given specification very fast compared to the available synthesis algorithms. Besides, the quantum costs of benchmark functions are improved about 20% on average (55% in the best case).","author":["Mehdi Saeedi","Morteza Saheb Zamani","Mehdi Sedighi","Zahra Sasanian"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 6","Issue 4","December 2010","Article No.: 13","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/1877745.1877747"],"date":"21 December 2010","ref":[{"text":"Barenco, A., Bennett, C., Cleve, R., DiVincenzo, D., Margolus, N., Shor, P., Sleator, T., Smolin, J., and Weinfurter, H. 1995.

In this paper, we directly address the last two problems by introducing intermediate fabrics, which are virtual reconfigurable architectures specialized for different application domains, implemented on top of commercial-off-the-shelf devices. Such specialization enables near-instantaneous placement and routing by hiding the complexity of fine-grained physical devices, while also enabling circuit portability across all devices that implement the intermediate fabric. When combined with existing work on runtime synthesis from software binaries, intermediate fabrics reduce the effects of all three problems by enabling transparent usage of COTS FPGAs by software designers. In this paper, we explore intermediate fabric architectures using specialization techniques to minimize area and performance overhead of the virtual fabric while maximizing routability and speedup of placement and routing. We present results showing an average placement and routing speedup of 554x, with an average area overhead of 10% and clock overhead of 18%, which corresponds to an average frequency of 195 MHz.","author":["James Coole","Greg Stitt"],"issue":["CODES/ISSS '10: Proceedings of the eighth IEEE/ACM/IFIP international conference on Hardware/software codesign and system synthesis","October 2010","Pages   13\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/1878961.1878966"],"date":"24 October 2010","ref":[{"text":"P.

While previous work in the areas of both Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and hypermedia system usability can contribute a considerable amount to the development of such guidelines, we believe that the use of multiple output media demands an understanding of particular characteristics and limitations of users' attentional capabilities. This paper presents some initial guidelines for the design of usable multimedia systems. These guidelines are based on empirical findings regarding the nature of human attention derived from the field of experimental psychology. We believe that the provision of such guidelines for multimedia interface design will support designers in achieving the dual goals of maximising a user's flexibility in controlling the presentation of multiple concurrent media, while keeping cognitive load to an acceptable level.","author":["M.

Mementos is a software system that transforms general-purpose programs into interruptible computations that are protected from frequent power losses by automatic, energy-aware state checkpointing. Mementos comprises a collection of optimization passes for the LLVM compiler infrastructure and a linkable library that exercises hardware support for energy measurement while managing state checkpoints stored in nonvolatile memory. We evaluate Mementos against diverse test cases in a trace-driven simulator of transiently powered RFID-scale devices. Although Mementos's energy checks increase run time when energy is plentiful, they allow Mementos to safely suspend execution when energy dwindles, effectively spreading computation across zero or more power failures. This paper's contributions are: a study of the runtime environment for programs on RFID-scale devices; an energy-aware state checkpointing system for these devices that is implemented for the MSP430 family of microcontrollers; and a trace-driven simulator of transiently powered RFID-scale devices.","author":["Benjamin Ransford","Jacob Sorber","Kevin Fu"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 39","Issue 1","March 2011","pp   159\u2013170","https://doi.org/10.1145/1961295.1950386"],"date":"05 March 2011","ref":[{"text":"W.

The drawbacks of PCM include limited write endurance and high power consumption for write operations (upto 10x in comparison to read operations). In this paper, we investigate new techniques that would perform writes to PCM with energy awareness. Our results show that we can minimize the write energy consumption by up to 8.1x by simply converting PCM native writes to read-before-write, and upto an additional 22.9% via intelligent out-of-position updates.","author":["Jie Chen","Ron C.

In contrast, in this paper, we present a unified framework that automatically optimizes the combination of information sources used for effective query formulation. The proposed framework produces fully weighted and expanded queries that are both more effective and more compact than those produced by the current state-of-the-art query expansion and weighting methods. We conduct an empirical evaluation of our framework for both newswire and web corpora. In all cases, our combination of multiple information sources for query formulation is found to be more effective than using any single source. The proposed query formulations are especially advantageous for large scale web corpora, where they also reduce the number of terms required for effective query expansion, and improve the diversity of the retrieved results.","author":["Michael Bendersky","Donald Metzler","W.

However, the long write latency limits the effectiveness of MLC STT-MRAM based L2 caches. In this paper, we address this limitation with two novel designs: Line Pairing (LP) and Line Swapping (LS). LP forms fast cachelines by re-organizing MLC soft bits which are faster to write. LS dynamically stores frequently written data into these fast cachelines. Our experimental results show that LP and LS improve system performance by 15% and reduce energy consumption by 21%.","author":["Lei Jiang","Bo Zhao","Youtao Zhang","Jun Yang"],"issue":["DAC '12: Proceedings of the 49th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2012","Pages   907\u2013912","https://doi.org/10.1145/2228360.2228521"],"date":"03 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"nVIDIA Tegra. http://www.nvidia.com/object/tegra-superchip.html.","order":1},{"text":"Intel Atom D525. http://ark.intel.com/products/49490.","order":2},{"text":"P.

In recent years, many researches have been conducted to improve the storage density and enhance the scalability of STT-RAM, such as reducing the write current and switching time of magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) devices. In parallel with these efforts, the continuous increasing of tunnel magneto-resistance(TMR) ratio of the MTJ inspires the development of multi-level cell (MLC) STT-RAM, which allows multiple data bits be stored in a single memory cell. Two types of MLC STT-RAM cells, namely, parallel MLC and series MLC, were also proposed. The storage margin of a MLC STT-RAM cell, i.e., the distinction between the lowest and highest resistance states, is partitioned into multiple segments for multi-level data representation. As a result, the performance and reliability of MLC STT-RAM cells become more sensitive to the MOS and MTJ device variations and the thermal-induced randomness of MTJ switching. In this work, we systematically analyze the variation sources of MLC STT-RAM designs and their impacts on the reliability of the read and write operations. On top of that, we also discuss the optimal device parameters of the MLC MTJ for the minimization of the operation error rate of the MLC STT-RAM cells from statistical design perspective. Our simulation results show that under the current available technology, series MLC STT-RAM demonstrates overwhelming benefits in the read and write reliability compared to parallel MLC STT-RAM and could potentially satisfy the requirement of commercial practices.","author":["Yaojun Zhang","Lu Zhang","Wujie Wen","Guangyu Sun","Yiran Chen"],"issue":["ICCAD '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2012","Pages   526\u2013532","https://doi.org/10.1145/2429384.2429498"],"date":"05 November 2012","ref":[{"text":"Y.

It promises the performance and energy efficiency of hardware designs with a lower barrier to entry in design expertise, and shorter design time. State-of-the-art high level synthesis now includes a wide variety of powerful optimizations that implement efficient hardware. These optimizations can implement some of the most important features generally performed in manual designs including parallel hardware units, pipelining of execution both within a hardware unit and between units, and fine-grained data communication. We may generally classify the optimizations as those that optimize hardware implementation within a code block (intra-block) and those that optimize communication and pipelining between code blocks (inter-block). However, both optimizations are in practice difficult to apply. Real-world applications contain data-dependent blocks of code and communicate through complex data access patterns. Existing high level synthesis tools cannot apply these powerful optimizations unless the code is inherently compatible, severely limiting the optimization opportunity. In this paper we present an integrated framework to model and enable both intra- and inter-block optimizations. This integrated technique substantially improves the opportunity to use the powerful HLS optimizations that implement parallelism, pipelining, and fine-grained communication. Our polyhedral model-based technique systematically defines a set of data access patterns, identifies effective data access patterns, and performs the loop transformations to enable the intra- and inter-block optimizations. Our framework automatically explores transformation options, performs code transformations, and inserts the appropriate HLS directives to implement the HLS optimizations. Furthermore, our framework can automatically generate the optimized communication blocks for fine-grained communication between hardware blocks. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that we can achieve an average of 6.04X speedup over the high level synthesis solution without our transformations to enable intra- and inter-block optimizations.","author":["Wei Zuo","Yun Liang","Peng Li","Kyle Rupnow","Deming Chen","Jason Cong"],"issue":["FPGA '13: Proceedings of the ACM/SIGDA international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2013","Pages   9\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/2435264.2435271"],"date":"11 February 2013","ref":[{"text":"Pocc.

Ranging from expressions of concern to doomsday scenarios, the exact time when serious hurdles would beset us varied quite a bit---some of the more optimistic warnings giving Moore\u2019s law until. Needless to say, a lot of people have spent time and effort with great success to find ways for substantially extending the time when we would encounter the dreaded cliff-edge, if not avoiding it altogether. Faced with this issue, we started approaching this in a decidedly different manner---one which suggested falling off the metaphorical cliff as a design choice, but in a controlled way. This resulted in devices that could switch and produce bits that are correct, namely of having the intended value, only with a probabilistic guarantee. As a result, the results could in fact be incorrect. Such devices and associated circuits and computing structures are now broadly referred to as inexact designs, circuits, and architectures. In this article, we will crystallize the essence of inexactness dating back to 2002 through two key principles that we developed: (i) that of admitting error in a design in return for resource savings, and subsequently (ii) making resource investments in the elements of a hardware platform proportional to the value of information they compute. We will also give a broad overview of a range of inexact designs and hardware concepts that our group and other groups around the world have been developing since, based on these two principles. Despite not being deterministically precise, inexact designs can be significantly more efficient in the energy they consume, their speed of execution, and their area needs, which makes them attractive in application contexts that are resilient to error. Significantly, our development of inexactness will be contrasted against the rich backdrop of traditional approaches aimed at realizing reliable computing from unreliable elements, starting with von Neumann\u2019s influential lectures and further developed by Shannon-Weaver and others.","author":["Krishna Palem","Avinash Lingamneni"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 12","Issue 2s","May 2013","Article No.: 87","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/2465787.2465789"],"date":"01 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"Akgul, B.

Unfortunately, directly applying existing data-parallel tools to graph computation tasks can be cumbersome and inefficient. The need for intuitive, scalable tools for graph computation has lead to the development of new graph-parallel systems (e.g., Pregel, PowerGraph) which are designed to efficiently execute graph algorithms. Unfortunately, these new graph-parallel systems do not address the challenges of graph construction and transformation which are often just as problematic as the subsequent computation. Furthermore, existing graph-parallel systems provide limited fault-tolerance and support for interactive data mining. We introduce GraphX, which combines the advantages of both data-parallel and graph-parallel systems by efficiently expressing graph computation within the Spark data-parallel framework. We leverage new ideas in distributed graph representation to efficiently distribute graphs as tabular data-structures. Similarly, we leverage advances in data-flow systems to exploit in-memory computation and fault-tolerance. We provide powerful new operations to simplify graph construction and transformation. Using these primitives we implement the PowerGraph and Pregel abstractions in less than 20 lines of code. Finally, by exploiting the Scala foundation of Spark, we enable users to interactively load, transform, and compute on massive graphs.","author":["Reynold S. Xin","Joseph E. Gonzalez","Michael J.

Recently, replication-based approaches were proposed to further reduce the response time. Efficient retrieval of replicated data from multiple disks is a challenging problem. Existing retrieval techniques are designed for storage arrays with identical disks, having no initial load or network delay. In this article, we consider the generalized retrieval problem of replicated data where the disks in the system might be heterogeneous, the disks may have initial load, and the storage arrays might be located on different sites. We first formulate the generalized retrieval problem using a Linear Programming (LP) model and solve it with mixed integer programming techniques. Next, the generalized retrieval problem is formulated as a more efficient maximum flow problem. We prove that the retrieval schedule returned by the maximum flow technique yields the optimal response time and this result matches the LP solution. We also propose a low-complexity online algorithm for the generalized retrieval problem by not guaranteeing the optimality of the result. Performance of proposed and state of the art retrieval strategies are investigated using various replication schemes, query types, query loads, disk specifications, network delays, and initial loads.","author":["Nihat Altiparmak","Ali \u015eaman Tosun"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 9","Issue 2","July 2013","Article No.: 5","pp   1\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/2491472.2491474"],"date":"01 July 2013","ref":[{"text":"Abdel-Ghaffar, K.

A major challenge for link-based clustering in such networks is their potential to generate many different results, carrying rather diverse semantic meanings. In order to generate desired clustering, we propose to use meta-path, a path that connects object types via a sequence of relations, to control clustering with distinct semantics. Nevertheless, it is easier for a user to provide a few examples (seeds) than a weighted combination of sophisticated meta-paths to specify her clustering preference. Thus, we propose to integrate meta-path selection with user-guided clustering to cluster objects in networks, where a user first provides a small set of object seeds for each cluster as guidance. Then the system learns the weight for each meta-path that is consistent with the clustering result implied by the guidance, and generates clusters under the learned weights of meta-paths. A probabilistic approach is proposed to solve the problem, and an effective and efficient iterative algorithm, PathSelClus, is proposed to learn the model, where the clustering quality and the meta-path weights mutually enhance each other. Our experiments with several clustering tasks in two real networks and one synthetic network demonstrate the power of the algorithm in comparison with the baselines.","author":["Yizhou Sun","Brandon Norick","Jiawei Han","Xifeng Yan","Philip S.

When \"search\" became one of the most frequently used applications, \"intent gap\", the gap between query expressions and users' search intents, emerged. Researchers have been focusing on three approaches to bridge the semantic and intent gaps: 1) developing more representative features, 2) exploiting better learning approaches or statistical models to represent the semantics, and 3) collecting more training data with better quality. However, it remains a challenge to close the gaps. In this paper, we argue that the massive amount of click data from commercial search engines provides a data set that is unique in the bridging of the semantic and intent gap. Search engines generate millions of click data (a.k.a. image-query pairs), which provide almost \"unlimited\" yet strong connections between semantics and images, as well as connections between users' intents and queries. To study the intrinsic properties of click data and to investigate how to effectively leverage this huge amount of data to bridge semantic and intent gap is a promising direction to advance multimedia research. In the past, the primary obstacle is that there is no such dataset available to the public research community. This changes as Microsoft has released a new large-scale real-world image click data to public. This paper presents preliminary studies on the power of large-scale click data with a variety of experiments, such as building large-scale concept detectors, tag processing, search, definitive tag detection, intent analysis, etc., with the goal to inspire deeper researches based on this dataset.","author":["Xian-Sheng Hua","Linjun Yang","Jingdong Wang","Jing Wang","Ming Ye","Kuansan Wang","Yong Rui","Jin Li"],"issue":["MM '13: Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2013","Pages   243\u2013252","https://doi.org/10.1145/2502081.2502283"],"date":"21 October 2013","ref":[{"text":"Image retrieval in clef, http://imageclef.org/2012/photo-web.","order":1},{"text":"G.

With Intel TSX, a processor can dynamically determine whether threads need to serialize through lock-protected critical sections. In this paper, we evaluate the first hardware implementation of Intel TSX using a set of high-performance computing (HPC) workloads, and demonstrate that applying Intel TSX to these workloads can provide significant performance improvements. On a set of real-world HPC workloads, applying Intel TSX provides an average speedup of 1.41x. When applied to a parallel user-level TCP/IP stack, Intel TSX provides 1.31x average bandwidth improvement on network intensive applications. We also demonstrate the ease with which we were able to apply Intel TSX to the various workloads.","author":["Richard M. Yoo","Christopher J.

Even in presence of 3G connectivity, our devices are built to switch automatically to WiFi networks so to improve user experience. Most of the times, this is achieved by recurrently broadcasting automatic connectivity requests (known as Probe Requests) to known access points (APs), like, e.g., \"Home WiFi\", \"Campus WiFi\", and so on. In a large gathering of people, the number of these probes can be very high. This scenario rises a natural question: \"Can significant information on the social structure of a large crowd and on its socioeconomic status be inferred by looking at smartphone probes?\". In this work we give a positive answer to this question. We organized a 3-months long campaign, through which we collected around 11M probes sent by more than 160K different devices. During the campaign we targeted national and international events that attracted large crowds as well as other gatherings of people. Then, we present a simple and automatic methodology to build the underlying social graph of the smartphone users, starting from their probes. We do so for each of our target events, and find that they all feature social-network properties. In addition, we show that, by looking at the probes in an event, we can learn important sociological aspects of its participants---language, vendor adoption, and so on.","author":["Marco V.

We compare our solution to the previous system, considering time performance, space requirements and accuracy in the context of the Dutch and English languages. Additionally, we report results for 9 additional languages among the largest Wikipedias. Finally, we present challenges and experiences to foment the discussion with other developers interested in recognition and disambiguation of entities in natural language text.","author":["Joachim Daiber","Max Jakob","Chris Hokamp","Pablo N.

The approaches were introduced and evaluated in more than 170 research articles, as well as patents, presentations and blogs. We reviewed these approaches and found most evaluations to contain major shortcomings. Of the approaches proposed, 21% were not evaluated. Among the evaluated approaches, 19% were not evaluated against a baseline. Of the user studies performed, 60% had 15 or fewer participants or did not report on the number of participants. Information on runtime and coverage was rarely provided. Due to these and several other shortcomings described in this paper, we conclude that it is currently not possible to determine which recommendation approaches for academic literature are the most promising. However, there is little value in the existence of more than 80 approaches if the best performing approaches are unknown.","author":["Joeran Beel","Stefan Langer","Marcel Genzmehr","Bela Gipp","Corinna Breitinger","Andreas N\u00fcrnberger"],"issue":["RepSys '13: Proceedings of the International Workshop on Reproducibility and Replication in Recommender Systems Evaluation","October 2013","Pages   15\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/2532508.2532512"],"date":"12 October 2013","ref":[{"text":"G.

Previous work on FPGAs has shown how hardware parallelism can be used to accelerate a \u201cRestricted Boltzmann Machine\u201d (RBM) ANN algorithm, and how to distribute computation across multiple FPGAs.Here we describe a fully pipelined parallel architecture that exploits \u201cmini-batch\u201d training (combining many input cases to compute each set of weight updates) to further accelerate ANN training. We implement on an FPGA, for the first time to our knowledge, a more powerful variant of the basic RBM, the \u201cFactored RBM\u201d (fRBM). The fRBM has proved valuable in learning transformations and in discovering features that are present across multiple types of input. We obtain (in simulation) a 100-fold acceleration (vs. CPU software) for an fRBM having N = 256 units in each of its four groups (two input, one output, one intermediate group of units) running on a Virtex-6 LX760 FPGA. Many of the architectural features we implement are applicable not only to fRBMs, but to basic RBMs and other ANN algorithms more broadly.","author":["Lok-Won Kim","Sameh Asaad","Ralph Linsker"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 7","Issue 1","February 2014","Article No.: 5","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/2539125"],"date":"01 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"Amin, H., Curtis, K., and Hayes-Gill, B. 1997.

Classroom-based peer learning relies on students being in the same place at the same time to form peer discussion groups, but this is rarely true for online students in MOOCs. We built a software tool that facilitates chat-based peer learning in MOOCs by 1) automatically forming ad-hoc discussion groups and 2) scaffolding the interactions between students in these groups. We report on a pilot deployment of this tool; post-use surveys administered to participants show that the tool was positively received and support the feasibility of synchronous online collaborative learning in MOOCs.","author":["Seongtaek Lim","Derrick Coetzee","Bjoern Hartmann","Armando Fox","Marti A.

These games require both the CPU and GPU to work in tandem, resulting in high power consumption.

However, the latent features make it difficulty to explain the recommendation results to the users. Fortunately, with the continuous growth of online user reviews, the information available for training a recommender system is no longer limited to just numerical star ratings or user/item features. By extracting explicit user opinions about various aspects of a product from the reviews, it is possible to learn more details about what aspects a user cares, which further sheds light on the possibility to make explainable recommendations. In this work, we propose the Explicit Factor Model (EFM) to generate explainable recommendations, meanwhile keep a high prediction accuracy. We first extract explicit product features (i.e. aspects) and user opinions by phrase-level sentiment analysis on user reviews, then generate both recommendations and disrecommendations according to the specific product features to the user's interests and the hidden features learned. Besides, intuitional feature-level explanations about why an item is or is not recommended are generated from the model. Offline experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of our framework over competitive baseline algorithms on both rating prediction and top-K recommendation tasks. Online experiments show that the detailed explanations make the recommendations and disrecommendations more influential on user's purchasing behavior.","author":["Yongfeng Zhang","Guokun Lai","Min Zhang","Yi Zhang","Yiqun Liu","Shaoping Ma"],"issue":["SIGIR '14: Proceedings of the 37th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research & development in information retrieval","July 2014","Pages   83\u201392","https://doi.org/10.1145/2600428.2609579"],"date":"03 July 2014","ref":[{"text":"S.

Domain wall memory (DWM) is one possible candidate due to its ability to store multiple bits per cell in order to break the density barrier. Additionally, it provides low standby power, fast access time, good endurance and retention. However, it suffers from poor write latency, shift latency, shift power and write power. DWM is sequential in nature and latency of read/write operations depends on the offset of the bit from the read/write head. This paper investigates the circuit design challenges such as bitcell layout, head positioning, utilization factor of the nanowire, shift power, shift latency and provides solutions to deal with these issues. A synergistic system is proposed by combining circuit techniques such as merged read/write heads (for compact layout), flipped-bitcell and shift gating (for shift power optimization), wordline (WL) strapping (for access latency), shift circuit design with micro-architectural techniques such as segmented cache to realize energy-efficient and robust DWM cache. Simulations show 3-33% better performance and 1.25X-14.4X better power over a wide range of PARSEC benchmarks.","author":["Seyedhamidreza Motaman","Anirudh Iyengar","Swaroop Ghosh"],"issue":["ISLPED '14: Proceedings of the 2014 international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2014","Pages   195\u2013200","https://doi.org/10.1145/2627369.2627643"],"date":"11 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"PW Diodato, \"Embedded DRAM: more than just a memory\", IEEE Communications Magazine, 2000.","doi":"10.1109/35.852042","order":1},{"text":"M.

But not all applications need high-precision storage for all of their data structures all of the time. This article proposes mechanisms that enable applications to store data approximately and shows that doing so can improve the performance, lifetime, or density of solid-state memories. We propose two mechanisms. The first allows errors in multilevel cells by reducing the number of programming pulses used to write them. The second mechanism mitigates wear-out failures and extends memory endurance by mapping approximate data onto blocks that have exhausted their hardware error correction resources. Simulations show that reduced-precision writes in multilevel phase-change memory cells can be 1.7 \u00d7 faster on average and using failed blocks can improve array lifetime by 23% on average with quality loss under 10%.","author":["Adrian Sampson","Jacob Nelson","Karin Strauss","Luis Ceze"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Computer Systems","Volume 32","Issue 3","September 2014","Article No.: 9","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/2644808"],"date":"23 September 2014","ref":[{"text":"K.

Currently only 40\\% or less of the raw bandwidth of the flash memory in the SSDs is delivered by the storage system to the applications. Moreover, because of space over-provisioning in the SSD to accommodate non-sequential or random writes, and additionally, parity coding across flash channels, typically only 50-70\\% of the raw capacity of a commodity SSD can be used for user data. Given the large scale of Baidu's data center, making the most effective use of its SSDs is of great importance. Specifically, we seek to maximize both bandwidth and usable capacity.To achieve this goal we propose {\\em software-defined flash} (SDF), a hardware/software co-designed storage system to maximally exploit the performance characteristics of flash memory in the context of our workloads. SDF exposes individual flash channels to the host software and eliminates space over-provisioning. The host software, given direct access to the raw flash channels of the SSD, can effectively organize its data and schedule its data access to better realize the SSD's raw performance potential.Currently more than 3000 SDFs have been deployed in Baidu's storage system that supports its web page and image repository services. Our measurements show that SDF can deliver approximately 95% of the raw flash bandwidth and provide 99% of the flash capacity for user data. SDF increases I/O bandwidth by 300\\% and reduces per-GB hardware cost by 50% on average compared with the commodity-SSD-based system used at Baidu.","author":["Jian Ouyang","Shiding Lin","Song Jiang","Zhenyu Hou","Yong Wang","Yuanzheng Wang"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 49","Issue 4","April 2014","pp   471\u2013484","https://doi.org/10.1145/2644865.2541959"],"date":"24 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"\"Micron 25nm MLC Product Datasheet.\" http://www.micron.com.","order":1},{"text":"\"NVMe: Non-volatile Memory Express.\" http://www.nvmexpress.org/.","order":2},{"text":"\"UBIFS: Unsorted Block Image File System.\" http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/doc/ubifs.html/.","order":3},{"text":"\"YFFS: Yet Another Flash File System.\" http://www.yaffs.net/.","order":4},{"text":"F.

However, the adoption of flow-based biochips is hampered today by the lack of computer-aided design tools. Manual design procedures not only delay product development but they also inhibit the exploitation of the design complexity that is possible with current fabrication techniques. In this paper, we present the first practical problem formulation for automated control-layer design in flow-based microfluidic VLSI (mVLSI) biochips and propose a systematic approach for solving this problem. Our goal is to find an efficient routing solution for control-layer design with a minimum number of control pins. The pressure-propagation delay, an intrinsic physical phenomenon in mVLSI biochips, is minimized in order to reduce the response time for valves, decrease the pattern set-up time, and synchronize valve actuation. Two fabricated flow-based devices and five synthetic benchmarks are used to evaluate the proposed optimization method. Compared with manual control-layer design and a baseline approach, the proposed approach leads to fewer control pins, better timing behavior, and shorter channel length in the control layer.","author":["Kai Hu","Trung Anh Dinh","Tsung-Yi Ho","Krishnendu Chakrabarty"],"issue":["CASES '14: Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Compilers, Architecture and Synthesis for Embedded Systems","October 2014","Article No.: 16","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2656106.2656118"],"date":"12 October 2014","ref":[{"text":"G.

Attackers usually control malicious accounts, including both fake and compromised real user accounts, to launch attack campaigns such as social spam, malware distribution, and online rating distortion. To defend against these attacks, we design and implement a malicious account detection system called SynchroTrap. We observe that malicious accounts usually perform loosely synchronized actions in a variety of social network context. Our system clusters user accounts according to the similarity of their actions and uncovers large groups of malicious accounts that act similarly at around the same time for a sustained period of time. We implement SynchroTrap as an incremental processing system on Hadoop and Giraph so that it can process the massive user activity data in a large online social network efficiently. We have deployed our system in five applications at Facebook and Instagram. SynchroTrap was able to unveil more than two million malicious accounts and 1156 large attack campaigns within one month.","author":["Qiang Cao","Xiaowei Yang","Jieqi Yu","Christopher Palow"],"issue":["CCS '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","November 2014","Pages   477\u2013488","https://doi.org/10.1145/2660267.2660269"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"Better Security through Software. http://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/better-security-through-software/248766257130, 2010.","order":1},{"text":"Staying in Control of Your Facebook Logins. http://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/staying-in-control-of-your-facebook-logins/389991097130, 2010.","order":2},{"text":"Working Together to Keep You Secure. http://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/working-together-to-keep-you-secure/68886667130, 2010.","order":3},{"text":"Amazon EC2 Pricing. http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/, 2013.","order":4},{"text":"Apache Giraph. http://giraph.apache.org/, 2013.","order":5},{"text":"Apache Hadoop. http://hadoop.apache.org/, 2013.","order":6},{"text":"Cookies, Pixels & Similar Technologies. https://www.facebook.com/help/cookies, 2013.","order":7},{"text":"Facebook Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Results. http://investor.fb.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=736911, 2013.","order":8},{"text":"Facebook's New Way to Combat Child Pornography. http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/19/facebook-to-combat-child-porn-using-microsofts-technology, 2013.","order":9},{"text":"Malicious Chrome extensions on the rise. http://www.zdnet.com/malicious-chrome-extensions-on-the-rise-7000019913/, 2013.","order":10},{"text":"Scaling Apache Giraph to a trillion edges. https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/scaling-apache-giraph-to-a-trillion-edges/10151617006153920, 2013.","order":11},{"text":"Types of cookies used by Google. http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/types/, 2013.","order":12},{"text":"Rate Limiting at Facebook. https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/ads-api/api-rate-limiting, 2014.","order":13},{"text":"Rate Limiting at Google+. https://developers.google.com/+/domains/faq, 2014.","order":14},{"text":"I.

Though the accuracy of CBVS systems have drastically improved, these high accuracy systems tend to be too inefficient for interactive search. Therefore, to strive for real-time web-scale CBVS, we perform a comprehensive study on the different components in a CBVS system to understand the trade-offs between accuracy and speed of each component. Directions investigated include exploring different low-level and semantics-based features, testing different compression factors and approximations during video search, and understanding the time v.s. accuracy trade-off of reranking. Extensive experiments on data sets consisting of more than 1,000 hours of video showed that through a combination of effective features, highly compressed representations, and one iteration of reranking, our proposed system can achieve an 10,000-fold speedup while retaining 80% accuracy of a state-of-the-art CBVS system. We further performed search over 1 million videos and demonstrated that our system can complete the search in 0.975 seconds with a single core, which potentially opens the door to interactive web-scale CBVS for the general public.","author":["Shoou-I Yu","Lu Jiang","Zhongwen Xu","Yi Yang","Alexander G.

To maximize cost and energy efficiency, these systems will increasingly use globally-addressable heterogeneous memory systems, making choices about memory page placement critical to performance. In this work we show that current page placement policies are not sufficient to maximize GPU performance in these heterogeneous memory systems. We propose two new page placement policies that improve GPU performance: one application agnostic and one using application profile information. Our application agnostic policy, bandwidth-aware (BW-AWARE) placement, maximizes GPU throughput by balancing page placement across the memories based on the aggregate memory bandwidth available in a system. Our simulation-based results show that BW-AWARE placement outperforms the existing Linux INTERLEAVE and LOCAL policies by 35% and 18% on average for GPU compute workloads. We build upon BW-AWARE placement by developing a compiler-based profiling mechanism that provides programmers with information about GPU application data structure access patterns. Combining this information with simple program-annotated hints about memory placement, our hint-based page placement approach performs within 90% of oracular page placement on average, largely mitigating the need for costly dynamic page tracking and migration.","author":["Neha Agarwal","David Nellans","Mark Stephenson","Mike O'Connor","Stephen W.

Our approach differs from existing techniques that handle branch (or control-flow) divergence, which use costly hardware modifications, low-utilization masking techniques, or static prediction methods. As we examine divergent applications, we characterize the degree of data-dependent control flow seen in each and isolate the code regions (or \u201ckernels\u201d) that cause the most performance degradation due to branch divergence. We then train neural networks (NNs) offline to approximate these kernels and inject the NN computations directly into the applications as substitutes for the kernels they approximate. This essentially translates control flow into nondivergent computation, trading off precision for performance. As our methodology manipulates application source code directly, it is inherently platform agnostic and can be adopted as a general means for accelerating divergent applications on data-parallel architectures. In this article, we present the Neuralizer, an automated software flow for kernel identification, NN training, and NN integration, as well as supplementary user-controlled optimization techniques. Evaluating our approach on a variety of divergent applications run on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), we on average achieve performance gains of 13.6 \u00d7 and energy savings of 14.8 \u00d7 with 96% accuracy.","author":["Beayna Grigorian","Glenn Reinman"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 12","Issue 1","April 2015","Article No.: 2","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/2717311"],"date":"09 March 2015","ref":[{"text":"Woongki Baek and Trishul M.

Currently, the system evaluates students' self-explanation performance using a local, sentence-level algorithm and does not adapt content based on reading ability. The current study leverages natural language processing tools to build models of students' comprehension ability from the linguistic properties of their self-explanations. Students (n = 126) interacted with iSTART across eight training sessions where they self-explained target sentences from complex science texts. Coh-Metrix was then used to calculate the linguistic properties of their aggregated self-explanations. The results of this study indicated that the linguistic indices were predictive of students' reading comprehension ability, over and above the current system algorithms. These results suggest that natural language processing techniques can inform stealth assessments and ultimately improve student models within intelligent tutoring systems.","author":["Laura K.

In this paper, we present a distributed deep learning system, called SINGA, for training big models over large datasets. An intuitive programming model based on the layer abstraction is provided, which supports a variety of popular deep learning models. SINGA architecture supports both synchronous and asynchronous training frameworks. Hybrid training frameworks can also be customized to achieve good scalability. SINGA provides different neural net partitioning schemes for training large models.

Designing practical and secure defenses against code-reuse attacks is highly challenging and currently subject to intense research. However, no secure and practical system-level solutions exist so far, since a large number of proposed defenses have been successfully bypassed. To tackle this attack, we present HAFIX (Hardware-Assisted Flow Integrity eXtension), a defense against code-reuse attacks exploiting backward edges (returns). HAFIX provides fine-grained and practical protection, and serves as an enabling technology for future control-flow integrity instantiations. This paper presents the implementation and evaluation of HAFIX for the Intel\u00ae Siskiyou Peak and SPARC embedded system architectures, and demonstrates its security and efficiency in code-reuse protection while incurring only 2% performance overhead.","author":["Lucas Davi","Matthias Hanreich","Debayan Paul","Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi","Patrick Koeberl","Dean Sullivan","Orlando Arias","Yier Jin"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 74","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744847"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"Gaisler Research.

A dense memristive crossbar PUF is described which utilizes variations in the write-time of memristors as the primary entropy source. For this work, the write-time varies according to six specific device parameters which can be directly measured from fabricated memristors and easily included in an accurate model for circuit simulation. The results presented show strong statistical performance for the proposed design in terms of entropy, uniqueness and uniformity. Furthermore, the nature of sneak path currents in the crossbar structure are leveraged to provide an exponential number of unique configurations for each response bit. Results also show that the proposed crossbar-based PUF provides improved power consumption and smaller area utilization when compared to CMOS-based and other nanoelectronic PUF circuits.","author":["Garrett S.

In this work, we propose RENO -- a efficient reconfigurable neuromorphic computing accelerator. RENO leverages the extremely efficient mixed-signal computation capability of memristor-based crossbar (MBC) arrays to speedup the executions of artificial neural networks (ANNs). The hierarchically arranged MBC arrays can be configured to a variety of ANN topologies through a mixed-signal interconnection network (M-Net). Simulation results on seven ANN applications show that compared to the baseline general-purpose processor, RENO can achieve on average 178.4x (27.06x) performance speedup and 184.2x (25.23x) energy savings in high-efficient multilayer perception (high-accurate auto-associative memory) implementation. Moreover, in the comparison to a pure digital neural processing unit (D-NPU) and a design with MBC arrays co-operating through a digital interconnection network, RENO still achieves the fastest execution time and the lowest energy consumption with similar computation accuracy.","author":["Xiaoxiao Liu","Mengjie Mao","Beiye Liu","Hai Li","Yiran Chen","Boxun Li","Yu Wang","Hao Jiang","Mark Barnell","Qing Wu","Jianhua Yang"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 66","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744900"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"\"Macsim,\" http://code.google.com/p/macsim/.","order":1},{"text":"\"The mnist database,\" http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.","order":2},{"text":"\"Uci machine learning,\" http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/.","order":3},{"text":"F.

Its fundamental innovation is that virtually all computation within level-2 (matrix-vector) and level-3 (matrix-matrix) BLAS operations can be expressed and optimized in terms of very simple kernels. While others have had similar insights, BLIS reduces the necessary kernels to what we believe is the simplest set that still supports the high performance that the computational science community demands. Higher-level framework code is generalized and implemented in ISO C99 so that it can be reused and/or reparameterized for different operations (and different architectures) with little to no modification. Inserting high-performance kernels into the framework facilitates the immediate optimization of any BLAS-like operations which are cast in terms of these kernels, and thus the framework acts as a productivity multiplier. Users of BLAS-dependent applications are given a choice of using the traditional Fortran-77 BLAS interface, a generalized C interface, or any other higher level interface that builds upon this latter API. Preliminary performance of level-2 and level-3 operations is observed to be competitive with two mature open source libraries (OpenBLAS and ATLAS) as well as an established commercial product (Intel MKL).","author":["Field G.

The embedding of the word vectors helps to retrieve a list of words that are used in similar contexts with respect to a given word. In this paper, we focus on using the word embeddings for enhancing retrieval effectiveness. In particular, we construct a generalized language model, where the mutual independence between a pair of words (say t and t') no longer holds. Instead, we make use of the vector embeddings of the words to derive the transformation probabilities between words. Specifically, the event of observing a term t in the query from a document d is modeled by two distinct events, that of generating a different term t', either from the document itself or from the collection, respectively, and then eventually transforming it to the observed query term t. The first event of generating an intermediate term from the document intends to capture how well does a term contextually fit within a document, whereas the second one of generating it from the collection aims to address the vocabulary mismatch problem by taking into account other related terms in the collection. Our experiments, conducted on the standard TREC collection, show that our proposed method yields significant improvements over LM and LDA-smoothed LM baselines.","author":["Debasis Ganguly","Dwaipayan Roy","Mandar Mitra","Gareth J.F.

SpotFi only uses information that is already exposed by WiFi chips and does not require any hardware or firmware changes, yet achieves the same accuracy as state-of-the-art localization systems. SpotFi makes two key technical contributions. First, SpotFi incorporates super-resolution algorithms that can accurately compute the angle of arrival (AoA) of multipath components even when the access point (AP) has only three antennas. Second, it incorporates novel filtering and estimation techniques to identify AoA of direct path between the localization target and AP by assigning values for each path depending on how likely the particular path is the direct path. Our experiments in a multipath rich indoor environment show that SpotFi achieves a median accuracy of 40 cm and is robust to indoor hindrances such as obstacles and multipath.","author":["Manikanta Kotaru","Kiran Joshi","Dinesh Bharadia","Sachin Katti"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Conference on Special Interest Group on Data Communication","August 2015","Pages   269\u2013282","https://doi.org/10.1145/2785956.2787487"],"date":"17 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"J.

Frequent refreshes increase power consumption. Also, they disturb normal DRAM accesses leading to performance degradation. In order to overcome this problem, we propose several DRAM refresh architectures. The basic idea is to eliminate unnecessary DRAM refreshes. We have estimated the DRAM refresh count in executing benchmark programs under several architecture models. As a result, in the most effective combination of the architectures, we have obtained more than 80% reduction against a conventional DRAM refresh architecture for most benchmark programs. In addition to it, even when we have taken normal DRAM access into account, we have obtained more than 50% reduction for several benchmarks.","author":["Taku Ohsawa","Koji Kai","Kazuaki Murakami"],"issue":["ISLPED '98: Proceedings of the 1998 international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 1998","Pages   82\u201387","https://doi.org/10.1145/280756.280792"],"date":"10 August 1998","ref":[{"text":"Y.

The gol is to store these maps without the loss of information that results from digitization, and to obtain a worst-case execution time that is not overly sensitive to the positioning of the map. A regular decomposition variant of the region quadtree is used to organize the vertices and edges of the maps. A number of related data organizations are proposed in an iterative manner until a method is obtained that meets the stated goals. The result is termed a PM (polygonal map) quadtree and is based on a regular decomposition point space  quadtree (PR quadtree) that stores additional information about the edges at its terminal nodes. Algorithms are given for inserting and deleting line segments from a PM quadtree. Use of the PM quadtree to perform point location, dynamic line insertion, and map overlay is discussed. The PM quadtree is compared conceptually to the K-structure and the layered dag with respect to typical cartographic data. An empirical comparison of the PM quadtree with other quadtree-based representations for polygonal maps is also provided.","author":["Hanan Samet","Robert E.

Within this shifting context, event-driven programming is emerging as a crucial programming model to achieve scalability. In this paper, we study the microarchitectural implications of server-side scripting, JavaScript in particular, from a unique event-driven programming model perspective. Using the Node.js framework, we come to several critical microarchitectural conclusions. First, unlike traditional server-workloads such as CloudSuite and BigDataBench that are based on the conventional thread-based execution model, event-driven applications are heavily single-threaded, and as such they require significant single-thread performance. Second, the single-thread performance is severely limited by the front-end inefficiencies of today's server processor microarchitecture, ultimately leading to overall execution inefficiencies. The front-end inefficiencies stem from the unique combination of limited intra-event code reuse and large inter-event reuse distance. Third, through a deep understanding of event-specific characteristics, architects can mitigate the front-end inefficiencies of the managed-language-based event-driven execution via a combination of instruction cache insertion policy and prefetcher.","author":["Yuhao Zhu","Daniel Richins","Matthew Halpern","Vijay Janapa Reddi"],"issue":["MICRO-48: Proceedings of the 48th International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2015","Pages   762\u2013774","https://doi.org/10.1145/2830772.2830792"],"date":"05 December 2015","ref":[{"text":"\"The redmonk programming language rankings: January 2015.\" http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2015/01/14/language-rankings-1-15/.","order":1},{"text":"S.

Hardware based solutions, such as Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF), enable system authentication by relying on the physical attributes of the silicon to serve as fingerprints. A variety of PUF designs have been proposed by researchers, with some gaining commercial success. Virtually all of these systems require dedicated PUF hardware to be built into the processor or System-on-Chip (SoC), increasing the cost of deployment in the field. This paper presents Authenticache, a novel, low-cost PUF design that does not require dedicated hardware support. Instead, it leverages on-chip error correction logic already built into many processor caches. As a result, Authenticache can be deployed and used by many off-the-shelf processors with minimal costs. We prototype, evaluate, and test the design on a real system, in addition to conducting extensive simulations. We find Authenticache to have high identifiability, as well as excellent resilience to measurement and environmental noise. Authenticache can withstand up to 142% of noise while maintaining a misidentification rate that is below 1 ppm.","author":["Anys Bacha","Radu Teodorescu"],"issue":["MICRO-48: Proceedings of the 48th International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2015","Pages   128\u2013140","https://doi.org/10.1145/2830772.2830814"],"date":"05 December 2015","ref":[{"text":"C.

Generally, these networks have a very large number of computation nodes which forces the designer to use software-based implementations. However, the software based implementations are offline and not suitable for portable or real-time applications. Experiments show that compared with the software based implementations, FPGA-based systems can greatly speed up the computation time, making them suitable for real-time situations and portable applications. However, the FPGA implementation of neural networks with a large number of nodes is still a challenging task. In this paper, we exploit stochastic bit streams in the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to implement the classification of the RBM handwritten digit recognition application completely on an FPGA. We use finite state machine-based (FSM) stochastic circuits to implement the required sigmoid function and use the novel stochastic computing approach to perform all large matrix multiplications. Experimental results show that the proposed stochastic architecture has much more potential for tolerating faults while requiring much less hardware compared to the currently un-implementable deterministic binary approach when the RBM consists of a large number of neurons. Exploiting the features of stochastic circuits, our implementation achieves much better performance than a software-based approach.","author":["Bingzhe Li","M. Hassan Najafi","David J.

When the matrix to be approximated originates from a large distributed system, such as a network of mobile phones or smart meters, a challenging problem arises due to the strongly conflicting yet essential requirements of efficiency, robustness, and privacy preservation. We argue that although collecting sensitive data in a centralized fashion may be efficient, it is not an option when considering privacy and efficiency at the same time. Thus, we do not allow any sensitive data to leave the nodes of the network. The local information at each node (personal attributes, documents, media ratings, etc.) defines one row in the matrix. This means that all computations have to be performed at the edge of the network. Known parallel methods that respect the locality constraint, such as synchronized parallel gradient search or distributed iterative methods, require synchronized rounds or have inherent issues with load balancing, and thus they are not robust to failure. Our distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm overcomes these limitations. During the execution, any sensitive information remains local, whereas the global features (e.g., the factor model of movies) converge to the correct value at all nodes. We present a theoretical derivation and a thorough experimental evaluation of our algorithm. We demonstrate that the convergence speed of our method is competitive while not relying on synchronization and being robust to extreme and realistic failure scenarios. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we present trace-based simulations, real smartphone user behavior analysis, and tests over real movie recommender system data.","author":["Istv\u00e1n Heged\u0171s","\u00c1rp\u00e1d Berta","Levente Kocsis","Andr\u00e1s A.

In this article, we present a survey of architectural techniques for managing process variation (PV) in modern processors. We also classify these techniques based on several important parameters to bring out their similarities and differences. The aim of this article is to provide insights to researchers into the state of the art in PV management techniques and motivate them to further improve these techniques for designing PV-resilient processors of tomorrow.","author":["Sparsh Mittal"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 48","Issue 4","May 2016","Article No.: 54","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/2871167"],"date":"09 February 2016","ref":[{"text":"Jaume Abella, Xavier Vera, and Antonio Gonzalez. 2007.

By incorporating elements of intelligence, the hope is that the resulting \u201csmart\u201d embedded systems will function correctly and within desired constraints in spite of highly dynamic changes in the applications and the environment, as well as in the underlying software/hardware platforms. Since terms related to \u201csmartness\u201d (e.g., self-awareness, self-adaptivity, and autonomy) have been used loosely in many software and hardware computing contexts, we first present a taxonomy of \u201cself-x\u201d terms and use this taxonomy to relate major \u201csmart\u201d software and hardware computing efforts. A major attribute for smart embedded systems is the notion of self-awareness that enables an embedded system to monitor its own state and behavior, as well as the external environment, so as to adapt intelligently. Toward this end, we use a System-on-Chip perspective to show how the CyberPhysical System-on-Chip (CPSoC) exemplar platform achieves self-awareness through a combination of cross-layer sensing, actuation, self-aware adaptations, and online learning. We conclude with some thoughts on open challenges and research directions.","author":["Nikil Dutt","Axel Jantsch","Santanu Sarma"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 15","Issue 2","May 2016","Article No.: 22","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/2872936"],"date":"17 February 2016","ref":[{"text":"ARM Inc. 2013. big.LITTLE technology: The future of mobile.

Researchers have captured this naturalness of software through statistical models and used them to good effect in suggestion engines, porting tools, coding standards checkers, and idiom miners. This suggests that code that appears improbable, or surprising, to a good statistical language model is \"unnatural\" in some sense, and thus possibly suspicious. In this paper, we investigate this hypothesis. We consider a large corpus of bug fix commits (ca. 7,139), from 10 different Java projects, and focus on its language statistics, evaluating the naturalness of buggy code and the corresponding fixes. We find that code with bugs tends to be more entropic (i.e. unnatural), becoming less so as bugs are fixed. Ordering files for inspection by their average entropy yields cost-effectiveness scores comparable to popular defect prediction methods. At a finer granularity, focusing on highly entropic lines is similar in cost-effectiveness to some well-known static bug finders (PMD, FindBugs) and ordering warnings from these bug finders using an entropy measure improves the cost-effectiveness of inspecting code implicated in warnings. This suggests that entropy may be a valid, simple way to complement the effectiveness of PMD or FindBugs, and that search-based bug-fixing methods may benefit from using entropy both for fault-localization and searching for fixes.","author":["Baishakhi Ray","Vincent Hellendoorn","Saheel Godhane","Zhaopeng Tu","Alberto Bacchelli","Premkumar Devanbu"],"issue":["ICSE '16: Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Software Engineering","May 2016","Pages   428\u2013439","https://doi.org/10.1145/2884781.2884848"],"date":"14 May 2016","ref":[{"text":", New York, NY, USA, 2014.

In the last two decades, a large number of HPC-based solutions were proposed for this problem that run in different platforms, targeting different types of comparisons with slightly different algorithms and making the comparative analysis of these approaches very difficult. This article proposes a classification of parallel optimal pairwise sequence comparison solutions, in order to highlight their main characteristics in a unified way. We then discuss several HPC-based solutions, including clusters of multicores and accelerators such as Cell Broadband Engines (CellBEs), Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Intel Xeon Phi, as well as hybrid solutions, which combine two or more platforms, providing the actual landscape of the main proposals in this area. Finally, we present open questions and perspectives in this research field.","author":["Edans Flavius De Oliveira Sandes","Azzedine Boukerche","Alba Cristina Magalhaes Alves De Melo"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 48","Issue 4","May 2016","Article No.: 63","pp   1\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/2893488"],"date":"18 March 2016","ref":[{"text":"A.

We utilize holographic optical elements (HOEs) as transparent additive layers. The HOE layers are almost free from diffraction unlike spatial light modulator layers, which makes this additive light field display more advantageous when modifying the number of layers, thickness, and pixel density compared with conventional compressive displays. Meanwhile, the additive light field display maintains advantages of compressive light field displays. The proposed additive light field display shows bright and full-color volumetric images in high definition. In addition, users can view real-world scenes beyond the displays. Hence, we expect that our method can contribute to the realization of augmented reality. Here, we describe implementation of a prototype additive light field display with two additive layers, evaluate the performance of transparent HOE layers, describe several results of display experiments, discuss the diffraction effect of spatial light modulators, and analyze the ability of the additive light field display to express uncorrelated light fields.","author":["Seungjae Lee","Changwon Jang","Seokil Moon","Jaebum Cho","Byoungho Lee"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 35","Issue 4","July 2016","Article No.: 60","pp   1\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897824.2925971"],"date":"24 July 2016","ref":[{"text":"Akeley, K., Watt, S.

It trades off accuracy for improvement in hardware cost and energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for multi-level approximate logic synthesis under error rate constraint. The basic idea of our approach is to pick nodes in a Boolean network and shrink them by approximating their factored-form expressions. We propose two different algorithms to implement the basic idea. The first algorithm iteratively picks the most effective node at present to shrink. Its drawback lies in that it may need a large number of iterations. To overcome this drawback, the second algorithm formulates a knapsack problem to pick multiple nodes for shrinking simultaneously. It is still iterative, but the number of iterations is greatly reduced. We apply the two algorithms to MCNC benchmarks and arithmetic circuits including adders and multipliers. The experimental results demonstrated that our algorithms perform better in area saving and are 1.7 and 5.9 times faster, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art approach.","author":["Yi Wu","Weikang Qian"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 128","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2897982"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"J.

As an energy-efficient hardware solution, machine learning accelerators for CNNs or traditional ANNs are also gaining popularity in the area of embedded vision, robotics and cyberphysics. However, the design parameters of NN models vary significantly from application to application. Hence, it's hard to provide one general and highly-efficient hardware solution to accommodate all of them, and it is also impractical for the domain-specific developers to customize their flown hardware targeting on a specific NN model. To deal with this dilemma, this study proposes a design automation tool, DeepBurning, allowing the application developers to build from scratch learning accelerators that targets their specific NN models with custom configurations and optimized performance. DeepBurning includes a RTL-level accelerator generator and a coordinated compiler that generates the control flow and data layout under the user-specified constraints. The results can be used to implement FPGA-based NN accelerator or help generate chip design for early design stage. In general, DeepBurning supports a large family of NN models, and greatly simplifies the design flow of NN accelerators for the machine learning or AI application developers. The evaluation shows that the generated learning accelerators burnt to our FPGA board exhibit great power efficiency compared to state-of-the-art FPGA-based solutions.","author":["Ying Wang","Jie Xu","Yinhe Han","Huawei Li","Xiaowei Li"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 110","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898003"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"Esmaeilzadeh et al., \"Neural acceleration for general-purposeapproximate programs,\".

However, new challenges arise for the placement on such architecture. Firstly, existing work does not consider the detailed models for the path wirelength and delay estimation for interposer, which may significantly affect the placement quality. Secondly, previous work is mostly based on traditional tile-based placement which is slow for the placement of large design on multiple FPGAs. In this paper, we propose a new fast two-stage modular placement flow for interposer based multiple FPGAs aiming for delay optimization with the incorporation of a detailed interposer routing model for wirelength and delay estimation. Firstly, we adopt the force-directed method for its global property to get an efficient solution as a start point of the placement. Secondly, we adopt the simulated annealing (SA) for its efficiency and effectiveness in searching the refinement solution. In order to speed up the refinement, the hierarchical B*-tree (HB*-tree) is employed to enable a fast search and convergence. The experiments demonstrate that our flow can achieve an efficient solution in a comparable time. The proposed approach is scalable to different design size.","author":["Fubing Mao","Wei Zhang","Bo Feng","Bingsheng He","Yuchun Ma"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '16: Proceedings of the 26th edition on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2016","Pages   93\u201398","https://doi.org/10.1145/2902961.2903025"],"date":"18 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"C.

Therefore, security, trust, and privacy become crucial to the design and implementation of IoT devices [12]. However, it is challenging to build security into IoT devices because most of them are constrained by extremely limited resources such as the battery, memory, and computation power etc. Inspired by the concept of visual cryptography [4] that requires the least amount of computation and a recent work on pure hardware-based single-user authentication [6], we present a novel solution to the secret sharing and multi-user authentication problem. Our solution is built on the observation that non-volatile resistive memories display nice monotonic and additive properties during resistive state transitions. We demonstrate how to design a hardware dependent multi-user authentication protocol using resistive random access memory (RRAM)-based hardware and provide the necessary circuits for the application. Finally, we simulate the proposed circuit to understand the nature of the operation and practical problems that these designs encounter during operation.","author":["Md Tanvir Arafin","Gang Qu"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '16: Proceedings of the 26th edition on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2016","Pages   169\u2013174","https://doi.org/10.1145/2902961.2903039"],"date":"18 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"Shamir, Adi. \"How to share a secret.\" Communications of the ACM 22.11 (1979): 612--613.","doi":"10.1145/359168.359176","order":1},{"text":"Blakley, George Robert. \"Safeguarding cryptographic keys.\" AFIPS.

Large and complex databases, such as YAGO and DBLP, can be modeled as HINs. A fundamental problem in HINs is the computation of closeness, or relevance, between two HIN objects. Relevance measures can be used in various applications, including entity resolution, recommendation, and information retrieval. Several studies have investigated the use of HIN information for relevance computation, however, most of them only utilize simple structure, such as path, to measure the similarity between objects. In this paper, we propose to use meta structure, which is a directed acyclic graph of object types with edge types connecting in between, to measure the proximity between objects. The strength of meta structure is that it can describe complex relationship between two HIN objects (e.g., two papers in DBLP share the same authors and topics). We develop three relevance measures based on meta structure. Due to the computational complexity of these measures, we further design an algorithm with data structures proposed to support their evaluation. Our extensive experiments on YAGO and DBLP show that meta structure-based relevance is more effective than state-of-the-art approaches, and can be efficiently computed.","author":["Zhipeng Huang","Yudian Zheng","Reynold Cheng","Yizhou Sun","Nikos Mamoulis","Xiang Li"],"issue":["KDD '16: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2016","Pages   1595\u20131604","https://doi.org/10.1145/2939672.2939815"],"date":"13 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"S.

One such device is the ferroelectric FET (FeFET), which offers the potential to be scaled beyond the end of the silicon roadmap as predicted by ITRS. Furthermore, the Ids vs. Vgs characteristics of FeFETs may allow a device to function as both a switch and a non-volatile storage element. We exploit this FeFET property to enable fine-grained logic-in-memory (LiM). We consider three different circuit design styles for FeFET-based LiM: complementary (differential), dynamic current mode, and dynamic logic. Our designs are compared with existing approaches for LiM (i.e., based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), CMOS, etc.) that afford the same circuit-level functionality. Assuming similar feature sizes, non-volatile FeFET-based LiM circuits are more efficient than functional equivalents based on MTJs when considering metrics such as propagation delay (2.9X, 6.8X) and dyanmic power (3.7X, 2.3X) (for 45 nm, 22 nm technology respectively). Compared to CMOS functional equivalents, FeFET designs still exhibit modest improvements in the aforementioned metrics while also offering non-volatility and reduced device count.","author":["Xunzhao Yin","Ahmedullah Aziz","Joseph Nahas","Suman Datta","Sumeet Gupta","Michael Niemier","Xiaobo Sharon Hu"],"issue":["ICCAD '16: Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2016","Article No.: 121","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967037"],"date":"07 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"Logic-in-rram: Design of low-power circuits based on oxide memories. http://lsi.epfl.ch/page-79126-en.html.

GPU-based accelerators gained increasing attention because a large amount of highly parallel neurons in CNN naturally matches the GPU computation pattern. In this work, we perform comprehensive experiments to investigate the performance bottlenecks and overheads of current GPU acceleration platform for scale-out CNN-based big data processing. In our characterization, we observe two significant semantic gaps: framework gap that lies between CNN-based data processing workflow and data processing manner in distributed framework; and the standalone gap that lies between the uneven computation loads at different CNN layers and fixed computing capacity provisioning of current GPU acceleration library. To bridge these gaps, we propose D3NN, a Distributed, Decoupled, and Dynamically tuned GPU acceleration framework for modern CNN architectures. In particular, D3NN features a novel analytical model that enables accurate time estimation of GPU accelerated CNN processing with only 5-10% error. Our evaluation results show the throughput of standalone processing node using D3NN gains up to 3.7X performance improvement over current standalone GPU acceleration platform. Our CNN-oriented GPU acceleration library with built-in dynamic batching scheme achieves up to 1.5X performance improvement over the non-batching scheme and outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning library by up to 28% (performance mode) ~ 67% (memory-efficient mode).","author":["Mingcong Song","Yang Hu","Yunlong Xu","Chao Li","Huixiang Chen","Jingling Yuan","Tao Li"],"issue":["PACT '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation","September 2016","Pages   315\u2013326","https://doi.org/10.1145/2967938.2967944"],"date":"11 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"Abdel-Hamid, O., Mohamed, A., Jiang, H., Deng, L., Penn, G. and Yu, D. 2014.

In this work, we explore the near-data processing opportunity of a fundamental operation - linked-list traversal (LLT). We propose a new NDP architecture which does not change the existing sequential programming model and does not require any modification to the core microarchitecture. Instead, we exploit the packetized interface between the core and the memory modules to off-load LLT for NDP. We assume a system with multiple memory modules (e.g., hybrid memory cube (HMC) modules) interconnected with a memory network and our initial evaluation shows that simply off-loading LLT computation to near-memory can actually reduce performance because of the additional off-chip memory network channel traversal. Thus, we first propose NDP-aware data localization to exploit packaging locality - including locality within a single memory module and memory vault - to minimize latency and improve energy efficiency. In order to improve overall throughput and maximize parallelism, we propose batching multiple LLT operations together to amortize the cost of NDP by utilizing the highly parallel execution of NDP processing units and the high bandwidth of 3D stacked DRAM. Our evaluation shows that the combination of NDP-aware data localization and batching can provide significant improvement in performance and energy efficiency.","author":["Byungchul Hong","Gwangsun Kim","Jung Ho Ahn","Yongkee Kwon","Hongsik Kim","John Kim"],"issue":["PACT '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation","September 2016","Pages   113\u2013124","https://doi.org/10.1145/2967938.2967958"],"date":"11 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"J.

General purpose memory controllers use online scheduling techniques in order to increase the memory bandwidth. Due to a limited buffer depth they only have a local view on the executed application. However, numerous applications possess regular or fixed memory access patterns, which are not yet exploited to overcome the memory wall. In this paper, we present a holistic methodology to generate an Application Specific Memory Controller (ASMC), which has a global view on the application and utilizes application knowledge to decrease the energy and increase the bandwidth. To generate an ASMC we analyze the DRAM access pattern of the application offline and generate a custom address mapping by solving a combinatorial sequence partitioning problem.","author":["Matthias Jung","Deepak M.

However, STT-RAM suffers from the read disturbance issue, which stems from the fact that the voltage difference between read current and write current becomes smaller as technology scales. The read disturbance leads to high error rates for read operations, which cannot be effectively protected by the SEC-DED ECC on large-capacity register files of GPUs.Prior schemes (e.g., read-restore) to mitigate the read disturbance usually incur either non-trivial performance loss or excessive energy overhead, thus not applicable for the GPU register file design that aims to achieve both high performance and energy-efficiency. To combat the read disturbance, we propose a novel software-hardware co-designed solution (i.e., Red-Shield), which consists of three optimizations to overcome the limitations of the existing solutions. First, we identify dead reads at compiling stage and augment instructions to avoid unnecessary restores. Second, we employ a small read buffer to accommodate register reads with high-access locality to further reduce restores. Third, we propose an adaptive restore mechanism to selectively pick the suitable restore scheme, according to the busy status of corresponding register banks. Experimental results show that our proposed design can effectively mitigate the performance loss and energy overhead caused by restore operations while still maintaining the reliability of reads.","author":["Hang Zhang","Xuhao Chen","Nong Xiao","Lei Wang","Fang Liu","Wei Chen","Zhiguang Chen"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 13","Issue 2","March 2017","Article No.: 27","pp   1\u201317","https://doi.org/10.1145/2996191"],"date":"01 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"Andrew W.

In FFTW, most of the performance-critical code was generated automatically by a special-purpose compiler, called genfft, that outputs C code. Written in Objective Caml, genfft can produce DFT programs for any input length, and it can specialize the DFT program for the common case where the input data are real instead of complex. Unexpectedly, genfft \"discovered\" algorithms that were previously unknown, and it was able to reduce the arithmetic complexity of some other existing algorithms.

WTB implements a multi-tier (cloud, edge, sensing) system that integrates recent advances in machine learning based image processing to automatically classify animals in images from remote, motion-triggered camera traps. We use non-local, resource-rich, public/private cloud systems to train the machine learning models, and \"in-the-field,\" resource-constrained edge systems to perform classification near the IoT sensing devices (cameras). We deploy WTB at the UCSB Sedgwick Reserve, a 6000 acre site for environmental research and use it to aggregate, manage, and analyze over 1.12M images. WTB integrates Google TensorFlow and OpenCV applications to perform automatic image classification and tagging. To avoid transferring large numbers of training images for TensorFlow over the low-bandwidth network linking Sedgwick to public clouds, we devise a technique that uses stock Google Images to construct a synthetic training set using only a small number of empty, background images from Sedgwick. Our system is able to accurately identify bears, deer, coyotes, and emtpy images and significantly reduces the time and bandwidth requirements for image transfer, as well as end-user analysis time, since WTB automatically filters the images on-site.","author":["Andy Rosales Elias","Nevena Golubovic","Chandra Krintz","Rich Wolski"],"issue":["IoTDI '17: Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Internet-of-Things Design and Implementation","April 2017","Pages   247\u2013258","https://doi.org/10.1145/3054977.3054986"],"date":"18 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"M.

In related literature, the Harvest-Store-Use (HSU) model is usually utilized to describe the energy flow behavior of the EH system. However, the half-duplex (HD) constraint of HSU that harvested energy can only be used after being temporally stored in energy buffer may reduce effective transmission time. Thus, we first construct the full-duplex (FD) energy flow behavior model of the EH system where the harvested energy can be tuned to power load and being stored simultaneously. The FD model is then proved to be equivalent with the HSU model when time interval is small enough. Considering some key physical variabilities, for example, the wireless channel and the amount of harvested energy, the transmission adaptation problem for multiple relays embedded with FD EH systems is formulated with the objective to improve the utilization of the harvested energy. We tackle the problem by using a centralized optimization algorithm by jointly tuning the factors, including power control for source and relay nodes, relay selection and dynamic switching among four relay transmission mode, namely HD amplify-and-forward (AF), HD decode-and-forward (DF), FD AF, and FD DF. The centralized optimization algorithm is proposed on the basis of dual decomposition and serves as a benchmark. To enable relays to individually make their own decisions, a distributed algorithm with relatively higher complexity is given by using consensus optimization in conjunction with the alternating direction method of multipliers, and a sub-optimal algorithm with low complexity is provided. The proposed algorithms are shown to have good performance via simulations for a range of different EH rates and prediction errors.","author":["Zejue Wang","Hongjia Li","Dan Hu","Song Ci"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 17","Issue 1","January 2018","Article No.: 5","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3055513"],"date":"24 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"F.

This paper presents a novel dual-mode magnetic crossbar architecture consisting of perpendicularly cross-coupled magnetic racetrack nanowires, which could morph between non-volatile multi-bit racetrack memory mode and in-memory data encryption mode. The proposed magnetic crossbar is able to automatically perform parallel in-memory bit-wise XOR computations of the data stored in the racetrack memories with the help of magnetic coupling physics without complex peripheral circuits, which could be leveraged to design energy efficient in-memory data encryption engine. We employ Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to elucidate the efficiency of the proposed design. The device-to-architecture level simulation results show that the proposed architecture can achieve 70% and 17.5% lower energy consumption compared to CMOS-ASIC and recent domain wall (DW) AES implementations, respectively. In addition, the AES encryption speed increases by 29.7% compared to the DW-AES implementation.","author":["Zhezhi He","Shaahin Angizi","Farhana Parveen","Deliang Fan"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '17: Proceedings of the on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI 2017","May 2017","Pages   83\u201388","https://doi.org/10.1145/3060403.3060460"],"date":"10 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"Ncsu eda freepdk45, 2011.","order":1},{"text":"Z.

CiM can solve the memory-wall problem of classical Von Neumann-based computer systems by exploiting application-specific computational and data-flow patterns with the capability of performing both storage and computations of emerging resistive RAM technologies (e.g., memristors). However, to efficiently explore and design such radically new application-specific CiM architectures, we require fundamentally new algorithm specification and compilation techniques. In this paper, we introduce a domain-specific language to express not only the computational patterns of an algorithm but also its spatial characteristics. Furthermore, we design a compiler that is able to transform these patterns into highly-optimized CiM designs. Experiments demonstrate the functional correctness of the language and the compiler as well as an order of magnitude speedup improvement over a multicore system in both performance and energy costs.","author":["Jintao Yu","Tom Hogervorst","Razvan Nane"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '17: Proceedings of the on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI 2017","May 2017","Pages   71\u201376","https://doi.org/10.1145/3060403.3060474"],"date":"10 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"K.

However, many applications contain structured processing in addition to classification. Being able to map both neural network classification and structured computation onto the same platform is appealing from a system design perspective. In this paper, we perform a case study on mapping the feature extraction stage of pedestrian detection using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG) onto a neuromophic platform. We consider three implementations: one that approximates HoG using neuromorphic intrinsics, one that emulates HoG outputs using a trained network, and one that allows feature extraction to be absorbed into classification. The proposed feature extraction methods are implemented and evaluated on neuromorphic hardware (IBM Neurosynaptic System). Our study shows that both a designed approximation and a \"parroted\" emulation can achieve similar accuracy, and that the latter appears to better capitalize on limited training and resource budgets, compared to the absorbed approach, while also being more power efficient than the programmed approach by a factor of 6.5x-208x.","author":["Wei-Yu Tsai","Jinhang Choi","Tulika Parija","Priyanka Gomatam","Chita Das","John Sampson","Vijaykrishnan Narayanan"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 58","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062218"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"S.

However, conventional technologies are confronted with a clear scaling limit. Many recently proposed advanced transistor concepts are also facing an uphill battle in the lab because of necessary performance tradeoffs and limited scaling potential. We argue for a new pathway that could enable exponential scaling for multiple generations. This pathway involves layering multiple technologies that enable new functions beyond those available from conventional and newly proposed transistors. The key principles for this new pathway have been demonstrated through an interdisciplinary team effort at C-SPIN (a STARnet center), where systems designers, device builders, materials scientists and physicists have all worked under one umbrella to overcome key technology barriers. This paper reviews several successful outcomes from this effort on topics such as the spin memory, logic-in-memory, cognitive computing, stochastic and probabilistic computing and reconfigurable information processing.","author":["Jian-Ping Wang","Sachin S.

Our approach is built on the principles of Fresnel holography and double phase amplitude encoding with additional hardware, phase correction factors, and spatial light modulator encodings to achieve full color, high contrast and low noise holograms with high resolution and true per-pixel focal control. We provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of all holographic computation that integrates with the standard graphics pipeline and enables real-time (\u226590 Hz) calculation directly or through eye tracked approximations. A unified focus, aberration correction, and vision correction model, along with a user calibration process, accounts for any optical defects between the light source and retina. We use this optical correction ability not only to fix minor aberrations but to enable truly compact, eyeglasses-like displays with wide fields of view (80\u00b0) that would be inaccessible through conventional means. All functionality is evaluated across a series of hardware prototypes; we discuss remaining challenges to incorporate all features into a single device.","author":["Andrew Maimone","Andreas Georgiou","Joel S.

Especially in HW/SW codesign settings, system developers try to avoid the employment of a full-blown RTOS as far as possible. In OSEK-V, we mitigate this trade-off by a very aggressive tailoring of the concrete RTOS instance into the hardware. Instead of implementing generic OS components as custom hardware devices, we capture the actually possible application-kernel interactions as a finite-state machine and integrate the tailored RTOS semantics directly into the processor pipeline.

Error coding flexibility for wireless communication allows IoT applications to exploit the large tradeoff space in data rate, link distance and energy-efficiency. As a solution, we present a light-weight Galois Field (GF) processor to enable energy-efficient block coding and symmetric/asymmetric cryptography kernel processing for a wide range of GF sizes (2m, m = 2, 3, ..., 233) and arbitrary irreducible polynomials. Program directed connections among primitive GF arithmetic units enable dynamically configured parallelism to efficiently perform either four-way SIMD 5- to 8-bit GF operations, including multiplicative inverse, or a wide bit-width (e.g., 32-bit) GF product in a single cycle. To illustrate our ideas, we synthesized our GF processor in a 28nm technology. Compared to a baseline software implementation optimized for a general purpose ARM M0+ processor, our processor exhibits a 5-20 x speedup for a range of error correction codes and symmetric/asymmetric cryptography applications. Additionally, our proposed GF processor consumes 431\u03bcW at 0.9V and 100MHz, and achieves 35.5pJ/b energy efficiency while executing AES operations at 12.2Mbps. We achieve this within an area of 0.01mm2.","author":["Yajing Chen","Shengshuo Lu","Cheng Fu","David Blaauw","Ronald Dreslinski","Trevor Mudge","Hun-Seok Kim"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   55\u201368","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080227"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"ARM-M0+.

The promise of approximate computing is in its ability to render just enough performance to meet quality constraints. However, going from this theoretical promise to a practical implementation requires a clear comprehension of the system requirements and matching them to the design of approximations as the system is implemented. This involves the tasks of (a) identifying the design space of potential approximations, (b) modeling the injected error as a function of the level of approximation, and (c) optimizing the system over the design space to maximize a metric, typically the power savings, under constraints on the maximum allowable degradation. Often, the error may be introduced at a low level of design (e.g., at the level of a full adder) but its impact must be percolated up to system-level error metrics (e.g., PSNR in a compressed image), and a practical approach must devise a coherent and quantifiable way of translating between error/power tradeoffs at all levels of design.","author":["Chaofan Li","Deepashree Sengupta","Farhana Sharmin Snigdha","Wenbin Xu","Jiang Hu","Sachin S.

The emergence of \"killer\" applications such as data-intensive recognition, mining, and synthesis (RMS) applications puts even more stress on the memory subsystem and exacerbates its energy consumption. Traditional mechanisms to ensure data integrity deploy overdesign (e.g., redundancy and error detection/correction) and/or guard-banding that consumes a significant part of the energy consumed in the memory subsystem. We explore opportunities for energy efficiency by exploiting the intrinsic tolerance of a vast class of approximate computing applications to some level of error in the on-chip memory hierarchy.

However, because of relatively high latency and low bandwidth of NVM, NVM is often paired with DRAM to build a heterogeneous memory system (HMS). As a result, data objects of the application must be carefully placed to NVM and DRAM for best performance. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight runtime solution that automatically and transparently manage data placement on HMS without the requirement of hardware modifications and disruptive change to applications. Leveraging online profiling and performance models, the runtime characterizes memory access patterns associated with data objects, and minimizes unnecessary data movement. Our runtime solution effectively bridges the performance gap between NVM and DRAM. We demonstrate that using NVM to replace the majority of DRAM can be a feasible solution for future HPC systems with the assistance of a software-based data management.","author":["Kai Wu","Yingchao Huang","Dong Li"],"issue":["SC '17: Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2017","Article No.: 58","Pages   1\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/3126908.3126923"],"date":"12 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"N.

The emerging Keyless SSL solution retains on-premise custody of customers' SSL private keys on their own servers. However, it suffers from significant performance degradation and limited scalability, caused by the long distance connection to Key Server for each new coming end-user request. The performance improvements using persistent session and key caching onto cloud will degrade the key invulnerability and discourage the website owners because of the cloud's security bugs. In this paper, the challenges of secured key protection and distribution are addressed in philosophy of \"Storing the trusted DATA on untrusted platform and transmitting through untrusted channel\". To this end, a three-phase hierarchical key management scheme, called STYX1 is proposed to provide the secured key protection together with hardware assisted service acceleration for cloud-based content delivery network (CCDN) applications. The STYX is implemented based on Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), Intel QuickAssist Technology (QAT) and SIGMA (SIGn-and-MAc) protocol. STYX can provide the tight key security guarantee by SGX based key distribution with a light overhead, and it can further significantly enhance the system performance with QAT based acceleration. The comprehensive evaluations show that the STYX not only guarantees the absolute security but also outperforms the direct HTTPS server deployed CDN without QAT by up to 5x throughput with significant latency reduction at the same time.","author":["Changzheng Wei","Jian Li","Weigang Li","Ping Yu","Haibing Guan"],"issue":["SoCC '17: Proceedings of the 2017 Symposium on Cloud Computing","September 2017","Pages   201\u2013213","https://doi.org/10.1145/3127479.3127482"],"date":"24 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"Intel corp., intel quickassist technology. https://01.org/packet-processing/intel","order":1},{"text":"Intel corp., intel software guard extensions: Intel attestation service api. https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/3d/c8/IAS_1_0_API_spec_1_1_Final.pdf.","order":2},{"text":"Intel corp., intel software guard extensions (intel sgx). https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx.","order":3},{"text":"Intel corp, intel\u00c2\u0151 xeon\u00c2\u0151 processor e5-2600 v2 product family and intel\u00c2\u0151 communications chipset 89xx series,. https://wwwssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/intelligent-systems/highland-forest/xeon-e5-2600-v2-large-scale-communications-brief.html.","order":4},{"text":"Amazon.

Modern DCNNs involve many millions of parameters and billions of operations. Inference using such DCNNs, if implemented as software running on an embedded processor, results in considerable execution time and energy consumption, which is prohibitive in many mobile applications. Field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based acceleration of DCNN inference is a promising approach to improve both energy consumption and classification throughput. However, the engineering effort required for development and verification of an optimized FPGA-based architecture is significant.In this article, we present PLACID, an automated PLatform for Accelerator CreatIon for DCNNs. PLACID uses an analytical approach to characterization and exploration of the implementation space. PLACID enables generation of an accelerator with the highest throughput for a given DCNN on a specific target FPGA platform. Subsequently, it generates an RTL level architecture in Verilog, which can be passed onto commercial tools for FPGA implementation. PLACID is fully automated, and reduces the accelerator design time from a few months down to a few hours. Experimental results show that architectures synthesized by PLACID yield 2\u00d7 higher throughput density than the best competing approach.","author":["Mohammad Motamedi","Philipp Gysel","Soheil Ghiasi"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications","Volume 13","Issue 4","October 2017","Article No.: 62","pp   1\u201321","https://doi.org/10.1145/3131289"],"date":"18 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u0131n Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen, Craig Citro, Greg S.

It has the potential to become the universal memory that could be incorporated to all levels of memory hierarchy. Although STT-MRAM technology got significant attention of various major memory manufacturers, to this day, academic research of STT-MRAM main memory remains marginal. This is mainly due to the unavailability of publicly available detailed timing parameters which are required to perform a cycle accurate main memory simulation. Our study presents a detailed analysis of STT-MRAM main memory timing and propose an approach to perform a reliable system level simulation of the memory technology. We seamlessly incorporate STT-MRAM timing parameters into DRAMSim2 memory simulator and use it as a part of the simulation infrastructure of the high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Our results suggests that, STT-MRAM main memory would provide performance comparable to DRAM, while opening up various opportunities for HPC system improvements. Most importantly, our study enables researchers to conduct reliable system level research on STT-MRAM main memory, and to explore the opportunities that this technology has to offer.","author":["Kazi Asifuzzaman","Rommel S\u00e1nchez Verdejo","Petar Radojkovi\u0107"],"issue":["MEMSYS '17: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Memory Systems","October 2017","Pages   283\u2013292","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132402.3132416"],"date":"02 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Peter Kogge, et al.

On the hardware side, the market for storage devices has diversified to a multi-layer storage topology spanning multiple orders of magnitude in cost and performance. Above the file system, applications increasingly need to process small, random IO on vast data sets with low latency, high throughput, and simple crash consistency. File systems designed for a single storage layer cannot support all of these demands together. We present Strata, a cross-media file system that leverages the strengths of one storage media to compensate for weaknesses of another. In doing so, Strata provides performance, capacity, and a simple, synchronous IO model all at once, while having a simpler design than that of file systems constrained by a single storage device. At its heart, Strata uses a log-structured approach with a novel split of responsibilities among user mode, kernel, and storage layers that separates the concerns of scalable, high-performance persistence from storage layer management. We quantify the performance benefits of Strata using a 3-layer storage hierarchy of emulated NVM, a flash-based SSD, and a high-density HDD. Strata has 20-30% better latency and throughput, across several unmodified applications, compared to file systems purpose-built for each layer, while providing synchronous and unified access to the entire storage hierarchy. Finally, Strata achieves up to 2.8x better throughput than a block-based 2-layer cache provided by Linux's logical volume manager.","author":["Youngjin Kwon","Henrique Fingler","Tyler Hunt","Simon Peter","Emmett Witchel","Thomas Anderson"],"issue":["SOSP '17: Proceedings of the 26th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","October 2017","Pages   460\u2013477","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132747.3132770"],"date":"14 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"2014.

On the one hand, its low cost, easy access, and rapid dissemination of information lead people to seek out and consume news from social media. On the other hand, it enables the wide spread of \\fake news\", i.e., low quality news with intentionally false information. The extensive spread of fake news has the potential for extremely negative impacts on individuals and society. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has recently become an emerging research that is attracting tremendous attention. Fake news detection on social media presents unique characteristics and challenges that make existing detection algorithms from traditional news media ine ective or not applicable. First, fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers to believe false information, which makes it difficult and nontrivial to detect based on news content; therefore, we need to include auxiliary information, such as user social engagements on social media, to help make a determination. Second, exploiting this auxiliary information is challenging in and of itself as users' social engagements with fake news produce data that is big, incomplete, unstructured, and noisy. Because the issue of fake news detection on social media is both challenging and relevant, we conducted this survey to further facilitate research on the problem. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of detecting fake news on social media, including fake news characterizations on psychology and social theories, existing algorithms from a data mining perspective, evaluation metrics and representative datasets. We also discuss related research areas, open problems, and future research directions for fake news detection on social media.","author":["Kai Shu","Amy Sliva","Suhang Wang","Jiliang Tang","Huan Liu"],"issue":["ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter","Volume 19","Issue 1","June 2017","pp   22\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/3137597.3137600"],"date":"01 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"Sadia Afroz, Michael Brennan, and Rachel Greenstadt.

Flat-COTE is an ensemble that combines 35 classifiers over four data representations. However, while comprehensive, the evaluation did not consider deep learning approaches. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have seen a surge in popularity and are now state of the art in many fields and raises the question of whether CNNs could be equally transformative for TSC.We implement a benchmark CNN for TSC using a common structure and use results from a TSC-specific CNN from the literature. We compare both to Flat-COTE and find that the collective is significantly more accurate than both CNNs. These results are impressive, but Flat-COTE is not without deficiencies. We significantly improve the collective by proposing a new hierarchical structure with probabilistic voting, defining and including two novel ensemble classifiers built in existing feature spaces, and adding further modules to represent two additional transformation domains. The resulting classifier, the Hierarchical Vote Collective of Transformation-based Ensembles (HIVE-COTE), encapsulates classifiers built on five data representations. We demonstrate that HIVE-COTE is significantly more accurate than Flat-COTE (and all other TSC algorithms that we are aware of) over 100 resamples of 85 TSC problems and is the new state of the art for TSC. Further analysis is included through the introduction and evaluation of 3 new case studies and extensive experimentation on 1,000 simulated datasets of 5 different types.","author":["Jason Lines","Sarah Taylor","Anthony Bagnall"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data","Volume 12","Issue 5","October 2018","Article No.: 52","pp   1\u201335","https://doi.org/10.1145/3182382"],"date":"05 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"A.

The concurrency control is that portion of the system that responds to the read and write requests of the application programs. Its job is to maintain the global consistency of the distributed database while ensuring that the termination of the application programs is not prevented by phenomena such as deadlock. We assume each individual site has its own local concurrency control which responds to requests at that site and can only communicate with concurrency controls at other sites when an application program moves from site to site, terminates, or aborts.This paper presents designs for several distributed concurrency controls and demonstrates that they work correctly.

To solve this problem, one usually calculates certain graph statistics (i.e., graph features) that help discriminate between graphs of different classes. When calculating such features, most existing approaches process the entire graph. In a graphlet-based approach, for instance, the entire graph is processed to get the total count of different graphlets or subgraphs. In many real-world applications, however, graphs can be noisy with discriminative patterns confined to certain regions in the graph only. In this work, we study the problem of attention-based graph classification. The use of attention allows us to focus on small but informative parts of the graph, avoiding noise in the rest of the graph. We present a novel RNN model, called the Graph Attention Model (GAM), that processes only a portion of the graph by adaptively selecting a sequence of \"informative\" nodes. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed method is competitive against various well-known methods in graph classification even though our method is limited to only a portion of the graph.","author":["John Boaz Lee","Ryan Rossi","Xiangnan Kong"],"issue":["KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2018","Pages   1666\u20131674","https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3219980"],"date":"19 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Nesreen K.

Despite their proliferation, currently there is no study of their robustness to adversarial attacks. Yet, in domains where they are likely to be used, e.g. the web, adversaries are common. Can deep learning models for graphs be easily fooled? In this work, we introduce the first study of adversarial attacks on attributed graphs, specifically focusing on models exploiting ideas of graph convolutions. In addition to attacks at test time, we tackle the more challenging class of poisoning/causative attacks, which focus on the training phase of a machine learning model.We generate adversarial perturbations targeting the node's features and the graph structure, thus, taking the dependencies between instances in account. Moreover, we ensure that the perturbations remain unnoticeable by preserving important data characteristics. To cope with the underlying discrete domain we propose an efficient algorithm Nettack exploiting incremental computations. Our experimental study shows that accuracy of node classification significantly drops even when performing only few perturbations. Even more, our attacks are transferable: the learned attacks generalize to other state-of-the-art node classification models and unsupervised approaches, and likewise are successful even when only limited knowledge about the graph is given.","author":["Daniel Z\u00fcgner","Amir Akbarnejad","Stephan G\u00fcnnemann"],"issue":["KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2018","Pages   2847\u20132856","https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3220078"],"date":"19 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Lada A Adamic and Natalie Glance . 2005.

In an FCN, traditional convolutional layers and deconvolutional layers contribute to the majority of the computation complexity. However, prior deep learning accelerator designs mostly focus on CNN optimization. They either use independent compute-resources to handle deconvolution or convert deconvolutional layers (Deconv) into general convolution operations, which arouses considerable overhead. To address this problem, we propose a unified fully convolutional accelerator aiming to handle both the deconvolutional and convolutional layers with a single processing element (PE) array. We re-optimize the conventional CNN accelerator architecture of regular 2D processing elements array, to enable it more efficiently support the data flow of deconvolutional layer inference. By exploiting the locality in deconvolutional filters, this architecture reduces the consumption of on-chip memory communication from 24.79 GB to 6.56 GB and improves the power efficiency significantly. Compared to prior baseline deconvolution acceleration scheme, the proposed accelerator achieves 1.3X -- 44.9X speedup and reduces the energy consumption by 14.6%-97.6% on a set of representative benchmark applications. Meanwhile, it keeps similar CNN inference performance to that of an optimized CNN-only accelerator with negligible power consumption and chip area overhead.","author":["Dawen Xu","Kaijie Tu","Ying Wang","Cheng Liu","Bingsheng He","Huawei Li"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 22","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240810"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"Han S, Liu X, Mao H, et al., EIE: efficient inference engine on compressed deep neural network.

To solve these questions, a novel crowdsensing quality control model is proposed in this paper. First, the idea of blockchain is introduced into this model. The credit-based verifier selection mechanism and twice consensuses are proposed to realize the non-repudiation and non-tampering of information in crowdsensing. Then, the quality grading evaluation (QGE) is put forward, in which the method of truth discovery and the idea of fuzzy theories are combined to evaluate the quality of sensing data, and the garbled circuit is used to ensure that evaluation criteria can not be leaked. Finally, the Experiments show that our model is feasible in time and effective in quality evaluation.","author":["Danwei Liang","Jian An","Jindong Cheng","He Yang","Ruowei Gui"],"issue":["UbiComp '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM International Joint Conference and 2018 International Symposium on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and Wearable Computers","October 2018","Pages   630\u2013635","https://doi.org/10.1145/3267305.3267547"],"date":"08 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Ganti, R.

Analog crossbar is built by the analog multiplier processing matrix and bitwise multiplications. We have shown that using current signals as internal transmission signals can largely reduce computation delay, compared to the digital implementation. We also have introduced analog blocks to work as activation functions for the algorithm. In the back-end of our design, we have used current comparators to achieve the output to be readable to external digital systems. We have designed the LSTM network with the matrix size of 16 \u00d7 16 in TSMC 180nm CMOS technology.

Existing graph embedding techniques either sample a large number of node pairs from a graph to learn node embeddings via stochastic optimization, or factorize a high-order proximity/adjacency matrix of the graph via expensive matrix factorization. However, these techniques usually require significant computational resources for the learning process, which hinders their applications on large-scale graphs. Moreover, the cosine similarity preserved by these techniques shows suboptimal efficiency in downstream graph analysis tasks, compared to Hamming similarity, for example. To address these issues, we propose NodeSketch, a highly-efficient graph embedding technique preserving high-order node proximity via recursive sketching. Specifically, built on top of an efficient data-independent hashing/sketching technique, NodeSketch generates node embeddings in Hamming space. For an input graph, it starts by sketching the self-loop-augmented adjacency matrix of the graph to output low-order node embeddings, and then recursively generates k-order node embeddings based on the self-loop-augmented adjacency matrix and (k-1)-order node embeddings. Our extensive evaluation compares NodeSketch against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques using five real-world graphs on two graph analysis tasks. The results show that NodeSketch achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to these techniques, while showing significant speedup of 9x-372x in the embedding learning process and 1.19x-1.68x speedup when performing downstream graph analysis tasks.","author":["Dingqi Yang","Paolo Rosso","Bin Li","Philippe Cudre-Mauroux"],"issue":["KDD '19: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2019","Pages   1162\u20131172","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292500.3330951"],"date":"25 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"Alex Arenas, Alberto Fernandez, and Sergio Gomez. 2008.

TensorFlow and Cloud TPU framework enable the simple and readable code to express the complicated distributed algorithm without compromising the performance. Our code implementation fits into a small Jupyter Notebook and fully utilizes Cloud TPU's efficient matrix operation and dedicated high speed inter-chip connection. The performance is highly competitive: it outperforms the best published benchmarks to our knowledge by 60% in single-core and 250% in multi-core with good linear scaling. When compared to Tesla V100 GPU, the single-core performance maintains a ~10% gain.

To bridge the knowledge gap, in this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of deep learning in browsers. We survey 7 most popular JavaScript-based deep learning frameworks, investigating to what extent deep learning tasks have been supported in browsers so far. Then we measure the performance of different frameworks when running different deep learning tasks. Finally, we dig out the performance gap between deep learning in browsers and on native platforms by comparing the performance of TensorFlow.js and TensorFlow in Python.

Although CNN brings many advantages to several AI applications, the longer computing time and the larger computing power still restrict the system performance significantly. Therefore, the hardware-efficient CNN accelerator design receives much attention in recent years. However, because of the intensively complicated computation and communication among the CNN operation, the interconnection between each CNN computing unit becomes complicated as the CNN size is scaling up. On the other hand, the Network-on-chip (NoC) interconnection has been proposed to solve the complex communication problem, which is an attractive interconnection to construct the hardware-efficient CNN design. To evaluate the NoC-based CNN design in the system level, we present a cycle-accurate NoC-based convolutional neural network simulator, CNN-Noxim, in this paper. The proposed CNN-Noxim can simulate the CNN models and the classification precision of the simulation output is verified by Keras. Consequently, the proposed NoC-based CNN simulator is a high flexible neural network simulator, which facilitates the evaluation of the NoC-based convolutional neural network design.","author":["Kun-Chih Jimmy Chen","Ting-Yi George Wang","Yueh-Chi Andrew Yang"],"issue":["COINS '19: Proceedings of the International Conference on Omni-Layer Intelligent Systems","May 2019","Pages   199\u2013204","https://doi.org/10.1145/3312614.3312655"],"date":"05 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, existing modeling techniques do not meet the requirements to provide accurate estimations of relevant performance metrics such as delay and jitter. In this paper we propose a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model able to understand the complex relationship between topology, routing and input traffic to produce accurate estimates of the per-source/destination pair mean delay and jitter. GNN are tailored to learn and model information structured as graphs and as a result, our model is able to generalize over arbitrary topologies, routing schemes and variable traffic intensity. In the paper we show that our model provides accurate estimates of delay and jitter (worst case R2 = 0.86) when testing against topologies, routing and traffic not seen during training. In addition, we present the potential of the model for network operation by presenting several use-cases that show its effective use in per-source/destination pair delay/jitter routing optimization and its generalization capabilities by reasoning in topologies and routing schemes not seen during training.","author":["Krzysztof Rusek","Jos\u00e9 Su\u00e1rez-Varela","Albert Mestres","Pere Barlet-Ros","Albert Cabellos-Aparicio"],"issue":["SOSR '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM Symposium on SDN Research","April 2019","Pages   140\u2013151","https://doi.org/10.1145/3314148.3314357"],"date":"03 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"{n. d.}.

The role of paper flight strips in air traffic control","abstract":"Air traffic control is a complex, safety-critical activity, with well-established and successful work practices. Yet many attempts to automate the existing system have failed because controllers remain attached to a key work artifact: the paper flight strip. This article describes a four-month intensive study of a team of Paris en-route controllers in order to understand their use of paper flight strips. The article also describes a comparison study of eight different control rooms in France and the Netherlands. Our observations have convinced us that we do not know enough to simply get rid of paper strips, nor can we easily replace the physical interaction between controllers and paper strips.These observationshighlight the benefits of strips, including qualities difficult to quantify and replicate in new computer systems. Current thinking offers two basic alternatives: maintaining the existing strips without computer\nsupport and bearing the financial cost of limiting the air traffic, or replacing the strips with automated versions, which offer potential benefits in terms of increased efficiency through automation, but unknown risks through radical change of work practices. We conclude with a\nsuggestion for a third alternative: to maintain the physical strips, but turn them into the interface to the computer. This would allow controllers to build directly upon their existing, safe work practices with paper strips, while offering them a gradual path for incorporating new computer-based functions. Augmented paper flight strips allow us to take advantage of uniquely human skills in the physical world, and allows us to leave the user interface and its subsequent evolution in the hands of the people most responsible, the air traffic controllers themselves.","author":["Wendy E.

In this paper, we develop a meta-model using Low-Rank Tensor Approximation (LRTA) to substitute expensive SPICE simulation. The polynomial degree of our LRTA model grows linearly with circuit dimension. This makes it especially promising for high-dimensional circuit problems. Our LRTA meta-model is solved efficiently with a robust greedy algorithm, and calibrated iteratively with an adaptive sampling method. Experiments on bit cell and SRAM column validate that proposed LRTA method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.","author":["Xiao Shi","Hao Yan","Qiancun Huang","Jiajia Zhang","Longxing Shi","Lei He"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 150","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317863"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"Lara Dolecek, Masood Qazi, Devavrat Shah, and Anantha Chandrakasan.

Since memories are the dominating component of a System-on-Chip, the overall performance of the system is highly dependent on that memories. Nevertheless, the high write energy and latency of the emerging STT-MRAM are the most challenging design issues in a modern computing system. By relaxing the non-volatility of these devices, it is possible to reduce the write energy and latency costs, at the expense of reducing the retention time, which in turn may lead to loss of data. In this article, we propose a hybrid STT-MRAM design for caches with different retention capabilities. Then, based on the application requirements (i.e., execution time and memory access rate), program data layout is re-arranged at compilation time for achieving fast and energy-efficient hybrid STT-MRAM on-chip memory design with no reliability degradation. The application requirements have been defined at function granularity based on profiling and compiler-level analysis, which estimate the required retention time and memory access rate, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid STT-MRAM cache combined with profiling-based and compiler-level analysis for the data re-arranging, on average, reduces the write energy per access by 49.7%. At system level, overall static and dynamic energy of the cache are reduced by 8.1% and 44%, respectively, whereas, the system performance has been improved up to 8.1%.","author":["Nour Sayed","Longfei Mao","Rajendra Bishnoi","Mehdi B.

NSGA-Net is designed with three goals in mind: (1) a procedure considering multiple and conflicting objectives, (2) an efficient procedure balancing exploration and exploitation of the space of potential neural network architectures, and (3) a procedure finding a diverse set of trade-off network architectures achieved in a single run. NSGA-Net is a population-based search algorithm that explores a space of potential neural network architectures in three steps, namely, a population initialization step that is based on prior-knowledge from hand-crafted architectures, an exploration step comprising crossover and mutation of architectures, and finally an exploitation step that utilizes the hidden useful knowledge stored in the entire history of evaluated neural architectures in the form of a Bayesian Network. Experimental results suggest that combining the dual objectives of minimizing an error metric and computational complexity, as measured by FLOPs, allows NSGA-Net to find competitive neural architectures. Moreover, NSGA-Net achieves error rate on the CIFAR-10 dataset on par with other state-of-the-art NAS methods while using orders of magnitude less computational resources. These results are encouraging and shows the promise to further use of EC methods in various deep-learning paradigms.","author":["Zhichao Lu","Ian Whalen","Vishnu Boddeti","Yashesh Dhebar","Kalyanmoy Deb","Erik Goodman","Wolfgang Banzhaf"],"issue":["GECCO '19: Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference","July 2019","Pages   419\u2013427","https://doi.org/10.1145/3321707.3321729"],"date":"13 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"Bowen Baker, Otkrist Gupta, Nikhil Naik, and Ramesh Raskar. 2017.

To prevent the existence of backdoors, the concept of rigidity was introduced in the specific context of curve generation. The idea is to first state a strict scope statement for the properties that the curve needs to have and then pick e.g. the one with the smallest parameters. The aim is to ensure that the designers did not have the degrees of freedom that allows the addition of a trapdoor. In this paper, we apply this approach to symmetric algorithms. The task is challenging because the corresponding primitives are more complex: they consist of several sub-components of different types, and the properties required by these sub-components to achieve the desired security level are not as clearly defined. Furthermore, security often comes in this case from the interplay between these components rather than from their individual properties. In this paper, we argue that it is nevertheless necessary to demand that symmetric algorithms have a similar but, due to their different nature, more complex property which we call \"unswervingness''. We motivate this need via a study of the literature on symmetric \"kleptography'' and via the study of some real-world standards. We then suggest some guidelines that could be used to leverage the unswervingness of a symmetric algorithm to standardize a highly trusted and equally safe variant of it.","author":["Orr Dunkelman","L\u00e9o Perrin"],"issue":["SSR'19: Proceedings of the 5th ACM Workshop on Security Standardisation Research Workshop","November 2019","Pages   69\u201380","https://doi.org/10.1145/3338500.3360335"],"date":"11 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"AES 2001.

In particular, we focus on the implementation of Approximate Triple Modular Redundancy (ATMR) designs using the precision reduction technique. The proposed method is applied to two benchmarks and a multitude of ATMR designs with different degrees of approximation. The benchmarks are implemented on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 APSoC FPGA through high-level synthesis and evaluated concerning area usage and the inaccuracy caused by approximation. Fault injection experiments are performed by flipping bits of the FPGA configuration bitstream. Results show that the proposed approximation method can decrease the DSP usage of the hardware implementation up to 80% and the number of sensitive configuration bits up to 75% while maintaining an accuracy of more than 99.96%.","author":["Gennaro S.

Some are related to common procedures, such as searching in files and text editors, or, more recently, to more advanced problems such as pattern detection in Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics. Tens of algorithms and methodologies have been developed for pattern matching and several programming languages, packages, applications and online systems exist that can perform exact string matching in biological sequences. These techniques, however, are limited to searching for specific and predefined strings in a sequence. In this paper a novel methodology (called Ex2SM) is presented, which is a pipeline of execution of advanced data structures and algorithms, explicitly designed for text mining, that can detect every possible repeated string in multivariate biological sequences. In contrast to known algorithms in literature, the methodology presented here is string agnostic, i.e., it does not require an input string to search for it, rather it can detect every string that exists at least twice, regardless of its attributes such as length, frequency, alphabet, overlapping etc. The complexity of the problem solved and the potential of the proposed methodology is demonstrated with the experimental analysis performed on the entire human genome. More specifically, all repeated strings with a length of up to 50 characters have been detected, an achievement which is practically impossible using other algorithms due to the exponential number of possible arrangements [EQUATION] of such long strings.","author":["Konstantinos F.

However, existing solutions did not address the key challenge of graph processing---irregular data movements. This paper proposes GraphQ, an improved PIM-based graph processing architecture over recent architecture Tesseract, that fundamentally eliminates irregular data movements. GraphQ is inspired by ideas from distributed graph processing and irregular applications to enable static and structured communication with runtime and architecture co-design. Specifically, GraphQ realizes: 1) batched and overlapped inter-cube communication by reordering vertex processing order; 2) streamlined inter-cube communication by using heterogeneous cores for different access types. Moreover, to tackle the discrepancy between inter-cube and inter-node bandwidth, we propose a hybrid execution model that performs additional local computation during the inter-node communication. This model is general enough and applicable to asynchronous iterative algorithms that can tolerate bounded stale values. Putting all together, GraphQ simultaneously maximizes intra-cube, inter-cube, and inter-node communication throughput. In a zSim-based simulator with five real-world graphs and four algorithms, GraphQ achieves on average 3.3\u00d7 and maximum 13.9\u00d7 speedup, 81% energy saving compared with Tesseract. We show that increasing memory size in PIM also proportionally increases compute capability: a 4-node GraphQ achieves 98.34\u00d7 speedup compared with a single node with the same memory size and conventional memory hierarchy.","author":["Youwei Zhuo","Chao Wang","Mingxing Zhang","Rui Wang","Dimin Niu","Yanzhi Wang","Xuehai Qian"],"issue":["MICRO '52: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","October 2019","Pages   712\u2013725","https://doi.org/10.1145/3352460.3358256"],"date":"12 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Junwhan Ahn, Sungpack Hong, Sungjoo Yoo, Onur Mutlu, and Kiyoung Choi. 2015.

The smaller dimensions of monolithic inter-tier vias offer high-density integration, the flexibility of partitioning logic blocks across multiple tiers, and significantly reduced total wire-length enable high-performance and energy-efficiency. However, the performance of M3D ICs degrades due to the presence of electrostatic coupling when the inter-layer-dielectric thickness between two adjacent tiers is less than 50nm. In this work, we evaluate the performance of an M3D-enabled Network-on-chip (NoC) architecture in the presence of electrostatic coupling. Electrostatic coupling induces significant delay and energy overheads for the multi-tier NoC routers. This in turn results in considerable performance degradation if the NoC design methodology does not incorporate the effects of electrostatic coupling. We demonstrate that electrostatic coupling degrades the energy-delay-product of an M3D NoC by 18.1% averaged over eight different applications from SPLASH-2 and PARSEC benchmark suites. As a countermeasure, we advocate the adoption of electrostatic coupling-aware M3D NoC design methodology. Experimental results show that the coupling-aware M3D NoC reduces performance penalty by lowering the number of multi-tier routers significantly.","author":["Dongjin Lee","Sourav Das","Janardhan Rao Doppa","Partha Pratim Pande","Krishnendu Chakrabarty"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 24","Issue 6","November 2019","Article No.: 62","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/3357158"],"date":"17 September 2019","ref":[{"text":"K.

Implementing STT-MRAM similar to traditional DRAM memory, that is keeping the same policies while only replacing the technology, however, severely limits the goodness that this new technology can offer. STT-MRAM needs to employ current sense amps which require an order of magnitude more space and power than typical DRAM voltage sense amps. To manage the high cost of sense amps, STT-MRAM decouples bit-lines from sense amps and shares one sense amp across 16 to 128 bit-lines, exploiting the non-destructive nature of its read operation. This sense amp sharing reduces the size of row buffers and, as a result, incur more row-buffer misses (i.e., higher activation energy and lower performance). Other issues arise if STT-MRAM is required to be compatible with current DRAM interfaces and policies. To cost-effectively address these issues, we propose SMART, which, unlike DRAM and conventional STT-MRAM, proposes sensing bit-lines after receiving a column access command instead of a row activation command. This results in several benefits: larger pages, fewer sense amps, lower activation power, higher bank-level parallelism, shorter latency, fewer address pins, and more efficient repairing of defective columns than conventional STT-MRAM. Our evaluation shows that SMART consumes 11% (39%) lower energy while providing 9% (5%) higher performance than conventional STT-MRAM (DRAM) on average. In addition to these benefits, SMART is 6% smaller than conventional STT-MRAM.","author":["Byoungchan Oh","Nilmini Abeyratne","Nam Sung Kim","Ronald G.

Fortunately, edge computing can optimize problems such as delay and connectivity by offloading part of the computational tasks to edge nodes close to the data source. Using this feature, IoT devices can save more resources while still maintaining the quality of service. However, since computation offloading decisions concern joint and complex resource management, we use multiple Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents deployed on IoT devices to guide their own decisions. Besides, Federated Learning (FL) is utilized to train DRL agents in a distributed fashion, aiming to make the DRL-based decision making practical and further decrease the transmission cost between IoT devices and Edge Nodes. In this article, we first study the problem of computation offloading optimization and prove the problem is an NP-hard problem. Then, based on DRL and FL, we propose an offloading algorithm that is different from the traditional method. Finally, we studied the effects of various parameters on the performance of the algorithm and verified the effectiveness of both the DRL and FL in the IoT system.","author":["Shihao Shen","Yiwen Han","Xiaofei Wang","Yan Wang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks","Volume 16","Issue 1","February 2020","Article No.: 8","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/3372025"],"date":"19 December 2019","ref":[{"text":"Nasir Abbas, Yan Zhang, Amir Taherkordi, and Tor Skeie. 2017.

Traditional experimental identification and validation of these interactions are still time-consuming, expensive, and do not have a high success rate. To improve this identification process, development of computational methods to predict and rank likely drug-target interactions (DTI) with minimum error rate would be of great help. In this work, we propose a computational method for (Drug-Target interaction prediction using Graph Embedding and graph Mining), DTiGEM. DTiGEM models identify novel DTIs as a link prediction problem in a heterogeneous graph constructed by integrating three networks, namely: drug-drug similarity, target-target similarity, and known DTIs. DTiGEM combines different techniques, including graph embeddings (e.g., node2vec), graph mining (e.g., path scores between drugs and targets), and machine learning (e.g., different classifiers). DTiGEM achieves improvement in the prediction performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods for computational prediction of DTIs on four benchmark datasets in terms of area under precision-recall curve (AUPR). Specifically, we demonstrate that based on the average AUPR score across all benchmark datasets, DTiGEM achieves the highest average AUPR value (0.831), thus reducing the prediction error by 22.4% relative to the second-best performing method in the comparison.","author":["Maha A.

The subject knowledge graph is constructed based on educational big data by using a bootstrapping strategy to gradually expand knowledge points and connections between them. In this paper two different datasets are used. One is the subject teaching resources such as syllabuses, teaching plans, textbooks and etc., which is used to automatically construct the core of subject knowledge graph so as to reduce the dependence on the manual annotation. Meanwhile the high-quality of subject teaching resources is the guarantee of accuracy of the knowledge graph core. The other dataset is the massive Internet encyclopedia texts, which is used to expand and complete the subject knowledge graph. As to algorithm, this paper utilizes the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model to automatically identify the subject knowledge points, and then evaluates the relationship between the knowledge points by calculating their semantic similarity, PMI and Normalized Google Distance between them. The experimental results show that BERT-BiLSTM-CRF outperforms the baselines significantly, and the three kinds of relationship evaluation models have achieved good results. Finally, computer science and physics science are taken as examples to construct the subject knowledge graphs successfully, which show the effectiveness of our method.","author":["Ying Su","Yong Zhang"],"issue":["ICBDE '20: Proceedings of the 2020 The 3rd International Conference on Big Data and Education","April 2020","Pages   30\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/3396452.3396458"],"date":"01 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"Bo Xu, Chenhao Xie, Yi Zhang, Yanghua Xiao, Haixun Wang and Wei Wang.

Resistive-memory-based processing-in-memory (ReRAM-based PIM) has been extensively studied to accelerate either convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN). According to the requirements of their core layers, i.e. convolutional layers and linear layers, the existing ReRAM-based PIMs adopt different optimization schemes for them. Directly deploying multi-modal DNNs on the existing ReRAM-based PIMs, however, is inefficient because multi-modal DNNs have combined CNN and RNN where the primary layers differ depending on the specific tasks. Therefore, a high-efficiency ReRAM-based PIM design for multi-modal DNNs necessitates an adaptive optimization to the given network. In this work, we propose HitM, a high-throughput ReRAM-based PIM for multi-modal DNNs with a two-stage workflow, which consists of a static analysis and an adaptive optimization. The static analysis generates the layer-wise resource and computation information with the input multi-modal DNN description and the adaptive optimization produces a high-throughput ReRAM-based PIM design through the dynamic algorithm based on hardware resources and the information from the static analysis. We evaluated HitM using several popular multi-modal DNNs with different parameters and structures and compared it with a na\u00efve ReRAM-based PIM design and an optimal-throughput ReRAM-based PIM design that assumes no hardware resource limitations. The experimental results show that HitM averagely achieves 78.01% of the optimal throughput while consumes 64.52% of the total hardware resources.","author":["Bing Li","Ying Wang","Yiran Chen"],"issue":["ICCAD '20: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2020","Article No.: 105","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.1145/3400302.3415663"],"date":"02 November 2020","ref":[{"text":"Stanislaw Antol, Aishwarya Agrawal, and et. al. 2015.

Moreover, these FPGA systems need to be maintainable and adaptable to changing workloads while improving accessibility for the application developers. However, current FPGA systems fail to achieve modularity and support for multi-tenancy due to dependencies between system components and the lack of standardised abstraction layers. To solve this, we introduce a modular FPGA operating system \u2013 FOS, which adopts a modular FPGA development flow to allow each system component to be changed and be agnostic to the heterogeneity of EDA tool versions, hardware and software layers. Further, to dynamically maximise the utilisation transparently from the users, FOS employs resource-elastic scheduling to arbitrate the FPGA resources in both time and spatial domain for any type of accelerators. Our evaluation on different FPGA boards shows that FOS can provide performance improvements in both single-tenant and multi-tenant environments while substantially reducing the development time and, at the same time, improving flexibility.","author":["Anuj Vaishnav","Khoa Dang Pham","Joseph Powell","Dirk Koch"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 13","Issue 4","October 2020","Article No.: 20","pp   1\u201328","https://doi.org/10.1145/3405794"],"date":"09 September 2020","ref":[{"text":"A.

Here, we prove several results on efficiently learning Pauli channels and more generally the Pauli projection of a quantum channel. We first derive a procedure for learning a Pauli channel on n qubits with high probability to a relative precision \u03f5 using O(\u03f5-2n2n) measurements, which is efficient in the Hilbert space dimension. The estimate is robust to state preparation and measurement errors, which, together with the relative precision, makes it especially appropriate for applications involving characterization of high-accuracy quantum gates. Next, we show that the error rates for an arbitrary set of s Pauli errors can be estimated to a relative precision \u03f5 using O(\u03f5-4log s log s/\u03f5) measurements. Finally, we show that when the Pauli channel is given by a Markov field with at most k-local correlations, we can learn an entire n-qubit Pauli channel to relative precision \u03f5 with only Ok(\u03f5-2n2logn) measurements, which is efficient in the number of qubits. These results enable a host of applications beyond just characterizing noise in a large-scale quantum system: they pave the way to tailoring quantum codes, optimizing decoders, and customizing fault tolerance procedures to suit a particular device.","author":["Steven T.

It is argued that evaluation methods should credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This is desirable from the user point of view in modern large IR environments. The proposed methods are (1) a novel application of P-R curves and average precision computations based on separate recall bases for documents of different degrees of relevance, and (2) two novel measures computing the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. We then demonstrate the use of these evaluation methods in a case study on the effectiveness of query types, based on combinations of query structures and expansion, in retrieving documents of various degrees of relevance. The test was run with a best match retrieval system (In-Query1) in a text database consisting of newspaper articles. The results indicate that the tested strong query structures are most effective in retrieving highly relevant documents. The differences between the query types are practically essential and statistically significant. More generally, the novel evaluation methods and the case demonstrate that non-dichotomous relevance assessments are applicable in IR experiments, may reveal interesting phenomena, and allow harder testing of IR methods.","author":["Kalervo J\u00e4rvelin","Jaana Kek\u00e4l\u00e4inen"],"issue":["SIGIR '00: Proceedings of the 23rd annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval","July 2000","Pages   41\u201348","https://doi.org/10.1145/345508.345545"],"date":"01 July 2000","ref":[{"text":"J.

(1) Any value which is permitted in some context of the language is permissible in any other meaningful context. In particular, functions and labels are permissible results of functions and values of variables. (2) Assignment and indirect addressing are formalized by introducing values, called references, which in turn possess other values. The assignment operation always affects the relation between some reference and its value. (3) All compound data structures are treated as functions. (4) Type declarations are not permitted.The functional approach to data structures and the use of references insure that any process which accepts some data structure will accept any logically equivalent structure, regardless of its internal representation. More generally, any data structure may be implicit; i.e. it may be specified by giving an arbitrary algorithm for computing or accessing its components. The existence of label variables permits the construction of co-routines, quasi-parallel processes, and other unorthodox control mechanisms.A variety of programming examples illustrates the generality of the language. Limitations and possible extensions are discussed briefly.","author":["John C.

NASD provides scalable storage bandwidth without the cost of servers used primarily, for transferring data from peripheral networks (e.g. SCSI) to client networks (e.g. ethernet). Increasing datuset sizes, new attachment technologies, the convergence of peripheral and interprocessor switched networks, and the increased availability of on-drive transistors motivate and enable this new architecture. NASD is based on four main principles: direct transfer to clients, secure interfaces via cryptographic support, asynchronous non-critical-path oversight, and variably-sized data objects. Measurements of our prototype system show that these services can be cost-effectively integrated into a next generation disk drive ASK. End-to-end measurements of our prototype drive andfilesysterns suggest that NASD cun support conventional distributed filesystems without performance degradation. More importantly, we show scaluble bandwidth for NASD-specialized filesystems. Using a parallel data mining application, NASD drives deliver u linear scaling of 6.2 MB/s per clientdrive pair, tested with up to eight pairs in our lab.","author":["Garth A. Gibson","David F.

Despite a recent surge in interest in three-dimensional graphics from computer architects, high-quality high-speed texture mapping has so far been confined to costly hardware systems that use brute-force techniques to achieve high performance. One obstacle faced by designers of texture mapping systems is the requirement of extremely high bandwidth to texture memory. High bandwidth is necessary since there are typically tens to hundreds of millions of accesses to texture memory per second. In addition, to achieve the high clock rates required in graphics pipelines, low-latency access to texture memory is needed. In this paper, we propose the use of texture image caches to alleviate the above bottlenecks, and evaluate various tradeoffs that arise in such designs.We find that the factors important to cache behavior are (i) the representation of texture images in memory, (ii) the rasterization order on screen and (iii) the cache organization. Through a detailed investigation of these issues, we explore the best way to exploit locality of reference and determine whether this technique is robust with respect to different scenes and different amounts of texture. Overall, we observe that there is a significant amount of temporal and spatial locality and that the working set sizes are relatively small (at most 16KB) across all cases that we studied. Consequently, the memory bandwidth requirements of a texture cache system are substantially lower (at least three times and as much as fifteen times) than the memory bandwidth requirements of a system which achieves equivalent performance but does not utilize a cache. These results are very encouraging and indicate that caching is a promising approach to designing memory systems for texture mapping.","author":["Ziyad S.

Whether or not one-way communication is strictly weaker than two-way is an open problem, although the conjecture in this paper is in the positive.

Stencil computations are commonly used in solving partial differential equations, image processing, and geometric modeling. The efficient handling of such stencils is critical for achieving high performance on distributed-memory machines. Compiling stencils into efficient code is viewed as so important that some companies have built special-purpose compilers for handling them and others have added stencil-recognizers to existing compilers.In this paper we present a general compilation strategy for stencils written using Fortran90 array constructs. Our strategy is capable of optimizing single or multi-statement stencils and is applicable to stencils specified with shift intrinsics or with array-syntax all equally well. The strategy eliminates the need for pattern-recognition algorithms by orchestrating a set of optimizations that address the overhead of both intraprocessor and interprocessor data movement that results from the translation of Fortran90 array constructs. Our experimental results show that code produced by this strategy beats or matches the best code produced by the special-purpose compilers or pattern-recognition schemes that are known to us. In addition, our strategy produces highly optimized code in situations where the others fail, producing several orders of magnitude performance improvement, and thus provides a stencil compilation strategy that is more robust than its predecessors.","author":["Gerald Roth","John Mellor-Crummey","Ken Kennedy","R.

While hardware-based techniques require extra logic to keep track of memory references and make decisions about future mode transitions, compiler-directed schemes can only work on a single application at a time and demand sophisticated program analysis support. In this work, we present an operating system (OS) based solution where the OS scheduler directs the power mode transitions by keeping track of module accesses for each process in the system. This global view combined with the flexibility of a software approach brings large energy savings at no extra hardware cost. Our implementation using a full-fledged OS shows that the proposed technique is also very robust when different system and workload parameters are modified, and provides the first set of experimental results for memory energy optimization with a multiprogrammed workload on a real platform. The proposed technique is applicable to both embedded systems and high-end computing platforms.","author":["V. Delaluz","A. Sivasubramaniam","M. Kandemir","N. Vijaykrishnan","M. J.

Previously, the progressive radiosity approach has depended on the use of the hemi-cube algorithm to determine form-factors. However, sampling problems inherent in the hemi-cube algorithm limit its usefulness for complex images. A more robust approach is described in which ray tracing is used to perform the numerical integration of the form-factor equation. The approach is tailored to provide good, approximate results for a low number of rays, while still providing a smooth continuum of increasing accuracy for higher numbers of rays. Quantitative comparisons between analytically derived form-factors and ray traced form-factors are presented.","author":["J. R. Wallace","K. A. Elmquist","E. A.

However, the achievable power savings by DVS alone is becoming limited as leakage power increases. In this paper, we show how the simultaneous use of adaptive body biasing (ABB) and DVS can be used to reduce power in high-performance processors. Analytical models of the leakage current, dynamic power, and frequency as functions of supply voltage and body bias are derived and verified with SPICE simulation. We then show how to determine the correct trade-off between supply voltage and body bias for a given clock frequency and duration of operation. The usefulness of our approach is evaluated on real workloads obtained using real-time monitoring of processor utilization for four applications. The results demonstrate that application of simultaneous DVS and ABB results in an average energy reduction of 48% over DVS alone.","author":["Steven M.

It is, however, very costly to collect and analyze survey data manually. This paper presents a new framework for mining product reputations on the Internet. It automatically collects people's opinions about target products from Web pages, and it uses text mining techniques to obtain the reputations of those products.On the basis of human-test samples, we generate in advance syntactic and linguistic rules to determine whether any given statement is an opinion or not, as well as whether such any opinion is positive or negative in nature. We first collect statements regarding target products using a general search engine, and then, using the rules, extract opinions from among them and attach three labels to each opinion, labels indicating the positive/negative determination, the product name itself, and an numerical value expressing the degree of system confidence that the statement is, in fact, an opinion. The labeled opinions are then input into an opinion database.The mining of reputations, i.e., the finding of statistically meaningful information included in the database, is then conducted. We specify target categories using label values (such as positive opinions of product A) and perform four types of text mining: extraction of 1) characteristic words, 2) co-occurrence words, 3) typical sentences, for individual target categories, and 4) correspondence analysis among multiple target categories.Actual marketing data is used to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the framework, which offers a drastic reduction in the overall cost of reputation analysis over that of conventional survey approaches and supports the discovery of knowledge from the pool of opinions on the web.","author":["Satoshi Morinaga","Kenji Yamanishi","Kenji Tateishi","Toshikazu Fukushima"],"issue":["KDD '02: Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","July 2002","Pages   341\u2013349","https://doi.org/10.1145/775047.775098"],"date":"23 July 2002","ref":[{"text":"B.

Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) has been successfully applied in FPGAs to mitigate transient faults, which are likely to occur in space applications. However, TMR comes with high area and power dissipation penalties. The new technique proposed in this paper was specifically developed for FPGAs to cope with transient faults in the user combinational and sequential logic, while also reducing pin count, area and power dissipation. The methodology was validated by fault injection experiments in an emulation board. We present some fault coverage results and a comparison with the TMR approach.","author":["Fernanda Lima","Luigi Carro","Ricardo Reis"],"issue":["DAC '03: Proceedings of the 40th annual Design Automation Conference","June 2003","Pages   650\u2013655","https://doi.org/10.1145/775832.775997"],"date":"02 June 2003","ref":[{"text":"Anghel, A., Alexandrescu, D., Nicolaidis, M., \"Evaluation of a Soft Error Tolerance Technique based on Time and/or Hardware Redundancy,\" Proc. of IEEE Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI), Sept. 2000, pp. 237--242.","doi":"10.5555/827245.827276","order":1},{"text":"Anghel, L., Nicolaidis, M., \"Cost Reduction and Evaluation of a Temporary Faults Detecting Technique,\" Proc. 2000 Design Automation and Test in Europe Conference (DATE 00), ACM Press, New York, 2000, pp. 591--598.","doi":"10.1145/343647.343863","order":2},{"text":"Barth, J., \"Radiation Environment\", IEEE NSREC Short Course, July, 1997.","order":3},{"text":"Caffrey, M., Graham, P., Johnson, E., Wirthlin, M., \"Single Event Upsets in SRAM FPGAs\", Proc. of Military and Aerospace Applications of Programmable Logic Devices (MAPLD), Sept. 2002.","order":4},{"text":"Carmichael, C., Fuller, E., Fabula, J., Lima, F., \"Proton Testing of SEU Mitigation Methods for the Virtex FPGA\", Proc. of Military and Aerospace Applications of Programmable Logic Devices MAPLD, 2001.","order":5},{"text":"Carmichael, C.,\"Triple Module Redundancy Design Techniques for Virtex Series FPGA\", Xilinx Application Notes 197, v1.0, Mar. 2001.","order":6},{"text":"Dupont, D., Nicolaidis, M., Rohr, P., \"Embedded Robustness IPs for Transient-Error-Free ICs\", IEEE Design and Test of Computers, May-June, 2002, pp. 56--70.","doi":"10.5555/622209.623156","order":7},{"text":"Johnson, B.W., Aylor, J.

Linearizability is a correctness condition for concurrent objects that exploits the semantics of abstract data types. It permits a high degree of concurrency, yet it permits programmers to specify and reason about concurrent objects using known techniques from the sequential domain. Linearizability provides the illusion that each operation applied by concurrent processes takes effect instantaneously at some point between its invocation and its response, implying that the meaning of a concurrent object's operations can be given by pre- and post-conditions. This paper defines linearizability, compares it to other correctness conditions, presents and demonstrates a method for proving the correctness of implementations, and shows how to reason about concurrent objects, given they are linearizable.","author":["Maurice P.

Closed manifold genus-0 meshes are topologically equivalent to a sphere, hence this is the natural parameter domain for them. Parameterizing a triangle mesh onto the sphere means assigning a 3D position on the unit sphere to each of the mesh vertices, such that the spherical triangles induced by the mesh connectivity are not too distorted and do not overlap. Satisfying the non-overlapping requirement is the most difficult and critical component of this process.

While they exhibit complementary advantages, neither paradigm alone is adequate for complex information goals that lend themselves partially to browsing and partially to searching. To integrate browsing and searching smoothly into a single interface, we introduce a novel approach called ScentTrails. Based on the concept of information scent developed in the context of information foraging theory, ScentTrails highlights hyperlinks to indicate paths to search results. This interface enables users to interpolate smoothly between searching and browsing to locate content matching complex information goals effectively. In a preliminary user study, ScentTrails enabled subjects to find information more quickly than by either searching or browsing alone.","author":["Christopher Olston","Ed H.

However, flash media has many unique characteristics that make existing data management/analytics algorithms designed for magnetic disks perform poorly with flash storage. For example, while random (page) reads are as fast as sequential reads, random (page) writes and in-place data updates are orders of magnitude slower than sequential writes. In this paper, we consider an important fundamental problem that would seem to be particularly challenging for flash storage: efficiently maintaining a very large (100 MBs or more) random sample of a data stream (e.g., of sensor readings). First, we show that previous algorithms such as reservoir sampling and geometric file are not readily adapted to flash. Second, we propose B-FILE, an energy-efficient abstraction for flash media to store self-expiring items, and show how a B-FILE can be used to efficiently maintain a large sample in flash. Our solution is simple, has a small (RAM) memory footprint, and is designed to cope with flash constraints in order to reduce latency and energy consumption. Third, we provide techniques to maintain biased samples with a B-FILE and to query the large sample stored in a B-FILE for a subsample of an arbitrary size. Finally, we present an evaluation with flash media that shows our techniques are several orders of magnitude faster and more energy-efficient than (flash-friendly versions of) reservoir sampling and geometric file. A key finding of our study, of potential use to many flash algorithms beyond sampling, is that \"semi-random\" writes (as defined in the paper) on flash cards are over two orders of magnitude faster and more energy-efficient than random writes.","author":["Suman Nath","Phillip B.

Prominent examples include internet companies and e-science. The Map-Reduce scalable dataflow paradigm has become popular for these applications. Its simple, explicit dataflow programming model is favored by some over the traditional high-level declarative approach: SQL. On the other hand, the extreme simplicity of Map-Reduce leads to much low-level hacking to deal with the many-step, branching dataflows that arise in practice. Moreover, users must repeatedly code standard operations such as join by hand. These practices waste time, introduce bugs, harm readability, and impede optimizations.Pig is a high-level dataflow system that aims at a sweet spot between SQL and Map-Reduce. Pig offers SQL-style high-level data manipulation constructs, which can be assembled in an explicit dataflow and interleaved with custom Map- and Reduce-style functions or executables. Pig programs are compiled into sequences of Map-Reduce jobs, and executed in the Hadoop Map-Reduce environment. Both Pig and Hadoop are open-source projects administered by the Apache Software Foundation.This paper describes the challenges we faced in developing Pig, and reports performance comparisons between Pig execution and raw Map-Reduce execution.","author":["Alan F.

As a combination of the k nearest neighbor query and the join operation, kNN join is an expensive operation. Given the increasing volume of data, it is difficult to perform a kNN join on a centralized machine efficiently. In this paper, we investigate how to perform kNN join using MapReduce which is a well-accepted framework for data-intensive applications over clusters of computers. In brief, the mappers cluster objects into groups; the reducers perform the kNN join on each group of objects separately. We design an effective mapping mechanism that exploits pruning rules for distance filtering, and hence reduces both the shuffling and computational costs. To reduce the shuffling cost, we propose two approximate algorithms to minimize the number of replicas. Extensive experiments on our in-house cluster demonstrate that our proposed methods are efficient, robust and scalable.","author":["Wei Lu","Yanyan Shen","Su Chen","Beng Chin Ooi"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 5","Issue 10","June 2012","pp   1016\u20131027","https://doi.org/10.14778/2336664.2336674"],"date":"01 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"A.

But DB2 BLU is much more than just a column store. Exploiting frequency-based dictionary compression and main-memory query processing technology from the Blink project at IBM Research - Almaden, DB2 BLU performs most SQL operations - predicate application (even range predicates and IN-lists), joins, and grouping - on the compressed values, which can be packed bit-aligned so densely that multiple values fit in a register and can be processed simultaneously via SIMD (single-instruction, multipledata) instructions. Designed and built from the ground up to exploit modern multi-core processors, DB2 BLU's hardware-conscious algorithms are carefully engineered to maximize parallelism by using novel data structures that need little latching, and to minimize data-cache and instruction-cache misses. Though DB2 BLU is optimized for in-memory processing, database size is not limited by the size of main memory. Fine-grained synopses, late materialization, and a new probabilistic buffer pool protocol for scans minimize disk I/Os, while aggressive prefetching reduces I/O stalls. Full integration with DB2 ensures that DB2 with BLU Acceleration benefits from the full functionality and robust utilities of a mature product, while still enjoying order-of-magnitude performance gains from revolutionary technology without even having to change the SQL, and can mix column-organized and row-organized tables in the same tablespace and even within the same query.","author":["Vijayshankar Raman","Gopi Attaluri","Ronald Barber","Naresh Chainani","David Kalmuk","Vincent KulandaiSamy","Jens Leenstra","Sam Lightstone","Shaorong Liu","Guy M.

Writing such applications in a generic, hardware-oblivious manner is a challenging problem: Current database systems thus rely on labor-intensive and error-prone manual tuning to exploit the full potential of modern parallel hardware architectures like multi-core CPUs and graphics cards. We propose an alternative design for a parallel database engine, based on a single set of hardware-oblivious operators, which are compiled down to the actual hardware at runtime. This design reduces the development overhead for parallel database engines, while achieving competitive performance to hand-tuned systems.We provide a proof-of-concept for this design by integrating operators written using the parallel programming framework OpenCL into the open-source database MonetDB. Following this approach, we achieve efficient, yet highly portable parallel code without the need for optimization by hand. We evaluated our implementation against MonetDB using TPC-H derived queries and observed a performance that rivals that of MonetDB's query execution on the CPU and surpasses it on the GPU. In addition, we show that the same set of operators runs nearly unchanged on a GPU, demonstrating the feasibility of our approach.","author":["Max Heimel","Michael Saecker","Holger Pirk","Stefan Manegold","Volker Markl"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 9","July 2013","pp   709\u2013720","https://doi.org/10.14778/2536360.2536370"],"date":"01 July 2013","ref":[{"text":"Advanced Micro Devices.

The relative performance of these two join approaches have been a topic of discussion for a long time. With the advent of modern multi-core architectures, it has been argued that sort-merge join is now a better choice than radix-hash join. This claim is justified based on the width of SIMD instructions (sort-merge outperforms radix-hash join once SIMD is sufficiently wide), and NUMA awareness (sort-merge is superior to hash join in NUMA architectures). We conduct extensive experiments on the original and optimized versions of these algorithms. The experiments show that, contrary to these claims, radix-hash join is still clearly superior, and sort-merge approaches to performance of radix only when very large amounts of data are involved. The paper also provides the fastest implementations of these algorithms, and covers many aspects of modern hardware architectures relevant not only for joins but for any parallel data processing operator.","author":["Cagri Balkesen","Gustavo Alonso","Jens Teubner","M.

The state-of-the-art solutions to the Big Data problem are largely based on the MapReduce framework (aka its open source implementation Hadoop). Although Hadoop handles the data volume challenge successfully, it does not deal with the data variety well since the programming interfaces and its associated data processing model is inconvenient and inefficient for handling structured data and graph data.This paper presents epiC, an extensible system to tackle the Big Data's data variety challenge. epiC introduces a general Actor-like concurrent programming model, independent of the data processing models, for specifying parallel computations. Users process multi-structured datasets with appropriate epiC extensions, the implementation of a data processing model best suited for the data type and auxiliary code for mapping that data processing model into epiC's concurrent programming model. Like Hadoop, programs written in this way can be automatically parallelized and the runtime system takes care of fault tolerance and inter-machine communications. We present the design and implementation of epiC's concurrent programming model. We also present two customized data processing model, an optimized MapReduce extension and a relational model, on top of epiC. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed epiC.","author":["Dawei Jiang","Gang Chen","Beng Chin Ooi","Kian-Lee Tan","Sai Wu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 7","March 2014","pp   541\u2013552","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732286.2732291"],"date":"01 March 2014","ref":[{"text":"The hadoop offical website. http://hadoop.apache.org/.","order":1},{"text":"The storm project offical website. http://storm-project.net/.","order":2},{"text":"A.

In the literature, all the approaches compute a label for every vertex in a graph G by index construction offline. The query time for answering reachability queries online is affected by the quality of the labels computed in index construction. The three main costs are the index construction time, the index size, and the query time. Some of the up-to-date approaches can answer reachability queries efficiently, but spend non-linear time to construct an index. Some of the up-to-date approaches construct an index in linear time and space, but may need to depth-first search G at run-time in O(n + m). In this paper, as the first, we propose a new randomized labeling approach to answer reachability queries, and the randomness is by independent permutation. We conduct extensive experimental studies to compare with the up-to-date approaches using 19 large real datasets used in the existing work and synthetic datasets. We confirm the efficiency of our approach.","author":["Hao Wei","Jeffrey Xu Yu","Can Lu","Ruoming Jin"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 12","August 2014","pp   1191\u20131202","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732977.2732992"],"date":"01 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"R.

Programmable accelerators are making their way into each of these areas independently. As such, there is a void of solutions that enables hardware acceleration at the intersection of these disjoint fields. This paper sets out to be the initial step towards a unifying solution for in-Database Acceleration of Advanced Analytics (DAnA). Deploying specialized hardware, such as FPGAs, for in-database analytics currently requires hand-designing the hardware and manually routing the data. Instead, DAnA automatically maps a high-level specification of advanced analytics queries to an FPGA accelerator. The accelerator implementation is generated for a User Defined Function (UDF), expressed as a part of an SQL query using a Python-embedded Domain-Specific Language (DSL). To realize an efficient in-database integration, DAnA accelerators contain a novel hardware structure, Striders, that directly interface with the buffer pool of the database. Striders extract, cleanse, and process the training data tuples that are consumed by a multi-threaded FPGA engine that executes the analytics algorithm. We integrate DAnA with PostgreSQL to generate hardware accelerators for a range of real-world and synthetic datasets running diverse ML algorithms. Results show that DAnA-enhanced PostgreSQL provides, on average, 8.3\u00d7 end-to-end speedup for real datasets, with a maximum of 28.2\u00d7. Moreover, DAnA-enhanced PostgreSQL is, on average, 4.0\u00d7 faster than the multi-threaded Apache MADLib running on Greenplum. DAnA provides these benefits while hiding the complexity of hardware design from data scientists and allowing them to express the algorithm in \u224830-60 lines of Python.","author":["Divya Mahajan","Joon Kyung Kim","Jacob Sacks","Adel Ardalan","Arun Kumar","Hadi Esmaeilzadeh"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 11","July 2018","pp   1317\u20131331","https://doi.org/10.14778/3236187.3236188"],"date":"01 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Gartner Report on Analytics. gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1971516.","order":1},{"text":"SAS Report on Analytics. sas.com/reg/wp/corp/23876.","order":2},{"text":"M.

Big performance challenges exist when data management systems invoke ML classifiers as user-defined functions (UDFs) or when stand-alone ML frameworks interact with data stores for data loading and pre-processing (ETL). In particular, UDFs can be precompiled or simply a black box for the data management system and the data layout may be completely different from the native layout, thus adding overheads at the boundaries. In this demo, we will show how bottlenecks between existing systems can be eliminated when their engines are designed around runtime compilation and native code generation, which is the case for many state-of-the-art relational engines as well as ML frameworks. We demonstrate an integration of Flare (an accelerator for Spark SQL), and Lantern (an accelerator for TensorFlow and PyTorch) that results in a highly optimized end-to-end compiled data path, switching between SQL and ML processing with negligible overhead.","author":["Gr\u00e9gory Essertel","Ruby Y.

At the core of these applications are consensus protocols that securely replicate client requests among all replicas, even if some replicas are Byzantine faulty. Unfortunately, these consensus protocols typically have low throughput, and this lack of performance is often cited as the reason for the slow wider adoption of blockchain technology. Consequently, many works focus on designing more efficient consensus protocols to increase throughput of consensus.We believe that this focus on consensus protocols only explains part of the story. To investigate this belief, we raise a simple question: Can a well-crafted system using a classical consensus protocol outperform systems using modern protocols? In this tutorial, we answer this question by diving deep into the design of blockchain systems. Further, we take an in-depth look at the theory behind consensus, which can help users select the protocol that best-fits their requirements. Finally, we share our vision of high-throughput blockchain systems that operate at large scales.","author":["Suyash Gupta","Jelle Hellings","Sajjad Rahnama","Mohammad Sadoghi"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 13","Issue 12","August 2020","pp   3441\u20133444","https://doi.org/10.14778/3415478.3415565"],"date":"01 August 2020","ref":[{"text":"I.

Unfortunately, the cost of building large annotated corpora is prohibitively expensive. This work aims to improve the induction strategy when there are few labels in the training data. We show that the most informative linguistic constituents are the higher nodes in the parse trees, typically denoting complex noun phrases and sentential clauses. They account for only 20% of all constituents. For inducing grammars from sparsely labeled training data (e.g., only higher-level constituent labels), we propose an <i>adaptation</i> strategy, which produces grammars that parse almost as well as grammars induced from fully labeled corpora. Our results suggest that for a partial parser to replace human annotators, it must be able to automatically extract higher-level constituents rather than base noun phrases.","author":["Rebecca Hwa"],"issue":["ACL '99: Proceedings of the 37th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Computational Linguistics","June 1999","Pages   73\u201379","https://doi.org/10.3115/1034678.1034699"],"date":"20 June 1999","ref":[{"text":"J.

Experimental results indicate that the coverage and accuracy of our method are significantly better than those of the baseline methods relying on existing technologies.","author":["Yunbo Cao","Hang Li"],"issue":["COLING '02: Proceedings of the 19th international conference on Computational linguistics - Volume 1","August 2002","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.3115/1072228.1072239"],"date":"24 August 2002","ref":[{"text":"Brill E., Lin J., Banko M., Dumais S. and Ng A.

In models whose parameters are very specific like lexicalized ones, sparse-data problem is very serious and also conditional probabilities tend to be estimated unreliably. To overcome data-sparseness, a simplified version of the well-known back-off smoothing method is used. To mitigate unreliable estimation problem, our models assume joint independence instead of conditional independence because joint probabilities have the same degree of estimation reliability. In experiments for the Brown corpus, models with rich contexts achieve relatively high accuracy and some models assuming joint independence show better results than the corresponding HMMs.","author":["Sang-Zoo Lee","Jun-ichi Tsujii","Hae-Chang Rim"],"issue":["ACL '00: Proceedings of the 38th Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics","October 2000","Pages   263\u2013269","https://doi.org/10.3115/1075218.1075252"],"date":"03 October 2000","ref":[{"text":"E.

For example, in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) task both cross-word triphones and a trigram language model are necessary to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, when using these models, the size of a pre-compiled recognition network can make a standard Viterbi search infeasible and hence, either multiple-pass or asynchronous stack decoding schemes are typically used. In this paper, we show that time-synchronous one-pass decoding using cross-word triphones and a trigram language model can be implemented using a dynamically built tree-structured network. This approach avoids the compromises inherent in using fast-matches or preliminary passes and is relatively efficient in implementation. It was included in the HTK large vocabulary speech recognition system used for the 1993 ARPA WSJ evaluation and experimental results are presented for that task.","author":["J. J. Odell","V.

Using movie reviews as data, we find that standard machine learning techniques definitively outperform human-produced baselines. However, the three machine learning methods we employed (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machines) do not perform as well on sentiment classification as on traditional topic-based categorization. We conclude by examining factors that make the sentiment classification problem more challenging.","author":["Bo Pang","Lillian Lee","Shivakumar Vaithyanathan"],"issue":["EMNLP '02: Proceedings of the ACL-02 conference on Empirical methods in natural language processing - Volume 10","July 2002","Pages   79\u201386","https://doi.org/10.3115/1118693.1118704"],"date":"06 July 2002","ref":[{"text":"Shlomo Argamon-Engelson, Moshe Koppel, and Galit Avneri. 1998.

The architecture presented, SNOW, is a network of linear separators in the feature space, utilizing the Winnow update algorithm.Multiplicative weight-update algorithms such as Winnow have been shown to have exceptionally good behavior when applied to very high dimensional problems, and especially when the target concepts depend on only a small subset of the features in the feature space. In this paper we describe an architecture that utilizes this mistake-driven algorithm for multi-class prediction-selecting the part of speech of a word. The experimental analysis presented here provides more evidence to that these algorithms are suitable for natural language problems.The algorithm used is an on-line algorithm: every example is used by the algorithm only once, and is then discarded. This has significance in terms of efficiency, as well as quick adaptation to new contexts.We present an extensive experimental study of our algorithm under various conditions; in particular, it is shown that the algorithm performs comparably to the best known algorithms for POS.","author":["Dan Roth","Dmitry Zelenko"],"issue":["ACL '98/COLING '98: Proceedings of the 36th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and 17th International Conference on Computational Linguistics - Volume 2","August 1998","Pages   1136\u20131142","https://doi.org/10.3115/980691.980755"],"date":"10 August 1998","ref":[{"text":"E.

SNAP is an experimental massively parallel machine which is dedicated to, but not limited to, the natural language processing using semantic networks. In designing the SNAP, we have investigated various natural language processing systems and theories to determine the scope of the hardware support and a set of micro-coded instructions to be provided. As a result, SNAP employs an extended marker-passing model and a dynamically modifiable network model. A set of primitive instructions is micro-coded to directly support a parallel marker-passing, bitoperations, numeric operations, network modifications, and other essential functions for natural language processing. This paper demonstrates the utility of SNAP for various paradigms of natural language processing. We have discovered that the SNAP provides milliseconds or microsectonds performance on several important applications such as the memory-based parsing and translation, classification-based parsing, and VLKB search. Also, we argue that there are numerous opportunities in the NLP community to take advantages of the computational power of the SNAP.","author":["Hiroaki Kitano","Dan Moldovan"],"issue":["COLING '92: Proceedings of the 14th conference on Computational linguistics - Volume 2","August 1992","Pages   813\u2013819","https://doi.org/10.3115/992133.992195"],"date":"23 August 1992","ref":[{"text":"{Blelloch, 1986} Blelloch, G.

One part of this system is the identification of relationships between clinically important entities in the text. Typical approaches to relationship extraction in this domain have used full parses, domain-specific grammars, and large knowledge bases encoding domain knowledge. In other areas of biomedical NLP, statistical machine learning approaches are now routinely applied to relationship extraction. We report on the novel application of these statistical techniques to clinical relationships. We describe a supervised machine learning system, trained with a corpus of oncology narratives hand-annotated with clinically important relationships. Various shallow features are extracted from these texts, and used to train statistical classifiers. We compare the suitability of these features for clinical relationship extraction, how extraction varies between inter- and intra-sentential relationships, and examine the amount of training data needed to learn various relationships.","author":["Angus Roberts","Robert Gaizauskas","Mark Hepple"],"issue":["BioNLP '08: Proceedings of the Workshop on Current Trends in Biomedical Natural Language Processing","June 2008","Pages   10\u201318"],"date":"19 June 2008","ref":[{"text":"H.

We contrast three search strategies for MERT: Powell's method, the variant of coordinate descent found in the Moses MERT utility, and a novel stochastic method. It is shown that the stochastic method obtains test set gains of +0.98 BLEU on MT03 and +0.61 BLEU on MT05. We also present a method for regularizing the MERT objective that achieves statistically significant gains when combined with both Powell's method and coordinate descent.","author":["Daniel Cer","Daniel Jurafsky","Christopher D.

We assume access to a reward function that defines the quality of the executed actions. During training, the learner repeatedly constructs action sequences for a set of documents, executes those actions, and observes the resulting reward. We use a policy gradient algorithm to estimate the parameters of a log-linear model for action selection. We apply our method to interpret instructions in two domains --- Windows troubleshooting guides and game tutorials. Our results demonstrate that this method can rival supervised learning techniques while requiring few or no annotated training examples.","author":["S. R. K. Branavan","Harr Chen","Luke S.

The proliferation of user-generated web content such as blogs, discussion forums and online review sites has made it possible to perform large-scale mining of public opinion. Sentiment modeling is thus becoming a critical component of market intelligence and social media technologies that aim to tap into the collective wisdom of crowds. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning high-quality sentiment models with minimal manual supervision. We propose a novel approach to learn from lexical prior knowledge in the form of domain-independent sentiment-laden terms, in conjunction with domain-dependent unlabeled data and a few labeled documents. Our model is based on a constrained non-negative tri-factorization of the term-document matrix which can be implemented using simple update rules. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of real-world sentiment prediction tasks.","author":["Tao Li","Yi Zhang","Vikas Sindhwani"],"issue":["ACL '09: Proceedings of the Joint Conference of the 47th Annual Meeting of the ACL and the 4th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing of the AFNLP: Volume 1 - Volume 1","August 2009","Pages   244\u2013252"],"date":"02 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"J.
