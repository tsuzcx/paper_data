It has been reported that one of these aspects is related to class imbalance in which examples in training data belonging to one class heavily outnumber the examples in the other class. In this situation, which is found in real world data describing an infrequent but important event, the learning system may have difficulties to learn the concept related to the minority class. In this work we perform a broad experimental evaluation involving ten methods, three of them proposed by the authors, to deal with the class imbalance problem in thirteen UCI data sets. Our experiments provide evidence that class imbalance does not systematically hinder the performance of learning systems. In fact, the problem seems to be related to learning with too few minority class examples in the presence of other complicating factors, such as class overlapping. Two of our proposed methods deal with these conditions directly, allying a known over-sampling method with data cleaning methods in order to produce better-defined class clusters. Our comparative experiments show that, in general, over-sampling methods provide more accurate results than under-sampling methods considering the area under the ROC curve (AUC). This result seems to contradict results previously published in the literature. Two of our proposed methods, Smote + Tomek and Smote + ENN, presented very good results for data sets with a small number of positive examples. Moreover, Random over-sampling, a very simple over-sampling method, is very competitive to more complex over-sampling methods. Since the over-sampling methods provided very good performance results, we also measured the syntactic complexity of the decision trees induced from over-sampled data. Our results show that these trees are usually more complex then the ones induced from original data. Random over-sampling usually produced the smallest increase in the mean number of induced rules and Smote + ENN the smallest increase in the mean number of conditions per rule, when compared among the investigated over-sampling methods.","author":["Gustavo E.

We believe that pedagogically useful visualizations exhibit certain features that hold across a wide range of visualization styles and content. We began our efforts to identify these features with a review that attempted to identify an initial set of candidates. We then ran two experiments that attempted to identify the effectiveness for a subset of features from the list. We identified a small number of features for algorithm visualizations that seem to have a significant impact on their pedagogical effectiveness, and found that several others appear to have little impact. The single most important feature studied is the ability to directly control the pace of the visualization. An algorithm visualization having a minimum of distracting features, and which focuses on the logical steps of an algorithm, appears to be best for procedural understanding of the algorithm. Providing a good example for the visualization to operate on proved significantly more effective than letting students construct their own data sets. Finally, a pseudocode display, a series of questions to guide exploration of the algorithm, or the ability to back up within the visualization did not show a significant effect on learning.","author":["Purvi Saraiya","Clifford A.

Dynamic information flow tracking protects programs against malicious software attacks by identifying spurious information flows from untrusted I/O and restricting the usage of the spurious information.Every security attack to take control of a program needs to transfer the program's control to malevolent code. In our approach, the operating system identifies a set of input channels as spurious, and the processor tracks all information flows from those inputs. A broad range of attacks are effectively defeated by checking the use of the spurious values as instructions and pointers.Our protection is transparent to users or application programmers; the executables can be used without any modification. Also, our scheme only incurs, on average, a memory overhead of 1.4% and a performance overhead of 1.1%.","author":["G. Edward Suh","Jae W.

We show that G = (V,E) can be preprocessed in O(kmn1/k) expected time, constructing a data structure of size O(kn1+1/k), such that any subsequent distance query can be answered, approximately, in O(k) time. The approximate distance returned is of stretch at most 2k\u22121, that is, the quotient obtained by dividing the estimated distance by the actual distance lies between 1 and 2k\u22121. A 1963 girth conjecture of Erd\u00f3s, implies that \u03a9(n1+1/k) space is needed in the worst case for any real stretch strictly smaller than 2k+1. The space requirement of our algorithm is, therefore, essentially optimal. The most impressive feature of our data structure is its constant query time, hence the name \"oracle\". Previously, data structures that used only O(n1+1/k) space had a query time of \u03a9(n1/k).Our algorithms are extremely simple and easy to implement efficiently. They also provide faster constructions of sparse spanners of weighted graphs, and improved tree covers and distance labelings of weighted or unweighted graphs.","author":["Mikkel Thorup","Uri Zwick"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 52","Issue 1","January 2005","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/1044731.1044732"],"date":"01 January 2005","ref":[{"text":"Aingworth, D., Chekuri, C., Indyk, P., and Motwani, R. 1999.

To improve availability and manageability, we investigate and compare data location schemes for a large self-organizing storage cluster that can quickly adapt to the additions or departures of storage nodes. We further present an efficient location scheme that differentiates between small and large file blocks for reduced management overhead compared to uniform strategies. In our protocol, small blocks, which are typically in large quantities, are placed through consistent hashing. Large blocks, much fewer in practice, are placed through a usage-based policy, and their locations are tracked by Bloom filters. The proposed scheme results in improved storage utilization even with non-uniform cluster nodes. To achieve high scalability and fault resilience, this protocol is fully distributed, relies only on soft states, and supports data replication. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this protocol through trace-driven simulation.","author":["Hong Tang","Tao Yang"],"issue":["SC '03: Proceedings of the 2003 ACM/IEEE conference on Supercomputing","November 2003","https://doi.org/10.1145/1048935.1050203"],"date":"15 November 2003","ref":[{"text":"{1} Ask Jeeves, Inc.

This paper studies the problem of clustering binary data. This is the case for market basket datasets where the transactions contain items and for document datasets where the documents contain \"bag of words\". The contribution of the paper is three-fold. First a general binary data clustering model is presented. The model treats the data and features equally, based on their symmetric association relations, and explicitly describes the data assignments as well as feature assignments. We characterize several variations with different optimization procedures for the general model. Second, we also establish the connections between our clustering model with other existing clustering methods. Third, we also discuss the problem for determining the number of clusters for binary clustering. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed clustering model.","author":["Tao Li"],"issue":["KDD '05: Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery in data mining","August 2005","Pages   188\u2013197","https://doi.org/10.1145/1081870.1081894"],"date":"21 August 2005","ref":[{"text":"Aggarwal, C.

When designing a graphic, BOZ aims to optimize two ways in which graphics help expedite human performance of information-processing tasks: (1) allowing users to substitute simple perceptual inferences in place of more demanding logical inferences, and (2) streamlining users' search for needed information. BOZ analyzes a logical description of a task to be performed by a human user and designs a provably equivalent perceptual task by substituting perceptual inferences in place of logical inferences in the task description. BOZ then designs and renders an accompanying graphic that encodes and structures data such that performance of   each perceptual inference is supported and visual search is minimized. BOZ produces a graphic along with a perceptual procedure describing how to use the graphic to complete the task. A key feature of BOZ's approach is that it is able to design different presentations of the same information  customized to the requirements of different tasks. BOZ is used to design graphic presentations of airline schedule information to support five different airline reservation tasks. Reaction time studies done with real users for one task and graphic show that the BOZ-designed graphic significantly reduces users' performance time to the task. Regression analyses link the observed efficiency savings to BOZ's two key design principles: perceptual inference substitutions and pruning of visual  search.","author":["Stephen M.

Explicitly targeting the acceptability envelope during development (rather than attempting to minimize the number of errors, as is the current practice) has several potential benefits. Specifically, leaving acceptable errors in the system eliminates the risks and costs associated with attempting to repair the errors; investing fewer resources in less critical regions of the program and more resources in more critical regions may increase acceptability and reduce the overall investment of development resources.To realize these benefits, the acceptability envelope must be both sizable and accessible. We present several case studies that explore the acceptability envelopes of the Pine email client and the Sure-Player MPEG decoder. These studies show that both Pine and Sure-Player can tolerate the addition of many off-by-one errors without producing unacceptable behavior. This result suggests that current systems may be overengineered in the sense that they can tolerate many more errors than they currently contain.Our SurePlayer case study also shows that SurePlayer has unforgiving regions of code that must be close to perfect for the system to function at all. To effectively exploit the acceptability envelope, developers must be able to distinguish forgiving and unforgiving regions so that they can appropriately prioritize their development effort. In SurePlayer, the unforgiving regions occur in code that uses metadata to parse the input stream; the forgiving regions tend to access the data within each image. This result suggests that developers may be able to use relatively simple indicators to effectively prioritize their development effort.","author":["Martin Rinard","Cristian Cadar","Huu Hai Nguyen"],"issue":["OOPSLA '05: Companion to the 20th annual ACM SIGPLAN conference on Object-oriented programming, systems, languages, and applications","October 2005","Pages   21\u201330","https://doi.org/10.1145/1094855.1094866"],"date":"16 October 2005","ref":[{"text":"Pine website. http://www.washington.edu/pine/.","order":1},{"text":"SurePlayer website. http://sureplayer.sourceforge.net/.","order":2},{"text":"A.

We use the SCEAS system [12] as a base platform to introduce new methods that can be used for ranking scientific publications. Moreover, we tune our approach along the reasoning of the prizes 'VLDB 10 Year Award' and 'SIGMOD Test of Time Award', which have been awarded in the course of the top two database conferences. Our approach can be used to objectively suggest the publications and the respective authors the are more likely to be awarded in the near future at these conferences.","author":["Antonis Sidiropoulos","Yannis Manolopoulos"],"issue":["ACM SIGMOD Record","Volume 34","Issue 4","December 2005","pp   54\u201360","https://doi.org/10.1145/1107499.1107506"],"date":"01 December 2005","ref":[{"text":"S.

We survey the \u201cstate of the art\u201d in techniques that reduce the total power consumed by a microprocessor system over time. These techniques are applied at various levels ranging from circuits to architectures, architectures to system software, and system software to applications. They also include holistic approaches that will become more important over the next decade. We conclude that power management is a multifaceted discipline that is continually expanding with new techniques being developed at every level. These techniques may eventually allow computers to break through the \u201cpower wall\u201d and achieve unprecedented levels of performance, versatility, and reliability.

Existing FPGA design flows carry out these two synthesis steps sequentially. Such a two-step approach cannot guarantee that the final delay of the circuit is optimal, because the quality of clustering depends significantly on the initial mapping result. To address this problem, we develop an algorithm that performs mapping and clustering simultaneously and optimally under a widely used clustering delay model. To our knowledge, our algorithm, named SMAC (simultaneous mapping and clustering) is the first delay-optimal algorithm to generate a synthesis solution that considers a combination of both steps. Compared to a synthesis flow using state-of-the-art mapping and clustering algorithms DAOmap [7] + T-VPACK [17] ? SMAC achieves a 25% performance gain with a 22% area overhead under the clustering delay model. After placement and routing, SMAC is 12% better in performance.","author":["Joey Y.

However, heat removal is more difficult in 3DICs, and the higher temperatures increase delay and leakage power, potentially negating the performance improvement. Thermal vias can help to remove heat, but they create routing congestion, which also leads to longer interconnects. It is therefore very difficult to tell whether or not a particular system may benefit from 3D integration. In order to help understand this trade-off, physical design experiments were performed on a low-power and a high-performance design in an existing 3DIC technology. Each design was partitioned and routed with varying numbers of tiers and thermal-via densities. A thermal-analysis methodology is developed to predict the final performance. Results show that the lowest energy per operation and delay are achieved with 4 or 5 tiers. These results show a reduction in energy and delay of up to 27% and 20% compared to a traditional 2DIC approach. In addition, it is shown that thermal-vias offer no performance benefit for the low-power system and only marginal benefit for the high-performance system.","author":["Hao Hua","Chris Mineo","Kory Schoenfliess","Ambarish Sule","Samson Melamed","Ravi Jenkal","W.

Unlike previous approaches, ours does not require the documents to be in HTML since it infers a hierarchical structure automatically. Currently, the method is used to summarize news articles sent to a Web mail account in plain text format. Subjects used a Web-enabled mobile phone emulator to access the account's inbox and view the summarized news articles. They then used the summaries to complete several information-seeking tasks, which involved answering factual questions about the stories. In comparing the hierarchical text summary setting to that in which subjects were given the full text articles, there was no significant difference in task accuracy or the time taken to complete the task. However, in the hierarchical summarization setting, the number of bytes transferred per user request is less than half that of the full text case. Finally, in comparing the new method to three other summarization methods, subjects achieved significantly better accuracy on the tasks when using hierarchical summaries.","author":["Jahna Otterbacher","Dragomir Radev","Omer Kareem"],"issue":["SIGIR '06: Proceedings of the 29th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval","August 2006","Pages   589\u2013596","https://doi.org/10.1145/1148170.1148271"],"date":"06 August 2006","ref":[{"text":"O.

A developer using the technique first partitions the computation into tasks. The execution platform then simply discards any task that encounters an error or a fault and completes the computation by executing any remaining tasks. This technique can substantially improve the robustness of the computation in the face of errors and faults. A potential concern is that discarding tasks may change the result that the computation produces.Our technique randomly samples executions of the program at varying task failure rates to obtain a quantitative, probabilistic model that characterizes the distortion of the output as a function of the task failure rates. By providing probabilistic bounds on the distortion, the model allows users to confidently accept results produced by executions with failures as long as the distortion falls within acceptable bounds. This approach may prove to be especially useful for enabling computations to successfully survive hardware failures in distributed computing environments.Our technique also produces a timing model that characterizes the execution time as a function of the task failure rates. The combination of the distortion and timing models quantifies an accuracy/execution time tradeoff. It therefore enables the development of techniques that purposefully fail tasks to reduce the execution time while keeping the distortion within acceptable bounds.","author":["Martin Rinard"],"issue":["ICS '06: Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Supercomputing","June 2006","Pages   324\u2013334","https://doi.org/10.1145/1183401.1183447"],"date":"28 June 2006","ref":[{"text":"J.

This has enabled Blue Matter to approach the effective limits of concurrency for molecular dynamics using particle-mesh (FFT-based) methods for handling electrostatic interactions. Using this decomposition, Blue Matter running on Blue Gene/L has achieved simulation rates in excess of 1000 time steps per second and demonstrated significant speed-ups to O(1) atom per node. Blue Matter employs a Communicating Sequential Process (CSP) style model with application communication state machines compiled to hardware interfaces. The scalability achieved has enabled methodologically rigorous biomolecular simulations on biologically interesting systems, such as membrane-bound proteins, whose time scales dwarf previous work on those systems, Major scaling improvements will require exploration of alternative algorithms for treating the long range electrostatics.","author":["Blake G.

The extensions presented are in four directions; an arbitrary logic function is allowed at any node, the don't cares are expressed in terms of both primary inputs and intermediate variables, a new ordering scheme is used, and maximal CSPF's are computed. These ideas are incorporated in an algorithm designed to take full advantage of the power of two-level minimization in multi-level logic synthesis systems.

Specifically, none of the existing solutions supports re-publication of the microdata, after it has been updated with insertions <u>and</u> deletions. This is a serious drawback, because currently a publisher cannot provide researchers with the most recent dataset continuously. This paper remedies the drawback. First, we reveal the characteristics of the re-publication problem that invalidate the conventional approaches leveraging k-anonymity and l-diversity. Based on rigorous theoretical analysis, we develop a new generalization principle m-invariance that effectively limits the risk of privacy disclosure in re-publication. We accompany the principle with an algorithm, which computes privacy-guarded relations that permit retrieval of accurate aggregate information about the original microdata. Our theoretical results are confirmed by extensive experiments with real data.","author":["Xiaokui Xiao","Yufei Tao"],"issue":["SIGMOD '07: Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data","June 2007","Pages   689\u2013700","https://doi.org/10.1145/1247480.1247556"],"date":"11 June 2007","ref":[{"text":"C.

The breadth and diversity of software vulnerabilities demand new security solutions that combine the speed and practicality of hardware approaches with the flexibility and robustness of software systems. This paper proposes Raksha, an architecture for software security based on dynamic information flow tracking (DIFT). Raksha provides three novel features that allow for a flexible hardware/software approach to security. First, it supports flexible and programmable security policies that enable software to direct hardware analysis towards a wide range of high-level and low-level attacks. Second, it supports multiple active security policies that can protect the system against concurrent attacks. Third, it supports low-overhead security handlers that allow software to correct, complement, or extend the hardware-based analysis without the overhead associated with operating system traps. We present an FPGA prototype for Raksha that provides a full featured Linux workstation for security analysis. Using unmodified binaries for real-world applications, we demonstrate that Raksha can detect high-level attacks such as directory traversal, command injection, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting as well as low-level attacks such as buffer overflows. We also show that low overhead exception handling is critical for analyses such as memory corruption protection in order to address false positives that occur due to the diverse code patterns in frequently used software.","author":["Michael Dalton","Hari Kannan","Christos Kozyrakis"],"issue":["ISCA '07: Proceedings of the 34th annual international symposium on Computer architecture","June 2007","Pages   482\u2013493","https://doi.org/10.1145/1250662.1250722"],"date":"09 June 2007","ref":[{"text":"CERT Coordination Center.

Automatic tools and techniques such as restructuring compilers and run-time speculative execution have failed to uncover much parallelism in these applications, in spite of a lot of effort by the research community. These difficulties have even led some researchers to wonder if there is any coarse-grain parallelism worth exploiting in irregular applications. In this paper, we describe two real-world irregular applications: a Delaunay mesh refinement application and a graphics application thatperforms agglomerative clustering. By studying the algorithms and data structures used in theseapplications, we show that there is substantial coarse-grain, data parallelism in these applications, but that this parallelism is very dependent on the input data and therefore cannot be uncoveredby compiler analysis. In principle, optimistic techniques such asthread-level speculation can be used to uncover this parallelism, but we argue that current implementations cannot accomplish thisbecause they do not use the proper abstractions for the data structuresin these programs. These insights have informed our design of the Galois system, an object-based optimistic parallelization system for irregular applications. There are three main aspects to Galois: (1) a small number of syntactic constructs for packaging optimistic parallelism as iteration over ordered and unordered sets, (2)assertions about methods in class libraries, and (3) a runtime scheme for detecting and recovering from potentially unsafe accesses to shared memory made by an optimistic computation. We show that Delaunay mesh generation and agglomerative clustering can be parallelized in a straight-forward way using the Galois approach, and we present experimental measurements to show that this approach is practical. These results suggest that Galois is a practical approach to exploiting data parallelismin irregular programs.","author":["Milind Kulkarni","Keshav Pingali","Bruce Walter","Ganesh Ramanarayanan","Kavita Bala","L.

Consequently, mobile phones require more hardware resources such as NOR/NAND flash memory and DRAM, and their production cost is accordingly becoming higher. One candidate solution to reduce production cost is demand paging using MMU. However, demand paging causes unpredictably long page fault latency, and as such mobile phone manufacturers are reluctant to deploy this scheme. In this paper, we present a method that reduces the long latency of page faults by performing page fault handling in a parallelized manner, considering the characteristics of NAND-Type flash memory. We also discuss how to modify the existing page cache replacement policies so that they can exploit the benefits of the parallelized page fault handler. Experimental results show that the parallelized page fault handler improves the worst case latency of page faults significantly, by up to roughly 20%, and that the modified page cache replacement policies improve both the average and worst instruction fetch time.","author":["Jihyun In","Ilhoon Shin","Hyojun Kim"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 42","Issue 7","July 2007","pp   217\u2013226","https://doi.org/10.1145/1273444.1254806"],"date":"13 June 2007","ref":[{"text":"C.

Accurately modeling of these correlated behaviors is crucial for many timing and power analyses to be valid. This paper proposes a new spatial model with a long-range trend component, a smooth correlation component, as well as a truly random component. The efficient method to construct such a spatial model is based on the Generalized Least Square fitting and the structured correlation functions, which are actually the generalization of the popular Pelgrom mismatch models. Experimental results on industrial benchmarks show that the method is not only highly effective for variability modeling, but can also be used for other spatially distributed characteristics such as IR drops and on-chip temperature distributions.","author":["Frank Liu"],"issue":["DAC '07: Proceedings of the 44th annual Design Automation Conference","June 2007","Pages   817\u2013822","https://doi.org/10.1145/1278480.1278684"],"date":"04 June 2007","ref":[{"text":"K.

As a result, the useful bandwidth depends on the transmission distance, a feature that distinguishes an underwater acoustic system from a terrestrial radio one. This fact influences the design of an acoustic network: a greater information throughput is available if messages are relayed over multiple short hops instead of being transmitted directly over one long hop. We asses the bandwidth dependency on the distance using an analytical method that takes into account physical models of acoustic propagation loss and ambient noise. A simple, single-path time-invariant model is considered as a first step. To assess the fundamental bandwidth limitation, we take an information-theoretic approach and define the bandwidth corresponding to optimal signal energy allocation -- one that maximizes the channel capacity subject to the constraint that the transmission power is finite. Numerical evaluation quantifies the bandwidth and the channel capacity, as well as the transmission power needed to achieve a pre-specified SNR threshold, as functions of distance. These results lead to closed-form approximations, which may become useful tools in the design and analysis of acoustic networks.","author":["Milica Stojanovic"],"issue":["ACM SIGMOBILE Mobile Computing and Communications Review","Volume 11","Issue 4","October 2007","pp   34\u201343","https://doi.org/10.1145/1347364.1347373"],"date":"01 October 2007","ref":[{"text":"I.

This is aggravated by the strong demand for lower cost and power consumption, higher performance and density which complicates SRAM design process. In this paper, we present a methodology for statistical simulation of SRAM read access yield, which is tightly related to SRAM performance and power consumption. The proposed flow enables early SRAM yield predication and performance/power optimization in the design time, which is important for SRAM in nanometer technologies. The methodology is verified using measured silicon yield data from a 1 Mb memory fabricated in an industrial 45nm technology.","author":["Mohamed H.

While only recently studied, IC piracy has now become a major challenge for the electronics and defense industries [6]. We propose a novel comprehensive technique to end piracy of integrated circuits (EPIC). It requires that every chip be activated with an external key, which can only be generated by the holder of IP rights, and cannot be duplicated. EPIC is based on (i) automatically-generated chip IDs, (ii) a novel combinational locking algorithm, and (iii) innovative use of public-key cryptography. Our evaluation suggests that the overhead of EPIC on circuit delay and power is negligible, and the standard flows for verification and test do not require change. In fact, major required components have already been integrated into several chips in production. We also use formal methods to evaluate combinational locking and computational attacks. A comprehensive protocol analysis concludes that EPIC is surprisingly resistant to various piracy attempts.","author":["Jarrod A. Roy","Farinaz Koushanfar","Igor L.

Computing elements are operated at a frequency higher than that permitted by a conventionally correct circuit design, enabling a trade-off between error that is deliberately introduced, and the energy consumed. Similar techniques considered previously were relevant to deeply scaled future technology generations. Our work extends this idea to be applicable to current-day designs through: (i) a mathematically rigorous foundation characterizing a tradeoff between energy consumed and the quality of solution, and (ii) a means of achieving this trade off through very aggressive voltage scaling beyond that of a conventionally designed circuit. Through our \"cmos inspired\" mathematical model, we show that our approach is better (by an exponential factor) than the conventional uniform voltage scaling approach for comparable computational speed or performance. We further establish through experimental study that a similar improvement by a factor of 3.4x to the snr over conventional voltage-scaled approaches can be achieved in the context of the ubiquitous discrete Fourier transform.","author":["Lakshmi N.B.

An operational semantics of qCCS is presented in terms of (nonprobabilistic) labeled transition systems. Strong bisimulation between processes modeled in qCCS is defined, and its fundamental algebraic properties are established, including uniqueness of the solutions of recursive equations. To model sequential computation in qCCS, a reduction relation between processes is defined. By combining reduction relation and strong bisimulation we introduce the notion of strong reduction-bisimulation, which is a device for observing interaction of computation and communication in quantum systems. Finally, a notion of strong approximate bisimulation (equivalently, strong bisimulation distance) and its reduction counterpart are introduced. It is proved that both approximate bisimilarity and approximate reduction-bisimilarity are preserved by various constructors of quantum processes. This provides us with a formal tool for observing robustness of quantum processes against inaccuracy in the implementation of its elementary gates.","author":["Mingsheng Ying","Yuan Feng","Runyao Duan","Zhengfeng Ji"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Computational Logic","Volume 10","Issue 3","April 2009","Article No.: 19","pp   1\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/1507244.1507249"],"date":"08 April 2009","ref":[{"text":"Breugel, F.

The signals are combined to form one large, virtual telescope. The enormous data streams are cross-correlated to filter out noise. This is especially challenging, since the computational demands grow quadratically with the number of data streams. Moreover, the correlator is not only computationally intensive, but also very I/O intensive. The LOFAR telescope, for instance, will produce over 100 terabytes per day. The future SKA telescope will even require in the order of exaflops, and petabits/s of I/O. A recent trend is to correlate in software instead of dedicated hardware. This is done to increase flexibility and to reduce development efforts. Examples include e-VLBI and LOFAR. In this paper, we evaluate the correlator algorithm on multi-core CPUs and many-core architectures, such as NVIDIA and ATI GPUs, and the Cell/B.E. The correlator is a streaming, real-time application, and is much more I/O intensive than applications that are typically implemented on many-core hardware today. We compare with the LOFAR production correlator on an IBM Blue Gene/P supercomputer. We investigate performance, power efficiency, and programmability. We identify several important architectural problems which cause architectures to perform suboptimally. Our findings are applicable to data-intensive applications in general. The results show that the processing power and memory bandwidth of current GPUs are highly imbalanced for correlation purposes. While the production correlator on the Blue Gene/P achieves a superb 96% of the theoretical peak performance, this is only 14% on ATI GPUs, and 26% on NVIDIA GPUs. The Cell/B.E. processor, in contrast, achieves an excellent 92%. We found that the Cell/B.E. is also the most energy-efficient solution, it runs the correlator 5-7 times more energy efficiently than the Blue Gene/P. The research presented is an important pathfinder for next-generation telescopes.","author":["Rob V. van Nieuwpoort","John W.

Although the basic control flow of this framework has existed in parallel SQL database management systems (DBMS) for over 20 years, some have called MR a dramatically new computing model [8, 17]. In this paper, we describe and compare both paradigms. Furthermore, we evaluate both kinds of systems in terms of performance and development complexity. To this end, we define a benchmark consisting of a collection of tasks that we have run on an open source version of MR as well as on two parallel DBMSs. For each task, we measure each system's performance for various degrees of parallelism on a cluster of 100 nodes. Our results reveal some interesting trade-offs. Although the process to load data into and tune the execution of parallel DBMSs took much longer than the MR system, the observed performance of these DBMSs was strikingly better. We speculate about the causes of the dramatic performance difference and consider implementation concepts that future systems should take from both kinds of architectures.","author":["Andrew Pavlo","Erik Paulson","Alexander Rasin","Daniel J.

There are well-known anomalies permitted by snapshot isolation that can lead to violations of data consistency by interleaving transactions that would maintain consistency if run serially. Until now, the only way to prevent these anomalies was to modify the applications by introducing explicit locking or artificial update conflicts, following careful analysis of conflicts between all pairs of transactions.This article describes a modification to the concurrency control algorithm of a database management system that automatically detects and prevents snapshot isolation anomalies at runtime for arbitrary applications, thus providing serializable isolation. The new algorithm preserves the properties that make snapshot isolation attractive, including that readers do not block writers and vice versa. An implementation of the algorithm in a relational DBMS is described, along with a benchmark and performance study, showing that the throughput approaches that of snapshot isolation in most cases.","author":["Michael J.

Despite numerous compiler and high-level synthesis studies, usage of such systems has largely been limited to device experts, due to significantly increased application design complexity. To reduce application design complexity, we introduce elastic computing - a framework that separates functionality from implementation details by enabling designers to use specialized functions, called elastic functions, which enable an optimization framework to explore thousands of possible implementations, even ones using different algorithms. Elastic functions allow designers to execute the same application code efficiently on potentially any architecture and for different runtime parameters such as input size, battery life, etc. In this paper, we present an initial elastic computing framework that transparently optimizes application code onto diverse systems, achieving significant speedups ranging from 1.3x to 46x on a hyper-threaded Xeon system with an FPGA accelerator, a 16-CPU Opteron system, and a quad-core Xeon system.","author":["John Robert Wernsing","Greg Stitt"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 45","Issue 4","April 2010","pp   115\u2013124","https://doi.org/10.1145/1755951.1755906"],"date":"13 April 2010","ref":[{"text":"J.

As the inter-cluster criterion to minimize, the sum on intra-cluster errors over every cluster is used, and as the intra-cluster criterion of a cluster Sj, |Sj|\u03b1-1 \u03a3pi\u03f5Sj || xi - x(Sj)||2 is considered, where ||\u00b7|| is the L2 norm and x(Sj) is the centroid of points in Sj, i.e., (1/|Sj|)\u03a3p \u2208Sjxi. The cases of \u03b1=1,2 correspond to the sum of squared errors and the all-pairs sum of squared errors, respectively. The k-clustering problem under the criterion with \u03b1=1,2 are treated in a unified manner by characterizing the optimum solution to the kclustering problem by the ordinary Euclidean Voronoi diagram and the weighted Voronoi diagram with both multiplicative and additive weights. With this framework, the problem is related to the generalized primary shutter function for the Voronoi diagrams. The primary shutter function is shown to be O(nO(kd)), which implies that, for fixed k, this clustering problem can be solved in a polynomial time. For the problem with the most typical intra-cluster criterion of the sum of squared errors, we also present an efficient randomized algorithm which, roughly speaking, finds an \u2208\u2013approximate 2\u2013clustering in O(n(1/\u2208)d) time, which is quite practical and may be used to real large-scale problems such as the color quantization problem.","author":["Mary Inaba","Naoki Katoh","Hiroshi Imai"],"issue":["SCG '94: Proceedings of the tenth annual symposium on Computational geometry","June 1994","Pages   332\u2013339","https://doi.org/10.1145/177424.178042"],"date":"10 June 1994","ref":[{"text":"T.

This is widely considered to be a very challenging problem due to the difficulty of parallel programming and the bottlenecks to efficient parallel execution. Inspired by how networking and storage systems have scaled to handle very large volumes of packet traffic and persistent data, we propose a new approach to the design of scalable, parallel computing platforms. For decades, computing platforms have gone to great lengths to ensure that every computation specified by applications is faithfully executed. While this design philosophy has remained largely unchanged, applications and the basic characteristics of their workloads have changed considerably. A wide range of existing and emerging computing workloads have an inherent forgiving nature. We therefore argue that adopting a best-effort service model for various software and hardware components of the computing platform stack can lead to drastic improvements in scalability. Applications are cognizant of the best-effort model, and separate their computations into those that may be executed on a best-effort basis and those that require the traditional execution guarantees. Best-effort computations may be exploited to simply reduce the computing workload, shape it to be more suitable for parallel execution, or execute it on unreliable hardware components. Guaranteed computations are realized either through an overlay software layer on top of the best-effort substrate, or through the use of application-specific strategies. We describe a system architecture for a best-effort computing platform, provide examples of parallel software and hardware that embody the best-effort model, and show that large improvements in performance and energy efficiency are possible through the adoption of this approach.","author":["Srimat T.

Our goal is to efficiently extract multiple performance models to cover different modes/corners with a small number of simulation samples. To this end, an efficient Bayesian inference with shared prior distribution (i.e., model template) is developed to explore the strong performance correlation among different modes/corners in order to achieve high modeling accuracy with low computational cost. Several industrial circuit examples demonstrate that the proposed MSR achieves up to 185x speedup over least-squares regression [14] and 6.7x speedup over least-angle regression [7] without surrendering any accuracy.","author":["Wangyang Zhang","Tsung-Hao Chen","Ming-Yuan Ting","Xin Li"],"issue":["DAC '10: Proceedings of the 47th Design Automation Conference","June 2010","Pages   897\u2013902","https://doi.org/10.1145/1837274.1837500"],"date":"13 June 2010","ref":[{"text":"Semiconductor Industry Associate,","order":1},{"text":"X.

While there is some research into power-aware storage stack components, there are no systematic studies evaluating each component's impact separately. Various factors like workloads, hardware configurations, and software configurations impact the performance and energy efficiency of the system. This article evaluates the file system's impact on energy consumption and performance. We studied several popular Linux file systems, with various mount and format options, using the FileBench workload generator to emulate four server workloads: Web, database, mail, and fileserver, on two different hardware configurations. The file system design, implementation, and available features have a significant effect on CPU/disk utilization, and hence on performance and power. We discovered that default file system options are often suboptimal, and even poor. In this article we show that a careful matching of expected workloads and hardware configuration to a single software configuration\u2014the file system\u2014can improve power-performance efficiency by a factor ranging from 1.05 to 9.4 times.","author":["Priya Sehgal","Vasily Tarasov","Erez Zadok"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 6","Issue 3","September 2010","Article No.: 10","pp   1\u201331","https://doi.org/10.1145/1837915.1837918"],"date":"28 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"}}Allalouf, M., Arbitman, Y., Factor, M., Kat, R.

This paper explores the use of a new emerging non-volatile memory technology as a replacement for SRAM based lower level caches - Spin Torque Transfer(STT) RAM. While STTRAM achieves a reduction in leakage energy of 90% compared to SRAM, the dynamic energy for a write operation is 2X that of SRAM. Consequently, we propose additional microarchitectural optimizations to reduce overall dynamic energy which achieve an average reduction in dynamic energy over the base case of 30% with a range of 16% to 60% across 10 benchmarks.","author":["Mitchelle Rasquinha","Dhruv Choudhary","Subho Chatterjee","Saibal Mukhopadhyay","Sudhakar Yalamanchili"],"issue":["ISLPED '10: Proceedings of the 16th ACM/IEEE international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2010","Pages   389\u2013394","https://doi.org/10.1145/1840845.1840931"],"date":"18 August 2010","ref":[{"text":"Ramaswamy, S. and Yalamanchili, S. 2008.

In a replicated database, some data items may be stored at multiple sites. The main motivation is improved reliability: by storing important data at multiple sites, the DBS can operate even though some sites have failed.This paper describes an algorithm for handling replicated data, which allows users to operate on data so long as one copy is \u201cavailable.\u201d A copy is \u201cavailable\u201d when (i) its site is up, and (ii) the copy is not out-of-date because of an earlier crash.The algorithm handles clean, detectable site failures, but not Byzantine failures or network partitions.","author":["Philip A.

Several commercial and research parallel file systems have been developed in recent years to ease the performance bottleneck. These advanced file systems perform well on some applications but may not perform well on others. They have not reached their full potential in mitigating the I/O-wall problem. Data access is application dependent. Based on the application-specific optimization principle, in this study we propose a cost-intelligent data access strategy to improve the performance of parallel file systems. We first present a novel model to estimate data access cost of different data layout policies. Next, we extend the cost model to calculate the overall I/O cost of any given application and choose an appropriate layout policy for the application. A complex application may consist of different data access patterns. Averaging the data access patterns may not be the best solution for those complex applications that do not have a dominant pattern. We then further propose a hybrid data replication strategy for those applications, so that a file can have replications with different layout policies for the best performance. Theoretical analysis and experimental testing have been conducted to verify the newly proposed cost-intelligent layout approach. Analytical and experimental results show that the proposed cost model is effective and the application-specific data layout approach achieved up to 74% performance improvement for data-intensive applications.","author":["Huaiming Song","Yanlong Yin","Yong Chen","Xian-He Sun"],"issue":["HPDC '11: Proceedings of the 20th international symposium on High performance distributed computing","June 2011","Pages   37\u201348","https://doi.org/10.1145/1996130.1996138"],"date":"08 June 2011","ref":[{"text":"\"Lustre: A Scalable, Robust, Highly-available Cluster File System,\" White Paper, Cluster File Systems, Inc., 2006. {Online}.

In this paper, we explore its use to relieve hotspots in oversubscribed data center (DC) networks. By experimenting with prototype equipment, we show that the DC environment is well suited to a deployment of 60GHz links contrary to concerns about interference and link reliability. Using directional antennas, many wireless links can run concurrently at multi-Gbps rates on top-of-rack (ToR) switches. The wired DC network can be used to sidestep several common wireless problems. By analyzing production traces of DC traffic for four real applications, we show that adding a small amount of network capacity in the form of wireless flyways to the wired DC network can improve performance. However, to be of significant value, we find that one hop indirect routing is needed. Informed by our 60GHz experiments and DC traffic analysis, we present a design that uses DC traffic levels to select and adds flyways to the wired DC network. Trace-driven evaluations show that network-limited DC applications with predictable traffic workloads running on a 1:2 oversubscribed network can be sped up by 45% in 95% of the cases, with just one wireless device per ToR switch. With two devices, in 40% of the cases, the performance is identical to that of a non-oversubscribed network.","author":["Daniel Halperin","Srikanth Kandula","Jitendra Padhye","Paramvir Bahl","David Wetherall"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 41","Issue 4","August 2011","pp   38\u201349","https://doi.org/10.1145/2043164.2018442"],"date":"15 August 2011","ref":[{"text":"M.

Heterogeneous computing is emerging as a powerful alternative to conventional multi-core to help address these challenges. In this paper we describe our approach to Maximum Performance Computing - building applicationspecific computers which complement conventional x86 processors with high performance dataflow engines implemented on FPGA to provide 10-100x improvements in performance and performance/W.

The former gives excellent performance for the in-vocabulary (IV) words; however, it handles out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words poorly. On the other hand, though the latter is more robust for OOV words, it fails to deliver satisfactory performance for IV words. These two approaches behave differently due to the unit they use (word vs. character) and the model form they adopt (generative vs. discriminative). In general, character-based approaches are more robust than word-based ones, as the vocabulary of characters is a closed set; and discriminative models are more robust than generative ones, since they can flexibly include all kinds of available information, such as future context.This article first proposes a character-based n-gram model to enhance the robustness of the generative approach. Then the proposed generative model is further integrated with the character-based discriminative model to take advantage of both approaches. Our experiments show that this integrated approach outperforms all the existing approaches reported in the literature. Afterwards, a complete and detailed error analysis is conducted. Since a significant portion of the critical errors is related to numerical/foreign strings, character-type information is then incorporated into the model to further improve its performance. Last, the proposed integrated approach is tested on cross-domain corpora, and a semi-supervised domain adaptation algorithm is proposed and shown to be effective in our experiments.","author":["Kun Wang","Chengqing Zong","Keh-Yih Su"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing","Volume 11","Issue 2","June 2012","Article No.: 7","pp   1\u201341","https://doi.org/10.1145/2184436.2184440"],"date":"01 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"2006.

The ongoing information explosion highlights the need to enable machines to better understand electronic text in human language. Much work has been devoted to creating universal ontologies or taxonomies for this purpose. However, none of the existing ontologies has the needed depth and breadth for universal understanding. In this paper, we present a universal, probabilistic taxonomy that is more comprehensive than any existing ones. It contains 2.7 million concepts harnessed automatically from a corpus of 1.68 billion web pages. Unlike traditional taxonomies that treat knowledge as black and white, it uses probabilities to model inconsistent, ambiguous and uncertain information it contains. We present details of how the taxonomy is constructed, its probabilistic modeling, and its potential applications in text understanding.","author":["Wentao Wu","Hongsong Li","Haixun Wang","Kenny Q.

For applications related to human senses, approximate arithmetic can be used to generate sufficient results rather than absolutely accurate results. Approximate design exploits a tradeoff of accuracy in computation versus performance and power. However, required accuracy varies according to applications, and 100% accurate results are still required in some situations. In this paper, we propose an accuracy-configurable approximate (ACA) adder for which the accuracy of results is configurable <u>during runtime.</u> Because of its configurability, the ACA adder can adaptively operate in both approximate (inaccurate) mode and accurate mode. The proposed adder can achieve significant throughput improvement and total power reduction over conventional adder designs. It can be used in accuracy-configurable applications, and improves the achievable tradeoff between performance/power and quality. The ACA adder achieves approximately 30% power reduction versus the conventional pipelined adder at the relaxed accuracy requirement.","author":["Andrew B.

In this paper, we propose a simple data structure, called a join index, for improving the performance of joins in the context of complex queries. For most of the joins, updates to join indices incur very little overhead. Some properties of a join index are (i) its efficient use of memory and adaptiveness to parallel execution, (ii) its compatibility with other operations (including select and union), (iii) its support for abstract data type join predicates, (iv) its support for multirelation clustering, and (v) its use in representing directed graphs and in evaluating recursive queries. Finally, the analysis of the join algorithm using join indices shows its excellent performance.","author":["Patrick Valduriez"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Database Systems","Volume 12","Issue 2","June 1987","pp   218\u2013246","https://doi.org/10.1145/22952.22955"],"date":"01 June 1987","ref":[{"text":"BAYER, R., AND MCCREIGHT, E.

Graph-coloring register allocation is an elegant approach to this problem. If the source and destination of a move instruction do not interfere, then their nodes can be coalesced in the interference graph. Chaitin's coalescing heuristic could make a graph uncolorable (i.e., introduce spills); Briggs et al. demonstrated a conservative coalescing heuristic that preserves colorability. But Briggs's algorithm is too conservative and leaves too many move instructions in our programs. We show how to interleave coloring reductions with Briggs's coalescing heuristic, leading to an algorithm that is safe but much more aggressive.","author":["Lal George","Andrew W.

Accordingly, they are receiving increased attention from the research community in an effort to improve their performance, scalability, reliability, cost, and power consumption. To be effective, such efforts require a detailed understanding of realistic key-value workloads. And yet little is known about these workloads outside of the companies that operate them. This paper aims to address this gap.To this end, we have collected detailed traces from Facebook's Memcached deployment, arguably the world's largest. The traces capture over 284 billion requests from five different Memcached use cases over several days. We analyze the workloads from multiple angles, including: request composition, size, and rate; cache efficacy; temporal patterns; and application use cases. We also propose a simple model of the most representative trace to enable the generation of more realistic synthetic workloads by the community.Our analysis details many characteristics of the caching workload. It also reveals a number of surprises: a GET/SET ratio of 30:1 that is higher than assumed in the literature; some applications of Memcached behave more like persistent storage than a cache; strong locality metrics, such as keys accessed many millions of times a day, do not always suffice for a high hit rate; and there is still room for efficiency and hit rate improvements in Memcached's implementation. Toward the last point, we make several suggestions that address the exposed deficiencies.","author":["Berk Atikoglu","Yuehai Xu","Eitan Frachtenberg","Song Jiang","Mike Paleczny"],"issue":["ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review","Volume 40","Issue 1","June 2012","pp   53\u201364","https://doi.org/10.1145/2318857.2254766"],"date":"11 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"http://voldemort-project.com.","order":1},{"text":"Ahmad, I.

Two experiments show that motion cues combined with stereo viewing can substantially increase the size of the graph that can be preceived. The first experiment was designed to provide quantitiative measurements of how much more (or less) can be understood in 3D than in 2D. The 3D display used was configured so that the image on the monitor was coupled to the user's actual eye positons (and it was updated in real-time as the user moved) as well as bring in stereo. Thus the effect was like a local \u201cvirtual reality\u201d display located in the vicinity of the computer monitor. The results from this study show that head-coupled stereo viewing can increase the size of an abstract graph that can be understood by a factor of three; using stereo alone provided an increase by a factor of 1.6 and head coupling along produced an increase by a factor of 2.2. The second experiment examined a variety of motion cues provided by head-coupled perspective (as in virtual reality displays), head-guided motion and automatic rotation, respectively, both with and without stereo in each case. The results show that structured 3D motion and stereo viewing both help in understanding, but that the kind of motion is not particularly important; all improve performance, and all are more significant than stereo cues. These results provide strong reasons for using advanced 3D graphics for interacting with a large variety of information structures.","author":["Colin Ware","Glenn Franck"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 15","Issue 2","April 1996","pp   121\u2013140","https://doi.org/10.1145/234972.234975"],"date":"01 April 1996","ref":[{"text":"ARTHUR, K., BOOTH, K.

DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed to prevent loss of data. These refresh operations waste energy and degrade system performance by interfering with memory accesses. The negative effects of DRAM refresh increase as DRAM device capacity increases. Existing DRAM devices refresh all cells at a rate determined by the leakiest cell in the device. However, most DRAM cells can retain data for significantly longer. Therefore, many of these refreshes are unnecessary.In this paper, we propose RAIDR (Retention-Aware Intelligent DRAM Refresh), a low-cost mechanism that can identify and skip unnecessary refreshes using knowledge of cell retention times. Our key idea is to group DRAM rows into retention time bins and apply a different refresh rate to each bin. As a result, rows containing leaky cells are refreshed as frequently as normal, while most rows are refreshed less frequently. RAIDR uses Bloom filters to efficiently implement retention time bins. RAIDR requires no modification to DRAM and minimal modification to the memory controller. In an 8-core system with 32 GB DRAM, RAIDR achieves a 74.6% refresh reduction, an average DRAM power reduction of 16.1%, and an average system performance improvement of 8.6% over existing systems, at a modest storage overhead of 1.25 KB in the memory controller. RAIDR's benefits are robust to variation in DRAM system configuration, and increase as memory capacity increases.","author":["Jamie Liu","Ben Jaiyen","Richard Veras","Onur Mutlu"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 40","Issue 3","June 2012","pp   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2366231.2337161"],"date":"09 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"B.

In practice, however, failures and maintenance of networking and power equipment often make tens to thousands of servers unavailable, and network congestion can increase service latency. Unfortunately, there exists an inherent tradeoff between achieving high fault tolerance and reducing bandwidth usage in network core; spreading servers across fault domains improves fault tolerance, but requires additional bandwidth, while deploying servers together reduces bandwidth usage, but also decreases fault tolerance. We present a detailed analysis of a large-scale Web application and its communication patterns. Based on that, we propose and evaluate a novel optimization framework that achieves both high fault tolerance and significantly reduces bandwidth usage in the network core by exploiting the skewness in the observed communication patterns.","author":["Peter Bod\u00edk","Ishai Menache","Mosharaf Chowdhury","Pradeepkumar Mani","David A.

Many in the research community believe that this exponential core scaling will continue into the hundreds or thousands of cores per chip, auguring a parallelism revolution in hardware or software. However, while transistor count increases continue at traditional Moore's Law rates, the per-transistor speed and energy efficiency improvements have slowed dramatically. Under these conditions, more cores are only possible if the cores are slower, simpler, or less utilized with each additional technology generation. This paper brings together transistor technology, processor core, and application models to understand whether multicore scaling can sustain the historical exponential performance growth in this energy-limited era. As the number of cores increases, power constraints may prevent powering of all cores at their full speed, requiring a fraction of the cores to be powered off at all times. According to our models, the fraction of these chips that is \"dark\" may be as much as 50% within three process generations. The low utility of this \"dark silicon\" may prevent both scaling to higher core counts and ultimately the economic viability of continued silicon scaling. Our results show that core count scaling provides much less performance gain than conventional wisdom suggests. Under (highly) optimistic scaling assumptions---for parallel workloads---multicore scaling provides a 7.9\u00d7 (23% per year) over ten years. Under more conservative (realistic) assumptions, multicore scaling provides a total performance gain of 3.7\u00d7 (14% per year) over ten years, and obviously less when sufficiently parallel workloads are unavailable. Without a breakthrough in process technology or microarchitecture, other directions are needed to continue the historical rate of performance improvement.","author":["Hadi Esmaeilzadeh","Emily Blem","Ren\u00e9e St. Amant","Karthikeyan Sankaralingam","Doug Burger"],"issue":["Communications of the ACM","Volume 56","Issue 2","February 2013","pp   93\u2013102","https://doi.org/10.1145/2408776.2408797"],"date":"01 February 2013","ref":[{"text":"Amdahl, G.M.

However, in reality, user-specified trust relations are very sparse, i.e., a tiny number of pairs of users with trust relations are buried in a disproportionately large number of pairs without trust relations, making trust prediction a daunting task. As an important social concept, however, trust has received growing attention and interest. Social theories are developed for understanding trust. Homophily is one of the most important theories that explain why trust relations are established. Exploiting the homophily effect for trust prediction provides challenges and opportunities. In this paper, we embark on the challenges to investigate the trust prediction problem with the homophily effect. First, we delineate how it differs from existing approaches to trust prediction in an unsupervised setting. Next, we formulate the new trust prediction problem into an optimization problem integrated with homophily, empirically evaluate our approach on two datasets from real-world product review sites, and compare with representative algorithms to gain a deep understanding of the role of homophily in trust prediction.","author":["Jiliang Tang","Huiji Gao","Xia Hu","Huan Liu"],"issue":["WSDM '13: Proceedings of the sixth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining","February 2013","Pages   53\u201362","https://doi.org/10.1145/2433396.2433405"],"date":"04 February 2013","ref":[{"text":"P.

This problem is NP-complete, and the difficulty of solving it is the basis of public-key cryptosystems of knapsack type. An algorithm is proposed that searches for a solution when given an instance of the subset sum problem. This algorithm always halts in polynomial time but does not always find a solution when one exists. It converts the problem to one of finding a particular short vector v in a lattice, and then uses a lattice basis reduction algorithm due to A. K. Lenstra, H. W. Lenstra, Jr., and L. Lovasz to attempt to find v. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Let the density d of a subset sum problem be defined by d = n/log2(maxi ai). Then for \u201calmost all\u201d problems of density d < 0.645, the vector v we searched for is the shortest nonzero vector in the lattice. For \u201calmost all\u201d problems of density d < 1/n, it is proved that the lattice basis reduction algorithm locates v. Extensive computational tests of the algorithm suggest that it works for densities d < dc(n), where dc(n) is a cutoff value that is substantially larger than 1/n. This method gives a polynomial time attack on knapsack public-key cryptosystems that can be expected to break them if they transmit information at rates below dc(n), as n \u2192 \u221e.","author":["J.

It is unique in that it represents and processes information in the form of digitized probabilities. SC employs very low-complexity arithmetic units which was a primary design concern in the past. Despite this advantage and also its inherent error tolerance, SC was seen as impractical because of very long computation times and relatively low accuracy. However, current technology trends tend to increase uncertainty in circuit behavior and imply a need to better understand, and perhaps exploit, probability in computation. This article surveys SC from a modern perspective where the small size, error resilience, and probabilistic features of SC may compete successfully with conventional methodologies in certain applications. First, we survey the literature and review the key concepts of stochastic number representation and circuit structure. We then describe the design of SC-based circuits and evaluate their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we give examples of the potential applications of SC and discuss some practical problems that are yet to be solved.","author":["Armin Alaghi","John P.

We demonstrate that existing warp scheduling policies in GPGPU architectures are unable to effectively incorporate data prefetching. The main reason is that they schedule consecutive warps, which are likely to access nearby cache blocks and thus prefetch accurately for one another, back-to-back in consecutive cycles. This either 1) causes prefetches to be generated by a warp too close to the time their corresponding addresses are actually demanded by another warp, or 2) requires sophisticated prefetcher designs to correctly predict the addresses required by a future \"far-ahead\" warp while executing the current warp. We propose a new prefetch-aware warp scheduling policy that overcomes these problems. The key idea is to separate in time the scheduling of consecutive warps such that they are not executed back-to-back. We show that this policy not only enables a simple prefetcher to be effective in tolerating memory latencies but also improves memory bank parallelism, even when prefetching is not employed. Experimental evaluations across a diverse set of applications on a 30-core simulated GPGPU platform demonstrate that the prefetch-aware warp scheduler provides 25% and 7% average performance improvement over baselines that employ prefetching in conjunction with, respectively, the commonly-employed round-robin scheduler or the recently-proposed two-level warp scheduler. Moreover, when prefetching is not employed, the prefetch-aware warp scheduler provides higher performance than both of these baseline schedulers as it better exploits memory bank parallelism.","author":["Adwait Jog","Onur Kayiran","Asit K.

First, we use a streaming data model and configure part of the L2 cache into a ray stream memory to enable efficient data processing through ray reordering. This increases the L1 hit rate and reduces off-chip memory accesses substantially. Second, we employ reconfigurable special-purpose pipelines than are constructed dynamically under program control. These pipelines use shared execution units (XUs) that can be configured to support the common compute kernels that are the foundation of the ray tracing algorithm, such as acceleration structure traversal and triangle intersection. This reduces the overhead incurred by memory and register accesses. These two synergistic features yield a ray tracing architecture that significantly reduces both power consumption and off-chip memory traffic when compared to a more traditional cache only approach.","author":["Daniel Kopta","Konstantin Shkurko","Josef Spjut","Erik Brunvand","Al Davis"],"issue":["HPG '13: Proceedings of the 5th High-Performance Graphics Conference","July 2013","Pages   121\u2013128","https://doi.org/10.1145/2492045.2492058"],"date":"19 July 2013","ref":[{"text":"Aila, T., and Karras, T. 2010.

In particular, we try to tease apart the performance contributions from two sources: the improved sched- ules enabled by OOO hardware speculation support and its ability to generate different schedules on different occurrences of the same instructions based on operand and functional unit availability. We find that the ability to express good static schedules achieves the bulk of the speedup resulting from OOO. Specifically, of the 53% speedup achieved by OOO relative to a similarly provisioned in- order machine, we find that 88% of that speedup can be achieved by using a single \"best\" static schedule as suggested by observing an OOO schedule of the code. We discuss the ISA mechanisms that would be required to express these static schedules. Furthermore, we find that the benefits of dynamism largely come from two kinds of events that influence the application's critical path: load instructions that miss in the cache only part of the time and branch mispredictions. We find that much of the benefit of OOO dynamism can be achieved by the potentially simpler task of addressing these two behaviors directly.","author":["Daniel S.

Typically, the compressor splits the original data into blocks and compresses each block with variable-length codes, hence producing variable-length compressed blocks. Although the compressor can easily exploit ample block-level parallelism, it is much more difficult to extract such coarse-grain parallelism from the decompressor because a block boundary cannot be located until decompression of the previous block is completed. This paper presents novel algorithms to efficiently predict block boundaries and a runtime system that enables efficient block-level parallel decompression, called SDM. The SDM execution model features speculative pipelining with three stages: Scanner, Decompressor, and Merger. The scanner stage employs a high-confidence prediction algorithm that finds compressed block boundaries without fully decompressing individual blocks. This information is communicated to the parallel decompressor stage in which multiple blocks are decompressed in parallel. The decompressed blocks are merged in order by the merger stage to produce the final output. The SDM runtime is specialized to execute this pipeline correctly and efficiently on resource-constrained embedded platforms. With SDM we effectively parallelize three production-grade variable-length decompression algorithms?zlib, bzip2, and H.264?with maximum speedups of 2.50\u00d7 and 8.53\u00d7 (and geometric mean speedups of 1.96\u00d7 and 4.04\u00d7) on 4-core and 36-core embedded platforms, respectively.","author":["Hakbeom Jang","Channoh Kim","Jae W.

For particular domains such as multimedia and learning algorithms, approximation is commonly used today. We consider automation to be essential to provide transparent approximation and we show that larger benefits can be achieved by constructing the approximation techniques to fit the underlying hardware. Our target platform is the GPU because of its high performance capabilities and difficult programming challenges that can be alleviated with proper automation. Our approach, SAGE, combines a static compiler that automatically generates a set of CUDA kernels with varying levels of approximation with a run-time system that iteratively selects among the available kernels to achieve speedup while adhering to a target output quality set by the user. The SAGE compiler employs three optimization techniques to generate approximate kernels that exploit the GPU microarchitecture: selective discarding of atomic operations, data packing, and thread fusion. Across a set of machine learning and image processing kernels, SAGE's approximation yields an average of 2.5x speedup with less than 10% quality loss compared to the accurate execution on a NVIDIA GTX 560 GPU.","author":["Mehrzad Samadi","Janghaeng Lee","D.

Even though these bulk data operations do not require any computation, current systems transfer a large quantity of data back and forth on the memory channel to perform such operations. As a result, bulk data operations consume high latency, bandwidth, and energy--degrading both system performance and energy efficiency. In this work, we propose RowClone, a new and simple mechanism to perform bulk copy and initialization completely within DRAM -- eliminating the need to transfer any data over the memory channel to perform such operations. Our key observation is that DRAM can internally and efficiently transfer a large quantity of data (multiple KBs) between a row of DRAM cells and the associated row buffer. Based on this, our primary mechanism can quickly copy an entire row of data from a source row to a destination row by first copying the data from the source row to the row buffer and then from the row buffer to the destination row, via two back-to-back activate commands. This mechanism, which we call the Fast Parallel Mode of RowClone, reduces the latency and energy consumption of a 4KB bulk copy operation by 11.6x and 74.4x, respectively, and a 4KB bulk zeroing operation by 6.0x and 41.5x, respectively. To efficiently copy data between rows that do not share a row buffer, we propose a second mode of RowClone, the Pipelined Serial Mode, which uses the shared internal bus of a DRAM chip to quickly copy data between two banks. RowClone requires only a 0.01% increase in DRAM chip area. We quantitatively evaluate the benefits of RowClone by focusing on fork, one of the frequently invoked system calls, and five other copy and initialization intensive applications. Our results show that RowClone can significantly improve both single-core and multi-core system performance, while also significantly reducing main memory bandwidth and energy consumption.","author":["Vivek Seshadri","Yoongu Kim","Chris Fallin","Donghyuk Lee","Rachata Ausavarungnirun","Gennady Pekhimenko","Yixin Luo","Onur Mutlu","Phillip B.

Features of UFL include support for variational forms and functionals, automatic differentiation of forms and expressions, arbitrary function space hierarchies for multifield problems, general differential operators and flexible tensor algebra. With these features, UFL has been used to effortlessly express finite element methods for complex systems of partial differential equations in near-mathematical notation, resulting in compact, intuitive and readable programs. We present in this work the language and its construction. An implementation of UFL is freely available as an open-source software library. The library generates abstract syntax tree representations of variational problems, which are used by other software libraries to generate concrete low-level implementations. Some application examples are presented and libraries that support UFL are highlighted.","author":["Martin S. Aln\u00e6s","Anders Logg","Kristian B. \u00d8lgaard","Marie E. Rognes","Garth N.

Such systems rely on partitioning to cluster or divide data into smaller pieces and thus achieve better parallelism and memory locality. This paper considers a comprehensive collection of variants of main-memory partitioning tuned for various layers of the memory hierarchy. We revisit the pitfalls of in-cache partitioning, and utilizing the crucial performance factors, we introduce new variants for partitioning out-of-cache. Besides non-in-place variants where linear extra space is used, we introduce large-scale in-place variants, and propose NUMA-aware partitioning that guarantees locality on multiple processors. Also, we make range partitioning comparably fast with hash or radix, by designing a novel cache-resident index to compute ranges. All variants are combined to build three NUMA-aware sorting algorithms: a stable LSB radix-sort; an in-place MSB radix-sort using different variants across memory layers; and a comparison-sort utilizing wide-fanout range partitioning and SIMD-optimal in-cache sorting. To the best of our knowledge, all three are the fastest to date on billion-scale inputs for both dense and sparse key domains. As shown for sorting, our work can serve as a tool for building other operations (e.g., join, aggregation) by combining the most suitable variants that best meet the design goals.","author":["Orestis Polychroniou","Kenneth A.

We propose static (SPCS) and dynamic (DPCS) variants of power/capacity scaling, a simple and low-overhead fault-tolerant cache architecture that utilizes insights gained from our 45nm SOI test chip. Our mechanism combines multi-level voltage scaling with power gating of blocks that become faulty at each voltage level. The SPCS policy sets the runtime cache VDD statically such that almost all of the cache blocks are not faulty. The DPCS policy opportunistically reduces the voltage further to save more power than SPCS while limiting the impact on performance caused by additional faulty blocks. Through an analytical evaluation, we show that our approach can achieve lower static power for all effective cache capacities than a recent complex FTVS work. This is due to significantly lower overheads, despite the failure of our approach to match the min-VDD of the competing work at fixed yield. Through architectural simulations, we find that the average energy saved by SPCS is 55%, while DPCS saves an average of 69% of energy with respect to baseline caches at 1 V. Our approach incurs no more than 4% performance and 5% area penalties in the worst case cache configuration.","author":["Mark Gottscho","Abbas BanaiyanMofrad","Nikil Dutt","Alex Nicolau","Puneet Gupta"],"issue":["DAC '14: Proceedings of the 51st Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2014","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2593069.2593184"],"date":"01 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"J.

We find that several smartphone localization systems in the recent past, including our own, make a simplifying assumption that the user's walking direction is known. In trying to relax this assumption, we were not able to find a generic solution from past work. While intuition suggests that the walking direction should be detectable through the accelerometer, in reality this direction gets blended into various other motion patterns during the act of walking, including up and down bounce, side-to-side sway, swing of arms or legs, etc. Moreover, the walking direction is in the phone's local coordinate system (e.g., along Y axis), and translation to global directions, such as 45 degree North, can be challenging when the compass is itself erroneous. WalkCompass copes with these challenges and develops a stable technique to estimate the user's walking direction within a few steps. Results drawn from 15 different environments demonstrate median error of less than 8 degrees, across 6 different users, 3 surfaces, and 3 holding positions. While there is room for improvement, we believe our current system can be immediately useful to various applications centered around localization and human activity recognition.","author":["Nirupam Roy","He Wang","Romit Roy Choudhury"],"issue":["MobiSys '14: Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile systems, applications, and services","June 2014","Pages   329\u2013342","https://doi.org/10.1145/2594368.2594392"],"date":"02 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"Complementary filter. http://web.mit.edu/scolton/www/filter.pdf.","order":1},{"text":"Unibros. http://hfid.olin.edu/sa2013/s_engr3220-unibros/inspirational.php.","order":2},{"text":"Walkcompass demo. http://synrg.csl.illinois.edu/projects/localization/walkcompass.","order":3},{"text":"Afzal, M.

In this work we study \"transient scene attributes\" -- high level properties which affect scene appearance, such as \"snow\", \"autumn\", \"dusk\", \"fog\". We define 40 transient attributes and use crowdsourcing to annotate thousands of images from 101 webcams. We use this \"transient attribute database\" to train regressors that can predict the presence of attributes in novel images. We demonstrate a photo organization method based on predicted attributes. Finally we propose a high-level image editing method which allows a user to adjust the attributes of a scene, e.g. change a scene to be \"snowy\" or \"sunset\". To support attribute manipulation we introduce a novel appearance transfer technique which is simple and fast yet competitive with the state-of-the-art. We show that we can convincingly modify many transient attributes in outdoor scenes.","author":["Pierre-Yves Laffont","Zhile Ren","Xiaofeng Tao","Chao Qian","James Hays"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 33","Issue 4","July 2014","Article No.: 149","pp   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/2601097.2601101"],"date":"27 July 2014","ref":[{"text":"An, X., and Pellacini, F. 2010.

This provides high energy efficiency, allowing long pipelines with tera-op/sec. image processing in battery-powered devices, but traditionally requires painstaking manual design in hardware. Based on this pattern, we present Darkroom, a language and compiler for image processing. The semantics of the Darkroom language allow it to compile programs directly into line-buffered pipelines, with all intermediate values in local line-buffer storage, eliminating unnecessary communication with off-chip DRAM. We formulate the problem of optimally scheduling line-buffered pipelines to minimize buffering as an integer linear program. Finally, given an optimally scheduled pipeline, Darkroom synthesizes hardware descriptions for ASIC or FPGA, or fast CPU code. We evaluate Darkroom implementations of a range of applications, including a camera pipeline, low-level feature detection algorithms, and deblurring. For many applications, we demonstrate gigapixel/sec. performance in under 0.5mm2 of ASIC silicon at 250 mW (simulated on a 45nm foundry process), real-time 1080p/60 video processing using a fraction of the resources of a modern FPGA, and tens of megapixels/sec. of throughput on a quad-core x86 processor.","author":["James Hegarty","John Brunhaver","Zachary DeVito","Jonathan Ragan-Kelley","Noy Cohen","Steven Bell","Artem Vasilyev","Mark Horowitz","Pat Hanrahan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 33","Issue 4","July 2014","Article No.: 144","pp   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/2601097.2601174"],"date":"27 July 2014","ref":[{"text":"Adams, A., Talvala, E.-V., Park, S.

While existing technologies have harvested power from ambient RF sources (e.g., TV broadcasts), they require a dedicated gateway (like an RFID reader) for Internet connectivity. We present Wi-Fi Backscatter, a novel communication system that bridges RF-powered devices with the Internet. Specifically, we show that it is possible to reuse existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to provide Internet connectivity to RF-powered devices. To show Wi-Fi Backscatter's feasibility, we build a hardware prototype and demonstrate the first communication link between an RF-powered device and commodity Wi-Fi devices. We use off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices including Intel Wi-Fi cards, Linksys Routers, and our organization's Wi-Fi infrastructure, and achieve communication rates of up to 1 kbps and ranges of up to 2.1 meters. We believe that this new capability can pave the way for the rapid deployment and adoption of RF-powered devices and achieve ubiquitous connectivity via nearby mobile devices that are Wi-Fi enabled.","author":["Bryce Kellogg","Aaron Parks","Shyamnath Gollakota","Joshua R.

In order to parallelize SGD, minibatch training needs to be employed to reduce the communication cost. However, an increase in minibatch size typically decreases the rate of convergence. This paper introduces a technique based on approximate optimization of a conservatively regularized objective function within each minibatch. We prove that the convergence rate does not decrease with increasing minibatch size. Experiments demonstrate that with suitable implementations of approximate optimization, the resulting algorithm can outperform standard SGD in many scenarios.","author":["Mu Li","Tong Zhang","Yuqiang Chen","Alexander J.

Further, many of them will have stringent size constraints. With no cord for power and limited space for a battery, powering these devices (to achieve several months to possibly years of unattended operation) becomes a daunting challenge. This paper highlights some promising directions for addressing this challenge, focusing on three main building blocks: (a) the design of ultra-low power hardware platforms that integrate computing, sensing, storage, and wireless connectivity in a tiny form factor, (b) the development of intelligent system-level power management techniques, and (c) the use of environmental energy harvesting to make IoT devices self-powered, thus decreasing -- in some cases, even eliminating -- their dependence on batteries. We discuss these building blocks in detail and illustrate case-studies of systems that use them judiciously, including the QUBE wireless embedded platform, which exploits the characteristics of emerging non-volatile memory technologies to seamlessly and efficiently enable long-running computations in systems that experience frequent power loss (i.e., intermittently powered systems).","author":["Hrishikesh Jayakumar","Kangwoo Lee","Woo Suk Lee","Arnab Raha","Younghyun Kim","Vijay Raghunathan"],"issue":["ISLPED '14: Proceedings of the 2014 international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2014","Pages   375\u2013380","https://doi.org/10.1145/2627369.2631644"],"date":"11 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"Belkin Wemo. http://www.belkin.com/us/Products/home-automation/c/wemo-home-automation/.","order":1},{"text":"CubeSensors. https://cubesensors.com/.","order":2},{"text":"Driblet. http://driblet.co/.","order":3},{"text":"Fitbit. http://www.fitbit.com/.","order":4},{"text":"Flood Beacon. http://floodbeacon.com.","order":5},{"text":"Pavegen. http://www.pavegen.com/.","order":6},{"text":"Pebble. https://getpebble.com/.","order":7},{"text":"Quirky Wink. https://www.quirky.com/ge.","order":8},{"text":"Revolv Home Automation hub. http://revolv.com/.","order":9},{"text":"Self-Powered Ad-Hoc Network. http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/span.html.","order":10},{"text":"Spheramid Gateway for Ninjasphere. http://ninjablocks.com/.","order":11},{"text":"Wally. https://www.wallyhome.com/.","order":12},{"text":"Wireless Sensor Tags. https://www.mytaglist.com/.","order":13},{"text":"B.

Prior works have proposed to use this as a DRAM cache. Because of its large size (a DRAM cache can be in the order of hundreds of megabytes), the total size of the tags associated with it can also be quite large (in the order of tens of megabytes). The large size of the tags has created a problem. Should we maintain the tags in the DRAM and pay the cost of a costly tag access in the critical path? Or should we maintain the tags in the faster SRAM by paying the area cost of a large SRAM for this purpose? Prior works have primarily chosen the former and proposed a variety of techniques for reducing the cost of a DRAM tag access. In this paper, we first establish (with the help of a study) that maintaining the tags in SRAM, because of its smaller access latency, leads to overall better performance. Motivated by this study, we ask if it is possible to maintain tags in SRAM without incurring high area overhead. Our key idea is simple. We propose to cache the tags in a small SRAM tag cache - we show that there is enough spatial and temporal locality amongst tag accesses to merit this idea. We propose the ATCache which is a small SRAM tag cache. Similar to a conventional cache, the ATCache caches recently accessed tags to exploit temporal locality; it exploits spatial locality by prefetching tags from nearby cache sets. In order to avoid the high miss latency and cache pollution caused by excessive prefetching, we use a simple technique to throttle the number of sets prefetched. Our proposed ATCache (which consumes 0.4% of overall tag size) can satisfy over 60% of DRAM cache tag accesses on average.","author":["Cheng-Chieh Huang","Vijay Nagarajan"],"issue":["PACT '14: Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on Parallel architectures and compilation","August 2014","Pages   51\u201360","https://doi.org/10.1145/2628071.2628089"],"date":"24 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"N.

It involves a multiparametric design space exploration for optimization, followed by design verification. Designers of special purpose VLSI implementations often need to explore parameters, such as optimal bitwidth and data representation, through time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. A prominent example of this simulation-based exploration process is the design of decoders for error correcting systems, such as the Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes adopted by modern communication standards, which involves thousands of Monte Carlo runs for each design point. Currently, high-performance computing offers a wide set of acceleration options that range from multicore CPUs to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The exploitation of diverse target architectures is typically associated with developing multiple code versions, often using distinct programming paradigms. In this context, we evaluate the concept of retargeting a single OpenCL program to multiple platforms, thereby significantly reducing design time. A single OpenCL-based parallel kernel is used without modifications or code tuning on multicore CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. We use SOpenCL (Silicon to OpenCL), a tool that automatically converts OpenCL kernels to RTL in order to introduce FPGAs as a potential platform to efficiently execute simulations coded in OpenCL. We use LDPC decoding simulations as a case study. Experimental results were obtained by testing a variety of regular and irregular LDPC codes that range from short/medium (e.g., 8,000 bit) to long length (e.g., 64,800 bit) DVB-S2 codes. We observe that, depending on the design parameters to be simulated, on the dimension and phase of the design, the GPU or FPGA may suit different purposes more conveniently, thus providing different acceleration factors over conventional multicore CPUs.","author":["Muhsen Owaida","Gabriel Falcao","Joao Andrade","Christos Antonopoulos","Nikolaos Bellas","Madhura Purnaprajna","David Novo","Georgios Karakonstantis","Andreas Burg","Paolo Ienne"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 14","Issue 2","March 2015","Article No.: 33","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/2656207"],"date":"17 February 2015","ref":[{"text":"A.

As the integration of multiple inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) to nowadays smartphones in recent years, human-centric mobility sensing is emerging and coming into vogue. Mobility information, as a new dimension in addition to wireless signals, can benefit localization in a number of ways, since location and mobility are by nature related in the physical world. In this article, we survey this new trend of mobility enhancing smartphone-based indoor localization. Specifically, we first study how to measure human mobility: what types of sensors we can use and what types of mobility information we can acquire. Next, we discuss how mobility assists localization with respect to enhancing location accuracy, decreasing deployment cost, and enriching location context. Moreover, considering the quality and cost of smartphone built-in sensors, handling measurement errors is essential and accordingly investigated. Combining existing work and our own working experiences, we emphasize the principles and conduct comparative study of the mainstream technologies. Finally, we conclude this survey by addressing future research directions and opportunities in this new and largely open area.","author":["Zheng Yang","Chenshu Wu","Zimu Zhou","Xinglin Zhang","Xu Wang","Yunhao Liu"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 47","Issue 3","April 2015","Article No.: 54","pp   1\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/2676430"],"date":"01 April 2015","ref":[{"text":"Gregory D.

This is particularly useful to induce prerequisite relations among courses from different providers (universities, MOOCs, etc.). We propose a new framework for inference within and across two graphs---at the course level and at the induced concept level---which we call Concept Graph Learning (CGL). In the training phase, our system projects the course-level links onto the concept space to induce directed concept links; in the testing phase, the concept links are used to predict (unobserved) prerequisite links for test-set courses within the same institution or across institutions. The dual mappings enable our system to perform an interlingua-style transfer learning, e.g. treating the concept graph as the interlingua, and inducing prerequisite links in a transferable manner across different universities. Experiments on our newly collected data sets of courses from MIT, Caltech, Princeton and CMU show promising results, including the viability of CGL for transfer learning.","author":["Yiming Yang","Hanxiao Liu","Jaime Carbonell","Wanli Ma"],"issue":["WSDM '15: Proceedings of the Eighth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2015","Pages   159\u2013168","https://doi.org/10.1145/2684822.2685292"],"date":"02 February 2015","ref":[{"text":"R.

However, Bitcoin's promise of anonymity is broken as recent work shows how Bitcoin's blockchain exposes users to reidentification and linking attacks. In consequence, different mixing services have emerged which promise to randomly mix a user's Bitcoins with other users' coins to provide anonymity based on the unlinkability of the mixing. However, proposed approaches suffer either from weak security guarantees and single points of failure, or small anonymity sets and missing deniability. In this paper, we propose CoinParty a novel, decentralized mixing service for Bitcoin based on a combination of decryption mixnets with threshold signatures. CoinParty is secure against malicious adversaries and the evaluation of our prototype shows that it scales easily to a large number of participants in real-world network settings. By the application of threshold signatures to Bitcoin mixing, CoinParty achieves anonymity by orders of magnitude higher than related work as we quantify by analyzing transactions in the actual Bitcoin blockchain and is first among related approaches to provide plausible deniability.","author":["Jan Henrik Ziegeldorf","Fred Grossmann","Martin Henze","Nicolas Inden","Klaus Wehrle"],"issue":["CODASPY '15: Proceedings of the 5th ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy","March 2015","Pages   75\u201386","https://doi.org/10.1145/2699026.2699100"],"date":"02 March 2015","ref":[{"text":"G.

In-memory objects can themselves be persistent without the need for a separate persistent data storage format. However, the challenge is to ensure that such data remains consistent if a failure occurs during execution.In this paper, we present our system, called Atlas, which adds durability semantics to lock-based code, typically allowing us to automatically maintain a globally consistent state even in the presence of failures. We identify failure-atomic sections of code based on existing critical sections and describe a log-based implementation that can be used to recover a consistent state after a failure. We discuss several subtle semantic issues and implementation tradeoffs. We confirm the ability to rapidly flush CPU caches as a core implementation bottleneck and suggest partial solutions. Experimental results confirm the practicality of our approach and provide insight into the overheads of such a system.","author":["Dhruva R. Chakrabarti","Hans-J.

Many companies are racing to develop toolkits that closely integrate statistical and machine learning techniques with data management systems. Almost all such toolkits assume that the input to a learning algorithm is a single table. However, most relational datasets are not stored as single tables due to normalization. Thus, analysts often perform key-foreign key joins before learning on the join output. This strategy of learning after joins introduces redundancy avoided by normalization, which could lead to poorer end-to-end performance and maintenance overheads due to data duplication. In this work, we take a step towards enabling and optimizing learning over joins for a common class of machine learning techniques called generalized linear models that are solved using gradient descent algorithms in an RDBMS setting. We present alternative approaches to learn over a join that are easy to implement over existing RDBMSs. We introduce a new approach named factorized learning that pushes ML computations through joins and avoids redundancy in both I/O and computations. We study the tradeoff space for all our approaches both analytically and empirically. Our results show that factorized learning is often substantially faster than the alternatives, but is not always the fastest, necessitating a cost-based approach. We also discuss extensions of all our approaches to multi-table joins as well as to Hive.","author":["Arun Kumar","Jeffrey Naughton","Jignesh M.

As an important service in most web applications, accurate real-time recommendation in the context of big data is of high demand. Traditional recommender systems that analyze data and update models at regular time intervals cannot satisfy the requirements of modern web applications, calling for real-time recommender systems. In this paper, we tackle the ``big\", ``real-time\" and ``accurate\" challenges in real-time recommendation, and propose a general real-time stream recommender system built on Storm named TencentRec from three aspects, i.e., ``system\", ``algorithm\", and ``data\". We analyze the large amount of data streams from a wide range of applications leveraging the considerable computation ability of Storm, together with a data access component and a data storage component developed by us. To deal with various application specific demands, we have implemented several classic practical recommendation algorithms in TencentRec, including the item-based collaborative filtering, the content based, and the demographic based algorithms. Specially, we present a practical scalable item-based CF algorithm in detail, with the super characteristics such as robust to the implicit feedback problem, incremental update and real-time pruning. With the enhancement of real-time data collection and processing, we can capture the recommendation changes in real-time. We deploy the TencentRec in a series of production applications, and observe the superiority of TencentRec in providing accurate real-time recommendations for 10 billion user requests everyday.","author":["Yanxiang Huang","Bin Cui","Wenyu Zhang","Jie Jiang","Ying Xu"],"issue":["SIGMOD '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","May 2015","Pages   227\u2013238","https://doi.org/10.1145/2723372.2742785"],"date":"27 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"G.

However, most systems implement only snapshot isolation (SI) instead of full serializability. Adding serializability guarantees to existing SI implementations tends to be prohibitively expensive. We present a novel MVCC implementation for main-memory database systems that has very little overhead compared to serial execution with single-version concurrency control, even when maintaining serializability guarantees. Updating data in-place and storing versions as before-image deltas in undo buffers not only allows us to retain the high scan performance of single-version systems but also forms the basis of our cheap and fine-grained serializability validation mechanism. The novel idea is based on an adaptation of precision locking and verifies that the (extensional) writes of recently committed transactions do not intersect with the (intensional) read predicate space of a committing transaction. We experimentally show that our MVCC model allows very fast processing of transactions with point accesses as well as read-heavy transactions and that there is little need to prefer SI over full serializability any longer.","author":["Thomas Neumann","Tobias M\u00fchlbauer","Alfons Kemper"],"issue":["SIGMOD '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","May 2015","Pages   677\u2013689","https://doi.org/10.1145/2723372.2749436"],"date":"27 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, most existing methods depend on dictionaries (e.g., WordNet), which confines their applicability. For instance, the dictionary based methods are unable to find domain dependent opinion words, because the entries in a dictionary are usually domain-independent. There also exist corpus-based methods that directly extract opinion lexicons from reviews. However, they heavily rely on sentiment seed words that have limited sentiment information and the context information has not been fully considered. To overcome these problems, this paper presents a word vector and matrix factorization based method for automatically extracting opinion lexicons from reviews of different domains and further identifying the sentiment polarities of the words. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.","author":["Zheng Lin","Weiping Wang","Xiaolong Jin","Jiguang Liang","Dan Meng"],"issue":["WWW '15 Companion: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web","May 2015","Pages   67\u201368","https://doi.org/10.1145/2740908.2742713"],"date":"18 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"D.

To store the contexts of thousands of concurrent threads on a GPU, a large static random-access memory (SRAM)-based register file is employed. Due to high leakage power of SRAM, the register file consumes 20% to 40% of the total GPU power consumption. Thus, hybrid memory system, which combines SRAM and the emerging non-volatile memory (NVM), has been employed for register file design on GPUs. Although it has shown strong potential to alleviate the power issue of GPUs, existing hybrid memory solutions might not exploit the intrinsic feature of GPU register file. By leveraging the warp schedule on GPU, this paper proposes a hybrid register architecture which consists of a NVM-based register file and mixed SRAM-based write buffers with a warp-aware write back strategy. Simulation results show that our design can eliminate 64% of write accesses to NVM and reduce power of register file by 66% on average, with only 4.2% performance degradation. After we apply the power gating technique, the register power is further reduced to 25% of SRAM counterpart on average.","author":["Gushu Li","Xiaoming Chen","Guangyu Sun","Henry Hoffmann","Yongpan Liu","Yu Wang","Huazhong Yang"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 103","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744785"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"Volodymyr V Kindratenko et al.

However, the energy consumed by read and write operations presents a major challenge to their use as energy-efficient on-chip memory. Leveraging the ability of many applications to tolerate impreciseness in their underlying computations and data, we explore approximate storage as a new approach to improving the energy-efficiency of spintronic memories. We identify and characterize mechanisms in STT-MRAM bit-cells that provide favorable energy-quality trade-offs, i.e., disproportionate energy improvements at the cost of small probabilities of read/write failures. Based on these mechanisms, we design a quality-configurable memory array in which data can be stored to varying levels of accuracy based on application requirements. We integrate the quality-configurable array as a scratchpad in the memory hierarchy of a programmable vector processor and expose it to software by introducing quality-aware load/store instructions within the ISA. We evaluate the energy benefits of our proposal using a device-to-architecture modeling framework and demonstrate 40% and 19.5% improvement in memory energy and overall application energy respectively, for negligible (< 0.5%) quality loss across a suite of recognition and vision applications.","author":["Ashish Ranjan","Swagath Venkataramani","Xuanyao Fong","Kaushik Roy","Anand Raghunathan"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 195","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744799"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"Y.

Circuit level techniques are proposed in this paper as a countermeasure against side-channel attacks. A distributed on-chip power delivery system consisting of multi-level switched capacitor (SC) voltage converters is proposed where the individual interleaved stages are turned on and turned off either based on the workload information or pseudo-randomly to scramble the power consumption profile. In the case that the changes in the workload demand do not trigger the power delivery system to turn on or off individual stages, the active stages are reshuffled with so called converter-reshuffling to insert random spikes in the power consumption profile. An entropy based metric is developed to evaluate the security-performance of the proposed converter-reshuffling technique as compared to three other existing on-chip power delivery schemes. The increase in the power trace entropy with CoRe scheme is also demonstrated with simulation results to further verify the theoretical analysis.","author":["Weize Yu","Orhun Aras Uzun","Sel\u00e7uk K\u00f6se"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 115","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744866"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"M.

The approximated output of such applications, even though not 100% numerically correct, is often either useful or the difference is unnoticeable to the end user. This opens up a new design dimension to trade off application performance and energy consumption with output correctness. However, a largely unaddressed challenge is quality control: how to ensure the user experience meets a prescribed level of quality. Current approaches either do not monitor output quality or use sampling approaches to check a small subset of the output assuming that it is representative. While these approaches have been shown to produce average errors that are acceptable, they often miss large errors without any means to take corrective actions. To overcome this challenge, we propose Rumba for online detection and correction of large approximation errors in an approximate accelerator-based computing environment. Rumba employs continuous lightweight checks in the accelerator to detect large approximation errors and then fixes these errors by exact re-computation on the host processor. Rumba employs computationally inexpensive output error prediction models for efficient detection. Computing patterns amenable for approximation (e.g., map and stencil) are usually data parallel in nature and Rumba exploits this property for selective correction. Overall, Rumba is able to achieve 2.1x reduction in output error for an unchecked approximation accelerator while maintaining the accelerator performance gains at the cost of reducing the energy savings from 3.2x to 2.2x for a set of applications from different approximate computing domains.","author":["Daya S.

However, it is still challenging to integrate the PIM architectures with existing systems in a seamless manner due to two common characteristics: unconventional programming models for in-memory computation units and lack of ability to utilize large on-chip caches. In this paper, we propose a new PIM architecture that (1) does not change the existing sequential programming models and (2) automatically decides whether to execute PIM operations in memory or processors depending on the locality of data. The key idea is to implement simple in-memory computation using compute-capable memory commands and use specialized instructions, which we call PIM-enabled instructions, to invoke in-memory computation. This allows PIM operations to be interoperable with existing programming models, cache coherence protocols, and virtual memory mechanisms with no modification. In addition, we introduce a simple hardware structure that monitors the locality of data accessed by a PIM-enabled instruction at runtime to adaptively execute the instruction at the host processor (instead of in memory) when the instruction can benefit from large on-chip caches. Consequently, our architecture provides the illusion that PIM operations are executed as if they were host processor instructions. We provide a case study of how ten emerging data-intensive workloads can benefit from our new PIM abstraction and its hardware implementation. Evaluations show that our architecture significantly improves system performance and, more importantly, combines the best parts of conventional and PIM architectures by adapting to data locality of applications.","author":["Junwhan Ahn","Sungjoo Yoo","Onur Mutlu","Kiyoung Choi"],"issue":["ISCA '15: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2015","Pages   336\u2013348","https://doi.org/10.1145/2749469.2750385"],"date":"13 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"J.

Unfortunately, different bottlenecks during execution and heterogeneous application requirements create imbalances in utilization of resources in the cores. For example, when a GPU is bottlenecked by the available off-chip memory bandwidth, its computational resources are often overwhelmingly idle, waiting for data from memory to arrive. This paper introduces the Core-Assisted Bottleneck Acceleration (CABA) framework that employs idle on-chip resources to alleviate different bottlenecks in GPU execution. CABA provides flexible mechanisms to automatically generate \"assist warps\" that execute on GPU cores to perform specific tasks that can improve GPU performance and efficiency. CABA enables the use of idle computational units and pipelines to alleviate the memory bandwidth bottleneck, e.g., by using assist warps to perform data compression to transfer less data from memory. Conversely, the same framework can be employed to handle cases where the GPU is bottlenecked by the available computational units, in which case the memory pipelines are idle and can be used by CABA to speed up computation, e.g., by performing memoization using assist warps. We provide a comprehensive design and evaluation of CABA to perform effective and flexible data compression in the GPU memory hierarchy to alleviate the memory bandwidth bottleneck. Our extensive evaluations show that CABA, when used to implement data compression, provides an average performance improvement of 41.7% (as high as 2.6X) across a variety of memory-bandwidth-sensitive GPGPU applications.","author":["Nandita Vijaykumar","Gennady Pekhimenko","Adwait Jog","Abhishek Bhowmick","Rachata Ausavarungnirun","Chita Das","Mahmut Kandemir","Todd C.

Wavefront parallelism is a well-known technique to enable concurrent processing of such applications and is widely being used on GPUs to benefit from their massively parallel computing capabilities. Wavefront parallelism on GPUs uses global barriers between processing of tiles to enforce data dependencies. However, such diagonal-wide synchronization causes load imbalance by forcing SMs to wait for the completion of the SM with longest computation. Moreover, diagonal processing causes loss of locality due to elements that border adjacent tiles. In this paper, we propose PeerWave, an alternative GPU wavefront parallelization technique that improves inter-SM load balance by using peer-wise synchronization between SMs. and eliminating global synchronization. Our approach also increases GPU L2 cache locality through row allocation of tiles to the SMs. We further improve PeerWave performance by using flexible hyper-tiles that reduce inter-SM wait time while maximizing intra-SM utilization. We develop an analytical model for determining the optimal tile size. Finally, we present a run-time and a CUDA based API to allow users to easily implement their applications using PeerWave. We evaluate PeerWave on the NVIDIA K40c GPU using 6 different applications and achieve speedups of up to 2X compared to the most recent hyperplane transformation based GPU implementation.","author":["Mehmet E.

Advertisers are interested in making use of this vast business potential, as very clear intent signal communicated through the issued query allows effective targeting of users. This idea is embodied in a sponsored search model, where each advertiser maintains a list of keywords they deem indicative of increased user response rate with regards to their business. According to this targeting model, when a query is issued all advertisers with a matching keyword are entered into an auction according to the amount they bid for the query, and the winner gets to show their ad. One of the main challenges is the fact that a query may not match many keywords, resulting in lower auction value, lower ad quality, and lost revenue for advertisers and publishers. Possible solution is to expand a query into a set of related queries and use them to increase the number of matched ads, called query rewriting. To this end, we propose rewriting method based on a novel query embedding algorithm, which jointly models query content as well as its context within a search session. As a result, queries with similar content and context are mapped into vectors close in the embedding space, which allows expansion of a query via simple K-nearest neighbor search in the projected space. The method was trained on more than 12 billion sessions, one of the largest corpuses reported thus far, and evaluated on both public TREC data set and in-house sponsored search data set. The results show the proposed approach significantly outperformed existing state-of-the-art, strongly indicating its benefits and the monetization potential.","author":["Mihajlo Grbovic","Nemanja Djuric","Vladan Radosavljevic","Fabrizio Silvestri","Narayan Bhamidipati"],"issue":["SIGIR '15: Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2015","Pages   383\u2013392","https://doi.org/10.1145/2766462.2767709"],"date":"09 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"M.

However, DRAM-based memory is an important consumer of energy and is unlikely to scale in the future. Various byte-addressable non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies promise high density and near-zero static energy, however they suffer from increased latency and increased dynamic energy consumption. This paper proposes to leverage a hybrid memory architecture, consisting of both DRAM and NVM, by novel, application-level data management policies that decide to place data on DRAM vs. NVM. We analyze modern column-oriented and key-value data stores and demonstrate the feasibility of application-level data management. Cycle-accurate simulation confirms that our methodology reduces the energy with least performance degradation as compared to the current state-of-the-art hardware or OS approaches. Moreover, we utilize our techniques to apportion DRAM and NVM memory sizes for these workloads.","author":["Ahmad Hassan","Hans Vandierendonck","Dimitrios S.

Under the assumption that accessing the ith element from the front of the list takes \u03b8(i) time, we show that move-to-front is within a constant factor of optimum among a wide class of list maintenance rules. Other natural heuristics, such as the transpose and frequency count rules, do not share this property. We generalize our results to show that move-to-front is within a constant factor of optimum as long as the access cost is a convex function. We also study paging, a setting in which the access cost is not convex. The paging rule corresponding to move-to-front is the \u201cleast recently used\u201d (LRU) replacement rule. We analyze the amortized complexity of LRU, showing that its efficiency differs from that of the off-line paging rule (Belady's MIN algorithm) by a factor that depends on the size of fast memory. No on-line paging algorithm has better amortized performance.","author":["Daniel D. Sleator","Robert E.

For example, to answer \"who is the ceo of apple\" on Freebase requires a match to an abstract \"leadership\" entity with three relations \"role\", \"organization\" and \"person\", and two other entities \"apple inc\" and \"managing director\". Recent years have seen a surge of research activity on learning-based solutions for this method. We further advance the state of the art by adopting learning-to-rank methodology and by fully addressing the inherent entity recognition problem, which was neglected in recent works. We evaluate our system, called Aqqu, on two standard benchmarks, Free917 and WebQuestions, improving the previous best result for each benchmark considerably. These two benchmarks exhibit quite different challenges, and many of the existing approaches were evaluated (and work well) only for one of them. We also consider efficiency aspects and take care that all questions can be answered interactively (that is, within a second).

Billion-node graphs that exceed the memory capacity of commodity machines are not well supported by popular Big Data tools like MapReduce, which are notoriously poor performing for iterative graph algorithms such as PageRank. In response, a new type of framework challenges one to \u201cthink like a vertex\u201d (TLAV) and implements user-defined programs from the perspective of a vertex rather than a graph. Such an approach improves locality, demonstrates linear scalability, and provides a natural way to express and compute many iterative graph algorithms. These frameworks are simple to program and widely applicable but, like an operating system, are composed of several intricate, interdependent components, of which a thorough understanding is necessary in order to elicit top performance at scale. To this end, the first comprehensive survey of TLAV frameworks is presented. In this survey, the vertex-centric approach to graph processing is overviewed, TLAV frameworks are deconstructed into four main components and respectively analyzed, and TLAV implementations are reviewed and categorized.","author":["Robert Ryan McCune","Tim Weninger","Greg Madey"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 48","Issue 2","November 2015","Article No.: 25","pp   1\u201339","https://doi.org/10.1145/2818185"],"date":"12 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"Amine Abou-Rjeili and George Karypis. 2006.

With the advances in 3D-stacking technologies, recently PIM architectures have regained researchers' attentions. Several fully-programmable PIM architectures as well as programming models were proposed in previous literature. Meanwhile, memory industry also starts to integrate computation units into Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC). In HMC 2.0 specification, a number of atomic instructions are supported. Although the instruction support is limited, it enables us to offload computations at instruction granularity. In this paper, we present a preliminary study of instruction offloading on HMC 2.0 using graph traversals as an example. By demonstrating the programmability and performance benefits, we show the feasibility of an instruction-level offloading PIM architecture.","author":["Lifeng Nai","Hyesoon Kim"],"issue":["MEMSYS '15: Proceedings of the 2015 International Symposium on Memory Systems","October 2015","Pages   258\u2013261","https://doi.org/10.1145/2818950.2818982"],"date":"05 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"J.

We assume that processing cores and memories are safe and anomaly is included through a communication medium (i.e., router). The article targets three different attacks, namely, traffic diversion, route looping, and core address spoofing attacks. The attacks are detected by using machine-learning techniques. Comprehensive analysis on machine-learning algorithms suggests that Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) have better attack detection efficiency. It has been observed that both algorithms have accuracy in the range of 94% to 97%. Additional hardware complexity analysis advocates SVM to be implemented on hardware. To test the framework, we implement a condition-based attack insertion module; attacks are performed intra- and intercluster. The proposed real-time anomaly detection framework is fully placed and routed on Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. Postplace and -route implementation results show that SVM has 12% to 2% area overhead and 3% to 1% power overhead for the quad-core and 16-core implementation, respectively. It is also observed that it takes 25% to 18% of the total execution time to detect an anomaly in transferred packets for quad-core and 16-core, respectively. The proposed framework achieves 65% reduction in area overhead and is 3 times faster compared to previous published work.","author":["Amey Kulkarni","Youngok Pino","Matthew French","Tinoosh Mohsenin"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 13","Issue 1","December 2016","Article No.: 10","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/2827699"],"date":"16 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"M.

In this work, we develop a machine learning based method to detect hate speech on online user comments from two domains which outperforms a state-of-the-art deep learning approach. We also develop a corpus of user comments annotated for abusive language, the first of its kind. Finally, we use our detection tool to analyze abusive language over time and in different settings to further enhance our knowledge of this behavior.","author":["Chikashi Nobata","Joel Tetreault","Achint Thomas","Yashar Mehdad","Yi Chang"],"issue":["WWW '16: Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web","April 2016","Pages   145\u2013153","https://doi.org/10.1145/2872427.2883062"],"date":"11 April 2016","ref":[{"text":"S.

Many modern transaction processing systems adopt a lightweight optimistic concurrency control (OCC) scheme to leverage its low overhead in low contention workloads. However, we observe that the lightweight OCC is not suitable for heterogeneous workloads, causing significant starvation of read-mostly transactions and overall performance degradation. In this paper, we present ERMIA, a memory-optimized database system built from scratch to cater the need of handling heterogeneous workloads. ERMIA adopts snapshot isolation concurrency control to coordinate heterogeneous transactions and provides serializability when desired. Its physical layer supports the concurrency control schemes in a scalable way. Experimental results show that ERMIA delivers comparable or superior performance and near-linear scalability in a variety of workloads, compared to a recent lightweight OCC-based system. At the same time, ERMIA maintains high throughput on read-mostly transactions when the performance of the OCC-based system drops by orders of magnitude.","author":["Kangnyeon Kim","Tianzheng Wang","Ryan Johnson","Ippokratis Pandis"],"issue":["SIGMOD '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data","June 2016","Pages   1675\u20131687","https://doi.org/10.1145/2882903.2882905"],"date":"26 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"R.

Programmers often use search engines such as Google and Bing to learn about existing APIs. In this paper, we describe SWIM, a tool which suggests code snippets given API-related natural language queries such as \"generate md5 hash code\". The query does not need to contain framework-specific trivia such as the type names or methods of interest. We translate user queries into the APIs of interest using clickthrough data from the Bing search engine. Then, based on patterns learned from open-source code repositories, we synthesize idiomatic code describing the use of these APIs. We introduce structured call sequences to capture API-usage patterns. Structured call sequences are a generalized form of method call sequences, with if-branches and while-loops to represent conditional and repeated API usage patterns, and are simple to extract and amenable to synthesis. We evaluated swim with 30 common C# API-related queries received by Bing. For 70% of the queries, the first suggested snippet was a relevant solution, and a relevant solution was present in the top 10 results for all benchmarked queries. The online portion of the workflow is also very responsive, at an average of 1.5 seconds per snippet.","author":["Mukund Raghothaman","Yi Wei","Youssef Hamadi"],"issue":["ICSE '16: Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Software Engineering","May 2016","Pages   357\u2013367","https://doi.org/10.1145/2884781.2884808"],"date":"14 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"Apache Lucene. https://lucene.apache.org, 2015.

In fact, the algorithms construct the set of all isomorphisms between two such graphs, presenting, in particular, generators for the group of all automorphisms of a trivalent graph. The algorithms are based upon the original polynomial-time solution to these problems by Luks but they introduce numerous speedups. These include improved permutation-group algorithms that exploit the structure of the underlying 2-groups. A remarkable property of the Las Vegas algorithm is that it computes the set of all isomorphisms between two trivalent graphs for the cost of computing only those isomorphisms that map a specified edge to a specified edge.","author":["Zvi Galil","Christoph M.

Often, the problem of computing top-N recommendations is mainly tackled with a two-step approach. The system focuses first on predicting the unknown ratings, which are eventually used to generate a ranked recommendation list. Actually, the top-N recommendation task can be directly seen as a ranking problem where the main goal is not to accurately predict ratings but to directly find the best-ranked list of items to recommend. In this article we present SPrank, a novel hybrid recommendation algorithm able to compute top-N recommendations exploiting freely available knowledge in the Web of Data. In particular, we employ DBpedia, a well-known encyclopedic knowledge base in the Linked Open Data cloud, to extract semantic path-based features and to eventually compute top-N recommendations in a learning-to-rank fashion. Experiments with three datasets related to different domains (books, music, and movies) prove the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms.","author":["Tommaso Di Noia","Vito Claudio Ostuni","Paolo Tomeo","Eugenio Di Sciascio"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology","Volume 8","Issue 1","October 2016","Article No.: 9","pp   1\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/2899005"],"date":"20 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"Sarabjot Singh Anand, Patricia Kearney, and Mary Shapcott. 2007.

We build a new software transactional memory (STM) around this observation. A conventional STM tracks read- and write-sets of memory words; even simple operations can generate large sets. Our STM, which we call STO, tracks abstract operations on transactional datatypes instead. Parts of the transactional commit protocol are delegated to these datatypes' implementations, which can use datatype semantics, and new commit protocol features, to reduce bookkeeping, limit false conflicts, and implement efficient concurrency control. We test these ideas on the STAMP benchmark suite for STM applications and on our own prior work, the Silo high-performance in-memory database, observing large performance improvements in both systems.","author":["Nathaniel Herman","Jeevana Priya Inala","Yihe Huang","Lillian Tsai","Eddie Kohler","Barbara Liskov","Liuba Shrira"],"issue":["EuroSys '16: Proceedings of the Eleventh European Conference on Computer Systems","April 2016","Article No.: 31","Pages   1\u201316","https://doi.org/10.1145/2901318.2901348"],"date":"18 April 2016","ref":[{"text":"B.

In general, because of their inherent multiplication-intensive characteristics, the hardware implementations of DFT/FFT usually require a large amount of hardware resource, which limits their applications in area-constraint scenarios. To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes area-efficient error-resilient DFT designs using stochastic computing. By leveraging low-complexity stochastic multipliers, two types of stochastic DFT design are presented with significant reduction in overall area. Analysis results show that compared with the conventional design, the proposed two 256-point stochastic DFT designs achieve 76% and 62% reduction in area, respectively. More importantly, these stochastic DFT designs also show much stronger error-resilience, which is very attractive in nanoscale CMOS era.","author":["Bo Yuan","Yanzhi Wang","Zhongfeng Wang"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '16: Proceedings of the 26th edition on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2016","Pages   33\u201338","https://doi.org/10.1145/2902961.2902978"],"date":"18 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"K.

Current flash translation layers can be classified into a page-mapping FTL, a block-mapping FTL, and a hybrid-mapping FTL. In order to utilize the advantages of the page-mapping FTL and the block-mapping FTL, the hybrid-mapping FTL is proposed to store data to the appropriate mapping mechanism by switching the mapping information between the page-mapping mechanism and the block-mapping mechanism. In the article, we propose a joint operation mechanism to rethink the advantages of the page-mapping FTL, the block-mapping FTL, and the hybrid-mapping FTL. With the joint operation mechanism, a flash translation layer can consider the main memory requirements, improve the system performance, and reduce the garbage collection overhead. The experimental results show that the proposed joint operation mechanism can achieve the goal under realistic workloads and benchmarks.","author":["Chin-Hsien Wu","Syuan-An Chen"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 15","Issue 4","August 2016","Article No.: 74","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/2915916"],"date":"02 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"Ken Bates and Bruce McNutt. 2007.

This problem captures several engineering tradeoffs in the design of routing topologies with controlled skew. Our bounded-skew routing algorithm, called the BST/DME algorithm, extends the DME algorithm for exact zero-skew trees via the concept of a merging region. For a prescribed topology, BST/DME constructs a bounded-skew tree (BST) in two phases: (i) a bottom-up phase to construct a binary tree of merging regions which represent the loci of possible embedding points of the internal nodes, and (ii) a top-down phase to determine the exact locations of the internal nodes. We present two approaches to construct the  merging regions: (i) the Boundary Merging and Embedding (BME) method which utilizes merging points that are restricted to the boundaries of merging regions, and (ii) the Interior Merging and Embedding (IME) algorithm which employs a sampling strategy and a dynamic programming-based selection technique to consider merging points that are interior to, as well as on the boundary of, the merging regions. When the topology is not prescribed, we propose a new Greedy-BST/DME algorithm which combines the merging region computation with topology generation. The Greedy-BST/DME algorithm very closely matches the best known heuristics for the zero-skew case and for the unbounded-skew case (i.e., the Steiner minimal  tree problem). Experimental results show that our BST algorithms can produce a set of routing solutions with smooth skew and wire length tradeoffs.","author":["Jason Cong","Andrew B. Kahng","Cheng-Kok Koh","C.-W.

Almost all the existing network embedding methods adopt shallow models. However, since the underlying network structure is complex, shallow models cannot capture the highly non-linear network structure, resulting in sub-optimal network representations. Therefore, how to find a method that is able to effectively capture the highly non-linear network structure and preserve the global and local structure is an open yet important problem. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a Structural Deep Network Embedding method, namely SDNE. More specifically, we first propose a semi-supervised deep model, which has multiple layers of non-linear functions, thereby being able to capture the highly non-linear network structure. Then we propose to exploit the first-order and second-order proximity jointly to preserve the network structure. The second-order proximity is used by the unsupervised component to capture the global network structure. While the first-order proximity is used as the supervised information in the supervised component to preserve the local network structure. By jointly optimizing them in the semi-supervised deep model, our method can preserve both the local and global network structure and is robust to sparse networks. Empirically, we conduct the experiments on five real-world networks, including a language network, a citation network and three social networks. The results show that compared to the baselines, our method can reconstruct the original network significantly better and achieves substantial gains in three applications, i.e. multi-label classification, link prediction and visualization.","author":["Daixin Wang","Peng Cui","Wenwu Zhu"],"issue":["KDD '16: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2016","Pages   1225\u20131234","https://doi.org/10.1145/2939672.2939753"],"date":"13 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"M.

ISPD place & route contests, DAC placement contests, timing analysis contests at TAU and CAD contests at ICCAD are good examples in the past and more of new contests are planned in the upcoming conferences. These are interesting and important events that stimulate the research of the target problems and advance the cutting edge technologies. Nevertheless, most contests focus only on the point tool problems instead of addressing the design flow or co-optimization among design tools. OpenDesign Flow Database platform is developed to direct attentions to the overall design flow from logic synthesis to physical design optimization [1]. The goals are to provide an academic reference design flow based on past CAD contest results, the database for design benchmarks and point tool libraries, and standard design input/output formats to build a customized design flow by composing point tool libraries.","author":["Jinwook Jung","Iris Hui-Ru Jiang","Gi-Joon Nam","Victor N.

It is a challenging research since the amount of sequence data being generated is increasing exponentially. In this study we attempt to do feature selection in promoter sequences using entropy values which reduces the dimension of the position specific motif matrices (PSMMs) of the promoter sequences. Later, we reconstruct the PSMMs using the entropy selected motifs/features and perform lacunarity analysis on the reconstructed PSMMs. This helps us to analyze the similarity existing between the promoter sequences. For experiments we use dataset created using NCBI. The results obtained using reduced motifs are encouraging in terms of differentiating promoters when compared to the results using complete set of motifs. From the experiments entropy seems to be a powerful measure to select features which increases the discriminative capability of lacunarity analysis.","author":["K. Kouser","B. S.

In order to efficiently perform aggregation, we implement simple aggregation operations in main memory and develop a locality-adaptive host architecture for in-memory aggregation, called cache-conscious aggregation. Through this, AIM executes aggregation at the most energy-efficient location among all levels of the memory hierarchy. Moreover, AIM minimally changes existing sequential programming models and provides fully automated compiler toolchain, thereby allowing unmodified legacy software to use AIM. Evaluations show that AIM greatly improves the energy efficiency of main memory and the system performance.","author":["Junwhan Ahn","Sungjoo Yoo","Kiyoung Choi"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 13","Issue 4","December 2016","Article No.: 34","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/2994149"],"date":"25 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"Junwhan Ahn, Sungpack Hong, Sungjoo Yoo, Onur Mutlu, and Kiyoung Choi. 2015a.

Towards attaining these objectives for practical implementations, various techniques to mitigate the specific reliability challenges associated with STT-MRAM elements are surveyed, classified, and assessed in this article. Cost and suitability metrics assessed include the area of nanomagmetic and CMOS components per bit, access time and complexity, sense margin, and energy or power consumption costs versus resiliency benefits. Solutions to the reliability issues identified are addressed within a taxonomy created to categorize the current and future approaches to reliable STT-MRAM designs. A variety of destructive and non-destructive sensing schemes are assessed for process variation tolerance, read disturbance reduction, sense margin, and write polarization asymmetry compensation. The highest resiliency strategies deliver a sensing margin above 300mV while incurring low power and energy consumption on the order of picojoules and microwatts, respectively, and attaining read sense latency of a few nanoseconds down to hundreds of picoseconds for non-destructive and destructive sensing schemes, respectively.","author":["Soheil Salehi","Deliang Fan","Ronald F.

Network pruning is a promising technique to solve this problem. However, pruning usually results in irregular network connections that not only demand extra representation efforts but also do not fit well on parallel computation. We introduce structured sparsity at various scales for convolutional neural networks: feature map-wise, kernel-wise, and intra-kernel strided sparsity. This structured sparsity is very advantageous for direct computational resource savings on embedded computers, in parallel computing environments, and in hardware-based systems. To decide the importance of network connections and paths, the proposed method uses a particle filtering approach. The importance weight of each particle is assigned by assessing the misclassification rate with a corresponding connectivity pattern. The pruned network is retrained to compensate for the losses due to pruning. While implementing convolutions as matrix products, we particularly show that intra-kernel strided sparsity with a simple constraint can significantly reduce the size of the kernel and feature map tensors. The proposed work shows that when pruning granularities are applied in combination, we can prune the CIFAR-10 network by more than 70% with less than a 1% loss in accuracy.","author":["Sajid Anwar","Kyuyeon Hwang","Wonyong Sung"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 13","Issue 3","May 2017","Article No.: 32","pp   1\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/3005348"],"date":"09 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"M.

However, understanding the prevalence and impact of personal attacks in online platforms at scale remains surprisingly difficult. The contribution of this paper is to develop and illustrate a method that combines crowdsourcing and machine learning to analyze personal attacks at scale. We show an evaluation method for a classifier in terms of the aggregated number of crowd-workers it can approximate. We apply our methodology to English Wikipedia, generating a corpus of over 100k high quality human-labeled comments and 63M machine-labeled ones from a classifier that is as good as the aggregate of 3 crowd-workers, as measured by the area under the ROC curve and Spearman correlation. Using this corpus of machine-labeled scores, our methodology allows us to explore some of the open questions about the nature of online personal attacks. This reveals that the majority of personal attacks on Wikipedia are not the result of a few malicious users, nor primarily the consequence of allowing anonymous contributions from unregistered users.","author":["Ellery Wulczyn","Nithum Thain","Lucas Dixon"],"issue":["WWW '17: Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web","April 2017","Pages   1391\u20131399","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052591"],"date":"03 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"J.

Traditionally, systems of entity relation extraction have relied on human-annotated corpora for training and adopted an incremental pipeline. Such systems require additional human expertise to be ported to a new domain, and are vulnerable to errors cascading down the pipeline. In this paper, we investigate joint extraction of typed entities and relations with labeled data heuristically obtained from knowledge bases (i.e., distant supervision). As our algorithm for type labeling via distant supervision is context-agnostic, noisy training data poses unique challenges for the task. We propose a novel domain-independent framework, called CoType, that runs a data-driven text segmentation algorithm to extract entity mentions, and jointly embeds entity mentions, relation mentions, text features and type labels into two low-dimensional spaces (for entity and relation mentions respectively), where, in each space, objects whose types are close will also have similar representations. CoType, then using these learned embeddings, estimates the types of test (unlinkable) mentions. We formulate a joint optimization problem to learn embeddings from text corpora and knowledge bases, adopting a novel partial-label loss function for noisy labeled data and introducing an object \"translation\" function to capture the cross-constraints of entities and relations on each other. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CoType across different domains (e.g., news, biomedical), with an average of 25% improvement in F1 score compared to the next best method.","author":["Xiang Ren","Zeqiu Wu","Wenqi He","Meng Qu","Clare R.

A hybrid model for Chinese spelling check is presented in this article. The hybrid model consists of three components: one graph-based model for generic errors and two independently trained models for specific errors. In the graph model, a directed acyclic graph is generated for each sentence, and the single-source shortest-path algorithm is performed on the graph to detect and correct general spelling errors at the same time. Prior to that, two types of errors over functional words (characters) are first solved by conditional random fields: the confusion of \u201c\u5728\u201d (at) (pinyin is zai in Chinese), \u201c\u518d\u201d (again, more, then) (pinyin: zai) and \u201c\u7684\u201d (of) (pinyin: de), \u201c\u5730\u201d (-ly, adverb-forming particle) (pinyin: de), and \u201c\u5f97\u201d (so that, have to) (pinyin: de). Finally, a rule-based model is exploited to distinguish pronoun usage confusion: \u201c\u5979\u201d (she) (pinyin: ta), \u201c\u4ed6\u201d (he) (pinyin: ta), and some other common collocation errors. The proposed model is evaluated on the standard datasets released by the SIGHAN Bake-off shared tasks, giving state-of-the-art results.","author":["Hai Zhao","Deng Cai","Yang Xin","Yuzhu Wang","Zhongye Jia"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing","Volume 16","Issue 3","April 2017","Article No.: 21","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/3047405"],"date":"30 March 2017","ref":[{"text":"Farooq Ahmad and Grzegorz Kondrak. 2005.

In this paper, we employ a single heterogeneous machine with fast storage media (e.g., NVMe SSD) and massively parallel coprocessors (e.g., Xeon Phi) to reach similar dimensions. By fully exploiting the heterogeneous devices, we design a new graph processing engine, named Mosaic, for a single machine. We propose a new locality-optimizing, space-efficient graph representation---Hilbert-ordered tiles, and a hybrid execution model that enables vertex-centric operations in fast host processors and edge-centric operations in massively parallel coprocessors. Our evaluation shows that for smaller graphs, Mosaic consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art out-of-core engines by 3.2-58.6x and shows comparable performance to distributed graph engines. Furthermore, Mosaic can complete one iteration of the Pagerank algorithm on a trillion-edge graph in 21 minutes, outperforming a distributed disk-based engine by 9.2\u00d7.","author":["Steffen Maass","Changwoo Min","Sanidhya Kashyap","Woonhak Kang","Mohan Kumar","Taesoo Kim"],"issue":["EuroSys '17: Proceedings of the Twelfth European Conference on Computer Systems","April 2017","Pages   527\u2013543","https://doi.org/10.1145/3064176.3064191"],"date":"23 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"NVM Express. http://www.nvmexpress.org/, 2017.","order":1},{"text":"Apache.

However, designing CNN architectures still requires expert knowledge and a lot of trial and error. In this paper, we attempt to automatically construct CNN architectures for an image classification task based on Cartesian genetic programming (CGP). In our method, we adopt highly functional modules, such as convolutional blocks and tensor concatenation, as the node functions in CGP. The CNN structure and connectivity represented by the CGP encoding method are optimized to maximize the validation accuracy. To evaluate the proposed method, we constructed a CNN architecture for the image classification task with the CIFAR-10 dataset. The experimental result shows that the proposed method can be used to automatically find the competitive CNN architecture compared with state-of-the-art models.","author":["Masanori Suganuma","Shinichi Shirakawa","Tomoharu Nagao"],"issue":["GECCO '17: Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference","July 2017","Pages   497\u2013504","https://doi.org/10.1145/3071178.3071229"],"date":"01 July 2017","ref":[{"text":"Bowen Baker, Otkrist Gupta, Nikhil Naik, and Ramesh Raskar. 2016.

In our work, we employ a descriptor learning approach to encode the similarity between fluid regions with differences in resolution and numerical viscosity. We use convolutional neural networks to generate the descriptors from fluid data such as smoke density and flow velocity. At the same time, we present a deformation limiting patch advection method which allows us to robustly track deformable fluid regions. With the help of this patch advection, we generate stable space-time data sets from detailed fluids for our repositories. We can then use our learned descriptors to quickly localize a suitable data set when running a new simulation. This makes our approach very efficient, and resolution independent. We will demonstrate with several examples that our method yields volumes with very high effective resolutions, and non-dissipative small scale details that naturally integrate into the motions of the underlying flow.","author":["Mengyu Chu","Nils Thuerey"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 36","Issue 4","July 2017","Article No.: 69","pp   1\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/3072959.3073643"],"date":"20 July 2017","ref":[{"text":"Gizem Akinci, Markus Ihmsen, Nadir Akinci, and Matthias Teschner. 2012.

With the case study of radio astronomy calibration, our contributions for improving the error resilience analysis are focused primarily on iterative methods that use a convergence criterion as a quality metric to terminate the iterative computations. We propose an adaptive statistical approximation model for high-level resilience analysis that provides an opportunity to divide a workload into exact and approximate iterations. This improves the existing error resilience analysis methodology by quantifying the number of approximate iterations (23% of the total iterations in our case study) in addition to other parameters used in the state-of-the-art techniques. This way heterogeneous architectures comprised of exact and inexact computing cores and adaptive accuracy architectures can be exploited efficiently. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of quality function reconsideration for convergence based iterative processes as the original quality function (the convergence criterion) is not necessarily sufficient in the resilience analysis phase. If such is the case, an additional quality function has to be defined to assess the viability of the approximate techniques.","author":["G. A. Gillani","A. B.J.

The nature of multimedia user-item interactions is 1/0 binary implicit feedback (e.g., photo likes, video views, song downloads, etc.), which can be collected at a larger scale with a much lower cost than explicit feedback (e.g., product ratings). However, the majority of existing collaborative filtering (CF) systems are not well-designed for multimedia recommendation, since they ignore the implicitness in users' interactions with multimedia content. We argue that, in multimedia recommendation, there exists item- and component-level implicitness which blurs the underlying users' preferences. The item-level implicitness means that users' preferences on items (e.g. photos, videos, songs, etc.) are unknown, while the component-level implicitness means that inside each item users' preferences on different components (e.g. regions in an image, frames of a video, etc.) are unknown. For example, a 'view'' on a video does not provide any specific information about how the user likes the video (i.e.item-level) and which parts of the video the user is interested in (i.e.component-level). In this paper, we introduce a novel attention mechanism in CF to address the challenging item- and component-level implicit feedback in multimedia recommendation, dubbed Attentive Collaborative Filtering (ACF). Specifically, our attention model is a neural network that consists of two attention modules: the component-level attention module, starting from any content feature extraction network (e.g. CNN for images/videos), which learns to select informative components of multimedia items, and the item-level attention module, which learns to score the item preferences. ACF can be seamlessly incorporated into classic CF models with implicit feedback, such as BPR and SVD++, and efficiently trained using SGD. Through extensive experiments on two real-world multimedia Web services: Vine and Pinterest, we show that ACF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CF methods.","author":["Jingyuan Chen","Hanwang Zhang","Xiangnan He","Liqiang Nie","Wei Liu","Tat-Seng Chua"],"issue":["SIGIR '17: Proceedings of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2017","Pages   335\u2013344","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080797"],"date":"07 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"D.

Network augmentation, on the other hand, leverages this feature representation to obtain a more informative network by adding potentially plausible edges while removing noisy edges. Traditional network embedding methods are often inefficient in capturing - (i) the latent relationship when the network is sparse (the network sparsity problem), and (ii) the local and global neighborhood structure of vertices (structure preserving problem). We propose SENA, a structural embedding and network augmentation framework for social network analysis. Unlike other embedding methods which only generate vertex features, SENA generates features for both vertices and relations (edges) by minimizing a well-designed objective function composed of a loss function and a regularization. The loss function reduces the network-sparsity problem by learning from both the edges present (true edges) and absent (false edges) in the network; whereas the regularization term preserves the structural properties of the network by efficiently considering - (i) the local neighborhood of vertices and edges, and (ii) the network spectra, i.e., eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix representing the network. We compare SENA with four baseline network embedding methods, namely DeepWalk, SE, SME and TransE. We demonstrate the efficacy of SENA through a task-based evaluation setting on different real-world networks. We consider the state-of-the-art algorithms for (i) community detection, (ii) link prediction and (iii) knowledge graph query answering, and show that with SENA's representation, these algorithms achieve up to 10%, 9% and (surprisingly) 108% higher accuracy respectively compared to the best baseline embedding methods.","author":["Sanghyun Hong","Tanmoy Chakraborty","Sungjin Ahn","Ghaith Husari","Noseong Park"],"issue":["HT '17: Proceedings of the 28th ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media","July 2017","Pages   235\u2013244","https://doi.org/10.1145/3078714.3078738"],"date":"04 July 2017","ref":[{"text":"D.

This paper evaluates a custom ASIC---called a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) --- deployed in datacenters since 2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural networks (NN). The heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a peak throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed on-chip memory. The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95% of our datacenters' NN inference demand. Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is on average about 15X -- 30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU, with TOPS/Watt about 30X -- 80X higher. Moreover, using the CPU's GDDR5 memory in the TPU would triple achieved TOPS and raise TOPS/Watt to nearly 70X the GPU and 200X the CPU.","author":["Norman P.

Its report-like characteristic which preserves and prioritizes graphical visualization was part of the main publishing concerns among several segments including government agencies. In this way, tabular data started to be enclosed within PDF documents and disclosed in government portals. This situation, apart being surprisingly contradictory to data openness, is still found even in the major open data initiatives. It is estimated that roughly 13% of published files in some main open data portals around the world have their data made available in PDF. Thus, there is a need for effective tools capable of extracting tabular content (a main placeholder for data) from PDF to allow its data to be published in more open formats such as the well-known CSV which complies with accessible and machine processable open data principles. This paper aims at providing a structured and comprehensive overview of the research in tabular content extraction specifically from PDF documents as well as to provide an overview of most recent practical results in the literature. The contribution of this work goes beyond theoretical discussions by helping data practitioners to understand to what extent methods and tools regarding tabular content extraction from PDF can benefit the open data initiatives in practical and effective ways.","author":["Andreiwid Sheffer Corr\u00eaa","P\u00e4r-Ola Zander"],"issue":["dg.o '17: Proceedings of the 18th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research","June 2017","Pages   54\u201363","https://doi.org/10.1145/3085228.3085278"],"date":"07 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Manuel Aristar\u00e1n and Mike Tigas. 2013.

Structural identity has been studied in theory and practice over the past decades, but only recently has it been addressed with representational learning techniques. This work presents struc2vec, a novel and flexible framework for learning latent representations for the structural identity of nodes. struc2vec uses a hierarchy to measure node similarity at different scales, and constructs a multilayer graph to encode structural similarities and generate structural context for nodes. Numerical experiments indicate that state-of-the-art techniques for learning node representations fail in capturing stronger notions of structural identity, while struc2vec exhibits much superior performance in this task, as it overcomes limitations of prior approaches. As a consequence, numerical experiments indicate that struc2vec improves performance on classification tasks that depend more on structural identity.","author":["Leonardo F.R. Ribeiro","Pedro H.P.

However, many people are still reluctant to outsource biological sequences to the cloud because they contain sensitive information that should be kept secret for ethical, security, and legal reasons. One of the most fundamental and frequently used computational tools for biological sequence analysis is pairwise sequence alignment (PSA). Previous works for securely solving PSAs at the cloud suffer from poor scalability, i.e., they are unable to exploit the cloud's infrastructure to solve PSAs in parallel because resource-limited users need to be constantly involved in the computations. In this paper, we develop a secure outsourcing algorithm that allows users to solve an arbitrary number of PSAs in parallel at the cloud. Compared with previous works, our algorithm can reduce computing time of a large number of PSAs by more than 50% with as few as 5 computing nodes at the cloud.","author":["Sergio Salinas","Pan Li"],"issue":["ACM-BCB '17: Proceedings of the 8th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology,and Health Informatics","August 2017","Pages   178\u2013183","https://doi.org/10.1145/3107411.3107477"],"date":"20 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"M.

In contrast to previous works, these representations explicitly encode multi-scale vertex relationships in a way that is analytically derivable. WALKLETS generates these multiscale relationships by sub-sampling short random walks on the vertices of a graph. By 'skipping' over steps in each random walk, our method generates a corpus of vertex pairs which are reachable via paths of a fixed length. This corpus can then be used to learn a series of latent representations, each of which captures successively higher order relationships from the adjacency matrix. We demonstrate the efficacy of WALKLETS's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, DBLP, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that WALKLETS outperforms new methods based on neural matrix factorization. Specifically, we outperform DeepWalk by up to 10% and LINE by 58% Micro-F1 on challenging multi-label classification tasks. Finally, WALKLETS is an online algorithm, and can easily scale to graphs with millions of vertices and edges.","author":["Bryan Perozzi","Vivek Kulkarni","Haochen Chen","Steven Skiena"],"issue":["ASONAM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining 2017","July 2017","Pages   258\u2013265","https://doi.org/10.1145/3110025.3110086"],"date":"31 July 2017","ref":[{"text":"B.

Museums and galleries have a large number of artworks in the database, hiring art experts to do analysis works (e.g., classification, annotation) is time consuming and expensive and the analytic results are not stable because the results highly depend on the experiences of art experts. The problem of generating better representation of visual arts is of great interests to us because of its application potentials and interesting research challenges---both content information and each unique style information within one artwork should be summarized and learned when generating the representation. For example, by studying a vast number of artworks, art experts summary and enhance the knowledge of unique characteristics of each visual arts to do visual arts analytic works, it is non-trivial for computer. In this paper, we present a unified framework, called DeepArt, to learn joint representations that can simultaneously capture contents and style of visual arts. This framework learns unique characteristics of visual arts directly from a large-scale visual arts dataset, it is more flexible and accurate than traditional handcraft approaches. We also introduce Art500k, a large-scale visual arts dataset containing over 500,000 artworks, which are annotated with detailed labels of artist, art movement, genre, etc. Extensive empirical studies and evaluations are reported based on our framework and Art500k and all those reports demonstrate the superiority of our framework and usefulness of Art500k. A practical system for visual arts retrieval and annotation is implemented based on our framework and dataset.

Sutherland states that \"The ultimate display would [...] be a room within which the computer can control the existence of matter [...]\". This general notion of a computer-mediated or virtual reality, in which synthetic objects or the entire virtual environment get indistinguishable from the real world, dates back to Plato's \"The Allegory of the Cave\" and has been reconsidered again and again in science fiction literature as well as the movie industry. For instance, virtual reality is often used to question whether we truly \"know\" if our perceptions are real or not. Early science fiction movies like \"The Matrix\u00e2\u0102\u0130 or the fictional holodeck from the Star Trek universe are prominent examples of these kind of perceptual ambiguities. Furthermore, in movies like Steven Spielberg's \"Minority Report\", Jon Favreau's \"Iron Man\", or Brad Bird's \"Mission Impossible 4\" actors can seamlessly use freehand gestures in space combined with speech to manipulate 3D holographic projections, while they also perceive haptic feedback when touching the virtual objects. In my talk I will revisit some of the most visually impressive 3D user interfaces and experiences of such fictional ultimate displays. As a matter of fact, we cannot let a computer fully control the existence of matter, but we can fool our senses and give a user the illusion that the computer can after all. I will show how different ultimate displays can be implemented with current state-of-the-art technology by exploiting perceptually-inspired interfaces. However, we will see that the resulting ultimate displays are not so ultimate at all, but pose novel interesting future research challenges and questions.","author":["Frank Steinicke"],"issue":["SUI '17: Proceedings of the 5th Symposium on Spatial User Interaction","October 2017","Pages   1\u20132","https://doi.org/10.1145/3131277.3143321"],"date":"16 October 2017"},{"_id":"10.1145/3132847.3132905","title":"Attributed Signed Network Embedding","abstract":"The major task of network embedding is to learn low-dimensional vector representations of social-network nodes. It facilitates many analytical tasks such as link prediction and node clustering and thus has attracted increasing attention. The majority of existing embedding algorithms are designed for unsigned social networks. However, many social media networks have both positive and negative links, for which unsigned algorithms have little utility. Recent findings in signed network analysis suggest that negative links have distinct properties and added value over positive links. This brings about both challenges and opportunities for signed network embedding. In addition, user attributes, which encode properties and interests of users, provide complementary information to network structures and have the potential to improve signed network embedding. Therefore, in this paper, we study the novel problem of signed social network embedding with attributes. We propose a novel framework SNEA, which exploits the network structure and user attributes simultaneously for network representation learning. Experimental results on link prediction and node clustering with real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SNEA.","author":["Suhang Wang","Charu Aggarwal","Jiliang Tang","Huan Liu"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   137\u2013146","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132905"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"Ghazaleh Beigi, Jiliang Tang, Suhang Wang, and Huan Liu. 2016.

The learned embeddings could advance various learning tasks such as node classification, network clustering, and link prediction. Most, if not all, of the existing works, are overwhelmingly performed in the context of plain and static networks. Nonetheless, in reality, network structure often evolves over time with addition/deletion of links and nodes. Also, a vast majority of real-world networks are associated with a rich set of node attributes, and their attribute values are also naturally changing, with the emerging of new content patterns and the fading of old content patterns. These changing characteristics motivate us to seek an effective embedding representation to capture network and attribute evolving patterns, which is of fundamental importance for learning in a dynamic environment. To our best knowledge, we are the first to tackle this problem with the following two challenges: (1) the inherently correlated network and node attributes could be noisy and incomplete, it necessitates a robust consensus representation to capture their individual properties and correlations; (2) the embedding learning needs to be performed in an online fashion to adapt to the changes accordingly. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a novel dynamic attributed network embedding framework - DANE. In particular, DANE first provides an offline method for a consensus embedding and then leverages matrix perturbation theory to maintain the freshness of the end embedding results in an online manner. We perform extensive experiments on both synthetic and real attributed networks to corroborate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.","author":["Jundong Li","Harsh Dani","Xia Hu","Jiliang Tang","Yi Chang","Huan Liu"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   387\u2013396","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132919"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"Lada A Adamic and Bernardo A Huberman. 2000.

We propose a novel framework that combines deep neural networks and spectral graph analysis. In particular, we use the node projection (called as spectral coordinate) in the low dimensional spectral space of the graph's adjacency matrix as the input of deep neural networks. Spectral coordinates in the spectral space capture the most useful topology information of the network. Due to the small dimension of spectral coordinates (compared with the dimension of the adjacency matrix derived from a graph), training deep neural networks becomes feasible. We develop and evaluate two neural networks, deep autoencoder and convolutional neural network, in our fraud detection framework. Experimental results on a real signed graph show that our spectrum based deep neural networks are effective in fraud detection.","author":["Shuhan Yuan","Xintao Wu","Jun Li","Aidong Lu"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   2419\u20132422","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133139"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"Leman Akoglu, Hanghang Tong, and Danai Koutra. 2015.

This may involve measuring sensors and controlling actuators, communicating with other systems, or interacting with users. These functions impose real-time constraints on system design. Verification of these specifications requires computing an upper bound on the worst-case execution time (WCET) of a hardware/software system. Furthermore, it is critical to derive a tight upper bound on WCET in order to make efficient use of system resources.The problem of bounding WCET   is particularly difficult on modern processors. These processors use cache-based memory systems that vary memory access time based on the dynamic memory access pattern of the program. This must be accurately modeled in order to   tightly bound WCET. Several analysis methods have been proposed to bound WCET on processors with instruction caches. Existing approaches either search all possible program paths, an intractable problem, or they use highly pessimistic assumptions to limit the search space. In this paper we present a more effective method for modeling instruction cache activity and computing a tight bound on WCET. The method uses an integer linear programming formulation and does not require explicit enumeration of program paths. The method is implemented in the program cinderella and we present some experimental results of this implementation.","author":["Yau-Tsun Steven Li","Sharad Malik","Andrew Wolfe"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 4","Issue 3","July 1999","pp   257\u2013279","https://doi.org/10.1145/315773.315778"],"date":"01 July 1999","ref":[{"text":"ARNOLD, R., MUELLER, F., WHALLEY, D., AND HARMON, M. 1994.

In this paper, we propose a full-chip RTL-to-GDSII physical design solution to build high-density and commercial-quality two-tier F2F-bonded 3D ICs. The state-of-the-art flow named Shrunk-2D (S2D) requires shrinking of standard cells and interconnects by a factor of 50% to fit into the target 3D footprint of a two-tier design. This, unfortunately, necessitates commercial place/route engines that handle one node smaller geometries, which can be challenging and costly. Our flow named Compact-2D (C2D) does not require any geometry shrinking. Instead, C2D implements a 2D IC with scaled interconnect RC parasitics, and contracts the layout to the F2F design footprint. In addition, C2D offers post-tier-partitioning optimization that is shown to be effective in fixing timing violations caused by inter-tier 3D routing, which is completely missing in S2D. Lastly, we present a methodology to recycle the routing result of post-tier-partitioning optimization for final GDSII generation. Our experimental results show that at iso-performance, C2D offers up to 26.8% power reduction and 15.6% silicon area savings over commercial 2D ICs without any routing resource overhead.","author":["Bon Woong Ku","Kyungwook Chang","Sung Kyu Lim"],"issue":["ISPD '18: Proceedings of the 2018 International Symposium on Physical Design","March 2018","Pages   90\u201397","https://doi.org/10.1145/3177540.3178244"],"date":"25 March 2018","ref":[{"text":"http://www.opensparc.net/.","order":1},{"text":"http://www.opencores.org/.","order":2},{"text":"E.

We suggest that people learn better than computers precisely because of this difference, and we suggest a key direction for machine learning research is to develop software architectures that enable intelligent agents to also learn many types of knowledge, continuously over many years, and to become better learners over time. In this paper we define more precisely this never-ending learning paradigm for machine learning, and we present one case study: the Never-Ending Language Learner (NELL), which achieves a number of the desired properties of a never-ending learner. NELL has been learning to read the Web 24hrs/day since January 2010, and so far has acquired a knowledge base with 120mn diverse, confidence-weighted beliefs (e.g., servedWith(tea,biscuits)), while learning thousands of interrelated functions that continually improve its reading competence over time. NELL has also learned to reason over its knowledge base to infer new beliefs it has not yet read from those it has, and NELL is inventing new relational predicates to extend the ontology it uses to represent beliefs. We describe the design of NELL, experimental results illustrating its behavior, and discuss both its successes and shortcomings as a case study in never-ending learning. NELL can be tracked online at http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu, and followed on Twitter at @CMUNELL.","author":["T. Mitchell","W. Cohen","E. Hruschka","P. Talukdar","B. Yang","J. Betteridge","A. Carlson","B.

An SNN is distinguished from other neural networks in that (1) its independent computing units, or \"neurons\", communicate with others only through spike messages; and (2) each neuron evaluates local learning rules, which are functions of spike arrival and departure timings, to modify its local state. The collective neuronal state dynamics of an SNN form a nonlinear dynamical system that can be cast as an unconventional model of computation. To realize such an SNN on Loihi requires each constituent neuron to locally store and independently update its own spike timing information. However, each Loihi core has limited resources for this purpose and these must be shared by neurons assigned to the same core. In this work, we present a compiler for Loihi that maps the neurons of an SNN onto and across Loihi's cores efficiently. We show that a poor neuron-to-core mapping can incur significant energy costs and address this with a greedy algorithm that compiles SNNs onto Loihi in a power-efficient manner. In so doing, we highlight the need for further development of compilers for this new, emerging class of architectures.","author":["Chit-Kwan Lin","Andreas Wild","Gautham N.

However, linear fitting faces issue of over-fitting and black relationships with historical data, while sequence mining is short in efficiency and lack dynamic adaptations. This paper builds a modified Bayesian-LSTM (B-LSTM) model for stock prediction. Six indicators of the Chinese stock market in every day are the basic input for LSTM. In order to represent the economic wave, we defined a data set unit by week which means the basic unit in LSTM is data in one week. Furthermore, a Bayesian optimization model is proposed to estimate the unit number dynamically in different economic cycle. The experimental results demonstrated that the B-LSTM increase over 25% prediction than the conventional LSTM.","author":["Biao Huang","Qiao Ding","Guozi Sun","Huakang Li"],"issue":["ICMLC 2018: Proceedings of the 2018 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing","February 2018","Pages   128\u2013133","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195106.3195170"],"date":"26 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Abu-Mostafa, Y.

By employing the unique crossbar structure, ReRAM can be constructed with extremely high density. However, the crossbar ReRAM faces some serious challenges in terms of performance, reliability, and energy consumption. First, ReRAM\u2019s crossbar structure causes an IR drop problem due to wire resistance and sneak currents, which results in nonuniform access latency in ReRAM banks and reduces its reliability. Second, without access transistors in the crossbar structure, write disturbance results in serious data reliability problem. Third, the access latency, reliability, and energy use of ReRAM arrays are significantly influenced by the data patterns involved in a write operation.To overcome the challenges of the crossbar ReRAM, we propose a novel circuit architecture co-optimization framework for improving the performance, reliability, and energy use of ReRAM-based main memory system, called CACF. The proposed CACF consists of three levels, including the circuit level, circuit architecture level, and architecture level. At the circuit level, to reduce the IR drops along bitlines, we propose a double-sided write driver design by applying write drivers along both sides of bitlines and selectively activating the write drivers. At the circuit architecture level, to address the write disturbance with low overheads, we propose a RESET disturbance detection scheme by adding disturbance reference cells and conditionally performing refresh operations. At the architecture level, a region partition with address remapping method is proposed to leverage the nonuniform access latency in ReRAM banks, and two flip schemes are proposed in different regions to optimize the data patterns involved in a write operation. The experimental results show that CACF improves system performance by 26.1%, decreases memory access latency by 22.4%, shortens running time by 20.1%, and reduces energy consumption by 21.6% on average over an aggressive baseline. Meanwhile, CACF significantly improves the reliability of ReRAM-based memory systems.","author":["Yang Zhang","Dan Feng","Wei Tong","Yu Hua","Jingning Liu","Zhipeng Tan","Chengning Wang","Bing Wu","Zheng Li","Gaoxiang Xu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 15","Issue 2","June 2018","Article No.: 22","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195799"],"date":"23 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"Nathan Binkert, Bradford Beckmann, Gabriel Black, Steven K.

We examine the problem of overcoming the inherent difficulty of concurrent operations on such structures, using a practical storage model. A single additional \u201clink\u201d pointer in each node allows a process to easily recover from tree modifications performed by other concurrent processes. Our solution compares favorably with earlier solutions in that the locking scheme is simpler (no read-locks are used) and only a (small) constant number of nodes are locked by any update process at any given time. An informal correctness proof for our system is given.","author":["Philip L. Lehman","s.

The proposed design overcomes many of the traditional problems of database system software and is one of the first to describe a complete data-secure computer capable of handling large databases.This paper begins by characterizing the major problems facing today's database system designers. These problems are intrinsically related to the nature of conventional hardware and can only be solved by introducing new architectural concepts. Several such concepts are brought to bear in the later sections of this paper. These architectural principles have a major impact upon the design of the system and so they are discussed in some detail. A key aspect of these principles is that they can be implemented with near-term technology. The rest of the paper is devoted to the functional characteristics and the theory of operation of the DBC. The theory of operation is based on a series of abstract models of the components and data structures employed by the DBC. These models are used to illustrate how the DBC performs access operations, manages data structures and security specifications, and enforces security requirements. Short Algol-like algorithms are used to show how these operations are carried out. This part of the paper concludes with a high-level description of the DBC organization. The actual details of the DBC hardware are quite involved and so their presentation is not the subject of this paper.A sample database is included in the Appendix to illustrate the working of the security and clustering mechanisms of the DBC.","author":["Jayanta Banerjee","David K.

We use a set of nearly 100 regression benchmark problems culled from open source repositories across the web. We conduct a rigorous benchmarking of four recent symbolic regression approaches as well as nine machine learning approaches from scikit-learn. The results suggest that symbolic regression performs strongly compared to state-of-the-art gradient boosting algorithms, although in terms of running times is among the slowest of the available methodologies. We discuss the results in detail and point to future research directions that may allow symbolic regression to gain wider adoption in the machine learning community.","author":["Patryk Orzechowski","William La Cava","Jason H.

Defective deep learning applications may lead to catastrophic consequences. Although recent research efforts were made on testing and debugging deep learning applications, the characteristics of deep learning defects have never been studied. To fill this gap, we studied deep learning applications built on top of TensorFlow and collected program bugs related to TensorFlow from StackOverflow QA pages and Github projects. We extracted information from QA pages, commit messages, pull request messages, and issue discussions to examine the root causes and symptoms of these bugs. We also studied the strategies deployed by TensorFlow users for bug detection and localization. These findings help researchers and TensorFlow users to gain a better understanding of coding defects in TensorFlow programs and point out a new direction for future research.","author":["Yuhao Zhang","Yifan Chen","Shing-Chi Cheung","Yingfei Xiong","Lu Zhang"],"issue":["ISSTA 2018: Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis","July 2018","Pages   129\u2013140","https://doi.org/10.1145/3213846.3213866"],"date":"12 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Earl T.

Because the result inverse function is given as a Fourier cosine series, the procedure requires only about ten FORTRAN statements. Furthermore, it does not require the use of involved algorithms for the generation of any special functions, but uses only cosines and exponentials.The basis of the method hinges on the fact that in evaluating the inverse Laplace transform integral there exists a freedom in choosing the contour of integration. Given certain restrictions, the contour may be any vertical line in the right-half plane. Specifying a line, the integral to be evaluated is essentially a Fourier integral. However, the method is concerned with determining the proper line, so that when the integral (along this line) is approximated, the error is as small as desired by virtue of having chosen the particular contour.","author":["H.

This version is well adapted for use in a special-purpose computer designed for the purpose. It is shown that only three operators are needed. One operator replaces successive pairs of data points by their sums and differences. The second operator performs a fixed permutation which is an ideal shuffle of the data. The third operator permits the multiplication of a selected subset of the data by a common complex multiplier.If, as seems reasonable, the slowest operation is the complex multiplications required, then, for reasonably sized date sets\u2014e.g. 512 complex numbers\u2014parallelization by the method developed should allow an increase of speed over the serial use of the Fast Fourier Transform by about two orders of magnitude.It is suggested that a machine to realize the speed improvement indicated is quite feasible.The analysis is based on the use of the Kronecker product of matrices. It is suggested that this form is of general use in the development and classification of various modifications and extensions of the algorithm.","author":["Marshall C.

A second criterion, extending these limitations to multidimensional uniformity, is also defined. A sequence possessing both properties is said to be asymptotically random as no other sequence of the same period could be more random in these respects.An algorithm is presented which, for any Tausworthe sequence based on a primitive trinomial over GF(2), establishes how closely or otherwise the conditions necessary for the criteria are achieved. Given that the necessary conditions are achieved, the conditions sufficient for the first criterion are derived from Galois theory and always apply. For the second criterion, however, the period must be prime.An asymptotically random 23-bit number sequence of astronomic period, 2607 - 1, is presented. An initialization program is required to provide 607 starting values, after which the sequence can be generated with a three-term recurrence of the Fibonacci type. In addition to possessing the theoretically demonstrable randomness properties associated with Tausworthe sequences, the sequence possesses equidistribution and multidimensional uniformity properties vastly in excess of anything that has yet been shown for conventional congruentially generated sequences. It is shown that, for samples of a size it is practicable to generate, there can exist no purely empirical test of the sequence as it stands capable of distinguishing between it and an \u221e-distributed sequence. Bounds for local nonrandomness in respect of runs above (below) the mean and runs of equal numbers are established theoretically.The claimed randomness properties do not necessarily extend to subsequences, though it is not yet known which particular subsequences are at fault.Accordingly, the sequence is at present suggested only for simulations with no fixed dimensionality requirements.","author":["J.

System reliability, in turn, mandates error-recoverability while implementing biochemical assays on-chip for medical applications. Unfortunately, the technology of DMFBs is not yet fully equipped to handle error-recovery from various microfluidic operations involving droplet motion and reaction. Recently, a number of cyber-physical systems have been proposed to provide real-time checking and error-recovery in assays based on the feedback received from a few on-chip checkpoints. However, to synthesize robust feedback systems for different types of DMFBs, certain practical issues need to be considered such as co-optimization of checkpoint placement, error-recoverability, and layout of droplet-routing pathways. For application-specific DMFBs, we propose here an algorithm that minimizes the number of checkpoints and determines their locations to cover every path in a given droplet-routing solution. Next, for general-purpose DMFBs, where the checkpoints are pre-deployed in specific locations, we present a checkpoint-aware routing algorithm such that every droplet-routing path passes through at least one checkpoint to enable error-recovery and to ensure physical routability of all droplets. Furthermore, we also propose strategies for executing the algorithms in reliable mode to enhance error-recoverability. The proposed methods thus provide reliability-hardening mechanisms for a wide class of cyber-physical DMFBs.","author":["Guan-Ruei Lu","Ansuman Banerjee","Bhargab B.

In order to develop an effective and efficient IMC platform, the performance, such as density, operation speed and power consumption, of the memory itself is one of the most important keys. In this work, we report a cross-point magnetic random access memory (MRAM) with diode selector for IMC implementation. The memory cell consists of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) device and a diode connected in series. The memory cells are arranged in a cross-point array structure, providing high storage density. The MTJ can be switched through the unipolar precessional voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect, thus enabling high speed and low power. Further, Boolean logic functions can be realized via regular memory-like write & read operations. The feasibility and performance of the proposed IMC in the crosspoint MRAM are successfully demonstrated with hybrid VCMA-MTJ/CMOS circuit simulations under the 40 nm technology node.","author":["Chaoxin Ding","Wang Kang","He Zhang","Youguang Zhang","Weisheng Zhao"],"issue":["NANOARCH '18: Proceedings of the 14th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","July 2018","Pages   72\u201378","https://doi.org/10.1145/3232195.3232218"],"date":"17 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"N.

This lack of explanation constitutes both a practical and an ethical issue. The literature reports many approaches aimed at overcoming this crucial weakness, sometimes at the cost of sacrificing accuracy for interpretability. The applications in which black box decision systems can be used are various, and each approach is typically developed to provide a solution for a specific problem and, as a consequence, it explicitly or implicitly delineates its own definition of interpretability and explanation. The aim of this article is to provide a classification of the main problems addressed in the literature with respect to the notion of explanation and the type of black box system. Given a problem definition, a black box type, and a desired explanation, this survey should help the researcher to find the proposals more useful for his own work. The proposed classification of approaches to open black box models should also be useful for putting the many research open questions in perspective.","author":["Riccardo Guidotti","Anna Monreale","Salvatore Ruggieri","Franco Turini","Fosca Giannotti","Dino Pedreschi"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 51","Issue 5","January 2019","Article No.: 93","pp   1\u201342","https://doi.org/10.1145/3236009"],"date":"22 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"Julius Adebayo and Lalana Kagal. 2016.

However, it is a huge challenge to have a predictor that is both accurate and fast. In this work, we study how to leverage convolutional neural network to address this challenge. The proposed method, called RouteNet, can either evaluate the overall routability of cell placement solutions without global routing or predict the locations of DRC (Design Rule Checking) hotspots. In both cases, large macros in mixed-size designs are taken into consideration. Experiments on benchmark circuits show that RouteNet can forecast overall routability with accuracy similar to that of global router while using substantially less runtime. For DRC hotspot prediction, RouteNet improves accuracy by 50% compared to global routing. It also significantly outperforms other machine learning approaches such as support vector machine and logistic regression.","author":["Zhiyao Xie","Yu-Hung Huang","Guan-Qi Fang","Haoxing Ren","Shao-Yun Fang","Yiran Chen","Nvidia Corporation"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 80","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240843"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"Ismail S.

A circuit obfuscated using the aforementioned approach preserves the correct functionality only when both correct functional and delay keys are provided. In this paper, we develop a novel SAT formulation based approach called TimingSAT to deobfuscte the functionalities of such delay locked designs within a reasonable amount of time. The proposed technique models the timing characteristics of various types of gates present in the design as Boolean functions to build timing profile embedded SAT formulations in terms of targeted key inputs. TimingSAT attack works in two stages: In the first stage the functional keys are found using traditional SAT attack approach and in the second stage the delay keys are deciphered utilizing the timing profile embedded SAT formulation of the circuit. In both stages of the attack, wrong keys are iteratively eliminated till a key belonging to the correct equivalence class is obtained. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed TimingSAT attack to break delay logic locked benchmarks within few hours.","author":["Abhishek Chakraborty","Yuntao Liu","Ankur Srivastava"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 6","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240857"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"A.

In order to solve the difficulty of channel estimation problem in MIMO-OFDM system, this paper propose a semi-blind estimation method based on independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm combined with improved Hopfield recurrent neural network (HRNN) as a hybrid approach named ICA-HRNN. Then use the ICA-HRNN algorithm to estimate the channel information of MIMO-OFDM system. The simulation results show that, the ICA-HRNN algorithm can better adapt to the nonlinear characteristics of MIMO-OFDM system, and increase the estimation accuracy and the estimation speed, especially when the system has low SNR.","author":["Hao Jie"],"issue":["ICVISP 2018: Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Vision, Image and Signal Processing","August 2018","Article No.: 47","Pages   1\u20135","https://doi.org/10.1145/3271553.3271593"],"date":"27 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, traditional PIM architecture has to use a separate crossbar array to store either positive or negative (P/N) weights, which limits both energy efficiency and area efficiency. Even worse, imbalance running time of different layers and idle ADCs/DACs even lower down the whole system efficiency. This paper proposes AERIS, an <u>A</u>rea/<u>E</u>nergy-efficient 1T2R <u>R</u>eRAM based processing-<u>I</u>n-memory NN <u>S</u>ystem-on-a-chip to enhance both energy and area efficiency. We propose an area-efficient 1T2R ReRAM structure to represent both P/N weights in a single array, and a reference current cancelling scheme (RCS) is also presented for better accuracy. Moreover, a layer-balance scheduling strategy, as well as the power gating technique for interface circuits, such as ADCs/DACs, is adopted for higher energy efficiency. Experiment results show that compared with state-of-the-art ReRAM-based architectures, AERIS achieves 8.5x/1.3x peak energy/area efficiency improvements in total, due to layer-balance scheduling for different layers, power gating of interface circuits, and 1T2R ReRAM circuits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed RCS compensates the non-ideal factors of ReRAM and improves NN accuracy by 5.2% in the XNOR net on CIFAR-10 dataset.","author":["Jinshan Yue","Yongpan Liu","Fang Su","Shuangchen Li","Zhe Yuan","Zhibo Wang","Wenyu Sun","Xueqing Li","Huazhong Yang"],"issue":["ASPDAC '19: Proceedings of the 24th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2019","Pages   146\u2013151","https://doi.org/10.1145/3287624.3287635"],"date":"21 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"F Alibart, L.

Current SGD-based algorithms suffer from either a high computational cost that exponentially grows with number of GCN layers, or a large space requirement for keeping the entire graph and the embedding of each node in memory. In this paper, we propose Cluster-GCN, a novel GCN algorithm that is suitable for SGD-based training by exploiting the graph clustering structure. Cluster-GCN works as the following: at each step, it samples a block of nodes that associate with a dense subgraph identified by a graph clustering algorithm, and restricts the neighborhood search within this subgraph. This simple but effective strategy leads to significantly improved memory and computational efficiency while being able to achieve comparable test accuracy with previous algorithms. To test the scalability of our algorithm, we create a new Amazon2M data with 2 million nodes and 61 million edges which is more than 5 times larger than the previous largest publicly available dataset (Reddit). For training a 3-layer GCN on this data, Cluster-GCN is faster than the previous state-of-the-art VR-GCN (1523 seconds vs 1961 seconds) and using much less memory (2.2GB vs 11.2GB). Furthermore, for training 4 layer GCN on this data, our algorithm can finish in around 36 minutes while all the existing GCN training algorithms fail to train due to the out-of-memory issue. Furthermore, Cluster-GCN allows us to train much deeper GCN without much time and memory overhead, which leads to improved prediction accuracy---using a 5-layer Cluster-GCN, we achieve state-of-the-art test F1 score 99.36 on the PPI dataset, while the previous best result was 98.71 by~\\citezhang2018gaan.","author":["Wei-Lin Chiang","Xuanqing Liu","Si Si","Yang Li","Samy Bengio","Cho-Jui Hsieh"],"issue":["KDD '19: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2019","Pages   257\u2013266","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292500.3330925"],"date":"25 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"Jie Chen, Tengfei Ma, and Cao Xiao. 2018.

Although exiting HIN embedding methods have achieved performance improvement to some extent, they still face a few major weaknesses. Most importantly, they usually adopt negative sampling to randomly select nodes from the network, and they do not learn the underlying distribution for more robust embedding. Inspired by generative adversarial networks (GAN), we develop a novel framework HeGAN for HIN embedding, which trains both a discriminator and a generator in a minimax game. Compared to existing HIN embedding methods, our generator would learn the node distribution to generate better negative samples. Compared to GANs on homogeneous networks, our discriminator and generator are designed to be relation-aware in order to capture the rich semantics on HINs. Furthermore, towards more effective and efficient sampling, we propose a generalized generator, which samples \"latent\" nodes directly from a continuous distribution, not confined to the nodes in the original network as existing methods are. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. Results show that we consistently and significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines across all datasets and tasks.","author":["Binbin Hu","Yuan Fang","Chuan Shi"],"issue":["KDD '19: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2019","Pages   120\u2013129","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292500.3330970"],"date":"25 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"Martin Arjovsky, Soumith Chintala, and L\u00e9on Bottou. 2017.

However, since the convolutional neural network (CNN) is widely known as compute-bound, current ReRAM-based accelerators are not able to support CNN efficiently. In this paper, we for the first time propose the CNN accelerator with Winograd's convolution on ReRAM (CNNWire), which minimizes the multiplications to enable fast and efficient CNN inference. We realize the convolution with Winograd Processing Element (WPE) based on convolutional tiles. Interconnections between WPEs are designed aiming to improve the data reuse. Finally, we introduce the full mapping flow to implement the Winograd convolution The results show that CNMWire gains 3.85x energy efficiency boosting and 3.24x speedup on average among different CNN benchmarks, compared with traditional GEMM based mapping.","author":["Jilan Lin","Shuangchen Li","Xing Hu","Lei Deng","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '19: Proceedings of the 2019 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2019","Pages   283\u2013286","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299874.3318018"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Sharan Chetlur et al. 2014. cuDNN: Efficient Primitives for Deep Learning.

This article presents a comprehensive neuromemristive crossbar architecture for the spatial pooler (SP) and the sparse distributed representation classifier, which are fundamental to the algorithm. There are several unique features in the proposed architecture that tightly link with the HTM algorithm. A memristor that is suitable for emulating the HTM synapses is identified and a new Z-window function is proposed. The architecture exploits the concept of synthetic synapses to enable potential synapses in the HTM. The crossbar for the SP avoids dark spots caused by unutilized crossbar regions and supports rapid on-chip training within two clock cycles. This research also leverages plasticity mechanisms such as neurogenesis and homeostatic intrinsic plasticity to strengthen the robustness and performance of the SP. The proposed design is benchmarked for image recognition tasks using Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and Yale faces datasets, and is evaluated using different metrics including entropy, sparseness, and noise robustness. Detailed power analysis at different stages of the SP operations is performed to demonstrate the suitability for mobile platforms.","author":["Abdullah M.

A major challenge in building systems that combine audio models with commodity microphones is to guarantee their accuracy and robustness in the real-world. Besides many environmental dynamics, a primary factor that impacts the robustness of audio models is microphone variability. In this work, we propose Mic2Mic - a machine-learned system component - which resides in the inference pipeline of audio models and at real-time reduces the variability in audio data caused by microphone-specific factors. Two key considerations for the design of Mic2Mic were: a) to decouple the problem of microphone variability from the audio task, and b) put minimal burden on end-users to provide training data. With these in mind, we apply the principles of cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGANs) to learn Mic2Mic using unlabeled and unpaired data collected from different microphones. Our experiments show that Mic2Mic can recover between 66% to 89% of the accuracy lost due to microphone variability for two common audio tasks.","author":["Akhil Mathur","Anton Isopoussu","Fahim Kawsar","Nadia Berthouze","Nicholas D.

In particular, ReRAM-based crossbar structures can perform matrix-vector multiplication directly in the analog domain, but the resolutions of ReRAM cells and digital/analog converters limit the precisions of inputs and weights that can be directly supported. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be trained with low-precision weights and activations, previous quantization approaches are either not amenable to ReRAM-based crossbar implementations or have poor accuracies when applied to deep CNNs on complex datasets. In this article, we propose a new CNN training and implementation approach that implements weights using a trained biased number representation, which can achieve near full-precision model accuracy with as little as 2-bit weights and 2-bit activations on the CIFAR datasets. The proposed approach is compatible with a ReRAM-based crossbar implementation. We also propose an activation-side coalescing technique that combines the steps of batch normalization, non-linear activation, and quantization into a single stage that simply performs a clipped-rounding operation. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous low-precision number representations for VGG-11, VGG-13, and VGG-19 models on both the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.","author":["Weijia Wang","Bill Lin"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 15","Issue 2","June 2019","Article No.: 15","pp   1\u201317","https://doi.org/10.1145/3304107"],"date":"26 March 2019","ref":[{"text":"Ali Shafiee, Anirban Nag, Naveen Muralimanohar, Rajeev Balasubramonian, John Paul Strachan, Miao Hu, R.

There have been a number of proposals to prevent RH, but they either incur large area overhead, suffer from noticeable performance drop on adversarial memory access patterns, or provide probabilistic protection with no capability to detect attacks. In this paper, we propose a new counter-based RH prevention solution named Time Window Counter (TWiCe) based row refresh, which accurately detects potential RH attacks only using a small number of counters with a minimal performance impact. We first make a key observation that the number of rows that can cause RH is limited by the maximum values of row activation frequency and DRAM cell retention time. We calculate the maximum number of required counter entries per DRAM bank, with which TWiCe prevents RH with a strong deterministic guarantee. We leverage pseudo-associative cache design and separate the TWiCe table to further reduce area and energy overheads. TWiCe incurs no performance overhead on normal DRAM operations and less than 0.7% area and energy overheads over contemporary DRAM devices. Our evaluation shows that TWiCe makes no more than 0.006% of additional DRAM row activations for adversarial memory access patterns including RH attack scenarios.","author":["Eojin Lee","Ingab Kang","Sukhan Lee","G.

Existing methods for CWS usually rely on a large number of labeled sentences to train word segmentation models, which are expensive and time-consuming to annotate. Luckily, the unlabeled data is usually easy to collect and many high-quality Chinese lexicons are off-the-shelf, both of which can provide useful information for CWS. In this paper, we propose a neural approach for Chinese word segmentation which can exploit both lexicon and unlabeled data. Our approach is based on a variant of posterior regularization algorithm, and the unlabeled data and lexicon are incorporated into model training as indirect supervision by regularizing the prediction space of CWS models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios validate the effectiveness of our approach.","author":["Junxin Liu","Fangzhao Wu","Chuhan Wu","Yongfeng Huang","Xing Xie"],"issue":["WWW '19: The World Wide Web Conference","May 2019","Pages   3013\u20133019","https://doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313437"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Deng Cai, Hai Zhao, Zhisong Zhang, Yuan Xin, Yongjian Wu, and Feiyue Huang. 2017.

Network-on-Chips (NoCs) are the de facto on-chip communication fabrics for multi/many core systems because of their benefits over the traditional bus in terms of scalability, parallelism, and power efficiency [20]. Because of these properties of NoC, communication architecture for different layers of a deep neural network can be developed using NoC. However, traditional NoC architectures and strategies may not be suitable for running deep neural networks because of the different types of communication patterns (e.g. one-to-many and many-to-one communication between layers and zero communication within a single layer) in neural networks. Furthermore, because of the different communication patterns, computations of the different layers of a neural network need to be mapped in a way that reduces communication bottleneck in NoC. Therefore, we explore different NoC architectures and mapping solutions for deep neural networks, and then propose an efficient concentrated mesh NoC architecture and a load-balanced mapping solution (including mathematical model) for accelerating deep neural networks. We also present preliminary results to show the effectiveness of our proposed approaches to accelerate deep neural networks while achieving energy-efficient and high-performance NoC.","author":["Md Farhadur Reza","Paul Ampadu"],"issue":["NOCS '19: Proceedings of the 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip","October 2019","Article No.: 12","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3313231.3352377"],"date":"17 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"N.

Counterfeit electronics poses a security risk in safety critical applications like avionics, SCADA systems, and defense. It also affects the reputation of legitimate suppliers and causes financial losses. Hence, it becomes necessary to develop traceability solutions to ensure the integrity of supply chain, from the time of fabrication to the end of product-life, which allows a customer to verify the provenance of a device or a system. In this article, we present an IC traceability solution based on blockchain. A blockchain is a public immutable database that maintains a continuously growing list of data records secured from tampering and revision. Over the lifetime of an IC, all ownership transfer information is recorded and archived in a blockchain. This safe, verifiable method prevents any party from altering or challenging the legitimacy of the information being exchanged. However, a chain of sales record is not enough to ensure provenance of an IC. There is a need for clone-proof method for securely binding the identity of an IC to the blockchain information. In this article, we propose a method of IC supply chain traceability via blockchain pegged to embedded physically unclonable function (PUF). The blockchain provides ownership transfer record, while the PUF provides unique identification for an IC allowing it to be linked uniquely to a blockchain. Our proposed solution automates hardware and software protocols using blockchain-powered Smart Contract that allows supply chain participants to authenticate, track, trace, analyze, and provision chips throughout their entire life cycle.","author":["Md Nazmul Islam","Sandip Kundu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 24","Issue 3","June 2019","Article No.: 36","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3315669"],"date":"05 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"Md Nazmul Islam. 2018.

Among several optimization models, multi-swarm approach has been proposed most recently for balancing the exploration and exploitation capability through the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The proposed multi-swarm model which is called Meeting Room Approach (MRA), is tested and evaluated based on solving normal and large-scale problems. In the current research, the feasibility of the proposed Multi-Swarm Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) is adopted to simulate mechanical engineering problem namely pressure vessel design (PVD). The results indicated the potential of the proposed MPSO model on simulating the PVD problem with optimum solution over the standalone PSO. Further, the current study results authenticated against other famous meta-heuristics models. Overall, MPSO reported an excellent optimization solution with fast convergence learning process.","author":["Sinan Q. Salih","AbdulRahman A.

This is a welcome improvement especially for datacenter servers running modern data-intensive applications. Nonetheless, for such servers to fully benefit from the increasing capacity, the bandwidth of interconnects between processors and these devices must also increase proportionally, which becomes ever costlier under unabating physical constraints. As a promising alternative to tackle this challenge cost-effectively, a heterogeneous computing paradigm referred to as near-data processing (NDP) has emerged. However, NDP has not yet been widely adopted by the industry because of significant gaps between existing software stacks and demanded ones for NDP-capable memory and storage devices. Aiming to overcome the gaps, we propose to turn memory and storage devices into familiar heterogeneous distributed computing systems. Then, we demonstrate potentials of such computing systems for existing data-intensive applications with two recently implemented NDP-capable devices. Finally, we conclude with a practical blueprint to exploit the NDP-based computing systems for speeding up solving future computer-aided design and optimization problems.","author":["Nam Sung Kim","Pankaj Mehra"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 22","Pages   1\u20134","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3323484"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"R.

Several excellent deep learning (DL) frameworks including Tensorflow, MxNet and PyTorch have been made open-sourced, further accelerating the advance of the community. However, existing DL frameworks are not designed for applications involving high-dimensional sparse data, which exists widely in many successful online businesses such as search engine, recommender systems and online advertising. In these industrial scenarios, deep models are typically trained on large scale datasets with up to billions of sparse features and hundreds of billions of samples, bringing great challenges to DL framework. In this paper, we introduce a high-performance, large-scale and distributed DL framework named XDL which provides an elegant solution to fill the gap between general design of existing DL frameworks and industrial requirements arising from high-dimensional sparse data. Since 2016, XDL has been successfully deployed in Alibaba, serving many productions such as online advertising and recommender system. Running on hundreds of GPU cards in parallel, XDL can train deep models with tens of billions parameters within only several hours. Besides its excellent performance and flexibility, XDL is also friendly to developers. Algorithm scientists in Alibaba can develop and deploy new deep models with only several lines of simple codes. The XDL API and a reference implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license in December, 2018 and are available at https://github.com/alibaba/xdeeplearning.","author":["Biye Jiang","Chao Deng","Huimin Yi","Zelin Hu","Guorui Zhou","Yang Zheng","Sui Huang","Xinyang Guo","Dongyue Wang","Yue Song","Liqin Zhao","Zhi Wang","Peng Sun","Yu Zhang","Di Zhang","Jinhui Li","Jian Xu","Xiaoqiang Zhu","Kun Gai"],"issue":["DLP-KDD '19: Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Deep Learning Practice for High-Dimensional Sparse Data","August 2019","Article No.: 6","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/3326937.3341255"],"date":"05 August 2019","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, et al.

Current approaches to parallelizing training primarily use intra-batch parallelization, where a single iteration of training is split over the available workers, but suffer from diminishing returns at higher worker counts. We present PipeDream, a system that adds inter-batch pipelining to intra-batch parallelism to further improve parallel training throughput, helping to better overlap computation with communication and reduce the amount of communication when possible. Unlike traditional pipelining, DNN training is bi-directional, where a forward pass through the computation graph is followed by a backward pass that uses state and intermediate data computed during the forward pass. Na\u00efve pipelining can thus result in mismatches in state versions used in the forward and backward passes, or excessive pipeline flushes and lower hardware efficiency. To address these challenges, PipeDream versions model parameters for numerically correct gradient computations, and schedules forward and backward passes of different minibatches concurrently on different workers with minimal pipeline stalls. PipeDream also automatically partitions DNN layers among workers to balance work and minimize communication. Extensive experimentation with a range of DNN tasks, models, and hardware configurations shows that PipeDream trains models to high accuracy up to 5.3X faster than commonly used intra-batch parallelism techniques.","author":["Deepak Narayanan","Aaron Harlap","Amar Phanishayee","Vivek Seshadri","Nikhil R.

Those applications usually are band-width hungry. Fortunately, the data of those applications can be split into multiple blocks with different priorities making it possible to reduce the bandwidth consumption by prioritizing some blocks over others. However, the existing transport layer is too primitive to accomplish that. So those applications are forced to build their own customized and complex wheels. In this work, we propose Deadline-aware Transport Protocol (DTP) to provide deliver-before-deadline service. The application expresses the deadline and metadata of the data to DTP. Then DTP tries to meet the requirement by scheduling blocks. Compared to existing protocols, DTP provides meaningful service and reduces the burden of the application developer.","author":["Hang Shi","Yong Cui","Feng Qian","Yuming Hu"],"issue":["APNet '19: Proceedings of the 3rd Asia-Pacific Workshop on Networking 2019","August 2019","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.1145/3343180.3343191"],"date":"17 August 2019","ref":[{"text":"Yong Cui, Tianxiang Li, Cong Liu, Xingwei Wang, and Mirja K\u00fchlewind. 2017.

We consider electronic sytems consisting of a hardware platform and software layers. We consider the three major constituents of hardware that consume energy, namely computation, communication, and storage units, and we review methods of reducing their energy consumption. We also study models for analyzing the energy cost of software, and methods for energy-efficient software design and compilation.\nThis survery is organized around three main phases of a system design: conceptualization and modeling design and implementation, and runtime management. For each phase, we review recent techniques for energy-efficient design of both hardware and software.","author":["Luca Benini","Giovanni de Micheli"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 5","Issue 2","April 2000","pp   115\u2013192","https://doi.org/10.1145/335043.335044"],"date":"01 April 2000","ref":[{"text":"ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, 1998.

For this purpose, one might consider to use of the Apriori algorithm, but the algorithm needs major conversion, because none of these statistical metrics are anti-monotone, and the use of higher support for reducing the search space cannot guarantee solutions in its the search space. We here present a method of estimating a tight upper bound on the statistical metric associated with any superset of an itemset, as well as the novel use of the resulting information of upper bounds to prune unproductive supersets while traversing itemset lattices. Experimental tests demonstrate the efficiency of this method.","author":["Shinichi Morishita","Jun Sese"],"issue":["PODS '00: Proceedings of the nineteenth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems","May 2000","Pages   226\u2013236","https://doi.org/10.1145/335168.335226"],"date":"01 May 2000","ref":[{"text":"C.

Modern tensors feature a wide range of data sparsity, with the density of non-zero elements ranging from 10-6% to 50%. This paper proposes a novel approach to accelerate tensor kernels based on the principle of hierarchical elimination of computation in the presence of sparsity. This approach relies on rapidly finding intersections---situations where both operands of a multiplication are non-zero---enabling new data fetching mechanisms and avoiding memory latency overheads associated with sparse kernels implemented in software. We propose the ExTensor accelerator, which builds these novel ideas on handling sparsity into hardware to enable better bandwidth utilization and compute throughput. We evaluate ExTensor on several kernels relative to industry libraries (Intel MKL) and state-of-the-art tensor algebra compilers (TACO). When bandwidth normalized, we demonstrate an average speedup of 3.4\u00d7, 1.3\u00d7, 2.8\u00d7, 24.9\u00d7, and 2.7\u00d7 on SpMSpM, SpMM, TTV, TTM, and SDDMM kernels respectively over a server class CPU.","author":["Kartik Hegde","Hadi Asghari-Moghaddam","Michael Pellauer","Neal Crago","Aamer Jaleel","Edgar Solomonik","Joel Emer","Christopher W.

However, harvested energy is intrinsically unstable. While Field-programmable Gate Array (FPGAs) have been widely adopted in various embedded systems, it is hard to survive unstable power since all the memory components in FPGA are based on volatile Static Random-access Memory (SRAMs). The emerging non-volatile memory-based FPGAs provide promising potentials to keep configuration data on the chip during power outages. Few works have considered implementing efficient runtime intermediate data checkpoint on non-volatile FPGAs. To realize accumulative computation under intermittent power on FPGA, this article proposes a low-cost design framework, Data-Flow-Tracking FPGA (DFT-FPGA), which utilizes binary counters to track intermediate data flow. Instead of keeping all on-chip intermediate data, DFT-FPGA only targets on necessary data that is labeled by off-line analysis and identified by an online tracking system. The evaluation shows that compared with state-of-the-art techniques, DFT-FPGA can realize accumulative computing with less off-line workload and significantly reduce online roll-back time and resource utilization.","author":["Xinyi Zhang","Clay Patterson","Yongpan Liu","Chengmo Yang","Chun Jason Xue","Jingtong Hu"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 16","Issue 3","July 2020","Article No.: 26","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/3371392"],"date":"01 July 2020","ref":[{"text":"Xiaowei Xu, Yukun Ding, Sharon Xiaobo Hu, Michael Niemier, Jason Cong, Yu Hu, and Yiyu Shi. 2018.

In addition to improving FPGA performance, toolchains for the development of FPGAs in OpenCL that reduce the amount of programming effort required have been developed and offered by FPGA vendors. These improvements reveal the possibility of implementing a concept that enables on-the-fly offloading of computational loads at which CPUs/GPUs perform poorly compared to FPGAs while moving data with low latency. We think that this concept is key to improving the performance of heterogeneous supercomputers that use accelerators such as the GPU. In this paper, we propose an approach for GPU--FPGA accelerated computing with the OpenCL programming framework that is based on the OpenCL-enabled GPU--FPGA DMA method and the FPGA-to-FPGA communication method. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can enable GPUs and FPGAs to work together over different nodes.","author":["Ryohei Kobayashi","Norihisa Fujita","Yoshiki Yamaguchi","Ayumi Nakamichi","Taisuke Boku"],"issue":["HPCAsia2020: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing in Asia-Pacific Region Workshops","January 2020","Pages   17\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/3373271.3373275"],"date":"15 January 2020","ref":[{"text":"[n.d.].

However, to increase the quality of predictions and render machine learning solutions feasible for more complex applications, a substantial amount of training data is required. Although small machine learning models can be trained with modest amounts of data, the input for training larger models such as neural networks grows exponentially with the number of parameters. Since the demand for processing training data has outpaced the increase in computation power of computing machinery, there is a need for distributing the machine learning workload across multiple machines, and turning the centralized into a distributed system. These distributed systems present new challenges: first and foremost, the efficient parallelization of the training process and the creation of a coherent model. This article provides an extensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in the field by outlining the challenges and opportunities of distributed machine learning over conventional (centralized) machine learning, discussing the techniques used for distributed machine learning, and providing an overview of the systems that are available.","author":["Joost Verbraeken","Matthijs Wolting","Jonathan Katzy","Jeroen Kloppenburg","Tim Verbelen","Jan S.

On the purpose of challenging these problems, we propose a new surrogate-based multiobjective optimization algorithm that does not require a large evaluation budget. It is called Multiobjective Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (MOTPE) and is an extension of the tree-structured Parzen estimator widely used to solve expensive single-objective optimization problems. Our empirical evidences reveal that MOTPE can approximate Pareto fronts of many benchmark problems better than existing methods with a limited budget.

As existing knowledge graph information is continuously created and grown, it is a curial task to determine whether the information in knowledge graph is correct and to complete the missing information. In response to this challenge, the researchers proposed a number of graph convolutional network (GCN)-based models to characterize knowledge graphs. The state-of-the-art model is R-GCN, which can effectively extract features. This paper deeply studies the algorithm ideas and results of the R-GCN model, explores whether the model can be further optimized in entity classification and link prediction, and finally, improves the original model and proposes a relational aggregation graph convolutional network. Specifically, this paper finds that a subset of the set of entities may be directly connected to a central entity. All the entities in this subset possess partially identical attributes. At the same time, the relationships between these entities and the central entity may be similar. These similar attributes and relationships can be abstractly aggregated into virtual entities and virtual relationships, respectively, to better extract the topological relationship features. This paper uses the FB15k dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed model on knowledge graph completion tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed RA-GCN model achieves a certain level improvement compared with the original model and that it can extract knowledge graph topological relationship characteristics more effectively.","author":["Anqi Tian","Chunhong Zhang","Miao Rang","Xueying Yang","Zhiqiang Zhan"],"issue":["ICMLC 2020: Proceedings of the 2020 12th International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing","February 2020","Pages   580\u2013586","https://doi.org/10.1145/3383972.3384067"],"date":"15 February 2020","ref":[{"text":"Bhagat, S., Cormode, G., and Muthukrishnan, S. 2011.

In ONNs, phases of light are modulated through Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs), and MZIs are connected in a gridlike layout to implement multiply-accumulate operations. However, ONNs are very sensitive to process variations and thermal effects. This sensitivity leads to a significant degradation of inference accuracy of ONNs and thus renders them unusable in practice. In this paper, we propose a framework to calibrate process variations and counter thermal effects by power compensation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can recover the inference accuracy under variations and thermal effects, e.g., from as low as 11.05% back to 74.11% for LeNet-5 on Cifar10, so that ONNs can achieve an inference accuracy similar to the accuracy after software training while providing their high bandwidth in neuromorphic computing.","author":["Ying Zhu","Grace Li Zhang","Bing Li","Xunzhao Yin","Cheng Zhuo","Huaxi Gu","Tsung-Yi Ho","Ulf Schlichtmann"],"issue":["ICCAD '20: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2020","Article No.: 152","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.1145/3400302.3415682"],"date":"17 December 2020","ref":[{"text":"M.

These applications are usually hosted in the untrusted cloud computing infrastructure. This poses significant security risks since these applications rely on applying machine learning algorithms on large datasets which may contain private and sensitive information. To tackle this challenge, we designed secureTF, a distributed secure machine learning framework based on Tensorflow for the untrusted cloud infrastructure. secureTF is a generic platform to support unmodified TensorFlow applications, while providing end-to-end security for the input data, ML model, and application code. secureTF is built from ground-up based on the security properties provided by Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, it extends the trust of a volatile memory region (or secure enclave) provided by the single node TEE to secure a distributed infrastructure required for supporting unmodified stateful machine learning applications running in the cloud. The paper reports on our experiences about the system design choices and the system deployment in production use-cases. We conclude with the lessons learned based on the limitations of our commercially available platform, and discuss open research problems for the future work.","author":["Do Le Quoc","Franz Gregor","Sergei Arnautov","Roland Kunkel","Pramod Bhatotia","Christof Fetzer"],"issue":["Middleware '20: Proceedings of the 21st International Middleware Conference","December 2020","Pages   44\u201359","https://doi.org/10.1145/3423211.3425687"],"date":"11 December 2020","ref":[{"text":"Alpine Linux. https://alpinelinux.org/.

There are still some unique problem complexities and challenges that require advanced approaches. In recent years, deep learning enabled anomaly detection, i.e., deep anomaly detection, has emerged as a critical direction. This article surveys the research of deep anomaly detection with a comprehensive taxonomy, covering advancements in 3 high-level categories and 11 fine-grained categories of the methods. We review their key intuitions, objective functions, underlying assumptions, advantages, and disadvantages and discuss how they address the aforementioned challenges. We further discuss a set of possible future opportunities and new perspectives on addressing the challenges.","author":["Guansong Pang","Chunhua Shen","Longbing Cao","Anton Van Den Hengel"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 54","Issue 2","March 2022","Article No.: 38","pp   1\u201338","https://doi.org/10.1145/3439950"],"date":"05 March 2021","ref":[{"text":"Davide Abati, Angelo Porrello, Simone Calderara, and Rita Cucchiara. 2019.

First, a model of the multiprocessor architecture is described, incorporating parameters defining I/O, CPU, and message transmission times that permit calculation of the execution times of these algorithms. Then, three join algorithms are presented and compared. It is shown that, for a given configuration, each algorithm has an application domain defined by the characteristics of the operand and result relations. Since a semijoin operator is useful for decreasing I/O and transmission times in a multiprocessor system, we present and compare two equi-semijoin algorithms and one non-equi-semijoin algorithm. The execution times of these algorithms are generally linearly proportional to the size of the operand and result relations, and inversely proportional to the number of processors. We then compare a method which consists of joining two relations to a method whereby one joins their semijoins. Finally, it is shown that the latter method, using semijoins, is generally better. The various algorithms presented are implemented in the SABRE database system; an evaluation model selects the best algorithm for performing a join according to the results presented here. A first version of the SABRE system is currently operational at INRIA.","author":["Patrick Valduriez","Georges Gardarin"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Database Systems","Volume 9","Issue 1","March 1984","pp   133\u2013161","https://doi.org/10.1145/348.318590"],"date":"23 March 1984","ref":[{"text":"AUER, H.

Properties are described as Haskell functions, and can be automatically tested on random input, but it is also possible to define custom test data generators. We present a number of case studies, in which the tool was successfully used, and also point out some pitfalls to avoid. Random testing is especially suitable for functional programs because properties can be stated at a fine grain. When a function is built from separately tested components, then random testing suffices to obtain good coverage of the definition under test.","author":["Koen Claessen","John Hughes"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 35","Issue 9","Sept. 2000","pp   268\u2013279","https://doi.org/10.1145/357766.351266"],"date":"01 September 2000","ref":[{"text":"S.

Improvements to a circuit's speed, area and power consumption are sought through modifications to the transistor sizes in the circuit; no changes in the circuit structure, number of gates or clocking are introduced. Linear algorithms are presented for computing optimal transistor sizes to minimize delay, area or power. These algorithms are implemented in an interactive tool, Aesop. Aesop is a powerful and fast \u201cwhat-if\u201d tool that allows the designer to explore the space of designs having optimal transistor sizes. When compared to manual designs, the circuits produced by Aesop are typically faster or have substantially lower area and power consumption. Compared to untuned circuits, Aesop typically increases circuit speed by a factor of 2 to 4. Alternatively, power consumption and transistor area can be reduced by 25 \u2014 50% with no sacrifice in circuit speed. These improvements are computed interactively on a professional workstation for circuits containing thousands of transistors.","author":["K. S.

In designing our compression method, we have compromised between two important goals: high compression ratio and fast random access ability, and have tried to minimize the overhead caused during run-time reconstruction. Our compression technique is suitable for applications wherein data are accessed in a somewhat unpredictable fashion, and real-time performance of decompression is necessary. The experimental results on three different kinds of 3D images from medical imaging, image-based rendering, and solid texture mapping suggest that the compression method can be used effectively in developing real-time applications that must handle large volume data, made of color samples taken in three- or higher-dimensional space.","author":["Chandrajit Bajaj","Insung Ihm","Sanghun Park"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 20","Issue 1","Jan. 2001","pp   10\u201338","https://doi.org/10.1145/383745.383747"],"date":"01 January 2001","ref":[{"text":"AHO, A., SETHI, R., AND ULLMAN, J. 1986.

Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) Analysis is a very powerful tool for the modeling of electromagnetic phenomena. The algorithm is computationally intensive and simulations can run for a few hours to several days. Increasing the computation speed and decreasing the run times of this algorithm would bring greater productivity and new avenues of research to many facets of electrical engineering.The algorithm is transferred to custom FPGA-based hardware using a pipelined bit-serial arithmetic architecture. A one-dimensional resonator is used to verify the implementation and explore the hardware speed and costs. The computational speed is extremely fast and is not related to the number of computational cells in the simulation. Finally, a discussion of future research is presented.","author":["Ryan N.

When the number of physical compute pages is smaller than the number of virtual compute pages in the abstract computation graph, the design is time-multiplexed onto the available physical hardware. A key component of this strategy is an automatic scheduler that selects the temporal sequencing of virtual resources onto the physical device. We describe a quasi-static scheduling strategy that retains the full semantic power of the dynamic SCORE flow graph while taking advantage of static scheduling techniques at program load time to hoist most of the computational work out of the inner scheduling loops. This strategy reduces online scheduling work per reconfiguration epoch by an order of magnitude. In addition, a more global perspective available from offline-scheduling improves schedule quality, resulting in a net reduction of total execution time by 46--81%.","author":["Yury Markovskiy","Eylon Caspi","Randy Huang","Joseph Yeh","Michael Chu","John Wawrzynek","Andr\u00e9 DeHon"],"issue":["FPGA '02: Proceedings of the 2002 ACM/SIGDA tenth international symposium on Field-programmable gate arrays","February 2002","Pages   196\u2013205","https://doi.org/10.1145/503048.503077"],"date":"24 February 2002","ref":[{"text":"S.S.Bhattacharyya,P.K.Murthy,and E.A.Lee.

World space is subdivided according to a fixed size 3-D orthogonal grid. Rays are traced using ray-points which move along the rays, referencing the voxels intersected. One processor is assigned per ray, as well as one processor per object fragment.\nA pointerless data structure called an induced octree is used. This structure exists only as an ordering of the data in processor-address space, yet with it, all processors can determine the jump-distance to the nearest non-empty voxel in parallel to within a power of two. Ray-points move by large jumps whenever possible, and ray-object intersection proceeds in log time in the average ray length. Sorting via the network is the parallel analogue to octree-traversal.\nA code-scheduling mechanism is introduced which improves processor usage for SIMD architectures.\nPreliminary results are presented for an implementation using a CM-1 CPU equipped with 16k processors.","author":["H.

An efficient terminal alignment heuristic for delay minimization is employed to further optimize the delay of the circuit in the routing phase.

Several new optimistic concurrency control techniques for objects in decentralized distributed systems are described here, their correctness and optimality properties are proved, and the circumstances under which each is likely to be useful are characterized.Unlike many methods that classify operations only as Reads or Writes, these techniques systematically exploit type-specific properties of objects to validate more interleavings. Necessary and sufficient validation conditions can be derived directly from an object's data type specification. These techniques are also modular: they can be applied selectively on a per-object (or even per-operation) basis in conjunction with standard pessimistic techniques such as two-phase locking, permitting optimistic methods to be introduced exactly where they will be most effective.These techniques can be used to reduce the algorithmic complexity of achieving high levels of concurrency, since certain scheduling decisions that are NP-complete for pessimistic schedulers can be validated after the fact in time, independent of the level of concurrency. These techniques can also enhance the availability of replicated data, circumventing certain tradeoffs between concurrency and availability imposed by comparable pessimistic techniques.","author":["M.

This is achieved by refinement of a general purpose static analyzer and later adaptation to particular programs of the family by the end-user through parametrization. This is applied to the proof of soundness of data manipulation operations at the machine level for periodic synchronous safety critical embedded software.The main novelties are the design principle of static analyzers by refinement and adaptation through parametrization (Sect. 3 and 7), the symbolic manipulation of expressions to improve the precision of abstract transfer functions (Sect. 6.3), the octagon (Sect. 6.2.2), ellipsoid (Sect. 6.2.3), and decision tree (Sect. 6.2.4) abstract domains, all with sound handling of rounding errors in oating point computations, widening strategies (with thresholds: Sect. 7.1.2, delayed: Sect. 7.1.3) and the automatic determination of the parameters (parametrized packing: Sect. 7.2).","author":["Bruno Blanchet","Patrick Cousot","Radhia Cousot","J\u00e9rome Feret","Laurent Mauborgne","Antoine Min\u00e9","David Monniaux","Xavier Rival"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 38","Issue 5","May 2003","pp   196\u2013207","https://doi.org/10.1145/780822.781153"],"date":"09 May 2003","ref":[{"text":"S.

Although earlier studies of directed search focused on keyword search, most of the search behavior we observed did not involve keyword search. Instead of jumping directly to their information target using keywords, our participants navigated to their target with small, local steps using their contextual knowledge as a guide, even when they knew exactly what they were looking for in advance. This stepping behavior was especially common for participants with unstructured information organization. The observed advantages of searching by taking small steps include that it allowed users to specify less of their information need and provided a context in which to understand their results. We discuss the implications of such advantages for the design of personal information management tools.","author":["Jaime Teevan","Christine Alvarado","Mark S. Ackerman","David R.

As more OLTP databases are stored mostly or entirely in memory, transactional throughput is less and less limited by disk IO, and lock managers increasingly become performance bottlenecks.In this paper, we introduce very lightweight locking (VLL), an alternative approach to pessimistic concurrency control for main-memory database systems that avoids almost all overhead associated with traditional lock manager operations. We also propose a protocol called selective contention analysis (SCA), which enables systems implementing VLL to achieve high transactional throughput under high contention workloads. We implement these protocols both in a traditional single-machine multi-core database server setting and in a distributed database where data is partitioned across many commodity machines in a shared-nothing cluster. Our experiments show that VLL dramatically reduces locking overhead and thereby increases transactional throughput in both settings.","author":["Kun Ren","Alexander Thomson","Daniel J.

This decoupled approach results in significant duplication of functionality, such as aggregation and filters, and misses tremendous opportunities for cross-layer optimizations. In this paper, we present the case for an integrated Data Visualization Management System (DVMS) based on a declarative visualization language that fully compiles the end-to-end visualization pipeline into a set of relational algebra queries. Thus the DVMS can be both expressive via the visualization language, and performant by lever-aging traditional and visualization-specific optimizations to scale interactive visualizations to massive datasets.","author":["Eugene Wu","Leilani Battle","Samuel R.

These statistics may be derived from sensitive user data and, hence, necessitate privacy preservation. A notable paradigm for offering strong privacy guarantees in statistics publishing is \u03b5-differential privacy. However, there is limited literature that adapts this concept to settings where the statistics are computed over an infinite stream of \"events\" (i.e., data items generated by the users), and published periodically. These works aim at hiding a single event over the entire stream. We argue that, in most practical scenarios, sensitive information is revealed from multiple events occurring at contiguous time instances. Towards this end, we put forth the novel notion of w-event privacy over infinite streams, which protects any event sequence occurring in w successive time instants. We first formulate our privacy concept, motivate its importance, and introduce a methodology for achieving it. We next design two instantiations, whose utility is independent of the stream length. Finally, we confirm the practicality of our solutions experimenting with real data.","author":["Georgios Kellaris","Stavros Papadopoulos","Xiaokui Xiao","Dimitris Papadias"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 12","August 2014","pp   1155\u20131166","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732977.2732989"],"date":"01 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"HCUP net. http://hcupnet.ahrq.gov/.","order":1},{"text":"informaservizi.it. http://apprendistato.informaservizi.it/.","order":2},{"text":"People Talking About This. www.insidefacebook.com/2012/01/10/people-talking-about-this-defined/.","order":3},{"text":"J.

Despite many recent advances from both academia and industry, these two problems are still far from settled. In this paper, we present Fuxi, a resource management and job scheduling system that is capable of handling the kind of workload at Alibaba where hundreds of terabytes of data are generated and analyzed everyday to help optimize the company's business operations and user experiences. We employ several novel techniques to enable Fuxi to perform efficient scheduling of hundreds of thousands of concurrent tasks over large clusters with thousands of nodes: 1) an incremental resource management protocol that supports multi-dimensional resource allocation and data locality; 2) user-transparent failure recovery where failures of any Fuxi components will not impact the execution of user jobs; and 3) an effective detection mechanism and a multi-level blacklisting scheme that prevents them from affecting job execution. Our evaluation results demonstrate that 95% and 91% scheduled CPU/memory utilization can be fulfilled under synthetic workloads, and Fuxi is capable of achieving 2.36T-B/minute throughput in GraySort. Additionally, the same Fuxi job only experiences approximately 16% slowdown under a 5% fault-injection rate. The slowdown only grows to 20% when we double the fault-injection rate to 10%. Fuxi has been deployed in our production environment since 2009, and it now manages hundreds of thousands of server nodes.","author":["Zhuo Zhang","Chao Li","Yangyu Tao","Renyu Yang","Hong Tang","Jie Xu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 13","August 2014","pp   1393\u20131404","https://doi.org/10.14778/2733004.2733012"],"date":"01 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"Alibaba Cloud Computing. http://www.aliyun.com/.","order":1},{"text":"Apache Tez. http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/tez/.","order":2},{"text":"Cgroup. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups.","order":3},{"text":"Fuxi. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fu_Xi.","order":4},{"text":"Google Petabyte Result. http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2008/11/24/google-sorts-1-petabyte-of-data-in-6-hours/.","order":5},{"text":"ODPS: Open Data Processing Service. http://www.aliyun.com/product/odps/.","order":6},{"text":"Sort Benchmark. http://sortbenchmark.org/.","order":7},{"text":"Hadoop at Yahoo!

A question is: do we need to know the final exact answer for a large graph? When it is impossible to know the exact answer in a limited time, is it possible to approximate the final answer in an automatic and systematic way without having to designing new approximate algorithms? The main idea behind the question is: it is more important to find out something meaningful quick from a large graph, and we should focus on finding a way of making use of large graphs instead of spending time on designing approximate algorithms. In this paper, we give an innovative approach which automatically and systematically synthesizes a program to approximate the original program. We show that we can give users some answers with reasonable accuracy and high efficiency for a wide spectrum of graph algorithms, without having to know the details of graph algorithms. We have conducted extensive experimental studies using many graph algorithms that are supported in the existing graph systems and large real graphs. Our extensive experimental results reveal that our automatically approximating approach is highly feasible.","author":["Zechao Shang","Jeffrey Xu Yu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 14","October 2014","pp   1833\u20131844","https://doi.org/10.14778/2733085.2733090"],"date":"01 October 2014","ref":[{"text":"S.

As such, we consider the problem of discovering topical phrases of mixed lengths. Existing work either performs post processing to the results of unigram-based topic models, or utilizes complex n-gram-discovery topic models. These methods generally produce low-quality topical phrases or suffer from poor scalability on even moderately-sized datasets. We propose a different approach that is both computationally efficient and effective. Our solution combines a novel phrase mining framework to segment a document into single and multi-word phrases, and a new topic model that operates on the induced document partition. Our approach discovers high quality topical phrases with negligible extra cost to the bag-of-words topic model in a variety of datasets including research publication titles, abstracts, reviews, and news articles.","author":["Ahmed El-Kishky","Yanglei Song","Chi Wang","Clare R.

Recent names used for this problem include dealing with dark data and knowledge base construction (KBC). In this work, we describe DeepDive, a system that combines database and machine learning ideas to help develop KBC systems, and we present techniques to make the KBC process more efficient. We observe that the KBC process is iterative, and we develop techniques to incrementally produce inference results for KBC systems. We propose two methods for incremental inference, based respectively on sampling and variational techniques. We also study the tradeoff space of these methods and develop a simple rule-based optimizer. DeepDive includes all of these contributions, and we evaluate DeepDive on five KBC systems, showing that it can speed up KBC inference tasks by up to two orders of magnitude with negligible impact on quality.","author":["Jaeho Shin","Sen Wu","Feiran Wang","Christopher De Sa","Ce Zhang","Christopher R\u00e9"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 11","July 2015","pp   1310\u20131321","https://doi.org/10.14778/2809974.2809991"],"date":"01 July 2015","ref":[{"text":"U.

However, efficient parallelization of in-place radix sort is very challenging for two reasons. First, the initial phase of permuting elements into buckets suffers read-write dependency inherent in its in-place nature. Secondly, load balancing of the recursive application of the algorithm to the resulting buckets is difficult when the buckets are of very different sizes, which happens for skewed distributions of the input data. In this paper, we present a novel parallel in-place radix sort algorithm, PARADIS, which addresses both problems: a) \"speculative permutation\" solves the first problem by assigning multiple non-continuous array stripes to each processor. The resulting shared-nothing scheme achieves full parallelization. Since our speculative permutation is not complete, it is followed by a \"repair\" phase, which can again be done in parallel without any data sharing among the processors. b) \"distribution-adaptive load balancing\" solves the second problem. We dynamically allocate processors in the context of radix sort, so as to minimize the overall completion time. Our experimental results show that PARADIS offers excellent performance/scalability on a wide range of input data sets.","author":["Minsik Cho","Daniel Brand","Rajesh Bordawekar","Ulrich Finkler","Vincent Kulandaisamy","Ruchir Puri"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 12","August 2015","pp   1518\u20131529","https://doi.org/10.14778/2824032.2824050"],"date":"01 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"R.

This paper addresses the fundamental problem of designing a probabilistic data structure that can quickly process set queries using a small amount of memory. We propose a Shifting Bloom Filter (ShBF) framework for representing and querying sets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ShBF using three types of popular set queries: membership, association, and multiplicity queries. The key novelty of ShBF is on encoding the auxiliary information of a set element in a location offset. In contrast, prior BF based set data structures allocate additional memory to store auxiliary information. We conducted experiments using real-world network traces, and results show that ShBF significantly advances the state-of-the-art on all three types of set queries.","author":["Tong Yang","Alex X.

With growing memory sizes and memory prices dropping by a factor of 10 every 5 years, data having a \"primary home\" in memory is now a reality. Main-memory databases eschew many of the traditional architectural tenets of relational database systems that optimized for disk-resident data. Innovative approaches to fundamental issues such as concurrency control and query processing are required to unleash the full performance potential of main-memory databases. The tutorial is focused around design issues and architectural choices that must be made when building a high performance database system optimized for main-memory: data storage and indexing, concurrency control, durability and recovery techniques, query processing and compilation, support for high availability, and ability to support hybrid transactional and analytics workloads. This will be illustrated by example solutions drawn from four state-of-the-art systems: H-Store/VoltDB, Hekaton, HyPeR, and SAP HANA. The tutorial will also cover current and future research trends.","author":["Per-\u00c5ke Larson","Justin Levandoski"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 9","Issue 13","September 2016","pp   1609\u20131610","https://doi.org/10.14778/3007263.3007321"],"date":"01 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"S.

Data examples are partitioned to multiple workers and training is executed concurrently over different partitions, under various synchronization policies that emphasize speedup or convergence. Since models with millions and even billions of features become increasingly common nowadays, model management becomes an equally important task for effective training. In this paper, we present a general framework for parallelizing stochastic optimization algorithms over massive models that cannot fit in memory. We extend the lock-free HOGWILD!-family of algorithms to disk-resident models by vertically partitioning the model offline and asynchronously updating the resulting partitions online. Unlike HOGWILD!, concurrent requests to the common model are minimized by a preemptive push-based sharing mechanism that reduces the number of disk accesses. Experimental results on real and synthetic datasets show that the proposed framework achieves improved convergence over HOGWILD! and is the only solution scalable to massive models.","author":["Chengjie Qin","Martin Torres","Florin Rusu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 10","June 2017","pp   986\u2013997","https://doi.org/10.14778/3115404.3115405"],"date":"01 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

Buffering logs in central log store has recently faced a severe multicore scalability problem, and log flushing has been challenged by synchronous I/O delay. We have designed and implemented a fast and scalable logging method, Eleda, that can migrate a surge of transaction logs from volatile memory to stable storage without risking durable transaction atomicity. Our efficient implementation of Eleda is enabled by a highly concurrent data structure, Grasshopper, that eliminates a multicore scalability problem of centralized logging and enhances system utilization in the presence of synchronous I/O delay. We implemented Eleda and plugged it to WiredTiger and Shore-MT by replacing their log managers. Our evaluation showed that Eleda-based transaction systems improve performance up to 71 x, thus showing the applicability of Eleda.","author":["Hyungsoo Jung","Hyuck Han","Sooyong Kang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 2","October 2017","pp   135\u2013148","https://doi.org/10.14778/3149193.3149195"],"date":"01 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Amazon Web Services Inc.

ProbeSim estimates SimRank similarities without precomputing any indexing structures, and thus can naturally support real-time SimRank queries on dynamic graphs. Besides the theoretical guarantee, ProbeSim also offers satisfying practical efficiency and effectiveness due to non-trivial optimizations. We conduct extensive experiments on a number of benchmark datasets, which demonstrate that our solutions outperform the existing methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, our experiments include the first empirical study that evaluates the effectiveness of SimRank algorithms on graphs with billion edges, using the idea of pooling.","author":["Yu Liu","Bolong Zheng","Xiaodong He","Zhewei Wei","Xiaokui Xiao","Kai Zheng","Jiaheng Lu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 1","September 2017","pp   14\u201326","https://doi.org/10.14778/3151113.3151115"],"date":"01 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06955.","order":1},{"text":"http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html.","order":2},{"text":"http://law.di.unimi.it/datasets.php.","order":3},{"text":"I.

The latency of such pipelines can be improved by minimizing data movement, making stages faster, and merging stages. The throughput is determined by the stage with the smallest capacity and it can be improved by allocating enough parallel resources to each stage. In this paper we explore the possibility of employing hardware acceleration (an FPGA) as a way to improve the overall performance when computing answers to search queries. With a real use case as a baseline and motivation, we focus on accelerating the scoring function implemented as a decision tree ensemble, a common approach to scoring and classification in search systems. Our solution uses a novel decision tree ensemble implementation on an FPGA to: 1) increase the number of entries that can be scored per unit of time, and 2) provide a compact implementation that can be combined with previous stages. The resulting system, tested in Amazon F1 instances, significantly improves the quality of the search results and improves performance by two orders of magnitude over the existing CPU based solution.","author":["Muhsen Owaida","Gustavo Alonso","Laura Fogliarini","Anthony Hock-Koon","Pierre-Etienne Melet"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 13","Issue 1","September 2019","pp   71\u201385","https://doi.org/10.14778/3357377.3357383"],"date":"01 September 2019","ref":[{"text":"J.

We define a semantic chunk as the sequence of words that fills a semantic role defined in a semantic frame. It is straightforward to convert chunking into a tagging task using one of several IOB representations. Using this representation each word is tagged with I, which means that the word is inside a chunk, or with O, which means that the word is outside a chunk, or B, which means that the word is the beginning of a chunk. Tagging can also be seen as a multi-class classification problem. After recasting the multi-class problem as a number of binary-class problems, we use support vector machines to implement the binary classifiers. We explore two semantic chunking tasks. In the first task we simultaneously detect the target word and segments of semantic roles. In the second task, in addition, we label the semantic segments with their respective semantic role types. For both tasks, we present encouraging results of experiments carried out using the annotated FrameNet database.","author":["Kadri Hacioglu","Wayne Ward"],"issue":["NAACL-Short '03: Proceedings of the 2003 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Human Language Technology: companion volume of the Proceedings of HLT-NAACL 2003--short papers - Volume 2","May 2003","Pages   25\u201327","https://doi.org/10.3115/1073483.1073492"],"date":"27 May 2003","ref":[{"text":"Erin L.

Larger as the number of classes is, more severe the multi-class problem is. Especially, one-vs-rest method is apt to drop the performance by generating severe unbalanced class distribution. In this study, to tackle the problem, we take a two-phase named entity recognition method based on SVMs and dictionary; at the first phase, we try to identify each entity by a SVM classifier and post-process the identified entities by a simple dictionary look-up; at the second phase, we try to classify the semantic class of the identified entity by SVMs. By dividing the task into two subtasks, i.e. the entity identification and the semantic classification, the unbalanced class distribution problem can be alleviated. Furthermore, we can select the features relevant to each task and take an alternative classification method according to the task. The experimental results on the GENIA corpus show that the proposed method is effective not only in the reduction of training cost but also in performance improvement: the identification performance is about 79.9(F\u03b2 = 1), the semantic classification accuracy is about 66.5(F\u03b2 = 1).","author":["Ki-Joong Lee","Young-Sook Hwang","Hae-Chang Rim"],"issue":["BioMed '03: Proceedings of the ACL 2003 workshop on Natural language processing in biomedicine - Volume 13","July 2003","Pages   33\u201340","https://doi.org/10.3115/1118958.1118963"],"date":"11 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"N.

Major barriers to building a high-performing word sense disambiguation system include the difficulty of labeling data for this task and of predicting fine-grained sense distinctions. These issues stem partly from the fact that the task is being treated in isolation from possible uses of automatically disambiguated data. In this paper, we consider the related task of word translation, where we wish to determine the correct translation of a word from context. We can use parallel language corpora as a large supply of partially labeled data for this task. We present algorithms for solving the word translation problem and demonstrate a significant improvement over a baseline system. We then show that the word-translation system can be used to improve performance on a simplified machine-translation task and can effectively and accurately prune the set of candidate translations for a word.","author":["David Vickrey","Luke Biewald","Marc Teyssier","Daphne Koller"],"issue":["HLT '05: Proceedings of the conference on Human Language Technology and Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing","October 2005","Pages   771\u2013778","https://doi.org/10.3115/1220575.1220672"],"date":"06 October 2005","ref":[{"text":"A.

Most approaches to deidentification rely heavily on dictionaries and heuristic rules; these approaches fail to remove most personal health information (PHI) that cannot be found in dictionaries. They also can fail to remove PHI that is ambiguous between PHI and non-PHI.Named entity recognition (NER) technologies can be used for deidentification. Some of these technologies exploit both local and global context of a word to identify its entity type. When documents are grammatically written, global context can improve NER.In this paper, we show that we can deidentify medical discharge summaries using support vector machines that rely on a statistical representation of local context. We compare our approach with three different systems. Comparison with a rule-based approach shows that a statistical representation of local context contributes more to deidentification than dictionaries and hand-tailored heuristics. Comparison with two well-known systems, SNoW and IdentiFinder, shows that when the language of documents is fragmented, local context contributes more to deidentification than global context.","author":["Tawanda Sibanda","Ozlem Uzuner"],"issue":["HLT-NAACL '06: Proceedings of the main conference on Human Language Technology Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association of Computational Linguistics","June 2006","Pages   65\u201373","https://doi.org/10.3115/1220835.1220844"],"date":"04 June 2006","ref":[{"text":"J.

We study the structure of these forests with respect to optimality of sharing, and in relation with the parsing schema used to produce them. In addition to a theoretical and experimental framework for studying these issues, the main results presented are:- sophistication in chart parsing schemata (e.g. use of look-ahed) may reduce time and space efficiency instead of improving it,- there is a shared forest structure with at most cubic size for any CF grammar,- when O(n3) complexity is required, the shape of a shared forest is dependent on the parsing schema used.Though analyzed on CF grammars for simplicity, these results extend to more complex formalisms such as unification based grammars.","author":["Sylvie Billot","Bernard Lang"],"issue":["ACL '89: Proceedings of the 27th annual meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics","June 1989","Pages   143\u2013151","https://doi.org/10.3115/981623.981641"],"date":"26 June 1989","ref":[{"text":"Aho, A.

We propose a word sense disambiguation-based method for locating sentences in which designated words carry specific senses, and apply a collocation-based method for selecting distractors that are necessary for multiple-choice cloze items. Experimental results indicate that our system was able to produce a usable item for every 1.6 items it returned. We also attempt to measure distance between sounds of words by considering phonetic features of the words. With the help of voice synthesizers, we were able to assist the task of composing listening cloze items. By providing both reading and listening cloze items, we would like to offer a somewhat adaptive system for assisting Taiwanese children in learning English vocabulary.","author":["Chao-Lin Liu","Chun-Hung Wang","Zhao-Ming Gao","Shang-Ming Huang"],"issue":["EdAppsNLP 05: Proceedings of the second workshop on Building Educational Applications Using NLP","June 2005","Pages   1\u20138"],"date":"01 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,","order":1},{"text":"A.M.
