They can be represented as binary trees that recursively split a multi-class classification task into a system of dichotomies and provide a statistically sound way of applying two-class learning algorithms to multi-class problems (assuming these algorithms generate class probability estimates). However, there are usually many candidate trees for a given problem and in the standard approach the choice of a particular tree is based on domain knowledge that may not be available in practice. An alternative is to treat every system of nested dichotomies as equally likely and to form an ensemble classifier based on this assumption. We show that this approach produces more accurate classifications than applying C4.5 and logistic regression directly to multi-class problems. Our results also show that ensembles of nested dichotomies produce more accurate classifiers than pairwise classification if both techniques are used with C4.5, and comparable results for logistic regression. Compared to error-correcting output codes, they are preferable if logistic regression is used, and comparable in the case of C4.5. An additional benefit is that they generate class probability estimates. Consequently they appear to be a good general-purpose method for applying binary classifiers to multi-class problems.","author":["Eibe Frank","Stefan Kramer"],"issue":["ICML '04: Proceedings of the twenty-first international conference on Machine learning","July 2004","https://doi.org/10.1145/1015330.1015363"],"date":"04 July 2004","ref":[{"text":"Allwein, E., Schapire, R., & Singer, Y.

These systems are not equipped with virtual memory. A small memory space called an execution buffer is allocated to page an application. An application-specific page manager manages the buffer. The manager is generated by a compiler post-pass and combined with the application image. Our compiler post-pass analyzes the ELF executable image of an application and transforms function call/return instructions into calls to the page manager. As a result, each function of the code can be loaded into memory on demand at run time. To minimize the overhead of demand paging, code clustering algorithms are also presented. We evaluate our techniques with five embedded applications. We show that our approach can reduce the code memory size by 33% on average with reasonable performance degradation (8-20%) and energy consumption (10% more on average) for low-end embedded systems.","author":["Chanik Park","Junghee Lim","Kiwon Kwon","Jaejin Lee","Sang Lyul Min"],"issue":["EMSOFT '04: Proceedings of the 4th ACM international conference on Embedded software","September 2004","Pages   114\u2013124","https://doi.org/10.1145/1017753.1017775"],"date":"27 September 2004","ref":[{"text":"Andrew W.

On the other hand, the implementation of such operations must pay attention to conflicts on the storage representation levels below. To meet these requirements in a layered architecture, we propose a multilevel transaction management utilizing layer-specific semantics. Based on the theoretical notion of multilevel serializability, a family of concurrency control strategies is developed. Suitable recovery protocols are investigated for aborting single transactions and for restarting the system after a crash. The choice of levels involved in a multilevel transaction strategy reveals an inherent trade-off between     increased concurrency and growing recovery costs. A series of measurements has been performed in order to compare several strategies. Preliminary results indicate considerable performance gains of the multilevel transaction approach.","author":["Gerhard Weikum"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Database Systems","Volume 16","Issue 1","March 1991","pp   132\u2013180","https://doi.org/10.1145/103140.103145"],"date":"01 March 1991","ref":[{"text":"AGRAWAL, R., C~EY, M.

We identified the source of the problem, eliminated the problem, and \"closed the loop\" by demonstrating up to a factor of 2 improvement in application performance. We present our methodology and provide insight into performance analysis that is immediately applicable to other large-scale supercomputers.","author":["Fabrizio Petrini","Darren J.

We collected month-long aggregated traffic logs for different traffic groups from seven major ISPs in Japan in order to analyze the macro-level impact of residential broad-band traffic. These traffic groups are carefully selected to be summable, and not to count the same traffic multiple times.Our results show that (1) the aggregated residential broad-band customer traffic in our data exceeds 100Gbps on average. Our data is considered to cover 41% of the total customer traffic in Japan, thus we can estimate that the total residential broadband traffic in Japan is currently about 250Gbps in total. (2) About 70% of the residential broadband traffic is constant all the time. The rest of the traffic has a daily fluctuation pattern with the peak in the evening hours. The behavior of residential broadband traffic deviates considerably from academic or office traffic. (3) The total traffic volume of the residential users is much higher than that of office users, so backbone traffic is dominated by the behavior of the residential user traffic. (4) The traffic volume exchanged through domestic private peering is comparable with the volume exchanged through the major IXes. (5) Within external traffic of ISPs, international traffic is about 23% for inbound and about 17% for outbound. (6) The distribution of the regional broadband traffic is roughly proportional to the regional population.We expect other countries will experience similar traffic patterns as residential broadband access becomes widespread.","author":["Kensuke Fukuda","Kenjiro Cho","Hiroshi Esaki"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 35","Issue 1","January 2005","pp   15\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/1052812.1052820"],"date":"01 January 2005","ref":[{"text":"ABILENE aggregate traffic statistics. http://abilene. internet2.edu/observatory/summary-view.html.","order":1},{"text":"Cisco Sampled NetFlow. http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios120/120newft/120limit/120s/120s11/12s_sanf.htm.","order":2},{"text":"A.

In order to classify a packet as belonging to a particular flow or set of flows, network nodes must perform a search over a set of filters using multiple fields of the packet as the search key. In general, there have been two major threads of research addressing packet classification, algorithmic and architectural. A few pioneering groups of researchers posed the problem, provided complexity bounds, and offered a collection of algorithmic solutions. Subsequently, the design space has been vigorously explored by many offering new algorithms and improvements on existing algorithms. Given the inability of early algorithms to meet performance constraints imposed by high speed links, researchers in industry and academia devised architectural solutions to the problem. This thread of research produced the most widely-used packet classification device technology, Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM). New architectural research combines intelligent algorithms and novel architectures to eliminate many of the unfavorable characteristics of current TCAMs. We observe that the community appears to be converging on a combined algorithmic and architectural approach to the problem. Using a taxonomy based on the high-level approach to the problem and a minimal set of running examples, we provide a survey of the seminal and recent solutions to the problem. It is our hope to foster a deeper understanding of the various packet classification techniques while providing a useful framework for discerning relationships and distinctions.","author":["David E.

In this article, we propose Automatic Locality-Improving Storage (ALIS), an introspective storage system that automatically reorganizes selected disk blocks based on the dynamic reference stream to increase effective storage performance. ALIS is based on the observations that sequential data fetch is far more efficient than random access, that improving seek distances produces only marginal performance improvements, and that the increasingly powerful processors and large memories in storage systems have ample capacity to reorganize the data layout and redirect the accesses so as to take advantage of rapid sequential data transfer. Using trace-driven simulation with a large set of real workloads, we demonstrate that ALIS considerably outperforms prior techniques, improving the average read performance by up to 50% for server workloads and by about 15% for personal computer workloads. We also show that the performance improvement persists as disk technology evolves. Since disk performance in practice is increasing by only about 8% per year, the benefit of ALIS may correspond to as much as several years of technological progress.","author":["Windsor W.

The classic Two-Phase Commit protocol blocks if the coordinator fails. Fault-tolerant consensus algorithms also reach agreement, but do not block whenever any majority of the processes are working. The Paxos Commit algorithm runs a Paxos consensus algorithm on the commit/abort decision of each participant to obtain a transaction commit protocol that uses 2F + 1 coordinators and makes progress if at least F + 1 of them are working properly. Paxos Commit has the same stable-storage write delay, and can be implemented to have the same message delay in the fault-free case as Two-Phase Commit, but it uses more messages. The classic Two-Phase Commit algorithm is obtained as the special F = 0 case of the Paxos Commit algorithm.","author":["Jim Gray","Leslie Lamport"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Database Systems","Volume 31","Issue 1","March 2006","pp   133\u2013160","https://doi.org/10.1145/1132863.1132867"],"date":"01 March 2006","ref":[{"text":"Aguilera, M.

Network-on-chip (NoC) research addresses global communication in SoC, involving (i) a move from computation-centric to communication-centric design and (ii) the implementation of scalable communication structures. This survey presents a perspective on existing NoC research. We define the following abstractions: system, network adapter, network, and link to explain and structure the fundamental concepts. First, research relating to the actual network design is reviewed. Then system level design and modeling are discussed. We also evaluate performance analysis techniques. The research shows that NoC constitutes a unification of current trends of intrachip communication rather than an explicit new alternative.","author":["Tobias Bjerregaard","Shankar Mahadevan"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 38","Issue 1","2006","pp   1\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.1145/1132952.1132953"],"date":"29 June 2006","ref":[{"text":"Agarwal, A. 1999.

The development of a family of new index representations has led to a wide range of innovations in index storage, index construction, and query evaluation. While some of these developments have been consolidated in textbooks, many specific techniques are not widely known or the textbook descriptions are out of date. In this tutorial, we introduce the key techniques in the area, describing both a core implementation and how the core can be enhanced through a range of extensions. We conclude with a comprehensive bibliography of text indexing literature.","author":["Justin Zobel","Alistair Moffat"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 38","Issue 2","2006","pp   6\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.1145/1132956.1132959"],"date":"25 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"Anh, V.

Although diffraction places a limit on the product of spatial and angular resolution in these light fields, we can nevertheless produce useful perspective views and focal stacks from them. Since microscopes are inherently orthographic devices, perspective views represent a new way to look at microscopic specimens. The ability to create focal stacks from a single photograph allows moving or light-sensitive specimens to be recorded. Applying 3D deconvolution to these focal stacks, we can produce a set of cross sections, which can be visualized using volume rendering. In this paper, we demonstrate a prototype light field microscope (LFM), analyze its optical performance, and show perspective views, focal stacks, and reconstructed volumes for a variety of biological specimens. We also show that synthetic focusing followed by 3D deconvolution is equivalent to applying limited-angle tomography directly to the 4D light field.","author":["Marc Levoy","Ren Ng","Andrew Adams","Matthew Footer","Mark Horowitz"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 25","Issue 3","July 2006","pp   924\u2013934","https://doi.org/10.1145/1141911.1141976"],"date":"01 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"Adelson, T., Wang, J.

However, the characteristics of MOS transistors in the subthreshold regime are significantly different from those in strong-inversion. This presents new challenges in design optimization, particularly in complex gates with stacks of transistors. In this paper, we demonstrate a new optimal sizing scheme for subthreshold designs which takes these issues into account. We derive a closed-form solution for the correct sizing of transistors in a stack, both in relation to other transistors in the stack, and to a single transistor with equivalent current drivability. Experimental results show that our framework provides a performance improvement of up to 13.5% over the conventional logical effort method on ISCAS benchmark circuits, while one component circuit demonstrated an improvement of 33.1%.","author":["John Keane","Hanyong Eom","Tae-Hyoung Kim","Sachin Sapatnekar","Chris Kim"],"issue":["DAC '06: Proceedings of the 43rd annual Design Automation Conference","July 2006","Pages   425\u2013428","https://doi.org/10.1145/1146909.1147022"],"date":"24 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"A.

The algorithms generate new schedules in a distributed manner via simple local changes to existing schedules. The class is parameterized by integers k\\geq 1. We show that algorithm k of our class achieves k/(k+2) of the capacity region, for every k\\geq 1. .The algorithms have small and constant worst-case overheads: in particular, algorithm k generates a new schedule using (a) time less than 4k+2 round-trip times between neighboring nodes in the network, and (b) at most three control transmissions by any given node, for any k. The control signals are explicitly specified, and face the same interference effects as normal data transmissions. Our class of distributed wireless scheduling algorithms are the first ones guaranteed to achieve any fixed fraction of the capacity region while using small and constant overheads that do not scale with network size. The parameter k explicitly captures the tradeoff between control overhead and scheduler throughput performance and provides a tuning knob protocol designers can use to harness this trade-off in practice.","author":["Sujay Sanghavi","Loc Bui","R.

But as for whether it can be used efficiently in scientific computing, many issues await further study. This paper first gives the design and implementation of a 64-bit stream processor, FT64 (Fei Teng 64), for scientific computing. The carrying out of 64-bit extension design and scientific computing oriented optimization are described in such aspects as instruction set architecture, stream controller, micro controller, ALU cluster, memory hierarchy and interconnection interface here. Second, two kinds of communications as message passing and stream communications are put forward. An interconnection based on the communications is designed for FT64-based high performance computers. Third, a novel stream programming language, SF95 (Stream FORTRAN95), and its compiler, SF95Compiler (Stream FORTRAN95 Compiler), are developed to facilitate the development of scientific applications. Finally, nine typical scientific application kernels are tested and the results show the efficiency of stream architecture for scientific computing.","author":["Xuejun Yang","Xiaobo Yan","Zuocheng Xing","Yu Deng","Jiang Jiang","Ying Zhang"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 35","Issue 2","May 2007","pp   210\u2013219","https://doi.org/10.1145/1273440.1250689"],"date":"09 June 2007","ref":[{"text":"Agrawal, S., Thies, W. and Amarasinghe, S.

A typical example is the web, which can be described by either the hyperlinks between web pages or the words occurring in web pages. When each view is represented as a graph, one may convexly combine the weight matrices or the discrete Laplacians for each graph, and then proceed with existing clustering or classification techniques. Such a solution might sound natural, but its underlying principle is not clear. Unlike this kind of methodology, we develop multiview spectral clustering via generalizing the normalized cut from a single view to multiple views. We further build multiview transductive inference on the basis of multiview spectral clustering. Our framework leads to a mixture of Markov chains defined on every graph. The experimental evaluation on real-world web classification demonstrates promising results that validate our method.","author":["Dengyong Zhou","Christopher J. C.

To assess the potential benefits of hardware tuning, we propose a framework that leverages synergistic interactions between recent advances in (a) sampling, (b) predictive modeling, and (c) optimization heuristics. This framework enables qualitatively new capabilities in analyzing the performance and power characteristics of adaptive microarchitectures. For the first time, we are able to simultaneously consider high temporal and comprehensive spatial adaptivity. In particular, we optimize efficiency for many, short adaptive intervals and identify the best configuration of 15 parameters, which define a space of 240B point.With frequent sub-application reconfiguration and a fully reconfigurable hardware substrate, adaptive microarchitectures achieve bips3/w efficiency gains of up to 5.3x (median 2.4x) relative to their static counterparts already optimized for a given application. This 5.3x efficiency gain is derived from a 1.6x performance gain and 0.8x power reduction. Although several applications achieve a significant fraction of their potential efficiency with as few as three adaptive parameters, the three most significant parameters differ across applications.

The main characteristics of this network -- including its logarithmic diameter, scalable aggregate bandwidth, and optimized routing technique- allow it to efficiently support the communication intensive nature of the application. We present a detailed hardware implementation of the routers and the network interfaces as well as the packet format and the routing algorithm. The latter is a parallelized version of the shortest path with deflection routing algorithm. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed network, a generic RTL VHDL description has been developed and synthesized with CMOS STMicroelectronics 0.18 \u03bcm technology.

FTL (Flash Translation Layer) is one of the most essential software components in NAND flash-based embedded devices as it allows to use legacy files systems by emulating the traditional block device interface on top of NAND flash memory. In this paper, we propose a novel FTL, called \u03bc-FTL. The main design goal of \u03bc-FTL is to reduce the memory foot-print as small as possible, while providing the best performance by supporting multiple mapping granularities based on variable-sized extents. The mapping information is managed by \u03bc-Tree, which offers an efficient index structure for NAND flash memory. Our evaluation results show that \u03bc-FTL significantly outperforms other block-mapped FTLs with the same memory size by up to 89.7%.","author":["Yong-Goo Lee","Dawoon Jung","Dongwon Kang","Jin-Soo Kim"],"issue":["EMSOFT '08: Proceedings of the 8th ACM international conference on Embedded software","October 2008","Pages   21\u201330","https://doi.org/10.1145/1450058.1450063"],"date":"19 October 2008","ref":[{"text":"DiskView, http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896650.aspx.","order":1},{"text":"DiskMon, http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896646.aspx.","order":2},{"text":"Samsung Elec. 2Gx8 Bit NAND Flash Memory (K9GAG08U1A), 2006.","order":3},{"text":"Samsung Elec. 2Gx8 Bit NAND Flash Memory (K9GAG08U0M-P), 2006.","order":4},{"text":"L.-P.

Three fundamental approaches to improving constraint propagation based on propagators as implementations of constraints are explored: keeping track of which propagators are at fixpoint, choosing which propagator to apply next, and how to combine several propagators for the same constraint.We show how idempotence reasoning and events help track fixpoints more accurately. We improve these methods by using them dynamically (taking into account current variable domains to improve accuracy). We define priority-based approaches to choosing a next propagator and show that dynamic priorities can improve propagation. We illustrate that the use of multiple propagators for the same constraint can be advantageous with priorities, and introduce staged propagators that combine the effects of multiple propagators with priorities for greater efficiency.","author":["Christian Schulte","Peter J.

This performance is constant whether the system is evaluated on Wikipedia articles or \"real world\" documents. This work has implications far beyond enriching documents with explanatory links. It can provide structured knowledge about any unstructured fragment of text.

In response to the third problem, a few experiments using natural-language-processing tools or statistical-language models have been carried out.

We show that an order of magnitude improvement in runtime can be obtained over MiniSAT (the best-in-class software based approach) by using a Virtex-4 (XC4VFX140) FPGA device.

While the problem is impossible to solve in the general case, we have created a machine that avoids the general-purpose programmability that leads to this impossibility result, yet is still programmable enough to handle a variety of critical operations such as public-key encryption and authentication. Through the application of our novel gate-level information flow tracking method, we show how all flows of information can be precisely tracked. From this foundation, we then describe how a class of architectures can be constructed, from the gates up, to completely capture all information flows and we measure the impact of doing so on the hardware implementation, the ISA, and the programmer.","author":["Mohit Tiwari","Hassan M.G.

Only 7.8 percent of the countries are responsible for 80 percent of the papers in the CHI proceedings, and the USA is clearly the country with most papers. But the success of a country or organization does not depend only on the number of accepted papers, but also on their quality. We present a ranking of countries and organizations based on the h index, an indicator that tries to balance the quantity and quality of scientific output based on a bibliometric analysis. The bibliometric analysis also allowed us to demonstrate the difficulty of judging quality. The papers acknowledged by the best paper award committee were not cited more often than a random sample of papers from the same years. The merit of the award is therefore unclear, and it might be worthwhile to allow the visitor to the conference to vote for the best paper.","author":["Christoph Bartneck","Jun Hu"],"issue":["CHI '09: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","April 2009","Pages   699\u2013708","https://doi.org/10.1145/1518701.1518810"],"date":"04 April 2009","ref":[{"text":"Greenberg, S. and Buxton, B.

Provisioning server storage is challenging. It requires optimizing for the performance, capacity, power and reliability needs of the expected workload, all while minimizing financial costs. In this paper we analyze a number of workload traces from servers in both large and small data centers, to decide whether and how SSDs should be used to support each. We analyze both complete replacement of disks by SSDs, as well as use of SSDs as an intermediate tier between disks and DRAM. We describe an automated tool that, given device models and a block-level trace of a workload, determines the least-cost storage configuration that will support the workload's performance, capacity, and fault-tolerance requirements. We found that replacing disks by SSDs is not a costeffective option for any of our workloads, due to the low capacity per dollar of SSDs. Depending on the workload, the capacity per dollar of SSDs needs to increase by a factor of 3-3000 for an SSD-based solution to break even with a diskbased solution. Thus, without a large increase in SSD capacity per dollar, only the smallest volumes, such as system boot volumes, can be cost-effectively migrated to SSDs. The benefit of using SSDs as an intermediate caching tier is also limited: fewer than 10% of our workloads can reduce provisioning costs by using an SSD tier at today's capacity per dollar, and fewer than 20% can do so at any SSD capacity per dollar. Although SSDs are much more energy-efficient than enterprise disks, the energy savings are outweighed by the hardware costs, and comparable energy savings are achievable with low-power SATA disks.","author":["Dushyanth Narayanan","Eno Thereska","Austin Donnelly","Sameh Elnikety","Antony Rowstron"],"issue":["EuroSys '09: Proceedings of the 4th ACM European conference on Computer systems","April 2009","Pages   145\u2013158","https://doi.org/10.1145/1519065.1519081"],"date":"01 April 2009","ref":[{"text":"Nitin Agrawal, Vijayan Prabhakaran, Ted Wobber, John D.

A large body of existing research explores the use of standalone AMPs in computationally challenging and data-intensive applications. AMPs are rapidly deployed as high-performance accelerators on clusters. In these settings, scheduling, communication and I/O are managed by generalpurpose processors (GPPs), while computation is off-loaded to AMPs. Design space exploration for the configuration and software stack of hybrid clusters of AMPs and GPPs is an open problem. In this paper, we explore this design space in an implementation of the popular MapReduce programming model. Our contributions are: An exploration of various design alternatives for hybrid asymmetric clusters of AMPs and GPPs; the adoption of a streaming approach to supporting MapReduce computations on clusters with asymmetric components; and adaptive schedulers that take into account individual component capabilities in asymmetric clusters. Throughout our design, we remove I/O bottlenecks, using double-buffering and asynchronous I/O. We present an evaluation of the design choices through experiments on a real cluster with MapReduce workloads of varying degrees of computation intensity. We find that in a cluster with resource-constrained and well-provisioned AMP accelerators, a streaming approach achieves 50.5% and 73.1% better performance compared to the non-streaming approach, respectively, and scales almost linearly with increasing number of compute nodes.We also show that our dynamic scheduling mechanisms adapt effectively the parameters of the scheduling policies between applications with different computation density.","author":["M.

In this paper, we make a case for a new approach to designing on-chip interconnection networks that eliminates the need for buffers for routing or flow control. We describe new algorithms for routing without using buffers in router input/output ports. We analyze the advantages and disadvantages of bufferless routing and discuss how router latency can be reduced by taking advantage of the fact that input/output buffers do not exist. Our evaluations show that routing without buffers significantly reduces the energy consumption of the on-chip cache/processor-to-cache network, while providing similar performance to that of existing buffered routing algorithms at low network utilization (i.e., on most real applications). We conclude that bufferless routing can be an attractive and energy-efficient design option for on-chip cache/processor-to-cache networks where network utilization is low.","author":["Thomas Moscibroda","Onur Mutlu"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 37","Issue 3","June 2009","pp   196\u2013207","https://doi.org/10.1145/1555815.1555781"],"date":"20 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"]]R.

However, BVHs adapt poorly to non-uniformly tessellated scenes, which leads to increased ray shooting costs. This paper presents a novel and practical BVH construction algorithm, which addresses the issue by utilizing spatial splitting similar to kD-trees. In contrast to previous preprocessing approaches, our method uses the surface area heuristic to control primitive splitting during tree construction. We show that our algorithm produces significantly more efficient hierarchies than other techniques. In addition, user parameters that directly influence splitting are eliminated, making the algorithm easily controllable.","author":["Martin Stich","Heiko Friedrich","Andreas Dietrich"],"issue":["HPG '09: Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Graphics 2009","August 2009","Pages   7\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/1572769.1572771"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"Bentley, J.

Compared with commodity CPUs, GPUs have an order of magnitude higher computation power as well as memory bandwidth. Moreover, new-generation GPUs allow writes to random memory locations, provide efficient interprocessor communication through on-chip local memory, and support a general purpose parallel programming model. Nevertheless, many of the GPU features are specialized for graphics processing, including the massively multithreaded architecture, the Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data processing style, and the execution model of a single application at a time. Additionally, GPUs rely on a bus of limited bandwidth to transfer data to and from the CPU, do not allow dynamic memory allocation from GPU kernels, and have little hardware support for write conflicts. Therefore, a careful design and implementation is required to utilize the GPU for coprocessing database queries.In this article, we present our design, implementation, and evaluation of an in-memory relational query coprocessing system, GDB, on the GPU. Taking advantage of the GPU hardware features, we design a set of highly optimized data-parallel primitives such as split and sort, and use these primitives to implement common relational query processing algorithms. Our algorithms utilize the high parallelism as well as the high memory bandwidth of the GPU, and use parallel computation and memory optimizations to effectively reduce memory stalls. Furthermore, we propose coprocessing techniques that take into account both the computation resources and the GPU-CPU data transfer cost so that each operator in a query can utilize suitable processors\u2014the CPU, the GPU, or both\u2014for an optimized overall performance. We have evaluated our GDB system on a machine with an Intel quad-core CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTX GPU. Our workloads include microbenchmark queries on memory-resident data as well as TPC-H queries that involve complex data types and multiple query operators on data sets larger than the GPU memory. Our results show that our GPU-based algorithms are 2--27x faster than their optimized CPU-based counterparts on in-memory data. Moreover, the performance of our coprocessing scheme is similar to, or better than, both the GPU-only and the CPU-only schemes.","author":["Bingsheng He","Mian Lu","Ke Yang","Rui Fang","Naga K.

In order for software to fully realize this potential, the step that maps computations to processing elements must be as automated as possible. However, the state-of-the-art approach is to rely on the programmer to specify this mapping manually and statically. This approach is not only labor intensive but also not adaptable to changes in runtime environments like problem sizes and hardware/software configurations. In this study, we propose adaptive mapping, a fully automatic technique to map computations to processing elements on a CPU+GPU machine. We have implemented it in our experimental heterogeneous programming system called Qilin. Our results show that, by judiciously distributing works over the CPU and GPU, automatic adaptive mapping achieves a 25% reduction in execution time and a 20% reduction in energy consumption than static mappings on average for a set of important computation benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our technique is able to adapt to changes in the input problem size and system configuration.","author":["Chi-Keung Luk","Sunpyo Hong","Hyesoon Kim"],"issue":["MICRO 42: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2009","Pages   45\u201355","https://doi.org/10.1145/1669112.1669121"],"date":"12 December 2009","ref":[{"text":"AMD.","order":1},{"text":"Arnold, M., Fink, S., Grove, D., Hind, M., and Sweeney, P.

It may occur whenever signals are being transmitted across asynchronous or unrelated clock domains. The impact of metastability is increasing as process geometries shrink and supply voltages drop faster than transistor Vts. FPGA technologies are significantly affected since leading edge FPGAs are amongst the first devices to adopt the most recent process nodes. In this paper, we present a comprehensive suite of techniques for modeling, characterizing and optimizing metastability effects in FPGAs. We first discuss a theoretical model of metastability, and verify the predictions using both circuit level simulations and board measurements. Next we show how designers have traditionally dealt with metastability problems and contrast that with the automatic CAD algorithms described in this paper that both analyze and optimize metastability-related issues. Through our detailed experimental results, we show that we can improve the metastability characteristics of a large suite of industrial benchmarks by an average of 268,000 times with our optimization techniques.","author":["Doris Chen","Deshanand Singh","Jeffrey Chromczak","David Lewis","Ryan Fung","David Neto","Vaughn Betz"],"issue":["FPGA '10: Proceedings of the 18th annual ACM/SIGDA international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2010","Pages   167\u2013176","https://doi.org/10.1145/1723112.1723142"],"date":"21 February 2010","ref":[{"text":"Altera.

The difficulty and importance of these problems have increased over the years, necessitating the use of preconditioning and near optimally converging iterative methods. However, the complexity of tuning or even using such methods has kept them outside the reach of many users. Responding to this problem, we have developed PRIMME, a comprehensive package that brings state-of-the-art methods from \u201cbleeding edge\u201d to production, with the best possible robustness, efficiency, and a flexible, yet highly usable interface that requires minimal or no tuning. We describe (1) the PRIMME multimethod framework that implements a variety of algorithms, including the near optimal methods GD+k and JDQMR; (2) a host of algorithmic innovations and implementation techniques that endow the software with its robustness and efficiency; (3) a multilayer interface that captures our experience and addresses the needs of both expert and end users.","author":["Andreas Stathopoulos","James R.

This paper lists alternative architectures to effect cloud computing for database applications and reports on the results of a comprehensive evaluation of existing commercial cloud services that have adopted these architectures. The focus of this work is on transaction processing (i.e., read and update workloads), rather than analytics or OLAP workloads, which have recently gained a great deal of attention. The results are surprising in several ways. Most importantly, it seems that all major vendors have adopted a different architecture for their cloud services. As a result, the cost and performance of the services vary significantly depending on the workload.","author":["Donald Kossmann","Tim Kraska","Simon Loesing"],"issue":["SIGMOD '10: Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data","June 2010","Pages   579\u2013590","https://doi.org/10.1145/1807167.1807231"],"date":"06 June 2010","ref":[{"text":"Amazon.

Problems with many of these technologies are due to such factors as process variations, defects and impurities in materials and solutions, and noise. Consequently, many systems built from these technologies operate imperfectly. Luckily there are many complex and large-market systems (applications) that tolerate acceptable though not always correct results. In addition, there is emerging a body of mathematical analysis related to imperfect computation. In this paper we first introduce the concepts of acceptable error-tolerance and acceptable performance degradation, and demonstrate how important attributes of these concepts can be quantified. We interlace this discussion with several examples of systems that can effectively employ these two concepts. Next we mention several immerging technologies that motivate the need to study these concepts as well as related mathematical paradigms. Finally we will list a few CAD issues that are needed to support this new form of technological revolution.","author":["Melvin Breuer"],"issue":["DAC '10: Proceedings of the 47th Design Automation Conference","June 2010","Pages   871\u2013876","https://doi.org/10.1145/1837274.1837493"],"date":"13 June 2010","ref":[{"text":"Boyle, P.

In particular, characteristics such as non-volatility, non-linearity, low power consumption, and good scalability make memristor one of the most promising emerging memory technologies. Some important design parameter, however, such as speed, energy consumption, and distingushiablility, are mainly determined by the memristor's physical characteristics. In this paper, a key observation of memristor's asymmetric energy consumption is made by the detailed analysis of the transient power consumption. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-element memory structure in which each memory cell consists of two memristors. By constantly writing complement bits into the two elements within a cell, the dual-element is flexible to satisfy design constraints which are usually difficult to be satisfied with one-cell memory structure. Design space of the dual-element memory cell is studied and it shows that the trade-offs among the energy, speed, and distingushiablility should be explored for different design objectives. In particular, we show that under the energy-driven optimization, the proposed dual-element memory achieves the same programming speed and distinguishability as conventional single-element memory but the energy consumption can be reduced by up to 80%.","author":["Dimin Niu","Yiran Chen","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["ISLPED '10: Proceedings of the 16th ACM/IEEE international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2010","Pages   25\u201330","https://doi.org/10.1145/1840845.1840851"],"date":"18 August 2010","ref":[{"text":"L.

During reprogramming, the number of radio transmissions should be minimized, since reprogramming time and energy depend chiefly on the number of radio transmissions. In this article, we present a multihop incremental reprogramming protocol called Zephyr that transfers the delta between old and new software versions, and lets the sensor nodes rebuild the new software using the received delta and the old software. Zephyr reduces the delta size by using application-level modifications to mitigate the effects of function shifts. Then it compares the two binary images at the byte level to generate a small delta, that is then sent over the wireless network to all the nodes. For the wide range of software change cases that we used as benchmarks, Zephyr transfers 1.83 to 1987 times less traffic through the network than Deluge (the standard nonincremental reprogramming protocol for TinyOS) and 1.14 to 49 times less traffic than an existing incremental reprogramming protocol by Jeong and Culler [2004].","author":["Rajesh Krishna Panta","Saurabh Bagchi","Samuel P.

These sensors include GPS sensors, vision sensors (i.e., cameras), audio sensors (i.e., microphones), light sensors, temperature sensors, direction sensors (i.e., magnetic compasses), and acceleration sensors (i.e., accelerometers). The availability of these sensors in mass-marketed communication devices creates exciting new opportunities for data mining and data mining applications. In this paper we describe and evaluate a system that uses phone-based accelerometers to perform activity recognition, a task which involves identifying the physical activity a user is performing. To implement our system we collected labeled accelerometer data from twenty-nine users as they performed daily activities such as walking, jogging, climbing stairs, sitting, and standing, and then aggregated this time series data into examples that summarize the user activity over 10- second intervals. We then used the resulting training data to induce a predictive model for activity recognition. This work is significant because the activity recognition model permits us to gain useful knowledge about the habits of millions of users passively---just by having them carry cell phones in their pockets. Our work has a wide range of applications, including automatic customization of the mobile device's behavior based upon a user's activity (e.g., sending calls directly to voicemail if a user is jogging) and generating a daily/weekly activity profile to determine if a user (perhaps an obese child) is performing a healthy amount of exercise.","author":["Jennifer R.

To date, all proposed chip-scale photonic interconnects have been based on the crystalline silicon platform for CMOS-compatible fabrication. However, maintaining CMOS compatibility does not preclude the use of other CMOS-compatible silicon materials such as silicon nitride and polycrystalline silicon. In this work, we investigate utilizing devices based on these deposited materials to design photonic networks with multiple layers of photonic devices. We apply rigorous device optimization and insertion loss analysis on various network architectures, demonstrating that multilayer photonic networks can exhibit dramatically lower total insertion loss, enabling unprecedented bandwidth scalability. We show that significant improvements in waveguide propagation and waveguide crossing insertion losses resulting from using these materials enables the realization of topologies that were previously not feasible using only the single-layer crystalline silicon approaches.","author":["Aleksandr Biberman","Kyle Preston","Gilbert Hendry","Nicol\u00e1s Sherwood-Droz","Johnnie Chan","Jacob S.

Recent studies have discovered that data so collected contain noises because current defect collection practices are based on optional bug fix keywords or bug report links in change logs. Automatically collected defect data based on the change logs could include noises. This paper proposes approaches to deal with the noise in defect data. First, we measure the impact of noise on defect prediction models and provide guidelines for acceptable noise level. We measure noise resistant ability of two well-known defect prediction algorithms and find that in general, for large defect datasets, adding FP (false positive) or FN (false negative) noises alone does not lead to substantial performance differences. However, the prediction performance decreases significantly when the dataset contains 20%-35% of both FP and FN noises. Second, we propose a noise detection and elimination algorithm to address this problem. Our empirical study shows that our algorithm can identify noisy instances with reasonable accuracy. In addition, after eliminating the noises using our algorithm, defect prediction accuracy is improved.","author":["Sunghun Kim","Hongyu Zhang","Rongxin Wu","Liang Gong"],"issue":["ICSE '11: Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Software Engineering","May 2011","Pages   481\u2013490","https://doi.org/10.1145/1985793.1985859"],"date":"21 May 2011","ref":[{"text":"J.

Most of prior research separately analyzes the meanings of the qualitative or quantitative features, and does not consider the categorical information when clustering financial reports. Since quantitative or qualitative features contain only partial information, there may be no synergy by considering them individually. It is more appropriate to predict stock price movements by simultaneously taking both quantitative and qualitative features into account. Therefore, in this study, we utilize a weighting scheme to combine both qualitative and quantitative features of financial reports together, and propose a method to predict short-term stock price movements. The proposed method employs the categorical information to localize the clusters and improve the purity of each resultant cluster. We gathered 26,255 reports of companies listed in the S&P 500 index from the EDGAR database and conducted the GICS (Global Industrial Classification System) experiments based on the industry sectors. The empirical evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms the SVM, na\u00efve Bayes, and PFHC methods in terms of accuracy and average profit.","author":["Ming-Chih Lin","Anthony J.

One of the major approaches, broadcast addressing, reduces the pin count by assigning a single control pin to multiple electrodes with mutually-compatible control signals. Prior works utilize this addressing scheme by minimally grouping electrode sets with non-conflict signal merging. However, merging control signals also introduces redundant actuations, which potentially cause a high power-consumption problem. Recent studies on PDMFBs have indicated that high power consumption not only decreases the product lifetime but also degrades the system reliability. Unfortunately, this power-aware design concern is still not readily available among current design automations of PDMFBs. To cope with these issues, we propose in this paper the first power-aware broadcast addressing for PDMFBs. Our algorithm simultaneously takes pin-count reduction and power-consumption minimization into consideration, thereby achieving higher integration and better design performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.","author":["Tsung-Wei Huang","Hong-Yan Su","Tsung-Yi Ho"],"issue":["DAC '11: Proceedings of the 48th Design Automation Conference","June 2011","Pages   741\u2013746","https://doi.org/10.1145/2024724.2024891"],"date":"05 June 2011","ref":[{"text":"K.

Modern GPUs have recently shown promising results in accelerating computationally challenging graph problems but their performance suffered heavily when the graph structure is highly irregular, as most real-world graphs tend to be. In this study, we first observe that the poor performance is caused by work imbalance and is an artifact of a discrepancy between the GPU programming model and the underlying GPU architecture.We then propose a novel virtual warp-centric programming method that exposes the traits of underlying GPU architectures to users. Our method significantly improves the performance of applications with heavily imbalanced workloads, and enables trade-offs between workload imbalance and ALU underutilization for fine-tuning the performance. Our evaluation reveals that our method exhibits up to 9x speedup over previous GPU algorithms and 12x over single thread CPU execution on irregular graphs. When properly configured, it also yields up to 30% improvement over previous GPU algorithms on regular graphs. In addition to performance gains on graph algorithms, our programming method achieves 1.3x to 15.1x speedup on a set of GPU benchmark applications. Our study also confirms that the performance gap between GPUs and other multi-threaded CPU graph implementations is primarily due to the large difference in memory bandwidth.","author":["Sungpack Hong","Sang Kyun Kim","Tayo Oguntebi","Kunle Olukotun"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 46","Issue 8","August 2011","pp   267\u2013276","https://doi.org/10.1145/2038037.1941590"],"date":"12 February 2011","ref":[{"text":"Stanford large network dataset collection. http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html, 2009.","order":1},{"text":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_200_Series, 2010.","order":2},{"text":"V.

A network flow is useful, and contributes to application throughput and operator revenue if, and only if, it completes within its deadline. Today's transport pro- tocols (TCP included), given their Internet origins, are agnostic to such flow deadlines. Instead, they strive to share network resources fairly. We show that this can hurt application performance.Motivated by these observations, and other (previously known) deficiencies of TCP in the datacenter environment, this paper presents the design and implementation of D3, a deadline-aware control protocol that is customized for the datacenter environment. D3 uses explicit rate control to apportion bandwidth according to flow deadlines. Evaluation from a 19-node, two-tier datacenter testbed shows that D3, even without any deadline information, easily outper- forms TCP in terms of short flow latency and burst tolerance. Further, by utilizing deadline information, D3 effectively doubles the peak load that the datacenter network cansupport.","author":["Christo Wilson","Hitesh Ballani","Thomas Karagiannis","Ant Rowtron"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 41","Issue 4","August 2011","pp   50\u201361","https://doi.org/10.1145/2043164.2018443"],"date":"15 August 2011","ref":[{"text":"H.

Emerging architectures feature different forms of parallelism. The Polyhedral Processes Networks (PPNs) are a proven model of choice for automated generation of pipeline and task parallel programs from sequential source code, however data parallelism is not addressed. In this paper, we present asystematic approach for identification and extraction of fine grain data parallelism from the PPN specification. The approach is implemented in a tool, called kpn2gpu, which produces fine-grain data parallel CUDA kernels for graphics processing units (GPUs). First experiments indicate that generated applications have a potential to exploit different forms of parallelism provided by the architecture and that kernels feature a highly regular structure that allows subsequent optimizations.","author":["Ana Balevic","Bart Kienhuis"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 39","Issue 4","September 2011","pp   66\u201371","https://doi.org/10.1145/2082156.2082173"],"date":"19 December 2011","ref":[{"text":"ACE Associated Compiler Experts bv.

However, data centers using modern server hardware face physical constraints in space and power, limiting further expansion and calling for improvements in the computational density per server and in the per-operation energy. Continuing to improve the computational resources of the cloud while staying within physical constraints mandates optimizing server efficiency to ensure that server hardware closely matches the needs of scale-out workloads. In this work, we introduce CloudSuite, a benchmark suite of emerging scale-out workloads. We use performance counters on modern servers to study scale-out workloads, finding that today's predominant processor micro-architecture is inefficient for running these workloads. We find that inefficiency comes from the mismatch between the workload needs and modern processors, particularly in the organization of instruction and data memory systems and the processor core micro-architecture. Moreover, while today's predominant micro-architecture is inefficient when executing scale-out workloads, we find that continuing the current trends will further exacerbate the inefficiency in the future. In this work, we identify the key micro-architectural needs of scale-out workloads, calling for a change in the trajectory of server processors that would lead to improved computational density and power efficiency in data centers.","author":["Michael Ferdman","Almutaz Adileh","Onur Kocberber","Stavros Volos","Mohammad Alisafaee","Djordje Jevdjic","Cansu Kaynak","Adrian Daniel Popescu","Anastasia Ailamaki","Babak Falsafi"],"issue":["ASPLOS XVII: Proceedings of the seventeenth international conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2012","Pages   37\u201348","https://doi.org/10.1145/2150976.2150982"],"date":"03 March 2012","ref":[{"text":"Anastassia Ailamaki, David J.

However, speech recognition is not yet advanced enough to provide people with a reliable listening typewriter. An aim of our experiments was to determine if an imperfect listening typewriter would be useful for composing letters. Participants dictated letters, either in isolated words or in consecutive word speech. They did this with simulations of listening typewriters that recognized either a limited vocabulary (1000 or 5000 words)or an unlimited vocabulary. Results suggest that some versions, even upon first using them, could be at least as good as traditional methods of handwriting and dictating. Isolated word speech with large vocabularies may provide the basis for a useful listening typewriter.","author":["John D.

Much work focuses on how to find substitutes for any given query. In this paper, we study how to efficiently process a keyword query whose substitutes are defined by a given taxonomy. This problem is challenging because each term in a query can have a large number of substitutes, and the original query can be rewritten into any of their combinations. We propose to build an additional index (besides inverted index) to efficiently process queries. For a query workload, we formulate an optimization problem which chooses the additional index structure, aiming at minimizing the query evaluation cost, under given index space constraints. We show the NP-hardness of the problem, and propose a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm using dynamic programming, as well as an 1 over 4(1-1/e)-approximation algorithm to solve the problem. Experimental results show that, with only 10% additional index space, our approach can greatly reduce the query evaluation cost.","author":["Bolin Ding","Haixun Wang","Ruoming Jin","Jiawei Han","Zhongyuan Wang"],"issue":["SIGMOD '12: Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","May 2012","Pages   493\u2013504","https://doi.org/10.1145/2213836.2213892"],"date":"20 May 2012","ref":[{"text":"H.

To ensure the functionality and reliability of flash memory, the pages containing address mapping information and other metadata should be carefully stored in flash memory. This paper presents Meta-Cure, a novel hardware and file system interface that transparently protects metadata in the presence of multi-bit faults. Meta-Cure exploits built-in ECC and replication in order to protect pages containing critical data. Redundant pairs are formed at run time and distributed to different physical pages to protect against failures. Meta-Cure requires no changes to the file system, on-chip hierarchy, or hardware implementation of flash memory chip. Experimental results show that the proposed technique can reduce uncorrectable page errors by 92% with less than 1% space overhead in comparison with conventional error correction techniques.","author":["Yi Wang","Luis Angel D.

As their utilization and bandwidth needs continue to grow, traditional methods of augmenting bandwidth have proven complex and costly in time and resources. Recent measurements show that data center traffic is often limited by congestion loss caused by short traffic bursts. Thus an attractive alternative to adding physical bandwidth is to augment wired links with wireless links in the 60 GHz band.We address two limitations with current 60 GHz wireless proposals. First, 60 GHz wireless links are limited by line-of-sight, and can be blocked by even small obstacles. Second, even beamforming links leak power, and potential interference will severely limit concurrent transmissions in dense data centers. We propose and evaluate a new wireless primitive for data centers, 3D beamforming, where 60 GHz signals bounce off data center ceilings, thus establishing indirect line-of-sight between any two racks in a data center. We build a small 3D beamforming testbed to demonstrate its ability to address both link blockage and link interference, thus improving link range and number of concurrent transmissions in the data center. In addition, we propose a simple link scheduler and use traffic simulations to show that these 3D links significantly expand wireless capacity compared to their 2D counterparts.","author":["Xia Zhou","Zengbin Zhang","Yibo Zhu","Yubo Li","Saipriya Kumar","Amin Vahdat","Ben Y.

In this paper, we address the emerging questions regarding the use of SCM. Based on an embedded platform that employs FeRAM, a type of SCM, we present our findings. In summary, by introducing SCM, power efficiency improves while performance is degraded. We also show that such performance degradations may be removed with operating system level schemes that fully exploit the characteristics of SCM. Finally, we present permanent computing that supports lightweight system on/off capabilities by using SCM.","author":["Seungjae Baek","Jongmoo Choi","Donghee Lee","Sam H.

In this article, we discuss the design challenges associated with spin-transfer torque (STT) MRAM in its state-of-the-art configuration. We propose an alternative bit cell configuration and three new genres of magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) structures to improve STT-MRAM bit cell stabilities, write endurance, and reduce write energy consumption. The proposed multi-port, multi-pillar MTJ structures offer the unique possibility of electrical and spatial isolation of memory read and write. In order to realize ultralow power under process variations, we propose device, bit-cell and architecture level design techniques. Such design alternatives at multiple levels of design abstraction has been found to achieve substantially enhanced robustness, density, reliability and low power as compared to their charge-based counterparts for future embedded applications.","author":["Niladri N.

Most of the previous approaches to realizing inexact circuits relied on scaling of circuit parameters (such as supply voltage) taking advantage of an application\u2019s error tolerance to achieve the cost and accuracy trade-offs, thus suffering from acute drawbacks of considerable implementation overheads that significantly reduced the gains. In this article, two novel design approaches called Probabilistic Pruning and Probabilistic Logic Minimization are proposed to realize inexact circuits with zero hardware overhead.Extensive simulations on various architectures of critical datapath elements demonstrate that each of the techniques can independently achieve normalized gains as large as 2x--9.5x in energy-delay-area product for relative error magnitude as low as 10\u2009\u2212\u20094%--8% compared to corresponding conventional correct circuits.","author":["Avinash Lingamneni","Christian Enz","Krishna Palem","Christian Piguet"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 12","Issue 2s","May 2013","Article No.: 93","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/2465787.2465795"],"date":"01 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"Alioto, M. and Palumbo, G. 2006.

The fast increasing size of the RF makes the area cost and power consumption unaffordable for traditional SRAM designs in the future technologies. In this paper, we propose to use embedded-DRAM (eDRAM) as an alternative in future GPGPUs. Compared with SRAM, eDRAM provides higher density and lower leakage power. However, the limited data retention time in eDRAM poses new challenges. Periodic refresh operations are needed to maintain data integrity. This is exacerbated with the scaling of eDRAM density, process variations and temperature. Unlike conventional CPUs which make use of multi-ported RF, most of the RFs in modern GPGPU are heavily banked but not multi-ported to reduce the hardware cost. This provides a unique opportunity to hide the refresh overhead. We propose two different eDRAM implementations based on 3T1D and 1T1C memory cells. To mitigate the impact of periodic refresh, we propose two novel refresh solutions using bank bubble and bank walk-through. Plus, for the 1T1C RF, we design an interleaved bank organization together with an intelligent warp scheduling strategy to reduce the impact of the destructive reads. The analysis shows that our schemes present better energy efficiency, scalability and variation tolerance than traditional SRAM-based designs.","author":["Naifeng Jing","Yao Shen","Yao Lu","Shrikanth Ganapathy","Zhigang Mao","Minyi Guo","Ramon Canal","Xiaoyao Liang"],"issue":["ISCA '13: Proceedings of the 40th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2013","Pages   344\u2013355","https://doi.org/10.1145/2485922.2485952"],"date":"23 June 2013","ref":[{"text":"Predictive Technology Model (PTM). http://ptm.asu.edu/.","order":1},{"text":"B.

Our approach leverages existing TV and cellular transmissions to eliminate the need for wires and batteries, thus enabling ubiquitous communication where devices can communicate among themselves at unprecedented scales and in locations that were previously inaccessible. To achieve this, we introduce ambient backscatter, a new communication primitive where devices communicate by backscattering ambient RF signals. Our design avoids the expensive process of generating radio waves; backscatter communication is orders of magnitude more power-efficient than traditional radio communication. Further, since it leverages the ambient RF signals that are already around us, it does not require a dedicated power infrastructure as in traditional backscatter communication. To show the feasibility of our design, we prototype ambient backscatter devices in hardware and achieve information rates of 1 kbps over distances of 2.5 feet and 1.5 feet, while operating outdoors and indoors respectively. We use our hardware prototype to implement proof-of-concepts for two previously infeasible ubiquitous communication applications.","author":["Vincent Liu","Aaron Parks","Vamsi Talla","Shyamnath Gollakota","David Wetherall","Joshua R.

While there are limited air-quality-monitor-stations in a city, air quality varies in urban spaces non-linearly and depends on multiple factors, such as meteorology, traffic volume, and land uses. In this paper, we infer the real-time and fine-grained air quality information throughout a city, based on the (historical and real-time) air quality data reported by existing monitor stations and a variety of data sources we observed in the city, such as meteorology, traffic flow, human mobility, structure of road networks, and point of interests (POIs). We propose a semi-supervised learning approach based on a co-training framework that consists of two separated classifiers. One is a spatial classifier based on an artificial neural network (ANN), which takes spatially-related features (e.g., the density of POIs and length of highways) as input to model the spatial correlation between air qualities of different locations. The other is a temporal classifier based on a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF), involving temporally-related features (e.g., traffic and meteorology) to model the temporal dependency of air quality in a location. We evaluated our approach with extensive experiments based on five real data sources obtained in Beijing and Shanghai. The results show the advantages of our method over four categories of baselines, including linear/Gaussian interpolations, classical dispersion models, well-known classification models like decision tree and CRF, and ANN.","author":["Yu Zheng","Furui Liu","Hsun-Ping Hsieh"],"issue":["KDD '13: Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2013","Pages   1436\u20131444","https://doi.org/10.1145/2487575.2488188"],"date":"11 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"A.

They are composed of large graphs of different stencil stages, as well as complex reductions, and stages with global or data-dependent access patterns. Because of their complex structure, the performance difference between a naive implementation of a pipeline and an optimized one is often an order of magnitude. Efficient implementations require optimization of both parallelism and locality, but due to the nature of stencils, there is a fundamental tension between parallelism, locality, and introducing redundant recomputation of shared values.We present a systematic model of the tradeoff space fundamental to stencil pipelines, a schedule representation which describes concrete points in this space for each stage in an image processing pipeline, and an optimizing compiler for the Halide image processing language that synthesizes high performance implementations from a Halide algorithm and a schedule. Combining this compiler with stochastic search over the space of schedules enables terse, composable programs to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of real image processing pipelines, and across different hardware architectures, including multicores with SIMD, and heterogeneous CPU+GPU execution. From simple Halide programs written in a few hours, we demonstrate performance up to 5x faster than hand-tuned C, intrinsics, and CUDA implementations optimized by experts over weeks or months, for image processing applications beyond the reach of past automatic compilers.","author":["Jonathan Ragan-Kelley","Connelly Barnes","Andrew Adams","Sylvain Paris","Fr\u00e9do Durand","Saman Amarasinghe"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 48","Issue 6","June 2013","pp   519\u2013530","https://doi.org/10.1145/2499370.2462176"],"date":"16 June 2013","ref":[{"text":"A.

Full detection and masking of soft errors is challenging, expensive, and, for some applications, unnecessary. For example, approximate computing applications (such as multimedia processing, machine learning, and big data analytics) can often naturally tolerate soft errors. We present Rely a programming language that enables developers to reason about the quantitative reliability of an application -- namely, the probability that it produces the correct result when executed on unreliable hardware. Rely allows developers to specify the reliability requirements for each value that a function produces. We present a static quantitative reliability analysis that verifies quantitative requirements on the reliability of an application, enabling a developer to perform sound and verified reliability engineering. The analysis takes a Rely program with a reliability specification and a hardware specification that characterizes the reliability of the underlying hardware components and verifies that the program satisfies its reliability specification when executed on the underlying unreliable hardware platform. We demonstrate the application of quantitative reliability analysis on six computations implemented in Rely.","author":["Michael Carbin","Sasa Misailovic","Martin C.

Our list includes: determining the feasibility of a system of bilinear equations, deciding whether a 3-tensor possesses a given eigenvalue, singular value, or spectral norm; approximating an eigenvalue, eigenvector, singular vector, or the spectral norm; and determining the rank or best rank-1 approximation of a 3-tensor. Furthermore, we show that restricting these problems to symmetric tensors does not alleviate their NP-hardness. We also explain how deciding nonnegative definiteness of a symmetric 4-tensor is NP-hard and how computing the combinatorial hyperdeterminant is NP-, #P-, and VNP-hard.","author":["Christopher J.

Due to the desire to process large graphs, these systems have emphasized the ability to run on distributed memory machines. Today, however, a single multicore server can support more than a terabyte of memory, which can fit graphs with tens or even hundreds of billions of edges. Furthermore, for graph algorithms, shared-memory multicores are generally significantly more efficient on a per core, per dollar, and per joule basis than distributed memory systems, and shared-memory algorithms tend to be simpler than their distributed counterparts.In this paper, we present a lightweight graph processing framework that is specific for shared-memory parallel/multicore machines, which makes graph traversal algorithms easy to write. The framework has two very simple routines, one for mapping over edges and one for mapping over vertices. Our routines can be applied to any subset of the vertices, which makes the framework useful for many graph traversal algorithms that operate on subsets of the vertices. Based on recent ideas used in a very fast algorithm for breadth-first search (BFS), our routines automatically adapt to the density of vertex sets. We implement several algorithms in this framework, including BFS, graph radii estimation, graph connectivity, betweenness centrality, PageRank and single-source shortest paths. Our algorithms expressed using this framework are very simple and concise, and perform almost as well as highly optimized code. Furthermore, they get good speedups on a 40-core machine and are significantly more efficient than previously reported results using graph frameworks on machines with many more cores.","author":["Julian Shun","Guy E.

But not all applications need high-precision storage for all of their data structures all of the time. This paper proposes mechanisms that enable applications to store data approximately and shows that doing so can improve the performance, lifetime, or density of solid-state memories. We propose two mechanisms. The first allows errors in multi-level cells by reducing the number of programming pulses used to write them. The second mechanism mitigates wear-out failures and extends memory endurance by mapping approximate data onto blocks that have exhausted their hardware error correction resources. Simulations show that reduced-precision writes in multi-level phase-change memory cells can be 1.7x faster on average and using failed blocks can improve array lifetime by 23% on average with quality loss under 10%.","author":["Adrian Sampson","Jacob Nelson","Karin Strauss","Luis Ceze"],"issue":["MICRO-46: Proceedings of the 46th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2013","Pages   25\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/2540708.2540712"],"date":"07 December 2013","ref":[{"text":"K.

If fewer pins were used to supply the same current, the wires and pins used for power delivery would have to carry larger currents over longer distances. This results in an \"IR-drop\" problem, where some of the voltage is dropped across the long resistive wires making up the power delivery network, and the eventual circuits experience fluctuations in their supplied voltage. The same problem also manifests if the pin count is the same, but the current draw is higher. IR-drop can be especially problematic in 3D DRAM devices because (i) low cost (few pins and TSVs) is a high priority, (ii) 3D-stacking increases current draw within the package without providing proportionate room for more pins, and (iii) TSVs add to the resistance of the power delivery network. This paper is the first to characterize the relationship between the power delivery network and the maximum supported activity in a 3D-stacked DRAM memory device. The design of the power delivery network determines if some banks can handle less activity than others. It also determines the combinations of bank activities that are permissible. Both of these attributes can feed into architectural policies. For example, if some banks can handle more activities than others, the architecture benefits by placing data from high-priority threads or data from frequently accessed pages into those banks. The memory controller can also derive higher performance if it schedules requests to specific combinations of banks that do not violate the IR-drop constraint. We first define an IR-drop-aware scheduler that encodes a number of activity constraints. This scheduler, however, falls short of the performance of an unrealistic ideal PDN that imposes no scheduling constraints by 4.6x. By addressing starvation phenomena in the scheduler, the gap is reduced to only 1.47x. Finally, by adding a dynamic page placement policy, performance is within 1.2x of the unrealistic ideal PDN. We thus show that architectural polices can help mitigate the limitations imposed by a cost constrained design.","author":["Manjunath Shevgoor","Jung-Sik Kim","Niladrish Chatterjee","Rajeev Balasubramonian","Al Davis","Aniruddha N.

Full detection and masking of soft errors is challenging, expensive, and, for some applications, unnecessary. For example, approximate computing applications (such as multimedia processing, machine learning, and big data analytics) can often naturally tolerate soft errors.We present Rely a programming language that enables developers to reason about the quantitative reliability of an application -- namely, the probability that it produces the correct result when executed on unreliable hardware. Rely allows developers to specify the reliability requirements for each value that a function produces.We present a static quantitative reliability analysis that verifies quantitative requirements on the reliability of an application, enabling a developer to perform sound and verified reliability engineering. The analysis takes a Rely program with a reliability specification and a hardware specification that characterizes the reliability of the underlying hardware components and verifies that the program satisfies its reliability specification when executed on the underlying unreliable hardware platform. We demonstrate the application of quantitative reliability analysis on six computations implemented in Rely.","author":["Michael Carbin","Sasa Misailovic","Martin C.

Given its promised ease-of-use and high performance, we took Xeon Phi out for a test drive. In this paper, we present this experience at two different levels: (1) the microbenchmark level, where we stress \"each nut and bolt\" of Phi in the lab, and (2) the application level, where we study Phi's performance response in a real-life environment. At the microbenchmarking level, we show the high performance of five components of the architecture, focusing on their maximum achieved performance and the prerequisites to achieve it. Next, we choose a medical imaging application (Leukocyte Tracking) as a case study. We observed that it is rather easy to get functional code and start benchmarking, but the first performance numbers can be far from satisfying. Our experience indicates that a simple data structure and massive parallelism are critical for Xeon Phi to perform well. When compiler-driven parallelization and/or vectorization fails, programming Xeon Phi for performance can become very challenging.","author":["Jianbin Fang","Henk Sips","LiLun Zhang","Chuanfu Xu","Yonggang Che","Ana Lucia Varbanescu"],"issue":["ICPE '14: Proceedings of the 5th ACM/SPEC international conference on Performance engineering","March 2014","Pages   137\u2013148","https://doi.org/10.1145/2568088.2576799"],"date":"22 March 2014","ref":[{"text":"R.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive thermal management approach to improve the lifetime reliability of multicore systems by considering both inter- and intra-application thermal variations. Fundamental to this approach is a reinforcement learning algorithm, which learns the relationship between the mapping of threads to cores, the frequency of a core and its temperature (sampled from on-board thermal sensors). Action is provided by overriding the operating system's mapping decisions using affinity masks and dynamically changing CPU frequency using in-kernel governors. Lifetime improvement is achieved by controlling not only the peak and average temperatures but also thermal cycling, which is an emerging wear-out concern in modern systems. The proposed approach is validated experimentally using an Intel quad-core platform executing a diverse set of multimedia benchmarks. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach minimizes average temperature, peak temperature and thermal cycling, improving the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) by an average of 2x for intra-application and 3x for inter-application scenarios when compared to existing thermal management techniques. Furthermore, the dynamic and static energy consumption are also reduced by an average 10% and 11% respectively.","author":["Anup Das","Rishad A. Shafik","Geoff V. Merrett","Bashir M.

Although there have been advances in WiFi-based positioning techniques, we find that existing solutions either require a dense deployment of access points (APs), manual fingerprinting, energy hungry WiFi scanning, or sophisticated AP hardware. We design SAIL using a single commodity WiFi AP to avoid these restrictions. SAIL computes the distance between the client and an AP using the propagation delay of the signal traversing between the two, combines the distance with smartphone dead-reckoning techniques, and employs geometric methods to ultimately yield the client's location using a single AP. SAIL combines physical layer (PHY) information and human motion to compute the propagation delay of the direct path by itself, eliminating the adverse effect of multipath and yielding sub-meter distance estimation accuracy. Furthermore, SAIL systematically addresses some of the common challenges towards dead-reckoning using smartphone sensors and achieves 2-5x accuracy improvements over existing techniques. We have implemented SAIL on commodity wireless APs and smartphones. Evaluation in a large-scale enterprise environment with 10 mobile users demonstrates that SAIL can capture the user's location with a mean error of 2.3m using just a single AP.","author":["Alex T.

Our main result is that for certain fundamental network problems such as minimum spanning tree, minimum cut, and shortest paths, quantum communication does not help in substantially speeding up distributed algorithms for these problems compared to the classical setting. In order to obtain this result, we extend the technique of Das Sarma et al. [SICOMP 2012] to obtain a uniform approach to prove non-trivial lower bounds for quantum distributed algorithms for several graph optimization (both exact and approximate versions) as well as verification problems, some of which are new even in the classical setting, e.g. tight randomized lower bounds for Hamiltonian cycle and spanning tree verification, answering an open problem of Das Sarma et al., and a lower bound in terms of the weight aspect ratio, matching the upper bounds of Elkin [STOC 2004]. Our approach introduces the Server model and Quantum Simulation Theorem which together provide a connection between distributed algorithms and communication complexity. The Server model is the standard two-party communication complexity model augmented with additional power; yet, most of the hardness in the two-party model is carried over to this new model. The Quantum Simulation Theorem carries this hardness further to quantum distributed computing. Our techniques, except the proof of the hardness in the Server model, require very little knowledge in quantum computing, and this can help overcoming a usual impediment in proving bounds on quantum distributed algorithms.

One of the fundamental challenges is to build robust firewalls for protecting OpenFlow-based networks where network states and traffic are frequently changed. To address this challenge, we introduce FlowGuard, a comprehensive framework, to facilitate not only accurate detection but also effective resolution of firewall policy violations in dynamic OpenFlow-based networks. FlowGuard checks network flow path spaces to detect firewall policy violations when network states are updated. In addition, FlowGuard conducts automatic and real-time violation resolutions with the help of several innovative resolution strategies designed for diverse network update situations. We also implement our framework and demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed detection and resolution approaches in FlowGuard through experiments with a real-world network topology.","author":["Hongxin Hu","Wonkyu Han","Gail-Joon Ahn","Ziming Zhao"],"issue":["HotSDN '14: Proceedings of the third workshop on Hot topics in software defined networking","August 2014","Pages   97\u2013102","https://doi.org/10.1145/2620728.2620749"],"date":"22 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"Floodlight: Open SDN Controller. http://www.projectfloodlight.org.","order":1},{"text":"Frenetic: A Family of Network Programming Languages. http://frenetic-lang.org/.","order":2},{"text":"Header Space Library. https://bitbucket.org/peymank/hassel-public.","order":3},{"text":"E.

Legacy systems that can provide such accuracy are either expensive or suffering from performance degradation resulting from various impacts, e.g., occlusion for computer vision based approaches. In this work, we present an RFID-based system, Tagoram, for object localization and tracking using COTS RFID tags and readers. Tracking mobile RFID tags in real time has been a daunting task, especially challenging for achieving high precision. Our system achieves these three goals by leveraging the phase value of the backscattered signal, provided by the COTS RFID readers, to estimate the location of the object. In Tagoram, we exploit the tag's mobility to build a virtual antenna array by using readings from a few physical antennas over a time window. To illustrate the basic idea of our system, we firstly focus on a simple scenario where the tag is moving along a fixed track known to the system. We propose Differential Augmented Hologram (DAH) which will facilitate the instant tracking of the mobile RFID tag to a high precision. We then devise a comprehensive solution to accurately recover the tag's moving trajectories and its locations, relaxing the assumption of knowing tag's track function in advance. We have implemented the Tagoram system using COTS RFID tags and readers. The system has been tested extensively in the lab environment and used for more than a year in real airline applications. For lab environment, we can track the mobile tags in real time with a millimeter accuracy to a median of 5mm and 7.29mm using linear and circular track respectively. In our year- long large scale baggage sortation systems deployed in two airports, our results from real deployments show that Tagoram can achieve a centimeter-level accuracy to a median of 6.35cm in these real deployments.","author":["Lei Yang","Yekui Chen","Xiang-Yang Li","Chaowei Xiao","Mo Li","Yunhao Liu"],"issue":["MobiCom '14: Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking","September 2014","Pages   237\u2013248","https://doi.org/10.1145/2639108.2639111"],"date":"07 September 2014","ref":[{"text":"J.

However, there are two important challenges inherent in the design of these systems that must be overcome if they are to be of practical use on commodity hardware. First, phase differences between the radio oscillators behind each antenna can make readings unusable, and so must be corrected in order for most techniques to yield high-fidelity results. Second, while the number of antennas on commodity access points is usually limited, most array processing increases in fidelity with more antennas. These issues work in synergistic opposition to array processing: without phase offset correction, no phase-difference array processing is possible, and with fewer antennas, automatic correction of these phase offsets becomes even more challenging. We present Phaser, a system that solves these intertwined problems to make phased array signal processing truly practical on the many WiFi access points deployed in the real world. Our experimental results on three- and five-antenna 802.11-based hardware show that 802.11 NICs can be calibrated and synchronized to a 20\u00b0 median phase error, enabling inexpensive deployment of numerous phase-difference based spectral analysis techniques previously only available on costly, special-purpose hardware.","author":["Jon Gjengset","Jie Xiong","Graeme McPhillips","Kyle Jamieson"],"issue":["MobiCom '14: Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking","September 2014","Pages   153\u2013164","https://doi.org/10.1145/2639108.2639139"],"date":"07 September 2014","ref":[{"text":"H.

To support detection by cameras, the frequencies and data rates are typically limited to below 1kHz and tens of bytes per second (Bps). In this paper, we present a technique for transmitting data from solid-state luminaries, used for interior ambient lighting, simultaneously to both cameras and low-power embedded devices in a manner that is imperceptible to occupants. This allows the camera communication VLC channel to also act as a higher speed downstream link and low-power wakeup mechanism for energy-constrained devices. Our approach uses Manchester encoding and Binary Frequency Shift Keying (BFSK) to modulate the high-speed data stream and applies duty-cycle adjustment to generate the slower camera communication signal. We explore the trade-off between the performance of the two communication channels. Our hybrid communication protocol is also compatible with existing IR receivers. This allows lights to communicate with low-cost commodity chipsets and control home appliances such as TVs, AV receivers, AC window units, etc. We show that we are able to reliably simultaneously transmit low-speed data at 1.3 Bps to camera enabled devices and higher-speed data at 104 Bps to low-power embedded devices. Since the majority of energy in many RF communication protocols often goes towards media access and receiving, VLC-triggered wakeup can significantly decrease system energy consumption. We also demonstrate a proof-of-concept wakeup circuit that consumes less then 204uA and can be triggered in less then 10ms.","author":["Niranjini Rajagopal","Patrick Lazik","Anthony Rowe"],"issue":["VLCS '14: Proceedings of the 1st ACM MobiCom workshop on Visible light communication systems","September 2014","Pages   33\u201338","https://doi.org/10.1145/2643164.2643173"],"date":"07 September 2014","ref":[{"text":"N.

Researchers have proposed several hardware trust verification techniques to mitigate such threats, and some of them are shown to be able to effectively flag all suspicious HTs implemented in the Trust-Hub hardware backdoor benchmark suite. No doubt to say, adversaries would adjust their tactics of attacks accordingly and it is hence essential to examine whether new types of HTs can be designed to defeat these hardware trust verification techniques. In this paper, we present a systematic HT design methodology to achieve the above objective, namely \\emph{DeTrust}. Given an HT design, DeTrust keeps its original malicious behavior while making the HT resistant to state-of-the-art hardware trust verification techniques by manipulating its trigger designs. To be specific, DeTrust implements stealthy implicit triggers for HTs by carefully spreading the trigger logic into multiple sequential levels and combinational logic blocks and combining the trigger logic with the normal logic, so that they are not easily differentiable from normal logic. As shown in our experimental results, adversaries can easily employ DeTrust to evade hardware trust verification. We close with a discussion on how to extend existing solutions to alleviate the threat posed by DeTrust. However, they generally suffer from high computational complexity, calling for more advanced techniques to ensure hardware trust.","author":["Jie Zhang","Feng Yuan","Qiang Xu"],"issue":["CCS '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","November 2014","Pages   153\u2013166","https://doi.org/10.1145/2660267.2660289"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"M.

Cross-Technology Interference (CTI) is highly uncertain and raises the need for agile methods that assess the channel conditions and apply actions maximizing communication success. In this paper, we present TIIM, a lightweight Technology-Independent Interference Mitigation solution that detects, quantifies, and reacts to CTI in realtime. TIIM employs a lightweight machine learning classifier to (i) decide whether communication is viable over the interfered link, (ii) characterize the ambient conditions and apply the best coexistence mitigation strategy. We present an in-depth experimental characterization of the effect of CTI on 802.15.4 links, which motivated and influenced the design of TIIM. Our evaluation shows that TIIM, while exposed to extensive and heterogeneous interference, can achieve a total PRR improvement of 30% with an additional transmission overhead of 5.6%.","author":["Anwar Hithnawi","Hossein Shafagh","Simon Duquennoy"],"issue":["IPSN '15: Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","April 2015","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2737095.2737104"],"date":"13 April 2015","ref":[{"text":"Cisco CleanAir Technology.","order":1},{"text":", 2007.","order":2},{"text":"Estimating the Utilisation of Key License-Exempt Spectrum Bands, Final Report, Mass Consultants Ltd., Ofcom, 2009.","order":3},{"text":"Miercom: Cisco CleanAir Competitive Testing, Lab Test Rerpot DR100409D, Miercom, 2010.","order":4},{"text":"Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPANs), IEEE Std. 802.15.4., 2011.","order":5},{"text":", 2014.","order":6},{"text":"Y.

We argue that extensibility is a crucial feature of the coordination infrastructures used in these systems. Without the ability to extend the functionality of coordination services, applications might end up using sub-optimal coordination algorithms, possibly leading to low performance. Adding extensibility, however, requires mechanisms that constrain extensions to be able to make reasonable security and performance guarantees. We propose a scheme that enables extensions to be introduced and removed dynamically in a secure way. To avoid performance overheads due to poorly designed extensions, it constrains the access of extensions to resources. Evaluation results for extensible versions of ZooKeeper and DepSpace show that it is possible to increase the throughput of a distributed queue by more than an order of magnitude (17x for ZooKeeper, 24x for DepSpace) while keeping the underlying coordination kernel small.","author":["Tobias Distler","Christopher Bahn","Alysson Bessani","Frank Fischer","Flavio Junqueira"],"issue":["EuroSys '15: Proceedings of the Tenth European Conference on Computer Systems","April 2015","Article No.: 10","Pages   1\u201316","https://doi.org/10.1145/2741948.2741954"],"date":"17 April 2015","ref":[{"text":"Apache ActiveMQ. http://activemq.apache.org/.","order":1},{"text":"Apache Curator. http://curator.apache.org/.","order":2},{"text":"CoreOS etcd. https://github.com/coreos/etcd/.","order":3},{"text":"JZab. https://github.com/zk1931/jzab/.","order":4},{"text":"LogCabin. https://github.com/logcabin/.","order":5},{"text":"M.

Logic-in-Memory (LiM) architectures address this challenge by embedding logic within the memory block to perform basic operations on data locally for specific functions. While custom smart memories have been successfully constructed for various applications, a fully automated LiM synthesis flow enables architectural exploration that has heretofore not been possible. In this paper we present a tool and design methodology for LiM physical synthesis that performs co-design of algorithms and architectures to explore system level trade-offs. The resulting layouts and timing models can be incorporated within any physical synthesis tool. Silicon results shown in this paper demonstrate a 250x performance improvement and 310x energy savings for a data-intensive application example.","author":["H.

Unfortunately, recent increases in flash density have also brought about decreases in chip-level reliability. In a data center environment, flash-based SSD failures can lead to downtime and, in the worst case, data loss. As a result, it is important to understand flash memory reliability characteristics over flash lifetime in a realistic production data center environment running modern applications and system software. This paper presents the first large-scale study of flash-based SSD reliability in the field. We analyze data collected across a majority of flash-based solid state drives at Facebook data centers over nearly four years and many millions of operational hours in order to understand failure properties and trends of flash-based SSDs. Our study considers a variety of SSD characteristics, including: the amount of data written to and read from flash chips; how data is mapped within the SSD address space; the amount of data copied, erased, and discarded by the flash controller; and flash board temperature and bus power. Based on our field analysis of how flash memory errors manifest when running modern workloads on modern SSDs, this paper is the first to make several major observations: (1) SSD failure rates do not increase monotonically with flash chip wear; instead they go through several distinct periods corresponding to how failures emerge and are subsequently detected, (2) the effects of read disturbance errors are not prevalent in the field, (3) sparse logical data layout across an SSD's physical address space (e.g., non-contiguous data), as measured by the amount of metadata required to track logical address translations stored in an SSD-internal DRAM buffer, can greatly affect SSD failure rate, (4) higher temperatures lead to higher failure rates, but techniques that throttle SSD operation appear to greatly reduce the negative reliability impact of higher temperatures, and (5) data written by the operating system to flash-based SSDs does not always accurately indicate the amount of wear induced on flash cells due to optimizations in the SSD controller and buffering employed in the system software. We hope that the findings of this first large-scale flash memory reliability study can inspire others to develop other publicly-available analyses and novel flash reliability solutions.","author":["Justin Meza","Qiang Wu","Sanjev Kumar","Onur Mutlu"],"issue":["SIGMETRICS '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMETRICS International Conference on Measurement and Modeling of Computer Systems","June 2015","Pages   177\u2013190","https://doi.org/10.1145/2745844.2745848"],"date":"15 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"NVM Express Specification. http://www.nvmexpress.org/specifications/.","order":1},{"text":"The R Project for Statistical Computing. http://www.r-project.org/.","order":2},{"text":"American National Standards Institute.

In recent years, range-free localization algorithms have drawn much research attention due to their low cost and applicability to large-scale WSNs. However, the application of range-free localization algorithms is restricted because of their dramatic accuracy degradation in practical anisotropic WSNs, which is mainly caused by large error of distance estimation. Distance estimation in the existing range-free algorithms usually relies on a unified per hop length (PHL) metric between nodes. But the PHL between different nodes might be greatly different in anisotropic WSNs, resulting in large error in distance estimation. We find that, although the PHL between different nodes might be greatly different, it exhibits significant locality; that is, nearby nodes share a similar PHL to anchors that know their positions in advance. Based on the locality of the PHL, a novel distance estimation approach is proposed in this article. Theoretical analyses show that the error of distance estimation in the proposed approach is only one-fourth of that in the state-of-the-art pattern-driven scheme (PDS). An anchor selection algorithm is also devised to further improve localization accuracy by mitigating the negative effects from the anchors that are poorly distributed in geometry. By combining the locality-based distance estimation and the anchor selection, a range-free localization algorithm named <underline>S</underline>elective <underline>M</underline>ultilateration (SM) is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that SM achieves localization accuracy higher than 0.3r, where r is the communication radius of nodes. Compared to the state-of-the-art solution, SM improves the distance estimation accuracy by up to 57% and improves localization accuracy by up to 52% consequently.","author":["Shigeng Zhang","Xuan Liu","Jianxin Wang","Jiannong Cao","Geyong Min"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks","Volume 11","Issue 3","May 2015","Article No.: 51","pp   1\u201328","https://doi.org/10.1145/2746343"],"date":"20 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"James Aspnes, Tolga Eren, David Kiyoshi Goldenberg, A.

In particular, large-scale graph processing is gaining attention due to its broad applicability from social science to machine learning. However, scalable hardware design that can efficiently process large graphs in main memory is still an open problem. Ideally, cost-effective and scalable graph processing systems can be realized by building a system whose performance increases proportionally with the sizes of graphs that can be stored in the system, which is extremely challenging in conventional systems due to severe memory bandwidth limitations. In this work, we argue that the conventional concept of processing-in-memory (PIM) can be a viable solution to achieve such an objective. The key modern enabler for PIM is the recent advancement of the 3D integration technology that facilitates stacking logic and memory dies in a single package, which was not available when the PIM concept was originally examined. In order to take advantage of such a new technology to enable memory-capacity-proportional performance, we design a programmable PIM accelerator for large-scale graph processing called Tesseract. Tesseract is composed of (1) a new hardware architecture that fully utilizes the available memory bandwidth, (2) an efficient method of communication between different memory partitions, and (3) a programming interface that reflects and exploits the unique hardware design. It also includes two hardware prefetchers specialized for memory access patterns of graph processing, which operate based on the hints provided by our programming model. Our comprehensive evaluations using five state-of-the-art graph processing workloads with large real-world graphs show that the proposed architecture improves average system performance by a factor of ten and achieves 87% average energy reduction over conventional systems.","author":["Junwhan Ahn","Sungpack Hong","Sungjoo Yoo","Onur Mutlu","Kiyoung Choi"],"issue":["ISCA '15: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2015","Pages   105\u2013117","https://doi.org/10.1145/2749469.2750386"],"date":"13 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"ARM Cortex-A5 Processor.

In JEDEC DDRx devices, a refresh operation is performed via an auto-refresh command, which refreshes multiple rows in multiple banks simultaneously. The internal implementation of auto-refresh is completely opaque outside the DRAM --- all the memory controller can do is to instruct the DRAM to refresh itself --- the DRAM handles all else, in particular determining which rows in which banks are to be refreshed. This is in conflict with a large body of research on reducing the refresh overhead, in which the memory controller needs fine-grained control over which regions of the memory are refreshed. For example, prior works exploit the fact that a subset of DRAM rows can be refreshed at a slower rate than other rows due to access rate or retention period variations. However, such row-granularity approaches cannot use the standard auto-refresh command, which refreshes an entire batch of rows at once and does not permit skipping of rows. Consequently, prior schemes are forced to use explicit sequences of activate (ACT) and precharge (PRE) operations to mimic row-level refreshing. The drawback is that, compared to using JEDEC's auto-refresh mechanism, using explicit ACT and PRE commands is inefficient, both in terms of performance and power. In this paper, we show that even when skipping a high percentage of refresh operations, existing row-granurality refresh techniques are mostly ineffective due to the inherent efficiency disparity between ACT/PRE and the JEDEC auto-refresh mechanism. We propose a modification to the DRAM that extends its existing control-register access protocol to include the DRAM's internal refresh counter. We also introduce a new \"dummy refresh\" command that skips refresh operations and simply increments the internal counter. We show that these modifications allow a memory controller to reduce as many refreshes as in prior work, while achieving significant energy and performance advantages by using auto-refresh most of the time.","author":["Ishwar Bhati","Zeshan Chishti","Shih-Lien Lu","Bruce Jacob"],"issue":["ISCA '15: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2015","Pages   235\u2013246","https://doi.org/10.1145/2749469.2750408"],"date":"13 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"J.

Nevertheless, existing storage resource management systems, such as VMware SDRS, are incapable of performing real time policy-based storage management due to the high cost of migrating large size virtual disks. Hence, the traditional storage management schemes become ineffective due to the lack of quick response to the frequent IO bursts and the inaccurate storage latency prediction in the light of a highly fluctuating environment. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose LightSRM, which can work properly in a time-variant cloud environment. To mitigate the storage migration cost, we leverage copy-on-write/read snapshots to redirect the IO requests without moving the virtual disk. To support snapshots in storage management, we also build a performance model specifically for snapshots. We employ exponentially weighted moving average with adjustable sliding window to provide quick and accurate performance prediction. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid management scheme, which can dynamically choose either snapshot or migration for fastest performance tuning. We build our prototype in a QEMU/KVM based virtualized environment. Our empirical evaluation results show that snapshot can redirect IO requests in a faster manner than migration can do when the virtual disk size is large. Besides, snapshot method has less disk performance impact on the applications. By employing hybrid snapshot/migration method, LightSRM yields less overall latency, better load balance, and less IO traffic overhead.","author":["Ruijin Zhou","Huixiang Chen","Tao Li"],"issue":["ICS '15: Proceedings of the 29th ACM on International Conference on Supercomputing","June 2015","Pages   133\u2013142","https://doi.org/10.1145/2751205.2751230"],"date":"08 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"Understanding VMware vSphere\u00ae 5.1 Storage DRS, VMware Technical white paper, March 2013.","order":1},{"text":"VMware Distributed Resource Scheduler, White Paper.","order":2},{"text":"Ajay Gulati, Chethan Kumar, Irfan Ahmad, and Karan Ku-mar, BASIL: Automated IO Load Balancing across Storage Devices.

Currently, many individuals and organizations mitigate the burden of local data storage and reduce the maintenance cost by outsourcing data to the cloud. However, the outsourced data is not always trustworthy due to the loss of physical control and possession over the data. As a result, many scholars have concentrated on relieving the security threats of the outsourced data by designing the Remote Data Auditing (RDA) technique as a new concept to enable public auditability for the stored data in the cloud. The RDA is a useful technique to check the reliability and integrity of data outsourced to a single or distributed servers. This is because all of the RDA techniques for single cloud servers are unable to support data recovery; such techniques are complemented with redundant storage mechanisms. The article also reviews techniques of remote data auditing more comprehensively in the domain of the distributed clouds in conjunction with the presentation of classifying ongoing developments within this specified area. The thematic taxonomy of the distributed storage auditing is presented based on significant parameters, such as scheme nature, security pattern, objective functions, auditing mode, update mode, cryptography model, and dynamic data structure. The more recent remote auditing approaches, which have not gained considerable attention in distributed cloud environments, are also critically analyzed and further categorized into three different classes, namely, replication based, erasure coding based, and network coding based, to present a taxonomy. This survey also aims to investigate similarities and differences of such a framework on the basis of the thematic taxonomy to diagnose significant and explore major outstanding issues.","author":["Mehdi Sookhak","Abdullah Gani","Hamid Talebian","Adnan Akhunzada","Samee U.

However, careful consideration is required when SSD-based systems employ parity protection. First, additional writes are required for parity updates. Second, parity consumes space on the device, which results in write amplification from less efficient garbage collection at higher space utilization.This article analyzes the effectiveness of SSD-based RAID and discusses the potential benefits and drawbacks in terms of reliability. A Markov model is presented to estimate the lifetime of SSD-based RAID systems in different environments. In a small array, our results show that parity protection provides benefit only with considerably low space utilizations and low data access rates. However, in a large system, RAID improves data lifetime even when we take write amplification into account.","author":["Sangwhan Moon","A. L.

Some pairs of objects might be seen as being alternatives to each other (such as two pairs of jeans), while others may be seen as being complementary (such as a pair of jeans and a matching shirt). This information guides many of the choices that people make, from buying clothes to their interactions with each other. We seek here to model this human sense of the relationships between objects based on their appearance. Our approach is not based on fine-grained modeling of user annotations but rather on capturing the largest dataset possible and developing a scalable method for uncovering human notions of the visual relationships within. We cast this as a network inference problem defined on graphs of related images, and provide a large-scale dataset for the training and evaluation of the same. The system we develop is capable of recommending which clothes and accessories will go well together (and which will not), amongst a host of other applications.","author":["Julian McAuley","Christopher Targett","Qinfeng Shi","Anton van den Hengel"],"issue":["SIGIR '15: Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2015","Pages   43\u201352","https://doi.org/10.1145/2766462.2767755"],"date":"09 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"G.

These systems can be designed in a cost efficient manner only if their architecture exploits the \u201cleads\u201d suggested by clever compile-time performance estimators. However, performance estimation of networked embedded systems is a non-trivial problem. The computational requirements of such systems show statistical variations that stem from several interacting factors. At the slowest time scale, applications can adapt to network bandwidth by configuring the processing functionality of their tasks (e.g. compression parameters). Also, there could be significant execution time variations within a task. Thus, it is tricky to compute the net processing demand of several such applications on a system architecture, especially if the system schedules these applications using prioritized run-time schedulers.\nIn this paper, we describe an analytical tool called AsaP for fast performance estimation of such embedded systems. AsaP builds approximate models of these systems and characterizes the processing load on the system as a stochastic process. The output of AsaP is an exact distribution of the processing delay of each application. This is a powerful result that can be leveraged for efficient design of multimedia networked systems requiring soft real-time guarantees. It is also the first known framework that quantifies the effect of runtime schedulers (FCFS, RM, EDF) on the performance of such systems.","author":["Asawaree Kalavade","Pratyush Mogh\u00e9"],"issue":["DAC '98: Proceedings of the 35th annual Design Automation Conference","May 1998","Pages   257\u2013262","https://doi.org/10.1145/277044.277116"],"date":"01 May 1998","ref":[{"text":"PDA Buyer's Guide, Pen Computing Magazine, vol. 3, no. 11, July/ August 1996, pp. 84.]]","order":1},{"text":"H.

In this paper, we examine the scenario of a heterogeneous network with nodes and content of various types. Such networks are notoriously difficult to mine because of the bewildering combination of heterogeneous contents and structures. The creation of a multidimensional embedding of such data opens the door to the use of a wide variety of off-the-shelf mining techniques for multidimensional data. Despite the importance of this problem, limited efforts have been made on embedding a network of scalable, dynamic and heterogeneous data. In such cases, both the content and linkage structure provide important cues for creating a unified feature representation of the underlying network. In this paper, we design a deep embedding algorithm for networked data. A highly nonlinear multi-layered embedding function is used to capture the complex interactions between the heterogeneous data in a network. Our goal is to create a multi-resolution deep embedding function, that reflects both the local and global network structures, and makes the resulting embedding useful for a variety of data mining tasks. In particular, we demonstrate that the rich content and linkage information in a heterogeneous network can be captured by such an approach, so that similarities among cross-modal data can be measured directly in a common embedding space. Once this goal has been achieved, a wide variety of data mining problems can be solved by applying off-the-shelf algorithms designed for handling vector representations. Our experiments on real-world network datasets show the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed algorithm as compared to the state-of-the-art embedding methods.","author":["Shiyu Chang","Wei Han","Jiliang Tang","Guo-Jun Qi","Charu C.

Traditional methods used handcrafted local features combined with high-level image representations to generate image-level representations. Thus, a practical challenge is to determine what features are appropriate for specific tasks. For example, in the study of gene expression patterns in Drosophila melanogaster, texture features based on wavelets were particularly effective for determining the developmental stages from in situ hybridization (ISH) images. Such image representation is however not suitable for controlled vocabulary (CV) term annotation because each CV term is often associated with only a part of an image. Here, we developed problem-independent feature extraction methods to generate hierarchical representations for ISH images. Our approach is based on the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can act on image pixels directly. To make the extracted features generic, the models were trained using a natural image set with millions of labeled examples. These models were transferred to the ISH image domain and used directly as feature extractors to compute image representations. Furthermore, we employed multi-task learning method to fine-tune the pre-trained models with labeled ISH images, and also extracted features from the fine-tuned models. Experimental results showed that feature representations computed by deep models based on transfer and multi-task learning significantly outperformed other methods for annotating gene expression patterns at different stage ranges. We also demonstrated that the intermediate layers of deep models produced the best gene expression pattern representations.","author":["Wenlu Zhang","Rongjian Li","Tao Zeng","Qian Sun","Sudhir Kumar","Jieping Ye","Shuiwang Ji"],"issue":["KDD '15: Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2015","Pages   1475\u20131484","https://doi.org/10.1145/2783258.2783304"],"date":"10 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"Y.

A popular analysis is to cut the graph so that the disjoint subgraphs can represent communities (for social network) or background and foreground cognitive activity (for medical imaging). An emerging setting is when multiple data sets (graphs) exist which opens up the opportunity for many new questions. In this paper we study two such questions: i) For a collection of graphs find a single cut that is good for all the graphs and ii) For two collections of graphs find a single cut that is good for one collection but poor for the other. We show that existing formulations of multiview, consensus and alternative clustering cannot address these questions and instead we provide novel formulations in the spectral clustering framework. We evaluate our approaches on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to address questions such as: \"What common cognitive network does this group of individuals have?\" and \"What are the differences in the cognitive networks for these two groups?\" We obtain useful results without the need for strong domain knowledge.","author":["Chia-Tung Kuo","Xiang Wang","Peter Walker","Owen Carmichael","Jieping Ye","Ian Davidson"],"issue":["KDD '15: Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2015","Pages   617\u2013626","https://doi.org/10.1145/2783258.2783318"],"date":"10 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"A.

It has emerged as the next generation big data processing engine, overtaking Hadoop MapReduce which helped ignite the big data revolution. Spark maintains MapReduce's linear scalability and fault tolerance, but extends it in a few important ways: it is much faster (100 times faster for certain applications), much easier to program in due to its rich APIs in Python, Java, Scala (and shortly R), and its core data abstraction, the distributed data frame, and it goes far beyond batch applications to support a variety of compute-intensive tasks, including interactive queries, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing.

They are not, however, scalable. We provide a way to retain the benefits of these pure-in-a-box data structures while dynamically converting to a more scalable lock-free data structure under contention. Our solution scales to any pair of pure and lock-free container types with key/value set semantics, while retaining lock-freedom. We demonstrate the principle in action on two very different platforms: first in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler and second in Java. To this end we extend GHC to support lock-free data structures and introduce a new approach for safe CAS in a lazy language.","author":["Ryan R. Newton","Peter P.

Despite extensive research on localization, the limited resolution of a map imposes restrictions on the navigation engine in both indoor and outdoor environments. To bridge the gap between the end position obtained from legacy navigation services and the real destination, we propose FollowMe, a \"last-mile\" navigation system to enable plug-and-play navigation in indoor and semi-outdoor environments. FollowMe exploits the ubiquitous, stable geomagnetic field and natural walking patterns to navigate the users to the same destination taken by an earlier traveler. Unlike existing localization and navigation systems, FollowMe is infrastructure-free, energy-efficient and cost-saving. We implemented FollowMe on smartphones, and evaluated it in a four-story campus building with a testing area of 2000m2. Our experimental results with 5 users show that 95% of spatial errors during navigation were 2m or less with at least 50% energy savings over a benchmark system.","author":["Yuanchao Shu","Kang G.

Low-voltage computing, specifically, near-threshold voltage computing (NTC), which involves operating the transistor very close to and yet above its threshold voltage, holds the promise of providing many-fold improvement in energy efficiency. However, use of NTC also presents several challenges such as increased parametric variation, failure rate, and performance loss. This article surveys several recent techniques that aim to offset these challenges for fully leveraging the potential of NTC. By classifying these techniques along several dimensions, we also highlight their similarities and differences. It is hoped that this article will provide insights into state-of-the-art NTC techniques to researchers and system designers and inspire further research in this field.","author":["Sparsh Mittal"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 12","Issue 4","July 2016","Article No.: 46","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/2821510"],"date":"28 December 2015","ref":[{"text":"Jaume Abella, Javier Carretero, Pedro Chaparro, Xavier Vera, and Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez. 2009.

Depending on the layout of the data structure in physical address space, some access patterns result in non-unit strides. In existing systems, which are optimized to store and access cache lines, non-unit strided accesses exhibit low spatial locality. Therefore, they incur high latency, and waste memory bandwidth and cache space. We propose the Gather-Scatter DRAM (GS-DRAM) to address this problem. We observe that a commodity DRAM module contains many chips. Each chip stores a part of every cache line mapped to the module. Our idea is to enable the memory controller to access multiple values that belong to a strided pattern from different chips using a single read/write command. To realize this idea, GS-DRAM first maps the data of each cache line to different chips such that multiple values of a strided access pattern are mapped to different chips. Second, instead of sending a separate address to each chip, GS-DRAM maps each strided pattern to a small pattern ID that is communicated to the module. Based on the pattern ID, each chip independently computes the address of the value to be accessed. The cache line returned by the module contains different values of the strided pattern gathered from different chips. We show that this approach enables GS-DRAM to achieve near-ideal memory bandwidth and cache utilization for many common access patterns. We design an end-to-end system to exploit GS-DRAM. Our evaluations show that 1) for in-memory databases, GS-DRAM obtains the best of the row store and the column store layouts, in terms of both performance and energy, and 2) for matrix-matrix multiplication, GS-DRAM seamlessly enables SIMD optimizations and outperforms the best tiled layout. Our framework is general, and can benefit many modern data-intensive applications.","author":["Vivek Seshadri","Thomas Mullins","Amirali Boroumand","Onur Mutlu","Phillip B. Gibbons","Michael A.

Geometry-based MRAM PUFs rely only on geometric variations in MRAM cells that generate preferred ground state in cells and form the basis of digital signature generation. Here we study two novel ways to improve the performance of the geometry-based PUF signature. First, we study how the choice between specific geometries can enhance the reliability of the digital signature. Using fabrications and simulations, we study how the rectangular shape in the PUF cells is more susceptible to lithography-based geometric variations than the elliptical shape of the same aspect ratio. The choice of rectangular over elliptical masks in the lithography process can therefore improve the reliability of the digital signature from PUF. Second, we present a MRAM PUF architecture and study how resistances in MRAM cells can be used to generate analog voltage output that are easier to detect if probed by an adversary. In the new PUF architecture, we have the choice between selection of rows and columns to generate unique and hard-to-predict analog voltage outputs. For a 64-bit response, the analog voltage output can range between 20 and 500 mV, making it tough for an adversary to guess over this wide range of voltages. This work ends with a discussion on the threat resilience ability of the new improved MRAM PUF to attacks from probing-, tampering-, reuse-, and simulation-based models.","author":["Jayita Das","Kevin Scott","Sanjukta Bhanja"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 13","Issue 1","December 2016","Article No.: 2","pp   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/2854154"],"date":"06 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"Yousra Alkabani and Farinaz Koushanfar. 2007.

Conventional overwriting-based and encryption-based solutions are not sufficient, as they cannot remove these artifacts. In this work, we aim to securely remove data from NAND flash-based block devices. We observed that completely removing the aforementioned artifacts from NAND flash is expensive, as it may require re-organizing the entire flash layout. We thus approach this security goal from a new angle. We investigate undetectable secure deletion, a novel security notion which can 1) remove the deleted data from flash devices, such that the adversary cannot have access to the deleted data once they have been removed, and 2) conceal the deletion history, such that the adversary cannot find out there was a deletion in the past. We design NAND Flash Partial Scrubbing (NFPS), the first undetectable secure deletion scheme for NAND flash-based block devices. We propose partial page reprogramming and partial block erasure methods to sanitize data from NAND flash. In addition, we incorporate NFPS to typical Flash Translation Layer (FTL) algorithms. Finally, we implement NFPS and experimentally evaluate its effectiveness.","author":["Shijie Jia","Luning Xia","Bo Chen","Peng Liu"],"issue":["ASIA CCS '16: Proceedings of the 11th ACM on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security","May 2016","Pages   305\u2013315","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897845.2897882"],"date":"30 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"Fio. http://freecode.com/projects/fio.","order":1},{"text":"Opennfm. https://code.google.com/p/opennfm/.","order":2},{"text":"Uk data protection act 1998 (dpa). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data Protection Act 1998 #Data protection principles.","order":3},{"text":"S.

Reliability-aware circuit design flows do virtually not exist and even research is in its infancy. In this paper, we propose to bring aging awareness to EDA tool flows based on so-called degradation-aware cell libraries. These libraries include detailed delay information of gates/cells under the impact that aging has on both threshold voltage (Vth) and carrier mobility (\u03bc) of transistors. This is unlike state of the art which considers Vth only. We show how ignoring \u03bc degradation leads to underestimating guard-bands by 19% on average. Our investigation revealed that the impact of aging is strongly dependent on the operating conditions of gates (i.e. input signal slew and output load capacitance), and not solely on the duty cycle of transistors. Neglecting this fact results in employing insufficient guard-bands and thus not sustaining reliability during lifetime. We demonstrate that degradation-aware libraries and tool flows are indispensable for not only accurately estimating guardbands, but also efficiently containing them. By considering aging degradations during logic synthesis, significantly more resilient circuits can be obtained. We further quantify the impact of aging on the degradation of image processing circuits. This goes far beyond investigating aging with respect to path delays solely. We show that in a standard design without any guardbanding, aging leads to unacceptable image quality after just one year. By contrast, if the synthesis tool is provided with the degradation-aware cell library, high image quality is sustained for 10 years (even under worst-case aging and without a guard-band). Hence, using our approach, aging can be effectively suppressed.","author":["Hussam Amrouch","Behnam Khaleghi","Andreas Gerstlauer","J\u00f6rg Henkel"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 12","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898082"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"\"Degradation-Aware Cell Libraries, V1.0,\" http://ces.itec.kit.edu/dependable-hardware.php","order":1},{"text":"V.

In this paper, we present DrTM+R, a fast in-memory transaction processing system that retains the performance benefit from advanced hardware features, while supporting general transactional workloads and high availability through replication. DrTM+R addresses the generality issue by designing a hybrid OCC and locking scheme, which leverages the strong atomicity of HTM and the strong consistency of RDMA to preserve strict serializability with high performance. To resolve the race condition between the immediate visibility of records updated by HTM transactions and the unready replication of such records, DrTM+R leverages an optimistic replication scheme that uses seqlock-like versioning to distinguish the visibility of tuples and the readiness of record replication. Evaluation using typical OLTP workloads like TPC-C and SmallBank shows that DrTM+R scales well on a 6-node cluster and achieves over 5.69 and 94 million transactions per second without replication for TPC-C and SmallBank respectively. Enabling 3-way replication on DrTM+R only incurs at most 41% overhead before reaching network bottleneck, and is still an order-of-magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art distributed transaction system (Calvin).","author":["Yanzhe Chen","Xingda Wei","Jiaxin Shi","Rong Chen","Haibo Chen"],"issue":["EuroSys '16: Proceedings of the Eleventh European Conference on Computer Systems","April 2016","Article No.: 26","Pages   1\u201317","https://doi.org/10.1145/2901318.2901349"],"date":"18 April 2016","ref":[{"text":"Agrawal, D., Bernstein, A.

Results show that the write energy reduction of evaluation sets---using FVEs generated for training sets---are close (equal) to the best known solution for MLC (TLC) NVM encoding; however, our solution incurs a memory overhead that is 16x (5.7x) less than the best comparable scheme in the literature for MLC (TLC) NVMs.","author":["Ali Alsuwaiyan","Kartik Mohanram"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '16: Proceedings of the 26th edition on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2016","Pages   403\u2013408","https://doi.org/10.1145/2902961.2902979"],"date":"18 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"\"International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors,\" 2011.","order":1},{"text":"B.

In this environment, hardware Trojans (i.e., malicious modifications or inclusions made by untrusted third parties) pose major security concerns, especially for those integrated circuits (ICs) and systems used in critical applications and cyber infrastructure. While hardware Trojans have been explored significantly in academia over the last decade, there remains room for improvement. In this article, we examine the research on hardware Trojans from the last decade and attempt to capture the lessons learned. A comprehensive adversarial model taxonomy is introduced and used to examine the current state of the art. Then the past countermeasures and publication trends are categorized based on the adversarial model and topic. Through this analysis, we identify what has been covered and the important problems that are underinvestigated. We also identify the most critical lessons for those new to the field and suggest a roadmap for future hardware Trojan research.","author":["K. Xiao","D. Forte","Y. Jin","R. Karri","S. Bhunia","M.

In this paper, we evaluate Active Disk architectures which integrate significant processing power and memory into a disk drive and allow application-specific code to be downloaded and executed on the data that is being read from (written to) disk. The key idea is to offload bulk of the processing to the diskresident processors and to use the host processor primarily for coordination, scheduling and combination of results from individual disks. To program Active Disks, we propose a stream-based programming model which allows disklets to be executed efficiently and safely. Simulation results for a suite of six algorithms from three application domains (commercial data warehouses, image processing and satellite data processing) indicate that for these algorithms, Active Disks outperform conventional-disk architectures.","author":["Anurag Acharya","Mustafa Uysal","Joel Saltz"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 33","Issue 11","Nov. 1998","pp   81\u201391","https://doi.org/10.1145/291006.291026"],"date":"01 October 1998","ref":[{"text":"A.

As a result, tensor decompositions, which extract useful latent information out of multiaspect data tensors, have witnessed increasing popularity and adoption by the data mining community. In this survey, we present some of the most widely used tensor decompositions, providing the key insights behind them, and summarizing them from a practitioner\u2019s point of view. We then provide an overview of a very broad spectrum of applications where tensors have been instrumental in achieving state-of-the-art performance, ranging from social network analysis to brain data analysis, and from web mining to healthcare. Subsequently, we present recent algorithmic advances in scaling tensor decompositions up to today\u2019s big data, outlining the existing systems and summarizing the key ideas behind them. Finally, we conclude with a list of challenges and open problems that outline exciting future research directions.","author":["Evangelos E. Papalexakis","Christos Faloutsos","Nicholas D.

Recent research has reported that application data management in Android involves frequent fsync() operations. The current fsync() implementations, including those of ext4 and F2FS, have several common drawbacks. Specifically, ext4 commits a transaction every time to sync a file, whereas F2FS commits a checkpoint to sync a directory. Committing a transaction or checkpoint flushes all dirty data from the page cache to the flash storage via many small, random block write requests. The resultant high I/O frequency and excessive write traffic cause a high fsync() latency. This study presents an efficient fsync() method, called eager synching, which is based on a simple idea: write less, and write sequentially. To sync a file, eager synching writes only a subset of all dirty data in the page cache to a sequential log space using a few sequential block write requests. It does not involve transaction or checkpoint committing. We successfully implemented eager synching in ext4 and F2FS, and our experimental results show that, compared with the original fsync() methods of ext4 and F2FS, eager synching reduced the average and maximum fsync() latencies by up to 72% and 91%, respectively, block-level write traffic by up to 35%, and I/O frequency by up to 66%. Through enhanced crash recovery procedures, eager synching can successfully recover all previously synched files while still guaranteeing the file system integrity. We also conducted live application replays using the proposed eager synching approach and observed that this approach significantly improved the application frame updating rate and application execution time.","author":["Li-Pin Chang","Po-Han Sung","Po-Tsang Chen","Po-Hung Chen"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 16","Issue 2","April 2017","Article No.: 34","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2930668"],"date":"19 December 2016","ref":[{"text":"Alan D.

The most fundamental functionality is to pinpoint the location of the target via wireless devices. According to how wireless devices interact with the target, wireless indoor localization schemes roughly fall into two categories: device based and device free. In device-based localization, a wireless device (e.g., a smartphone) is attached to the target and computes its location through cooperation with other deployed wireless devices. In device-free localization, the target carries no wireless devices, while the wireless infrastructure deployed in the environment determines the target\u2019s location by analyzing its impact on wireless signals.This article is intended to offer a comprehensive state-of-the-art survey on wireless indoor localization from the device perspective. In this survey, we review the recent advances in both modes by elaborating on the underlying wireless modalities, basic localization principles, and data fusion techniques, with special emphasis on emerging trends in (1) leveraging smartphones to integrate wireless and sensor capabilities and extend to the social context for device-based localization, and (2) extracting specific wireless features to trigger novel human-centric device-free localization. We comprehensively compare each scheme in terms of accuracy, cost, scalability, and energy efficiency. Furthermore, we take a first look at intrinsic technical challenges in both categories and identify several open research issues associated with these new challenges.","author":["Jiang Xiao","Zimu Zhou","Youwen Yi","Lionel M.

To address the issues, auxiliary information is usually used to boost the performance. Due to the rapid collection of information on the web, the knowledge base provides heterogeneous information including both structured and unstructured data with different semantics, which can be consumed by various applications. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage the heterogeneous information in a knowledge base to improve the quality of recommender systems. First, by exploiting the knowledge base, we design three components to extract items' semantic representations from structural content, textual content and visual content, respectively. To be specific, we adopt a heterogeneous network embedding method, termed as TransR, to extract items' structural representations by considering the heterogeneity of both nodes and relationships. We apply stacked denoising auto-encoders and stacked convolutional auto-encoders, which are two types of deep learning based embedding techniques, to extract items' textual representations and visual representations, respectively. Finally, we propose our final integrated framework, which is termed as Collaborative Knowledge Base Embedding (CKE), to jointly learn the latent representations in collaborative filtering as well as items' semantic representations from the knowledge base. To evaluate the performance of each embedding component as well as the whole system, we conduct extensive experiments with two real-world datasets from different scenarios. The results reveal that our approaches outperform several widely adopted state-of-the-art recommendation methods.","author":["Fuzheng Zhang","Nicholas Jing Yuan","Defu Lian","Xing Xie","Wei-Ying Ma"],"issue":["KDD '16: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2016","Pages   353\u2013362","https://doi.org/10.1145/2939672.2939673"],"date":"13 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"ahmet uyar, f. m. a.

Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.","author":["Aditya Grover","Jure Leskovec"],"issue":["KDD '16: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2016","Pages   855\u2013864","https://doi.org/10.1145/2939672.2939754"],"date":"13 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"L.

The former accounts for the vast majority of miner revenues at the beginning of the system, but it is expected to transition to the latter as the block rewards dwindle. There has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the block chain. We show that this is not the case. Our key insight is that with only transaction fees, the variance of the block reward is very high due to the exponentially distributed block arrival time, and it becomes attractive to fork a \"wealthy\" block to \"steal\" the rewards therein. We show that this results in an equilibrium with undesirable properties for Bitcoin's security and performance, and even non-equilibria in some circumstances. We also revisit selfish mining and show that it can be made profitable for a miner with an arbitrarily low hash power share, and who is arbitrarily poorly connected within the network. Our results are derived from theoretical analysis and confirmed by a new Bitcoin mining simulator that may be of independent interest. We discuss the troubling implications of our results for Bitcoin's future security and draw lessons for the design of new cryptocurrencies.","author":["Miles Carlsten","Harry Kalodner","S.

In many cases, insufficient external resources in the knowledge population hinder the subsequent statistical inference. The gap between these two processes can be reduced by an incremental population approach. We propose a new probabilistic knowledge graph factorisation method that benefits from the path structure of existing knowledge (e.g. syllogism) and enables a common modelling approach to be used for both incremental population and knowledge completion tasks. More specifically, the probabilistic formulation allows us to develop an incremental population algorithm that trades off exploitation-exploration. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the balanced exploitation-exploration helps the incremental population, and the additional path structure helps to predict missing information in knowledge completion.","author":["Dongwoo Kim","Lexing Xie","Cheng Soon Ong"],"issue":["CIKM '16: Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2016","Pages   2257\u20132262","https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983677"],"date":"24 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"C.

In particular, deep convolutional neural networks have been shown to dominate on several popular public benchmarks such as the ImageNet database. Unfortunately, the benefits of deep networks have yet to be fully exploited in embedded, resource-bound settings that have strict power and area budgets. Graphical processing unit (GPU) have been shown to improve throughput and energy-efficiency over central processing unit (CPU) due to their highly parallel architecture yet still impose a significant power burden. In a similar fashion, field programmable gate array (FPGA) can be used to improve performance while further allowing more fine-grained control over implementation to improve efficiency. In order to reduce power and area while still achieving required throughput, classification-efficient network architectures are required in addition to optimal deployment on efficient hardware. In this work, we target both of these enterprises. For the first objective, we analyze simple, biologically inspired reduction strategies that are applied both before and after training. The central theme of the techniques is the introduction of sparsification to help dissolve away the dense connectivity that is often found at different levels in convolutional neural networks. The sparsification techniques include feature compression partition, structured filter pruning, and dynamic feature pruning. Additionally, we explore filter factorization and filter quantization approximation techniques to further reduce the complexity of convolutional layers. In the second contribution, we propose SPARCNet, a hardware accelerator for efficient deployment of SPARse Convolutional NETworks. The accelerator looks to enable deploying networks in such resource-bound settings by both exploiting efficient forms of parallelism inherent in convolutional layers and by exploiting the sparsification and approximation techniques proposed. To demonstrate both contributions, modern deep convolutional network architectures containing millions of parameters are explored within the context of the computer vision dataset CIFAR. Utilizing the reduction techniques, we demonstrate the ability to reduce computation and memory by 60% and 93% with less than 0.03% impact on accuracy when compared to the best baseline network with 93.47% accuracy. The SPARCNet accelerator with different numbers of processing engines is implemented on a low-power Artix-7 FPGA platform. Additionally, the same networks are optimally implemented on a number of embedded commercial-off-the-shelf platforms including NVIDIAs CPU+GPU SoCs TK1 and TX1 and Intel Edison. Compared to NVIDIAs TK1 and TX1, the FPGA-based accelerator obtains 11.8 \u00d7 and 7.5 \u00d7 improvement in energy efficiency while maintaining a classification throughput of 72 images/s. When further compared to a number of recent FPGA-based accelerators, SPARCNet is able to achieve up to 15 \u00d7 improvement in energy efficiency while consuming less than 2W of total board power at 100MHz. In addition to improving efficiency, the accelerator has built-in support for sparsification techniques and ability to perform in-place rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, max-pooling, and batch normalization.","author":["Adam Page","Ali Jafari","Colin Shea","Tinoosh Mohsenin"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 13","Issue 3","May 2017","Article No.: 31","pp   1\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/3005448"],"date":"12 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"2015.

We discuss a new texture representation called the BTF (bidirectional texture function) which captures the variation in texture with illumination and viewing direction. We present a BTF database with image textures from over 60 different samples, each observed with over 200 different combinations of viewing and illumination directions. We describe the methods involved in collecting the database as well as the importqance and uniqueness of this database for computer graphics. A related quantity to the BTF is the familiar BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function). The measurement methods involved in the BTF database are conducive  to simultaneous measurement of the BRDF. Accordingly, we also present a BRDF database with reflectance measurements for over 60 different samples, each observed with over 200 different combinations of viewing and illumination directions. Both of these unique databases are publicly available and have important implications for computer graphics.","author":["Kristin J. Dana","Bram van Ginneken","Shree K. Nayar","Jan J.

We introduce Passive Wi-Fi that demonstrates that one can generate 802.11b transmissions using backscatter communication, while consuming 3-4 orders of magnitude lower power than existing Wi-Fi chipsets. Passive Wi-Fi transmissions can be decoded on any Wi-Fi device including routers, mobile phones and tablets. Our experimental evaluation shows that passive Wi-Fi transmissions can be decoded on off-the-shelf smartphones and Wi-Fi chipsets over distances of up to 100 feet. We also design a passive Wi-Fi IC that shows that 1 and 11 Mbps transmissions consume 14.5 and 59.2 ?W respectively. This translates to 10000x lower power than existing Wi-Fi chipsets and 1000x lower power than Bluetooth LE and ZigBee.","author":["Bryce Kellogg","Vamsi Talla","Joshua R.

Many neural network models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recursive Neural Network (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been proposed to learn representations of phrase/sentence, however, rich syntactic knowledge has not been fully explored when composing a longer text from its shorter constituent words. In most traditional models, only word embeddings are utilized to compose phrase/sentence representations, while the syntactic information of words is yet to be explored. In this article, we discover that encoding syntactic knowledge (part-of-speech tag) in neural networks can enhance sentence/phrase representation. Specifically, we propose to learn tag-specific composition functions and tag embeddings in recursive neural networks, and propose to utilize POS tags to control the gates of tree-structured LSTM networks. We evaluate these models on two benchmark datasets for sentiment classification, and demonstrate that improvements can be obtained with such syntactic knowledge encoded.","author":["Minlie Huang","Qiao Qian","Xiaoyan Zhu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 35","Issue 3","June 2017","Article No.: 26","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/3052770"],"date":"05 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastien, Pascal Lamblin, Razvan Pascanu, James Bergstra, Ian J.

A number of companies and universities are currently involved in this promising technology. In 2016, Everspin released the first 256M STT-MRAM chip, indicating the commercialization and application of STT-MRAM. Nevertheless, STT-MRAM still has some intrinsic limitations, such as dynamic write power and speed, compared with CMOS-based memory technologies. Following the technical evolution process from toggle-MRAM to STT-MRAM, the continuous pursuit of high performance, high density, low power and scalability, drives the intensive R&D of new memory technologies. In this paper, we will show the recent progress in advanced spintronic memories beyond STT-MRAM, such as the spin Hall effect (SHE)-driven and voltage-driven MRAMs. These advanced MRAM technologies do have some unique advantages compared with STT-MRAM, but they also suffer from new design and fabrication challenges. In addition, we will present the latest research in emerging spintronic devices, e.g., magnetic skyrmions, which are potential as information carriers in future spintronic memories, e.g., racetrack memory.","author":["Wang Kang","Zhaohao Wang","He Zhang","Sai Li","Youguang Zhang","Weisheng Zhao"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '17: Proceedings of the on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI 2017","May 2017","Pages   299\u2013304","https://doi.org/10.1145/3060403.3060589"],"date":"10 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"N.

Approximate computation is a viable method to save energy and increase performance by trading energy for accuracy. There are a number of proposed approximate solutions, however, they are limited to a small range of applications because they cannot control the error rate of their output. In this paper, we propose a novel approximate floating point multiplier, called CFPU, which significantly reduces energy and improves performance of multiplication at the expense of accuracy. Our design approximately models multiplication by replacing the most costly step of the operation with a lower energy alternative. In order to tune the level of approximation, CFPU dynamically identifies the inputs which will produce the largest approximation error and processes them in precise CFPU mode. We showed that our CFPU can outperforms a standard FPU when at least 4% of multiplications are performed in approximate mode. In our tested applications this percentage of multiplications is substantially higher, leading to significant energy savings. Our experimental evaluation on AMD Southern Island GPU shows that replacing the proposed CFPU with traditional FPUs results in 77% energy savings and 3.5x energy-delay product improvement over eight general OpenCL applications while providing acceptable quality of service. In addition, for the same level of accuracy, the CFPU provides 2.4x energy-delay product improvement compared to state-of-the-art approximate multipliers.","author":["Mohsen Imani","Daniel Peroni","Tajana Rosing"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 76","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062210"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"J.

Latent topic models, on the other hand, take a more global view, looking at the word distributions across the corpus to assign a topic to each word occurrence. These two paradigms are complementary in how they represent the meaning of word occurrences. While some previous works have already looked at using word embeddings for improving the quality of latent topics, and conversely, at using latent topics for improving word embeddings, such \"two-step'' methods cannot capture the mutual interaction between the two paradigms. In this paper, we propose STE, a framework which can learn word embeddings and latent topics in a unified manner. STE naturally obtains topic-specific word embeddings, and thus addresses the issue of polysemy. At the same time, it also learns the term distributions of the topics, and the topic distributions of the documents. Our experimental results demonstrate that the STE model can indeed generate useful topic-specific word embeddings and coherent latent topics in an effective and efficient way.","author":["Bei Shi","Wai Lam","Shoaib Jameel","Steven Schockaert","Kwun Ping Lai"],"issue":["SIGIR '17: Proceedings of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2017","Pages   375\u2013384","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080806"],"date":"07 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Ricardo Baeza-Yates, Berthier Ribeiro-Neto, and others. 1999.

As the performance density of traditional CPU-centric architectures stagnates, advancing compute capabilities necessitates novel architectural approaches. Near-memory processing (NMP) architectures are reemerging as promising candidates to improve computing efficiency through tight coupling of logic and memory. NMP architectures are especially fitting for data analytics, as they provide immense bandwidth to memory-resident data and dramatically reduce data movement, the main source of energy consumption. Modern data analytics operators are optimized for CPU execution and hence rely on large caches and employ random memory accesses. In the context of NMP, such random accesses result in wasteful DRAM row buffer activations that account for a significant fraction of the total memory access energy. In addition, utilizing NMP's ample bandwidth with fine-grained random accesses requires complex hardware that cannot be accommodated under NMP's tight area and power constraints. Our thesis is that efficient NMP calls for an algorithm-hardware co-design that favors algorithms with sequential accesses to enable simple hardware that accesses memory in streams. We introduce an instance of such a co-designed NMP architecture for data analytics, the Mondrian Data Engine. Compared to a CPU-centric and a baseline NMP system, the Mondrian Data Engine improves the performance of basic data analytics operators by up to 49x and 5x, and efficiency by up to 28x and 5x, respectively.","author":["Mario Drumond","Alexandros Daglis","Nooshin Mirzadeh","Dmitrii Ustiugov","Javier Picorel","Babak Falsafi","Boris Grot","Dionisios Pnevmatikatos"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   639\u2013651","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080233"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Daniel Abadi, Peter A.

To bridge the gap, two approaches, the memory-rich processor (more on-chip memory) and the compute-capable memory (processing-in-memory) have been studied. However, the first one has strong computing capability but limited memory capacity/bandwidth, whereas the second one is the exact the opposite. To address the challenge, we propose DRISA, a DRAM-based Reconfigurable In-Situ Accelerator architecture, to provide both powerful computing capability and large memory capacity/bandwidth. DRISA is primarily composed of DRAM memory arrays, in which every memory bitline can perform bitwise Boolean logic operations (such as NOR). DRISA can be reconfigured to compute various functions with the combination of the functionally complete Boolean logic operations and the proposed hierarchical internal data movement designs.We further optimize DRISA to achieve high performance by simultaneously activating multiple rows and subarrays to provide massive parallelism, unblocking the internal data movement bottlenecks, and optimizing activation latency and energy. We explore four design options and present a comprehensive case study to demonstrate significant acceleration of convolutional neural networks. The experimental results show that DRISA can achieve 8.8x speedup and 1.2x better energy efficiency compared with ASICs, and 7.7x speedup and 15x better energy efficiency over GPUs with integer operations.","author":["Shuangchen Li","Dimin Niu","Krishna T.

As the size of DNNs continues to grow, it is critical to improve the energy efficiency and performance while maintaining accuracy. For DNNs, the model size is an important factor affecting performance, scalability and energy efficiency. Weight pruning achieves good compression ratios but suffers from three drawbacks: 1) the irregular network structure after pruning, which affects performance and throughput; 2) the increased training complexity; and 3) the lack of rigirous guarantee of compression ratio and inference accuracy. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes CirCNN, a principled approach to represent weights and process neural networks using block-circulant matrices. CirCNN utilizes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based fast multiplication, simultaneously reducing the computational complexity (both in inference and training) from O(n2) to O(n log n) and the storage complexity from O(n2) to O(n), with negligible accuracy loss. Compared to other approaches, CirCNN is distinct due to its mathematical rigor: the DNNs based on CirCNN can converge to the same \"effectiveness\" as DNNs without compression. We propose the CirCNN architecture, a universal DNN inference engine that can be implemented in various hardware/software platforms with configurable network architecture (e.g., layer type, size, scales, etc.). In CirCNN architecture: 1) Due to the recursive property, FFT can be used as the key computing kernel, which ensures universal and small-footprint implementations. 2) The compressed but regular network structure avoids the pitfalls of the network pruning and facilitates high performance and throughput with highly pipelined and parallel design. To demonstrate the performance and energy efficiency, we test CirCNN in FPGA, ASIC and embedded processors. Our results show that CirCNN architecture achieves very high energy efficiency and performance with a small hardware footprint. Based on the FPGA implementation and ASIC synthesis results, CirCNN achieves 6 - 102X energy efficiency improvements compared with the best state-of-the-art results.","author":["Caiwen Ding","Siyu Liao","Yanzhi Wang","Zhe Li","Ning Liu","Youwei Zhuo","Chao Wang","Xuehai Qian","Yu Bai","Geng Yuan","Xiaolong Ma","Yipeng Zhang","Jian Tang","Qinru Qiu","Xue Lin","Bo Yuan"],"issue":["MICRO-50 '17: Proceedings of the 50th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","October 2017","Pages   395\u2013408","https://doi.org/10.1145/3123939.3124552"],"date":"14 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"J.

In this paper, we explore the problem of privacy-preserving predictions: after each prediction, the server learns nothing about clients' input and clients learn nothing about the model. We present MiniONN, the first approach for transforming an existing neural network to an oblivious neural network supporting privacy-preserving predictions with reasonable efficiency. Unlike prior work, MiniONN requires no change to how models are trained. To this end, we design oblivious protocols for commonly used operations in neural network prediction models. We show that MiniONN outperforms existing work in terms of response latency and message sizes.

The critical insight behind GETT is the identification of three index sets, involved in the tensor contraction, which enable us to systematically reduce an arbitrary tensor contraction to loops around a highly tuned \u201cmacro-kernel.\u201d This macro-kernel operates on suitably prepared (\u201cpacked\u201d) sub-tensors that reside in a specified level of the cache hierarchy. In contrast to previous approaches to tensor contractions, GETT exhibits desirable features such as unit-stride memory accesses, cache-awareness, as well as full vectorization, without requiring auxiliary memory. We integrate GETT alongside the so-called Transpose\u2013Transpose-GEMM-Transpose and Loops-over-GEMM approaches into an open source \u201cTensor Contraction Code Generator.\u201d The performance results for a wide range of tensor contractions suggest that GETT has the potential of becoming the method of choice: While GETT exhibits excellent performance across the board, its effectiveness for bandwidth-bound tensor contractions is especially impressive, outperforming existing approaches by up to 12.4\u00d7. More precisely, GETT achieves speedups of up to 1.41\u00d7 over an equivalent-sized GEMM for bandwidth-bound tensor contractions while attaining up to 91.3% of peak floating-point performance for compute-bound tensor contractions.","author":["Paul Springer","Paolo Bientinesi"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software","Volume 44","Issue 3","April 2018","Article No.: 28","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/3157733"],"date":"03 January 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u0131n Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen, Craig Citro, Greg S.

For this purpose, we study the energy efficiency of a hybrid FPGA-CPU device that can switch task execution between hardware and software with a focus on periodic tasks. To increase the applicability of this task switching, we also consider the voltage and frequency scaling (VFS) applied to the FPGA to reduce the system energy consumption. We show that in some cases, if the task\u2019s period is higher than a specific level, the FPGA accelerator cannot reduce the energy consumption associated to the task and the software version is the most energy efficient option. We have applied the proposed techniques to a robot map creation algorithm as a case study which shows up to 38% energy reduction compared to the FPGA implementation. Overall, experimental results show up to 48% energy reduction by applying the proposed techniques at runtime on 13 individual tasks.","author":["Mohammad Hosseinabady","Jose Luis Nunez-Yanez"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 17","Issue 3","June 2018","Article No.: 63","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/3182172"],"date":"22 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"J.

MCMC samplers are used in machine learning, image and signal processing applications that are computationally intensive. In such scenarios, high-throughput samplers are of paramount importance. To achieve a high-throughput platform, we add two domain-specific instructions with dedicated hardware whose functions are extensively used in MCMC algorithms. These instructions bring down the number of clock cycles needed to implement the respective functions by 10x and 21x. A 64-cluster architecture of the MC3A is fully placed and routed in 65 nm, TSMC CMOS technology, where the VLSI layout of each cluster occupies an area of 0.577 mm^2 while consuming a power of 247 mW running at 1 GHz clock frequency. Our proposed MC3A achieves 6x higher throughput than its equivalent predecessor (PENC) and consumes 4x lower energy per sample. Also, when compared to other off-the-shelf platforms, such as Jetson TX1 and TX2 SoC, MC3A results in 195x and 191x higher throughput and consumes 808x and 726x lower energy per sample generation, respectively.","author":["Lahir Marni","Morteza Hosseini","Tinoosh Mohsenin"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '18: Proceedings of the 2018 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2018","Pages   165\u2013170","https://doi.org/10.1145/3194554.3194577"],"date":"30 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"T.

Thus, it also draws a lot of attentions on how to adopt and enable polar codes in storage applications. However, the code construction and encoding length limitation issues obstruct the adoption of polar codes in flash storage devices. To enable polar codes in flash storage devices, we propose a proactive channel adjustment design to extend the effective time of a code construction to improve the error correction capability of polar codes. This design pro-actively tunes the quality of the critical flash cells to maintain the correctness of the code construction and relax the constraint of the encoding length limitation, so that polar codes can be enabled in flash storage devices. A series of experiments demonstrates that the proposed design can effectively improve the error correction capability of polar codes in flash storage devices.","author":["Kun-Cheng Hsu","Che-Wei Tsao","Yuan-Hao Chang","Tei-Wei Kuo","Yu-Ming Huang"],"issue":["DAC '18: Proceedings of the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2018","Article No.: 117","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3196095"],"date":"24 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"E.

However, most graph processing applications suffer from large memory overhead due to random memory accesses. Such random memory access pattern provides little temporal and spatial locality which cannot be accelerated by the conventional hierarchical memory system. In this work, we propose GAS, a heterogeneous memory architecture, to accelerate graph applications implemented in message-based vertex program model, which is widely used in various graph processing systems. GAS utilizes the specialized content-addressable memory (CAM) to store random data, and determine exact access patterns by a series of associative search. Thus, GAS not only removes the inefficiency of random accesses but also reduces the memory access latency by accurate prefetching. We test the efficiency of GAS with three important graph processing kernels on five well-known graphs. Our experimental results show that GAS can significantly reduce cache miss rate and improve the bandwidth utilization as compared to a conventional system with a state-of-the-art graph-specific prefetching mechanism. These enhancements result in 34% and 27% reduction in energy consumption and execution time, respectively.","author":["Minxuan Zhou","Mohsen Imani","Saransh Gupta","Tajana Rosing"],"issue":["ISLPED '18: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","July 2018","Article No.: 27","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3218603.3218631"],"date":"23 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Y.

The proposed two-layer design makes use of additional transistors over the SRAM layer to enable assist techniques as well as provide logic functions (such as AND/NAND, OR/NOR, XNOR/XOR) without degrading cell density. Through analysis, we provide insights into the benefits provided by three memory assist and two logic modes and evaluate the energy efficiency of our proposed design. Assist techniques improve SRAM read stability by 2.2x and increase the write margin by 17.6%, while staying within the SRAM footprint. By virtue of increased robustness, the cell enables seamless operation at lower supply voltages and thereby ensures energy efficiency. Energy Delay Product (EDP) reduces by 1.6x over standard 6T SRAM with a faster data access. Transistor placement and their biasing technique in layer-2 enables In-memory bitwise Boolean computation. When computing bulk In-memory operations, 6.5x energy savings is achieved as compared to computing outside the memory system.","author":["Srivatsa Srinivasa","Akshay Krishna Ramanathan","Xueqing Li","Wei-Hao Chen","Fu-Kuo Hsueh","Chih-Chao Yang","Chang-Hong Shen","Jia-Min Shieh","Sumeet Gupta","Meng-Fan Marvin Chang","Swaroop Ghosh","Jack Sampson","Vijaykrishnan Narayanan"],"issue":["ISLPED '18: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","July 2018","Article No.: 34","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3218603.3218645"],"date":"23 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"David Patterson et al., 1997.

The existing methods show that the high-order proximity plays a key role in capturing the underlying structure of the network. However, two fundamental problems in preserving the high-order proximity remain unsolved. First, all the existing methods can only preserve fixed-order proximities, despite that proximities of different orders are often desired for distinct networks and target applications. Second, given a certain order proximity, the existing methods cannot guarantee accuracy and efficiency simultaneously. To address these challenges, we propose AROPE (arbitrary-order proximity preserved embedding), a novel network embedding method based on SVD framework. We theoretically prove the eigen-decomposition reweighting theorem, revealing the intrinsic relationship between proximities of different orders. With this theorem, we propose a scalable eigen-decomposition solution to derive the embedding vectors and shift them between proximities of arbitrary orders. Theoretical analysis is provided to guarantee that i) our method has a low marginal cost in shifting the embedding vectors across different orders, ii) given a certain order, our method can get the global optimal solutions, and iii) the overall time complexity of our method is linear with respect to network size. Extensive experimental results on several large-scale networks demonstrate that our proposed method greatly and consistently outperforms the baselines in various tasks including network reconstruction, link prediction and node classification.","author":["Ziwei Zhang","Peng Cui","Xiao Wang","Jian Pei","Xuanrong Yao","Wenwu Zhu"],"issue":["KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2018","Pages   2778\u20132786","https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3219969"],"date":"19 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mikhail Belkin and Partha Niyogi . 2002.

The cloud-based solution is a promising approach to enabling deep learning applications on mobile devices where the large portions of a DNN are offloaded to the cloud. However, revealing data to the cloud leads to potential privacy risk. To benefit from the cloud data center without the privacy risk, we design, evaluate, and implement a cloud-based framework ARDEN which partitions the DNN across mobile devices and cloud data centers. A simple data transformation is performed on the mobile device, while the resource-hungry training and the complex inference rely on the cloud data center. To protect the sensitive information, a lightweight privacy-preserving mechanism consisting of arbitrary data nullification and random noise addition is introduced, which provides strong privacy guarantee. A rigorous privacy budget analysis is given. Nonetheless, the private perturbation to the original data inevitably has a negative impact on the performance of further inference on the cloud side. To mitigate this influence, we propose a noisy training method to enhance the cloud-side network robustness to perturbed data. Through the sophisticated design, ARDEN can not only preserve privacy but also improve the inference performance. To validate the proposed ARDEN, a series of experiments based on three image datasets and a real mobile application are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ARDEN. Finally, we implement ARDEN on a demo system to verify its practicality.","author":["Ji Wang","Jianguo Zhang","Weidong Bao","Xiaomin Zhu","Bokai Cao","Philip S.

Yet, unlike existing technologies, e.g., WiFi, mmWave radios require highly directional antennas. Since the antennas have pencil-beams, the transmitter and receiver need to align their beams before they can communicate. Existing systems scan the space to find the best alignment. Such a process has been shown to introduce up to seconds of delay, and is unsuitable for wireless networks where an access point has to quickly switch between users and accommodate mobile clients. This paper presents Agile-Link, a new protocol that can find the best mmWave beam alignment without scanning the space. Given all possible directions for setting the antenna beam, Agile-Link provably finds the optimal direction in logarithmic number of measurements. Further, Agile-Link works within the existing 802.11ad standard for mmWave LAN, and can support both clients and access points. We have implemented Agile-Link in a mmWave radio and evaluated it empirically. Our results show that it reduces beam alignment delay by orders of magnitude. In particular, for highly directional mmWave devices operating under 802.11ad, the delay drops from over a second to 2.5 ms.","author":["Haitham Hassanieh","Omid Abari","Michael Rodriguez","Mohammed Abdelghany","Dina Katabi","Piotr Indyk"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '18: Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication","August 2018","Pages   432\u2013445","https://doi.org/10.1145/3230543.3230581"],"date":"07 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"{n. d.}.","order":1},{"text":"2015. 5G Vision White Paper - Samsung.

Few-shot adaptation provides robust parameter estimation with few training examples, by optimizing the parameters of zero-shot learning and supervised many-shot learning simultaneously. In this method, first we build a zero-shot detector, and then update it by using the few examples. Our experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed framework on three datasets: TRECVID Semantic Indexing 2010, 2014, and ImageNET. On the ImageNET dataset, we show that our method outperforms recent few-shot learning methods. On the TRECVID 2014 dataset, we achieve 15.19~% and 35.98~% in Mean Average Precision under the zero-shot condition and the supervised condition, respectively.

Inside such a chip, fluid volumes of nanoliter size are transported between devices for various operations, such as mixing and detection. The transportation channels and corresponding operation devices are controlled by microvalves driven by external pressure sources. Since assigning an independent pressure source to every microvalve would be impractical due to high costs and limited system dimensions, states of microvalves are switched using a control logic by time multiplexing. Existing control logic designs, however, still switch only a single control channel per operation --- leading to a low efficiency. In this paper, we propose the first automatic synthesis approach for a control logic that is able to switch multiple control channels simultaneously to reduce the overall switching time of valve states. In addition, we propose the first fault-aware design in control logic to introduce redundant control paths to maintain the correct function even when manufacturing defects occur. Compared with the existing direct connection method, the proposed multi-channel switching mechanism can reduce the switching time of valve states by up to 64%. In addition, all control paths for fault tolerance have been realized.","author":["Ying Zhu","Bing Li","Tsung-Yi Ho","Qin Wang","Hailong Yao","Robert Wille","Ulf Schlichtmann"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 123","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240830"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"J.

They demand the flexibility to distribute data effectively and provide high I/O performance. The consistent hashing algorithm is widely used in parallel/distributed file systems due to its decentralized design, scalability, and adaptability to node changes. However, it lacks efficiency in a heterogeneous environment where different storage devices, e.g. hard disk drives and solid state drives, co-exist. In this study, we propose an attributed consistent hashing (attributedCH), to overcome this deficiency. AttributedCH manages heterogeneous nodes on a consistent hashing ring and maintains attributes for each node to characterize distinct node features. It divides the hash ring into sectors and selects nodes from the sector with a comprehensive selection strategy. By considering different attributes, attributedCH achieves adaptive and efficient data placement for heterogeneous storage systems. We have carried out extensive evaluations and the evaluation results confirm that the attributedCH overcomes the deficiency of existing consistent hashing algorithms well and is particularly suitable for heterogeneous storage systems.","author":["Jiang Zhou","Yong Chen","Weiping Wang"],"issue":["PACT '18: Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","November 2018","Article No.: 23","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/3243176.3243202"],"date":"01 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"P.

With its large number of antennas, the number of signals that need to be processed is dramatic. One important element of the SKA\u2019s Central Signal Processor package is pulsar search. This article focuses on the FPGA-based acceleration of the Frequency-Domain Acceleration Search module, which is a part of SKA pulsar search engine. In this module, the frequency-domain input signals have to be processed by 85 Finite Impulse response (FIR) filters within a short period of limitation and for thousands of input arrays. Because of the large scale of the input length and FIR filter size, even high-end FPGA devices cannot parallelise the task completely. We start by investigating both time-domain FIR filter (TDFIR) and frequency-domain FIR filter (FDFIR) to tackle this task. We applied the overlap-add algorithm to split the coefficient array of TDFIR and the overlap-save algorithm to split the input signals of FDFIR. To achieve fast prototyping design, we employed OpenCL, which is a high-level FPGA development technique. The performance and power consumption are evaluated using multiple FPGA devices simultaneously and compared with GPU results, which is achieved by porting FPGA-based OpenCL kernels. The experimental evaluation shows that the FDFIR solution is very competitive in terms of performance, with a clear energy consumption advantage over the GPU solution.","author":["Haomiao Wang","Prabu Thiagaraj","Oliver Sinnen"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 11","Issue 4","January 2019","Article No.: 24","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/3268933"],"date":"09 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Mohamed S.

No doubt to say, the data privacy of these deep learning systems is a serious concern. Different from previous research focusing on exploiting privacy leakage from deep learning models, in this paper, we present the first attack on the implementation of deep learning models. To be specific, we perform the attack on an FPGA-based convolutional neural network accelerator and we manage to recover the input image from the collected power traces without knowing the detailed parameters in the neural network. For the MNIST dataset, our power side-channel attack is able to achieve up to 89% recognition accuracy.","author":["Lingxiao Wei","Bo Luo","Yu Li","Yannan Liu","Qiang Xu"],"issue":["ACSAC '18: Proceedings of the 34th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference","December 2018","Pages   393\u2013406","https://doi.org/10.1145/3274694.3274696"],"date":"03 December 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Andy Chu, Ian J.

In this scenario, the network model is exposed to the risk of being attacked in the unverified devices if the parameters and hyper-parameters are transmitted and processed in an unencrypted way. Our work tackles this security problem by using on-chip memory Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and Processing-In-Memory (PIM). We allow the model execution only on authorized devices and protect the model from white-box attacks, black-box attacks and model tampering attacks. The proposed PUFs-and-PIM based Protection method for neural Models (P3M), can utilize unstable PUFs to protect the neural models in edge deep learning accelerators with negligible performance overhead.

With the emerging technologies, such as bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), attention mechanisms, and beam-search algorithms, NMT can deliver improved translation quality compared to the conventional statistics-based methods, especially for translating long sentences. However, higher translation quality means more complicated models, higher computation/memory demands, and longer translation time, which causes difficulties for practical use. In this paper, we propose a design methodology for implementing the inference of a real-life NMT (with the problem size = 172 GFLOP) on FPGA for improved run time latency and energy efficiency. We use High-Level Synthesis (HLS) to build high-performance parameterized IPs for handling the most basic operations (multiply-accumulations) and construct these IPs to accelerate the matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) kernels, which are frequently used in NMT. Also, we perform a design space exploration by considering both computation resources and memory access bandwidth when utilizing the hardware parallelism in the model and generate the best parameter configurations of the proposed IPs. Accordingly, we propose a novel hybrid parallel structure for accelerating the NMT with affordable resource overhead for the targeted FPGA. Our design is demonstrated on a Xilinx VCU118 with overall performance at 7.16 GFLOPS.","author":["Qin Li","Xiaofan Zhang","JinJun Xiong","Wen-mei Hwu","Deming Chen"],"issue":["ASPDAC '19: Proceedings of the 24th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2019","Pages   693\u2013698","https://doi.org/10.1145/3287624.3287717"],"date":"21 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Nal Kalchbrenner and Phil Blunsom.

However, the high computational complexity of CNNs presents a critical challenge towards their broader adoption in real-time and power-efficient scenarios. FPGAs are poised to take a significant role for high-performance and energy-efficient computation of CNNs for both mobile (e.g., UAVs, self-driving cars, and IoT devices) and cloud computing domains. However, implementing an effective CNN system onto FPGAs efficiently remains problematic. The current cloud-based FPGAs with unique design constraints and architectural characteristics further increase the challenges. To address these challenges, we propose a novel open-source automated tool chain called Cloud-DNN. Our tool chain takes trained CNN models specified in Caffe as input, performs a set of transformations, and maps the model to a cloud-based FPGA. Cloud-DNN can significantly improve the overall design productivity of CNNs on FPGAs while satisfying the emergent computational requirements. Our design provides an alternative solution compared to other cloud-based options (e.g., GPUs or TPUs) while offering flexible, and high performance DNN inferences. The unique features of Cloud-DNN include the optimizations with cloud-platform characteristics and the support of easier and streamlined implementation. Experimental results demonstrate up to 104.55x performance improvement when compared to CPU implementation and comparable usability, flexibility, and strong quality compared to other state-of-the-art DNN inference implementations on standalone FPGAs.","author":["Yao Chen","Jiong He","Xiaofan Zhang","Cong Hao","Deming Chen"],"issue":["FPGA '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2019","Pages   73\u201382","https://doi.org/10.1145/3289602.3293915"],"date":"20 February 2019","ref":[{"text":"Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton.

In recent years, it has gained significant momentum among industrial and research communities. Patented by Semtech, LoRa makes use of chirp spread spectrum modulation to deliver data with promises of long battery life, far-reaching communication distances, and a high node density at the cost of data rate. In this article, we conduct a series of experiments to verify the claims made by Semtech on LoRa technology. Our results show that LoRa is capable of communicating over 10km under line-of-sight environments. However, under non-line-of-sight environments, LoRa\u2019s performance is severely affected by obstructions such as buildings and vegetations. Moreover, the promise of prolonged battery life requires extreme tuning of parameters. Last, a LoRa gateway supports up to 6,000 nodes with PRR requirement of >70%. This study also explores the relationship between LoRa transmission parameters and proposes an algorithm to determine optimal settings in terms of coverage and power consumption under non-line-of-sight environments. It further investigates the impact of LoRa Wide-area Networks on energy consumption and network capacity along with implementation of a LoRa medium access mechanism and possible gains brought forth by implementing such a mechanism.","author":["Jansen C.

Synthesis and verification processes are invoked in each iteration to evaluate the found solutions and to guide the search algorithm. As a result, a large number of approximate circuits is subjected to analysis - leading to long runtimes - but only a few approximate circuits might form an acceptable solution. In this paper, we present our Jump Search (JS) method which seeks to reduce the runtime of an approximation process by reducing the number of expensive synthesis and verification steps. To reduce the runtime, JS computes impact factors for each approximation candidate in the circuit to create a selection of approximate circuits without invoking synthesis or verification processes. We denote the selection as path from which JS determines the final solution. In our experimental results, JS achieved speed-ups of up to 57x while area savings remain comparable to the reference search method, Simulated Annealing.","author":["Linus Witschen","Hassan Ghasemzadeh Mohammadi","Matthias Artmann","Marco Platzner"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '19: Proceedings of the 2019 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2019","Pages   153\u2013158","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299874.3317998"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Muhammad Awais, Hassan Ghasemzadeh Mohammadi, and Marco Platzner. 2018.

Furthermore, the hardware deployed for Internet of Things (IoT) applications need to process ever growing volumes of data, which can further exacerbate the \"memory wall\". Computing-in-memory (CiM) architectures, where logic and arithmetic operations are performed in memory, can significantly reduce energy and latency overheads associated with data transfer, and potentially alleviate processor-memory bottlenecks. In this paper, we consider the utility of ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) arrays and CiM arrays based on ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs) to support emerging machine learning models that can learn new classes of data with significantly less training overhead - highly desirable in IoT applications. Architecturally, we use TCAM and CiM arrays to implement the external memory module in a memory enhanced neural network (MENN) - which can be used to minimize catastrophic forgetting - a major problem in applications such as lifelong and few-shot learning. As a representative example, we achieve 95.14% accuracy for a few-shot learning task with the Omniglot data set by using a combined L\u221e infinity and L1 distance metric computed via a TCAM-CiM cascaded architecture (as opposed to 99.06% accuracy assuming a GPU backed by DRAM). While there is a slight drop in accuracy, the TCAM-CiM approach is 4.34X faster and 4.18X more energy efficient than a CMOS implementation for the same task. The ability of an FeFET to serve as both a compact logic and storage element helps to enable dense CiM and TCAM structures that drive the aforementioned improvements to application-level figures of merit (FOMs).","author":["Ann Franchesca Laguna","Xunzhao Yin","Dayane Reis","Michael Niemier","X.

Such capabilities can be enabled with deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), but it remains difficult to execute large networks on mobile devices. Offloading object detection to the edge or cloud is also very challenging due to the stringent requirements on high detection accuracy and low end-to-end latency. The long latency of existing offloading techniques can significantly reduce the detection accuracy due to changes in the user's view. To address the problem, we design a system that enables high accuracy object detection for commodity AR/MR system running at 60fps. The system employs low latency offloading techniques, decouples the rendering pipeline from the offloading pipeline, and uses a fast object tracking method to maintain detection accuracy. The result shows that the system can improve the detection accuracy by 20.2%-34.8% for the object detection and human keypoint detection tasks, and only requires 2.24ms latency for object tracking on the AR device. Thus, the system leaves more time and computational resources to render virtual elements for the next frame and enables higher quality AR/MR experiences.","author":["Luyang Liu","Hongyu Li","Marco Gruteser"],"issue":["MobiCom '19: The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking","August 2019","Article No.: 25","Pages   1\u201316","https://doi.org/10.1145/3300061.3300116"],"date":"05 August 2019","ref":[{"text":"Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality Device Sales to Hit 99 Million Devices in 2021. http://www.capacitymedia.com/Article/3755961/VR-and-AR-device-shipments-to-hit-99m-by-2021.","order":1},{"text":"The reality of VR/AR growth. https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/11/the-reality-of-vrar-growth/.","order":2},{"text":"Microsoft HoloLens. https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/.","order":3},{"text":"Magic Leap One. https://www.magicleap.com/.","order":4},{"text":"Ross Girshick, Ilija Radosavovic, Georgia Gkioxari, Piotr Doll\u00e1r,and Kaiming He.

However, these gains have yet to be fully demonstrated in real world clinical settings. In this paper, we describe a human-centered study of a deep learning system used in clinics for the detection of diabetic eye disease. From interviews and observation across eleven clinics in Thailand, we characterize current eye-screening workflows, user expectations for an AI-assisted screening process, and post-deployment experiences. Our findings indicate that several socio-environmental factors impact model performance, nursing workflows, and the patient experience. We draw on these findings to reflect on the value of conducting human-centered evaluative research alongside prospective evaluations of model accuracy.","author":["Emma Beede","Elizabeth Baylor","Fred Hersch","Anna Iurchenko","Lauren Wilcox","Paisan Ruamviboonsuk","Laura M.

Compared to 2D convolutions that share the filters in 2D spatial domain, 3D convolutions further reuse filters in the temporal dimension to capture time-domain features. Prior works on specialized 3D-CNN accelerators employ additional on-chip memories and multi-cluster architecture to reuse data among the process element (PE) arrays, which is too expensive for low-power chips. Instead of harvesting in-memory locality, we propose a 3D systolic cube architecture to exploit the spatial-and-temporal localities of 3D CNNs, which moves the reusable data in-between PEs connected via a 3D-cube Network-on-Chip. Evaluation shows that systolic-cube contributes to considerable energy-efficiency boost for activity-recognition benchmarks.","author":["Yongchen Wang","Ying Wang","Huawei Li","Cong Shi","Xiaowei Li"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 210","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317919"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"K.

However, the success of DNNs depends on the proper configuration of its architecture and hyperparameters. Such a configuration is difficult and as a result, DNNs are often not used to their full potential. In addition, DNNs in commercial applications often need to satisfy real-world design constraints such as size or number of parameters. To make configuration easier, automatic machine learning (AutoML) systems for deep learning have been developed, focusing mostly on optimization of hyperparameters. This paper takes AutoML a step further. It introduces an evolutionary AutoML framework called LEAF that not only optimizes hyperparameters but also network architectures and the size of the network. LEAF makes use of both state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and distributed computing frameworks. Experimental results on medical image classification and natural language analysis show that the framework can be used to achieve state-of-the-art performance. In particular, LEAF demonstrates that architecture optimization provides a significant boost over hyperparameter optimization, and that networks can be minimized at the same time with little drop in performance. LEAF therefore forms a foundation for democratizing and improving AI, as well as making AI practical in future applications.","author":["Jason Liang","Elliot Meyerson","Babak Hodjat","Dan Fink","Karl Mutch","Risto Miikkulainen"],"issue":["GECCO '19: Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference","July 2019","Pages   401\u2013409","https://doi.org/10.1145/3321707.3321721"],"date":"13 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"2017.

Existing black-box approaches to generating adversarial examples typically require a significant number of queries, either for training a substitute network or performing gradient estimation. We introduce GenAttack, a gradient-free optimization technique that uses genetic algorithms for synthesizing adversarial examples in the black-box setting. Our experiments on different datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet) show that GenAttack can successfully generate visually imperceptible adversarial examples against state-of-the-art image recognition models with orders of magnitude fewer queries than previous approaches. Against MNIST and CIFAR-10 models, GenAttack required roughly 2,126 and 2,568 times fewer queries respectively, than ZOO, the prior state-of-the-art black-box attack. In order to scale up the attack to large-scale high-dimensional ImageNet models, we perform a series of optimizations that further improve the query efficiency of our attack leading to 237 times fewer queries against the Inception-v3 model than ZOO. Furthermore, we show that GenAttack can successfully attack some state-of-the-art ImageNet defenses, including ensemble adversarial training and non-differentiable or randomized input transformations. Our results suggest that evolutionary algorithms open up a promising area of research into effective black-box attacks.","author":["Moustafa Alzantot","Yash Sharma","Supriyo Chakraborty","Huan Zhang","Cho-Jui Hsieh","Mani B.

It is therefore important that people can intuitively understand the behavior of robots. Oftentimes, the behavior of people is used as a model because of its familiarity. However, it is as yet unclear what the best approach is to design interaction behaviors for non-humanoid robots. In this article, we explore two different approaches toward designing behavior for a service robot. The first concerns the commonly used approach of copying human behavior as closely as possible to the robot (human-translated). The second approach was inspired by product design methods. The design of the robot's behavior was optimized for the robot's interaction capabilities and hardware modalities (robot-optimized). To evaluate people's responses to the two behavior sets for a tour guide robot, an online video study (N = 204) and a two-day in-the-wild study (N > 600) were performed. Results showed that participants responded slightly more positive to robot-optimized behavior and paid attention to robot-optimized behavior for longer. However, participants remembered more details when the robot showed human-translated behavior. Together, the studies show that it is sometimes better for non-humanoid robots to have robot-optimized behaviors rather than human-translated behaviors.","author":["Daphne E. Karreman","Geke D. S.

These embeddings are often used to perform tasks such as knowledge graph completion, question answering and inference. Knowledge graph embedding methods aid in the representation of entities and relationships of a knowledge graph in continuous vector spaces. However, most existing techniques ignore the inherent hierarchical structure of entities present in the knowledge graph, defined by ontological relationships between entity types. This paper introduces a novel score function called GrCluster that helps fill that gap. GrCluster is a simple, intuitive and efficient scoring function that incorporates the entity hierarchical correlation into existing knowledge graph embeddings. The effectiveness of GrCluster is demonstrated by integrating it into several well known embedding models. The experimental results show consistent improvements across metrics and embedding models for the tasks of entity prediction and triplet classification.","author":["Varun Ranganathan","Siddharth Suresh","Yash Mathur","Natarajan Subramanyam","Denilson Barbosa"],"issue":["SAC '20: Proceedings of the 35th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing","March 2020","Pages   964\u2013971","https://doi.org/10.1145/3341105.3373978"],"date":"30 March 2020","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, Manjunath Kudlur, Josh Levenberg, Rajat Monga, Sherry Moore, Derek G.

The main idea is to improve the performance of the communication system by adding diversity in a conventional polar coding scheme.

For instance, gains of 8 dB in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio can be obtained with the proposed system considering a code length of N=1024 and a bit error probability of 10^-3.","author":["Waslon T.

The two types of graphs can contain distinct and complementary information for the same entities/nodes. However, previous works focus either on knowledge graph embedding or behavior graph embedding while few works consider both in a unified way. Here we present BEM, a Bayesian framework that incorporates the information from knowledge graphs and behavior graphs. To be more specific, BEM takes as prior the pre-trained embeddings from the knowledge graph, and integrates them with the pre-trained embeddings from the behavior graphs via a Bayesian generative model. BEM is able to mutually refine the embeddings from both sides while preserving their own topological structures. To show the superiority of our method, we conduct a range of experiments on three benchmark datasets: node classification, link prediction, triplet classification on two small datasets related to Freebase, and item recommendation on a large-scale e-commerce dataset.","author":["Yuting Ye","Xuwu Wang","Jiangchao Yao","Kunyang Jia","Jingren Zhou","Yanghua Xiao","Hongxia Yang"],"issue":["CIKM '19: Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2019","Pages   679\u2013688","https://doi.org/10.1145/3357384.3358014"],"date":"03 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"P.

How- ever, compiling and mapping an SNN to the hardware is challenging, especially when compute and storage resources of the hardware (viz. crossbars) need to be shared among the neurons and synapses of the SNN. We propose an approach to analyze and compile SNNs on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware, providing guarantees on key performance metrics such as execution time and throughput. Our approach makes the following three key contributions. First, we propose a greedy technique to partition an SNN into clusters of neurons and synapses such that each cluster can fit on to the resources of a crossbar. Second, we exploit the rich semantics and expressiveness of Synchronous Dataflow Graphs (SDFGs) to represent a clustered SNN and analyze its performance using Max-Plus Algebra, considering the available compute and storage capacities, buffer sizes, and communication bandwidth. Third, we propose a self-timed execution-based fast technique to compile and admit SNN-based applications to a neuromorphic hardware at run-time, adapting dynamically to the available resources on the hard- ware. We evaluate our approach with standard SNN-based applications and demonstrate a significant performance improvement compared to current practices.","author":["Shihao Song","Adarsha Balaji","Anup Das","Nagarajan Kandasamy","James Shackleford"],"issue":["LCTES '20: The 21st ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED Conference on Languages, Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems","June 2020","Pages   38\u201350","https://doi.org/10.1145/3372799.3394364"],"date":"16 June 2020","ref":[{"text":"Mart'in Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, et almbox. 2016.

The strengths of the GPL approach to circuit design have been demonstrated by JHDL, a Java-based circuit design environment used to develop several large FPGA-based applications at several institutions. Major strengths of the JHDL environment include a common run-time for both simulation and hardware execution, and the overall extensibility of the parent Java environment. The common run-time environment means that all validation and support software (testbenches, application-specific interfaces, graphical user interfaces, etc.) can be used without modification with the built-in simulator or with the executing application as it runs in hardware. Extensibility also plays a big role because designers can easily add new capability to the environment by writing additional tools in the parent language, Java, using the wide variety of available libraries. This paper gives a brief introduction to JHDL syntax and demonstrates its features with an end-to-end application example.","author":["Brad L. Hutchings","Brent E.

Profiling these bottlenecks requires both high-fidelity introspection and the ability to run sufficiently many cycles to execute complex software stacks, a challenging combination. In this work, we enable agile full-system performance optimization for hardware/software systems with FirePerf, a set of novel out-of-band system-level performance profiling capabilities integrated into the open-source FireSim FPGA-accelerated hardware simulation platform. Using out-of-band call stack reconstruction and automatic performance counter insertion, FirePerf enables introspecting into hardware and software at appropriate abstraction levels to rapidly identify opportunities for software optimization and hardware specialization, without disrupting end-to-end system behavior like traditional profiling tools. We demonstrate the capabilities of FirePerf with a case study that optimizes the hardware/software stack of an open-source RISC-V SoC with an Ethernet NIC to achieve 8x end-to-end improvement in achievable bandwidth for networking applications running on Linux. We also deploy a RISC-V Linux kernel optimization discovered with FirePerf on commercial RISC-V silicon, resulting in up to 1.72x improvement in network performance.","author":["Sagar Karandikar","Albert Ou","Alon Amid","Howard Mao","Randy Katz","Borivoje Nikoli\u0107","Krste Asanovi\u0107"],"issue":["ASPLOS '20: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2020","Pages   715\u2013731","https://doi.org/10.1145/3373376.3378455"],"date":"09 March 2020","ref":[{"text":"2018.

Existing PIM solutions require a number of additional procedures during the setup-time, including code re-writing and re-compiling, code annotations, and detailed program profiling, etc. These requirements, however, potentially prevent existing executable binaries benefiting from PIM architectures. For old binary legacies without any source code, it is impossible to run them on existing PIM architectures. To solve these challenges, we propose a transparent and universal PIM (TUPIM), a novel PIM architecture that can execute unmodified binaries and at the same time take advantages of PIM. TUPIM is a significant advance over the state-of-the-art because it transparently expends the scope of PIM to deploy all applications without any source code, programming models, or compiler modifications. Experiments show that TUPIM can get 2.2x speedup on average (up to 3.67x) and 15.7% energy reduction, compared with conventional CPU-only executions.","author":["Sheng Xu","Xiaoming Chen","Xuehai Qian","Yinhe Han"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '20: Proceedings of the 2020 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","September 2020","Pages   199\u2013204","https://doi.org/10.1145/3386263.3406896"],"date":"07 September 2020","ref":[{"text":"J.

The DNN accuracy, affected by such approximations, can be then effectively improved through retraining. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for modelling the approximation error introduced by approximate hardware in DNNs, which accelerates retraining and achieves negligible accuracy loss. To this end, we implement the behavioral simulation of several approximate multipliers and model the error generated by such approximations on pre-trained DNNs for image classification on CIFAR10 and ImageNet. Finally, we optimize the DNN parameters by applying our error model during DNN retraining, to recover the accuracy lost due to approximations. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed method for accelerated retraining (11 x faster for CIFAR10 and 8x faster for ImageNet) for full DNN approximation, which allows us to deploy approximate multipliers with energy savings of up to 36% for 8-bit precision DNNs with an accuracy loss lower than 1%.","author":["Cecilia De la Parra","Andre Guntoro","Akash Kumar"],"issue":["ASPDAC '21: Proceedings of the 26th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2021","Pages   365\u2013371","https://doi.org/10.1145/3394885.3431533"],"date":"18 January 2021","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, et al. 2015.

One promising technique for overcoming this problem is Thread-Level Speculation (TLS), which enables the compiler to optimistically create parallel threads despite uncertainty as to whether those threads are actually independent. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a design for supporting TLS that seamlessly scales to any machine size because it is a straightforward extension of writeback invalidation-based cache coherence (which itself scales both up and down). Our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme performs well on both single-chip multiprocessors and on larger-scale machines where communication latencies are twenty times larger.","author":["J.

Much of the energy has focused on refining the initial efforts at predicting load instruction outcomes, with the balance of the effort examining the value locality of either all register-writing instructions, or a focused subset of them. Surprisingly, there has been very little published characterization of or effort to exploit the value locality of data words stored to memory by computer programs. This paper presents such a characterization, proposes both memory-centric (based on message passing) and producer-centric (based on program structure) prediction mechanisms for stored data values, introduces the concept of silent stores and new definitions of multiprocessor false sharing based on these observations, and suggests new techniques for aligning cache coherence protocols and microarchitectural store handling techniques to exploit the value locality of stores. We find that realistic implementations of these techniques can significantly reduce multiprocessor data bus traffic and are more effective at reducing address bus traffic than the addition of Exclusive state to a MSI coherence protocol. We also show that squashing of silent stores can provide uniprocessor speedups greater than the addition of store-to-load forwarding.","author":["Kevin M. Lepak","Mikko H.

LWQ does morphological disambiguation in two steps: First, it defines all solution candidates of an ambiguous word using a morphological analyzer; second, it chooses the best candidate according to its total distances to neighbor words that are not ambiguous. To show LWQ's performance, we have conducted many tests on the corpus by considering the consistency of classification.

It has become a new workload family member in data-centers. GNN works on irregular graph-structured data with three distinct phases: Combination, Graph Processing, and Aggregation. While Combination phase has been well supported by sgemm kernels in cuBLAS, the other two phases are still inefficient on GPGPU due to the lack of optimized CUDA kernels. In particular, Aggregation phase introduces large volume of DRAM storage footprint and data movement, and both Aggregation and Graph Processing phases suffer from high kernel launching time. These inefficiencies not only decrease training throughput but also limit users from training GNNs on larger graphs on GPGPU. Although these problems have been partially alleviated by recent studies, their optimizations are still not sufficient. In this paper, we propose fuseGNN, an extension of PyTorch that provides highly optimized APIs and CUDA kernels for GNN. First, two different programming abstractions for Aggregation phase are utilized to handle graphs with different average degrees. Second, dedicated GPGPU kernels are developed for Aggregation and Graph Processing in both forward and backward passes, in which kernel-fusion along with other optimization strategies are applied to reduce kernel launching time and latency as well as exploit data reuse opportunities. Evaluation on multiple benchmarks shows that fuseGNN achieves up to 5.3\u00d7 end-to-end speedup over state-of-the-art frameworks, and the DRAM storage footprint is reduced by several orders of magnitude on large datasets.","author":["Zhaodong Chen","Mingyu Yan","Maohua Zhu","Lei Deng","Guoqi Li","Shuangchen Li","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["ICCAD '20: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2020","Article No.: 60","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/3400302.3415610"],"date":"02 November 2020","ref":[{"text":"C CUDA.

Most traditional CNN accelerators rely on single core, linear processing elements (PEs) in conjunction with 1D dataflows for accelerating convolution operations. This limits the maximum achievable ratio of peak throughput per PE count to unity. Most of the past works optimize their dataflows to attain close to a 100% hardware utilization to reach this ratio. In this paper, we introduce a high throughput, multi-threaded, log-based PE core. The designed core provides a 200% increase in peak throughput per PE count while only incurring a 6% increase in area overhead compared to a single, linear multiplier PE core with same output bit precision. We also present a 2D weight broadcast dataflow which exploits the multi-threaded nature of the PE cores to achieve a high hardware utilization per layer for various CNNs. The entire architecture, which we refer to as NeuroMAX, is implemented on Xilinx Zynq 7020 SoC at 200 MHz processing clock. Detailed analysis is performed on throughput, hardware utilization, area and power breakdown, and latency to show performance improvement compared to previous FPGA and ASIC designs.","author":["Mahmood Azhar Qureshi","Arslan Munir"],"issue":["ICCAD '20: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2020","Article No.: 45","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/3400302.3415638"],"date":"02 November 2020","ref":[{"text":"Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E.

Low-power approximate adders (LPAAs), for instance, IMPACT and InXA, are being advocated as building blocks for approximate computing hardware. For their practical adoption, the error caused by these units needs to be pre-evaluated and compared with maximum allowable error bounds for an application. To address this problem, we present PEAL, a Probabilistic error analysis methodology for Low-power Approximate Single and Multi-layered Adder Architectures, while considering variable probabilities for each bit of input operands for a given multi-bit adder design. PEAL is highly generic, linearly scalable, and applicable to any adder type. The analysis provides probability of success, which is accurate for single-layered adder architectures and provides a lower bound for multi-layered architectures. We have shown that state-of-the-art LPAAs can serve as effective building blocks of approximate computing only when the input probabilities are either very high (>0.8) or very low (<0.2). Interestingly, none of the state-of-the-art LPAA units, which to the best of our knowledge are the most widely adopted, has demonstrated effectiveness for mid-range probabilities (0.3\u20130.7). We have also analytically explained the cause of this usability limitation and proposed its solution. Moreover, we have proposed a method for estimating the Mean-squared Error of datapaths composed of LPAAs, to quantify the magnitude of error introduced in the output due to approximation of the adder units.","author":["Muhammad Kamran Ayub","Muhammad Abdullah Hanif","Osman Hasan","Muhammad Shafique"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 17","Issue 1","January 2021","Article No.: 1","pp   1\u201337","https://doi.org/10.1145/3405430"],"date":"01 October 2020","ref":[{"text":"SEALPAA.

In the literature, there have been several attempts at optimizing the number of approximate bits of each approximate adder in a system for a given accuracy constraint. For computational efficiency, the error models used in these routines are simple expressions obtained using regression or by assuming inputs or the error is uniformly distributed. In this article, we first demonstrate that for many approximate adders, these assumptions lead to an inaccurate prediction of error statistics for multi-level circuits. We show that mean error and mean square error can be computed accurately if static probabilities of adders at all stages are taken into account. Therefore, in a system with a certain type of approximate adder, any optimization framework needs to take into account not just the functionality of the adder but also its position in the circuit, functionality of its parents, and the number of approximate bits in the parent blocks. We propose a method to derive parameterized error models for various types of approximate adders. We incorporate these models within an optimization framework and demonstrate that the noise power is computed accurately.","author":["Celia Dharmaraj","Vinita Vasudevan","Nitin Chandrachoodan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 20","Issue 2","March 2021","Article No.: 12","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/3430509"],"date":"11 January 2021","ref":[{"text":"W.

Existing approximation techniques for a full memory hierarchy determine optimal configurations at design-time provided a goal and application. Such policies are rigid: they cannot adapt to unknown workloads and must be redesigned for different memory configurations and technologies. We propose SEAMS: the first self-optimizing runtime manager for coordinating configurable approximation knobs across all levels of the memory hierarchy. SEAMS continuously updates and optimizes its approximation management policy throughout runtime for diverse workloads. SEAMS optimizes the approximate memory configuration to minimize energy consumption without compromising the quality threshold specified by application developers. SEAMS can (1) learn a policy at runtime to manage variable application quality of service (QoS) constraints, (2) automatically optimize for a target metric within those constraints, and (3) coordinate runtime decisions for interdependent knobs and subsystems. We demonstrate SEAMS\u2019 ability to efficiently provide functions (1)\u2013(3) on a RISC-V Linux platform with approximate memory segments in the on-chip cache and main memory. We demonstrate SEAMS\u2019 ability to save up to 37% energy in the memory subsystem without any design-time overhead. We show SEAMS\u2019 ability to reduce QoS violations by 75% with < 5% additional energy.","author":["Biswadip Maity","Bryan Donyanavard","Anmol Surhonne","Amir Rahmani","Andreas Herkersdorf","Nikil Dutt"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 20","Issue 5","July 2021","Article No.: 48","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/3466875"],"date":"29 July 2021","ref":[{"text":"Amin Ansari, Shuguang Feng, Shantanu Gupta, and Scott Mahlke. 2009.

In these six programs ten distinct values occupy over 50% of all memory locations and on an average account for nearly 50% of all memory accesses during program execution. This observation holds for smaller blocks of consecutive memory locations and the set of frequent values remains quite stable over the execution of the program.In the six benchmarks with frequent value locality, on an average 50% of all cache misses occur during the reading or writing of the ten most frequently accessed values. We propose a new data cache structure, the frequent value cache (FVC), which employs a value-centric approach to caching data locations for exploiting the frequent value locality phenomenon. FVC is a small direct-mapped cache which is dedicated to holding only frequently occurring values. The value-centric nature of FVC enables us to store data in a compressed form where the compression is achieved by encoding the frequent values using a few bits. Moreover this simple compression scheme preserves the random access to data values in a cache line.Our experiments demonstrate that by augmenting a direct mapped cache (DMC) with a direct mapped FVC of size no more than 3 Kbytes we can obtain reductions in miss rates ranging from 1% to 68%. In fact we observed that higher reductions in miss rates can be achieved by augmenting a DMC with a small FVC as opposed to doubling the size of DMC for the 124.m88ksim and 134.perl benchmarks.","author":["Youtao Zhang","Jun Yang","Rajiv Gupta"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 35","Issue 11","Nov. 2000","pp   150\u2013159","https://doi.org/10.1145/356989.357003"],"date":"01 November 2000","ref":[{"text":"D.

The design and implementation of this system is described and illustrated with detailed examples of the operation of system components and examples of overall system operation. The language processing portion of the system uses a number of augmented transition networks, each of which matches phrases with a specific meaning, along with context registers (history keepers) and concept case frames; these are used for judging meaningfulness of questions, generating dialogue for clarifying partially understood questions, and resolving ellipsis and pronoun reference problems. Other system components construct a formal query for the relational database, and optimize the order of searching relations. Methods are discussed for handling vague or complex questions and for providing browsing ability. Also included are discussions of important issues in programming natural language systems for limited domains, and the relationship of this system to others.","author":["David L.

Inherent defects at the most basic level cause them to be both fat and weak: their primitive word-at-a-time style of programming inherited from their common ancestor\u2014the von Neumann computer, their close coupling of semantics to state transitions, their division of programming into a world of expressions and a world of statements, their inability to effectively use powerful combining forms for building new programs from existing ones, and their lack of useful mathematical properties for reasoning about programs.An alternative functional style of programming is founded on the use of combining forms for creating programs. Functional programs deal with structured data, are often nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically constructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require the complex machinery of procedure declarations to become generally applicable. Combining forms can use high level programs to build still higher level ones in a style not possible in conventional languages.Associated with the functional style of programming is an algebra of programs whose variables range over programs and whose operations are combining forms. This algebra can be used to transform programs and to solve equations whose \u201cunknowns\u201d are programs in much the same way one transforms equations in high school algebra. These transformations are given by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language in which programs are written. Combining forms are chosen not only for their programming power but also for the power of their associated algebraic laws. General theorems of the algebra give the detailed behavior and termination conditions for large classes of programs.A new class of computing systems uses the functional programming style both in its programming language and in its state transition rules. Unlike von Neumann languages, these systems have semantics loosely coupled to states\u2014only one state transition occurs per major computation.","author":["John Backus"],"issue":["Communications of the ACM","Volume 21","Issue 8","Aug. 1978","pp   613\u2013641","https://doi.org/10.1145/359576.359579"],"date":"01 August 1978","ref":[{"text":"Arvind, and Gostelow, K.P.

The binary search tree is a data structure for representing tables and lists so that accessing, inserting, and deleting items is easy. On an n-node splay tree, all the standard search tree operations have an amortized time bound of O(log n) per operation, where by \u201camortized time\u201d is meant the time per operation averaged over a worst-case sequence of operations. Thus splay trees are as efficient as balanced trees when total running time is the measure of interest. In addition, for sufficiently long access sequences, splay trees are as efficient, to within a constant factor, as static optimum search trees. The efficiency of splay trees comes not from an explicit structural constraint, as with balanced trees, but from applying a simple restructuring heuristic, called splaying, whenever the tree is accessed. Extensions of splaying give simplified forms of two other data structures: lexicographic or multidimensional search trees and link/cut trees.","author":["Daniel Dominic Sleator","Robert Endre Tarjan"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 32","Issue 3","July 1985","pp   652\u2013686","https://doi.org/10.1145/3828.3835"],"date":"01 July 1985","ref":[{"text":"ABRAMSON, N.Information Theory and Coding.

This paper describes several randomized algorithms for distributing updates and driving the replicas toward consistency. The algorithms are very simple and require few guarantees from the underlying communication system, yet they ensure that the effect of every update is eventually reflected in all replicas. The cost and performance of the algorithms are tuned by choosing appropriate distributions in the randomization step. The algorithms are closely analogous to epidemics, and the epidemiology literature aids in understanding their behavior. One of the algorithms has been implemented in the Clearinghouse servers of the Xerox Corporate Internet. solving long-standing problems of high traffic and database inconsistency.","author":["Alan Demers","Dan Greene","Carl Houser","Wes Irish","John Larson","Scott Shenker","Howard Sturgis","Dan Swinehart","Doug Terry"],"issue":["ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","Volume 22","Issue 1","Jan., 1988","pp   8\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/43921.43922"],"date":"03 January 1988","ref":[{"text":"[Ab] Karl Abrahamson, Andrew Addler, Lisa Higham, David Kirkpatrick Probabilistic Solitude Verification on a Ring.","doi":"10.1145/10590.10604","order":1},{"text":"[Aw] Baruch Awerbuch and Shimon Even.

Since all documents are not of equal relevance to their users, highly relevant documents should be identified and ranked first for presentation. In order to develop IR techniques in this direction, it is necessary to develop evaluation approaches and methods that credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This can be done by extending traditional evaluation methods, that is, recall and precision based on binary relevance judgments, to graded relevance judgments. Alternatively, novel measures based on graded relevance judgments may be developed. This article proposes several novel measures that compute the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. The first one accumulates the relevance scores of retrieved documents along the ranked result list. The second one is similar but applies a discount factor to the relevance scores in order to devaluate late-retrieved documents. The third one computes the relative-to-the-ideal performance of IR techniques, based on the cumulative gain they are able to yield. These novel measures are defined and discussed and their use is demonstrated in a case study using TREC data: sample system run results for 20 queries in TREC-7. As a relevance base we used novel graded relevance judgments on a four-point scale. The test results indicate that the proposed measures credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents and allow testing of statistical significance of effectiveness differences. The graphs based on the measures also provide insight into the performance IR techniques and allow interpretation, for example, from the user point of view.","author":["Kalervo J\u00e4rvelin","Jaana Kek\u00e4l\u00e4inen"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 20","Issue 4","October 2002","pp   422\u2013446","https://doi.org/10.1145/582415.582418"],"date":"01 October 2002","ref":[{"text":"Blair, D.

We describe the development of the routing architecture, including its directional bias, its direct-drive routing which reduces both area and delay. The logic array block and logic cell design is also described, and new routing structures with in the logic array block, and logic element features are described.","author":["David Lewis","Vaughn Betz","David Jefferson","Andy Lee","Chris Lane","Paul Leventis","Sandy Marquardt","Cameron McClintock","Bruce Pedersen","Giles Powell","Srinivas Reddy","Chris Wysocki","Richard Cliff","Jonathan Rose"],"issue":["FPGA '03: Proceedings of the 2003 ACM/SIGDA eleventh international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2003","Pages   12\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/611817.611821"],"date":"23 February 2003","ref":[{"text":"V.

Objects being compared often are modeled as sets, with their similarity traditionally determined based on set intersection. Intersection-based measures do not accurately capture similarity in certain domains, such as when the data is sparse or when there are known relationships between items within sets. We propose new measures that exploit a hierarchical domain structure in order to produce more intuitive similarity scores. We extend our similarity measures to provide appropriate results in the presence of multisets (also handled unsatisfactorily by traditional measures), for example, to correctly compute the similarity between customers who buy several instances of the same product (say milk), or who buy several products in the same category (say dairy products). We also provide an experimental comparison of our measures against traditional similarity measures, and report on a user study that evaluated how well our measures match human intuition.","author":["Prasanna Ganesan","Hector Garcia-Molina","Jennifer Widom"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 21","Issue 1","January 2003","pp   64\u201393","https://doi.org/10.1145/635484.635487"],"date":"01 January 2003","ref":[{"text":"Bollacker, K., Lawrence, S., and Giles, C.

In principle, this search space is enormous, and to control the potential combinatorial explosion, constraints between the data and model elements are needed. A set of constraints for sparse sensory data that are applicable to a wide variety of sensors are derived, and their characteristics are examined. Known bounds on the complexity of constraint satisfaction problems are used, together with explicit estimates of the effectiveness of the constraints derived for the case of sparse, noisy, three-dimensional sensory data, to obtain general theoretical bounds on the number of interpretations expected to be consistent with the data. It is shown that these bounds are consistent with empirical results reported previously. The results are used to demonstrate the graceful degradation of the recognition technique with the presence of noise in the data, and to predict the number of data points needed, in general, to uniquely determine the object being sensed.","author":["W.

More specifically, it is shown how a complete network of processors can deterministically simulate one PRAM step in O(log n/(log log n)2) time when both models use n processors and the size of the PRAM's shared memory is polynomial in n. (The best previously known upper bound was the trivial O(n)). It is established that this upper bound is nearly optimal, and it is proved that an on-line simulation of T PRAM steps by a complete network of processors requires \u03a9(T(log n/ log log n)) time.A simple consequence of the upper bound is that an Ultracomputer (the currently feasible general-purpose parallel machine) can simulate one step of a PRAM (the most convenient parallel model to program) in O((log n)2log log n) steps.","author":["Eli Upfal","Avi Wigderson"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 34","Issue 1","Jan. 1987","pp   116\u2013127","https://doi.org/10.1145/7531.7926"],"date":"01 January 1987","ref":[{"text":"AJTAI, M., KOMLOS, J., AND SZEMERf~DI, E.

The existing approaches deal de facto only with combinational circuits. However, incorporating retiming into delay budgeting introduces more freedom to optimize sequential circuits. In this paper, we propose an approach for budgeting sequential circuits. We propose a new algorithm, T-SBGT, which uses an LP formulation to solve the budgeting problem in sequential circuits and guarantees that the clock period constraints are met. We then utilize the skew-retiming equivalence relation [9] and retime the circuit. We demonstrate usefulness of our approach in the context of FPGA placement flow. An effective algorithm to minimize Flip-Flops (FFs) number after placement using the net slack is also proposed. The results show the placement flow improves timing by 9%, and reduces budget violations by 16% compared to the traditional flow. The post-placement FF reduction algorithm decreases the FF count by 19% on average.","author":["Chao-Yang Yeh","Malgorzata Marek-Sadowska"],"issue":["DAC '03: Proceedings of the 40th annual Design Automation Conference","June 2003","Pages   202\u2013207","https://doi.org/10.1145/775832.775886"],"date":"02 June 2003","ref":[{"text":"V.

With systems based on the publish/subscribe interaction scheme, subscribers register their interest in an event, or a pattern of events, and are subsequently asynchronously notified of events generated by publishers. Many variants of the paradigm have recently been proposed, each variant being specifically adapted to some given application or network model. This paper factors out the common denominator underlying these variants: full decoupling of the communicating entities in time, space, and synchronization. We use these three decoupling dimensions to better identify commonalities and divergences with traditional interaction paradigms. The many variations on the theme of publish/subscribe are classified and synthesized. In particular, their respective benefits and shortcomings are discussed both in terms of interfaces and implementations.","author":["Patrick Th. Eugster","Pascal A.

We present TreeJuxtaposer, a system designed to support the comparison task for large trees of several hundred thousand nodes. We introduce the idea of \"guaranteed visibility\", where highlighted areas are treated as landmarks that must remain visually apparent at all times. We propose a new methodology for detailed structural comparison between two trees and provide a new nearly-linear algorithm for computing the best corresponding node from one tree to another. In addition, we present a new rectilinear Focus+Context technique for navigation that is well suited to the dynamic linking of side-by-side views while guaranteeing landmark visibility and constant frame rates. These three contributions result in a system delivering a fluid exploration experience that scales both in the size of the dataset and the number of pixels in the display. We have based the design decisions for our system on the needs of a target audience of biologists who must understand the structural details of many phylogenetic, or evolutionary, trees. Our tool is also useful in many other application domains where tree comparison is needed, ranging from network management to call graph optimization to genealogy.","author":["Tamara Munzner","Fran\u00e7ois Guimbreti\u00e8re","Serdar Tasiran","Li Zhang","Yunhong Zhou"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 22","Issue 3","July 2003","pp   453\u2013462","https://doi.org/10.1145/882262.882291"],"date":"01 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"ADAMS, E.

The uniform interface between operators makes Volcano extensible by new operators. All operators are designed and coded as if they were meant for a single-process system only. When attempting to parallelize Volcano, we had to choose between two models of parallelization, called here the bracket and operator models. We describe the reasons for not choosing the bracket model, introduce the novel operator model, and provide details of Volcano's exchange operator that parallelizes all other operators. It allows intra-operator parallelism on partitioned datasets and both vertical and horizontal inter-operator parallelism. The exchange operator encapsulates all parallelism issues and therefore makes implementation of parallel database algorithms significantly easier and more robust. Included in this encapsulation is the translation between demand-driven dataflow within processes and data-driven dataflow between processes. Since the interface between Volcano operators is similar to the one used in \u201creal,\u201d commercial systems, the techniques described here can be used to parallelize other query processing engines.","author":["Goetz Graefe"],"issue":["ACM SIGMOD Record","Volume 19","Issue 2","Jun. 1990","pp   102\u2013111","https://doi.org/10.1145/93605.98720"],"date":"01 May 1990","ref":[{"text":"M Accetta, R Baron, W.

In this article, we describe a new family of model-based algorithms designed for this task. These algorithms rely on a statistical modelling technique that introduces latent class variables in a mixture model setting to discover user communities and prototypical interest profiles. We investigate several variations to deal with discrete and continuous response variables as well as with different objective functions. The main advantages of this technique over standard memory-based methods are higher accuracy, constant time prediction, and an explicit and compact model representation. The latter can also be used to mine for user communitites. The experimental evaluation shows that substantial improvements in accucracy over existing methods and published results can be obtained.","author":["Thomas Hofmann"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 22","Issue 1","January 2004","pp   89\u2013115","https://doi.org/10.1145/963770.963774"],"date":"01 January 2004","ref":[{"text":"Basu, C., Hirsh, H., and Cohen, W. 1998.

Most discount methods rely on some understanding of the context in which the groupware systems will be used, which means that evaluators need to model the tasks that groups will perform. However, existing task analysis schemes are not well suited to the needs of groupware evaluation: they either do not deal with collaboration issues, do not use an appropriate level of analysis for concrete assessment of usability in interfaces, or do not adequately represent the variability inherent in group work. To fill this gap, we have developed a new modeling technique called Collaboration Usability Analysis. CUA focuses on the teamwork that goes on in a group task rather than the taskwork. To enable closer links between the task representation and the groupware interface, CUA grounds each collaborative action in a set of group work primitives called the mechanics of collaboration. To represent the range of ways that a group task can be carried out, CUA allows variable paths through the execution of a task, and allows alternate paths and optional tasks to be modeled. CUA's main contribution is to provide evaluators with a framework in which they can simulate the realistic use of a groupware system and identify usability problems that are caused by the groupware interface.","author":["David Pinelle","Carl Gutwin","Saul Greenberg"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction","Volume 10","Issue 4","December 2003","pp   281\u2013311","https://doi.org/10.1145/966930.966932"],"date":"01 December 2003","ref":[{"text":"Annett, J. and Duncan, K.

However, it can be impractical because many relevant reactions are modeled as stochastic, discrete event processes, and the complexity of the computing task scales with the number of discrete events in a simulation. Traditionally, such simulations are computed on general purpose CPUs, and sometimes in networks of such processors. We show that an alternative algorithm to the conventional approaches based on the Gillespie algorithm reveals a fine-grained parallel structure that is amenable to realization in FPGA hardware. A method is shown for compiling biochemical reaction systems into corresponding Verilog descriptions of simulators that employ this alternative algorithm. We describe a preliminary implementation of such a compiled accelerator that demonstrates the performance of this approach, achieving an initial performance that is 20 times faster than a competing general purpose CPU.","author":["John F.

It is shown there that the most effective and the simplest algorithm of analytical integration was made by O.I. Marichev [8, 9, 12]. Later it was realized in the reference-books [16-18, 20]. This algorithm allows us to calculate definite and indefinite integrals of the products of elementary and special functions of hypergeometric type. It embraces about 70 per cent of integrals which are included in the world reference-literature. It allows to calculate many other integrals too.\nThe present article contains short description of this algorithm and its realization in the REDUCE system during the process of creation of INTEGRATOR system. Only one general method of integration is known to be realized on the computers, i.e. criterion algorithm for calculating of indefinite integrals of elementary functions through elementary functions by themselves (the authors of it are M. Bronstein and other).\nThe idea of our algorithm is in the following. The initial integrals is transformed to contour integral from the ratio of products of gamma-functions by means of Mellin transform and parseval equality. The residue theorem is used for the calculating of the received integral which due to the strict rules results in sums of hypergeometric series. The value of integral itself and the integrand functions are the special cases of the well-known Meijer's G-function [4, 7, 8, 12, 14, 18].\nProgramming packet is realized in programming languages PASCAL and REDUCE. It also offers the opportunity of finding the values for some classical integral transforms (Laplace, Hankel, Fourier, Mellin and etc.). The REDUCE's part of packet contains the main properties of the well-known special functions, such as the Bessel and gamma-functions and kindred functions, Anger function, Weber function, Whittaker functions, generalized hypergeometric functions. Special place in the packet is occupied by Meijers's G-function for which the main properties such as finding the particular cases and representation by means of hypergeometric series are realized.","author":["V.

As a result, data placement becomes a critical performance issue.In general, determining the optimal placement of data across processing nodes for performance is a difficult problem. We describe our heuristic approach to solving the data placement problem in Bubba. We then present experimental results using a specific workload to provide insight into the problem. Several researchers have argued the benefits of declustering (i e, spreading each base relation over many nodes). We show that as declustering is increased, load balancing continues to improve. However, for transactions involving complex joins, further declustering reduces throughput because of communications, startup and termination overhead.We argue that data placement, especially declustering, in a highly-parallel system must be considered early in the design, so that mechanisms can be included for supporting variable declustering, for minimizing the most significant overheads associated with large-scale declustering, and for gathering the required statistics.","author":["George Copeland","William Alexander","Ellen Boughter","Tom Keller"],"issue":["ACM SIGMOD

The key feature of Jeliot is the fully or semi-automatic visualization of the data and control flows. The development process of Jeliot has been research-oriented, meaning that all the different versions have had their own research agenda rising from the design of the previous version and their empirical evaluations. In this process, the user interface and visualization has evolved to better suit the targeted audience, which in the case of Jeliot 3, is novice programmers. In this paper we explain the model for the system and introduce the features of the user interface and visualization engine. Moreover, we have developed an intermediate language that is used to decouple the interpretation of the program from its visualization. This has led to a modular design that permits both internal and external extensibility.","author":["Andr\u00e9s Moreno","Niko Myller","Erkki Sutinen","Mordechai Ben-Ari"],"issue":["AVI '04: Proceedings of the working conference on Advanced visual interfaces","May 2004","Pages   373\u2013376","https://doi.org/10.1145/989863.989928"],"date":"25 May 2004","ref":[{"text":"D.

In this paper, we describe a scheme that meets all three criteria. By contrast, published and commercial semiconductor solutions meet some but not all of these three criteria.For example, many approaches that provide dense tables have poor update times; others require large amounts of expensive high speed memory dedicated to this application. Many IP address lookup approaches do not take into account the flexibility of ASICs or the structure of modern high speed memory technologies such as RLDRAM[1] and FCRAM[2]. In this paper, we present a family of IP lookup schemes using a data structure that compactly encodes large prefix tables in order to address the criteria listed above. We also present a series of optimizations to the core algorithm that allows the memory access width of the algorithm to be reduced at the cost of memory references or allocated memory. Such flexibility in performance versus density is an important feature for the lookup engine of routers that may be deployed in different networks with varying requirements on address lookup length and table density (e.g. global IPv4 networks, global v6, VPN based v4 networks, MPLS, and IP tunneling encapsulation points).","author":["Will Eatherton","George Varghese","Zubin Dittia"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 34","Issue 2","April 2004","pp   97\u2013122","https://doi.org/10.1145/997150.997160"],"date":"01 April 2004","ref":[{"text":"QDR SRAM consortia, http://www.qdrsram.com/","order":1},{"text":"RLDRAM (Reduced Latency DRAM) consortia, www.rldram.com/","order":2},{"text":"Networking FCRAM (Fast Cycle Ram), http://www.toshiba.com/taec/main/promo/fcram/","order":3},{"text":"Artisan Components, Inc., http://www.artisan.com/","order":4},{"text":"U.

A network consists of entities connected by links representing relations such as friendship, communication, or shared activity. Maintaining privacy when publishing networked data is uniquely challenging because an individual's network context can be used to identify them even if other identifying information is removed. In this paper, we quantify the privacy risks associated with three classes of attacks on the privacy of individuals in networks, based on the knowledge used by the adversary. We show that the risks of these attacks vary greatly based on network structure and size. We propose a novel approach to anonymizing network data that models aggregate network structure and then allows samples to be drawn from that model. The approach guarantees anonymity for network entities while preserving the ability to estimate a wide variety of network measures with relatively little bias.","author":["Michael Hay","Gerome Miklau","David Jensen","Don Towsley","Philipp Weis"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 1","Issue 1","August 2008","pp   102\u2013114","https://doi.org/10.14778/1453856.1453873"],"date":"01 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"W.

In data warehouse systems, highly compressed column-oriented data structures are quite prominent. In order to scale with the data volume and the system load, many of these systems are highly distributed with a shared-nothing approach. The fundamental principle of all systems is a full table scan over one or multiple compressed columns. Recent research proposed different techniques to speedup table scans like intelligent compression or using an additional hardware such as graphic cards or FPGAs. In this paper, we show that utilizing the embedded Vector Processing Units (VPUs) found in standard superscalar processors can speed up the performance of mainmemory full table scan by factors. This is achieved without changing the hardware architecture and thereby without additional power consumption. Moreover, as on-chip VPUs directly access the system's RAM, no additional costly copy operations are needed for using the new SIMD-scan approach in standard main memory database engines. Therefore, we propose this scan approach to be used as the standard scan operator for compressed column-oriented main memory storage. We then discuss how well our solution scales with the number of processor cores; consequently, to what degree it can be applied in multi-threaded environments. To verify the feasibility of our approach, we implemented the proposed techniques on a modern Intel multi-core processor using Intel\u00ae Streaming SIMD Extensions (Intel\u00ae SSE). In addition, we integrated the new SIMD-scan approach into SAP\u00ae Netweaver\u00ae Business Warehouse Accelerator. We conclude with describing the performance benefits of using our approach for processing and scanning compressed data using VPUs in column-oriented main memory database systems.","author":["Thomas Willhalm","Nicolae Popovici","Yazan Boshmaf","Hasso Plattner","Alexander Zeier","Jan Schaffner"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 2","Issue 1","August 2009","pp   385\u2013394","https://doi.org/10.14778/1687627.1687671"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"Westmann, T., Kossmann D., Helmer, S., Moerkkotte, G., \"The Implementation and Performance of Compressed Databases,\" in","doi":"10.1145/362084.362137","order":1},{"text":"Harizopoulos S., Liang V., Abadi D., Madden S., \"Performance tradeoffs in read-optimized databases,\" In","doi":"10.5555/1182635.1164170","order":2},{"text":"Flynn, M.

Our approach carefully chooses a set of queries to evaluate, and then exploits consistency constraints that should hold over the noisy output. In a post-processing phase, we compute the consistent input most likely to have produced the noisy output. The final output is differentially-private and consistent, but in addition, it is often much more accurate. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these techniques can be used for estimating the degree sequence of a graph very precisely, and for computing a histogram that can support arbitrary range queries accurately.","author":["Michael Hay","Vibhor Rastogi","Gerome Miklau","Dan Suciu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   1021\u20131032","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920970"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"B.

SpatialHadoop runs existing Hadoop programs as is, yet, it achieves order(s) of magnitude better performance than Hadoop when dealing with spatial data. SpatialHadoop employs a simple spatial high level language, a two-level spatial index structure, basic spatial components built inside the MapReduce layer, and three basic spatial operations: range queries, k-NN queries, and spatial join. Other spatial operations can be similarly deployed in SpatialHadoop.

However, most of those implementations are not portable across different architectures, because they are usually developed from scratch and target at a specific architecture. This paper proposes a kernel-adapter based design (OmniDB), a portable yet efficient query processor on parallel CPU/GPU architectures. OmniDB attempts to develop an extensible query processing kernel (qKernel) based on an abstract model for parallel architectures, and to leverage an architecture-specific layer (adapter) to make qKernel be aware of the target architecture. The goal of OmniDB is to maximize the common functionality in qKernel so that the development and maintenance efforts for adapters are minimized across different architectures. In this demo, we demonstrate our initial efforts in implementing OmniDB, and present the preliminary results on the portability and efficiency.","author":["Shuhao Zhang","Jiong He","Bingsheng He","Mian Lu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 12","August 2013","pp   1374\u20131377","https://doi.org/10.14778/2536274.2536319"],"date":"01 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"A.

It consists in making a database consistent with respect to a set of given constraints. In recent years, repairing methods have been proposed for several classes of constraints. However, these methods rely on ad hoc decisions and tend to hard-code the strategy to repair conflicting values. As a consequence, there is currently no general algorithm to solve database repairing problems that involve different kinds of constraints and different strategies to select preferred values. In this paper we develop a uniform framework to solve this problem. We propose a new semantics for repairs, and a chase-based algorithm to compute minimal solutions. We implemented the framework in a DBMS-based prototype, and we report experimental results that confirm its good scalability and superior quality in computing repairs.","author":["Floris Geerts","Giansalvatore Mecca","Paolo Papotti","Donatello Santoro"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 9","July 2013","pp   625\u2013636","https://doi.org/10.14778/2536360.2536363"],"date":"01 July 2013","ref":[{"text":"S.

All these systems divide input graphs into partitions, and employ a \"think like a vertex\" programming model to support iterative graph computation. This vertex-centric model is easy to program and has been proved useful for many graph algorithms. However, this model hides the partitioning information from the users, thus prevents many algorithm-specific optimizations. This often results in longer execution time due to excessive network messages (e.g. in Pregel) or heavy scheduling overhead to ensure data consistency (e.g. in GraphLab). To address this limitation, we propose a new \"think like a graph\" programming paradigm. Under this graph-centric model, the partition structure is opened up to the users, and can be utilized so that communication within a partition can bypass the heavy message passing or scheduling machinery. We implemented this model in a new system, called Giraph++, based on Apache Giraph, an open source implementation of Pregel. We explore the applicability of the graph-centric model to three categories of graph algorithms, and demonstrate its flexibility and superior performance, especially on well-partitioned data. For example, on a web graph with 118 million vertices and 855 million edges, the graph-centric version of connected component detection algorithm runs 63X faster and uses 204X fewer network messages than its vertex-centric counterpart.","author":["Yuanyuan Tian","Andrey Balmin","Severin Andreas Corsten","Shirish Tatikonda","John McPherson"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 3","November 2013","pp   193\u2013204","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732232.2732238"],"date":"01 November 2013","ref":[{"text":"Apache Giraph. http://giraph.apache.org.","order":1},{"text":"A.

Each online network represents a subset of their \"real\" ego-networks. An interesting and challenging problem is to reconcile these online networks, that is, to identify all the accounts belonging to the same individual. Besides providing a richer understanding of social dynamics, the problem has a number of practical applications. At first sight, this problem appears algorithmically challenging. Fortunately, a small fraction of individuals explicitly link their accounts across multiple networks; our work leverages these connections to identify a very large fraction of the network.Our main contributions are to mathematically formalize the problem for the first time, and to design a simple, local, and efficient parallel algorithm to solve it. We are able to prove strong theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's performance on well-established network models (Random Graphs, Preferential Attachment). We also experimentally confirm the effectiveness of the algorithm on synthetic and real social network data sets.","author":["Nitish Korula","Silvio Lattanzi"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 5","Janary 2014","pp   377\u2013388","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732269.2732274"],"date":"01 January 2014","ref":[{"text":"Dblp. http://dblp.uni-trier.de/xml/.","order":1},{"text":"Wikipedia dumps. http://dumps.wikimedia.org/.","order":2},{"text":"F.

While scaling down all records uniformly is equivalent to scaling up the noise magnitude, we show that scaling records non-uniformly can result in substantially higher accuracy by bypassing the worst-case requirements of differential privacy for the noise magnitudes.This paper details the data analysis platform wPINQ, which generalizes the Privacy Integrated Query (PINQ) to weighted datasets. Using a few simple operators (including a non-uniformly scaling Join operator) wPINQ can reproduce (and improve) several recent results on graph analysis and introduce new generalizations (e.g., counting triangles with given degrees). We also show how to integrate probabilistic inference techniques to synthesize datasets respecting more complicated (and less easily interpreted) measurements.","author":["Davide Proserpio","Sharon Goldberg","Frank McSherry"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 8","April 2014","pp   637\u2013648","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732296.2732300"],"date":"01 April 2014","ref":[{"text":"A.-L.

It potentially invalidates the need for flush-before-commit as log records are persistent immediately upon write. Distributed logging---a once prohibitive technique for single node systems in the DRAM era---becomes a promising solution to easing the logging bottleneck because of the non-volatility and high performance of NVM.In this paper, we advocate NVM and distributed logging on multicore and multi-socket hardware. We identify the challenges brought by distributed logging and discuss solutions. To protect committed work in NVM-based systems, we propose passive group commit, a lightweight, practical approach that leverages existing hardware and group commit. We expect that durable processor cache is the ultimate solution to protecting committed work and building reliable, scalable NVM-based systems in general. We evaluate distributed logging with logging-intensive workloads and show that distributed logging can achieve as much as ~3x speedup over centralized logging in a modern DBMS and that passive group commit only induces minuscule overhead.","author":["Tianzheng Wang","Ryan Johnson"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 10","June 2014","pp   865\u2013876","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732951.2732960"],"date":"01 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"AgigaTech.

In this paper, we describe the architecture of an interactive natural language query interface for relational databases. Through a carefully limited interaction with the user, we are able to correctly interpret complex natural language queries, in a generic manner across a range of domains. By these means, a logically complex English language sentence is correctly translated into a SQL query, which may include aggregation, nesting, and various types of joins, among other things, and can be evaluated against an RDBMS. We have constructed a system, NaLIR (Natural Language Interface for Relational databases), embodying these ideas. Our experimental assessment, through user studies, demonstrates that NaLIR is good enough to be usable in practice: even naive users are able to specify quite complex ad-hoc queries.","author":["Fei Li","H.

However, BSP can suffer from poor performance due to stale messages and frequent global synchronization barriers. Asynchronous computation models have been proposed to alleviate these overheads but existing asynchronous systems that implement such models have limited scalability or retain frequent global barriers, and do not always support graph mutations or algorithms with multiple computation phases. We propose barrierless asynchronous parallel (BAP), a new computation model that reduces both message staleness and global synchronization. This enables BAP to overcome the limitations of existing asynchronous models while retaining support for graph mutations and algorithms with multiple computation phases. We present GiraphUC, which implements our BAP model in the open source distributed graph processing system Giraph, and evaluate our system at scale with large real-world graphs on 64 EC2 machines. We show that GiraphUC provides across-the-board performance improvements of up to 5\u00d7 faster over synchronous systems and up to an order of magnitude faster than asynchronous systems. Our results demonstrate that the BAP model provides efficient and transparent asynchronous execution of algorithms that are programmed synchronously.","author":["Minyang Han","Khuzaima Daudjee"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 9","May 2015","pp   950\u2013961","https://doi.org/10.14778/2777598.2777604"],"date":"01 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"Apache Giraph. http://giraph.apache.org.","order":1},{"text":"Apache Hama. http://hama.apache.org.","order":2},{"text":"Okapi. http://grafos.ml/okapi.","order":3},{"text":"GraphLab: Distributed Graph-Parallel API. http://docs.graphlab.org/classgraphlab_1_1async__consistent__engine.html, 2014.","order":4},{"text":"L.

The combination of HTM and NVM promises to be a natural choice for in-memory database synchronization. However, limitations on the size of hardware transactions and the lack of progress guarantees by modern HTM implementations prevent some applications from obtaining the full benefit of hardware transactional memory. In this paper, we propose a persistent hybrid TM algorithm called PHyTM for systems that support NVM and HTM. PHyTM allows hardware assisted ACID transactions to execute concurrently with pure software transactions, which allows applications to gain the benefit of persistent HTM while simultaneously accommodating unbounded transactions (with a high degree of concurrency). Experimental simulations demonstrate that PHyTM is fast and scalable for realistic workloads.","author":["Hillel Avni","Trevor Brown"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 4","November 2016","pp   409\u2013420","https://doi.org/10.14778/3025111.3025122"],"date":"01 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"H.

But what if distributed transactions could be made scalable using the next generation of networks and a redesign of distributed databases? There would no longer be a need for developers to worry about co-partitioning schemes to achieve decent performance. Application development would become easier as data placement would no longer determine how scalable an application is. Hardware provisioning would be simplified as the system administrator can expect a linear scale-out when adding more machines rather than some complex sub-linear function, which is highly application specific.In this paper, we present the design of our novel scalable database system NAM-DB and show that distributed transactions with the very common Snapshot Isolation guarantee can indeed scale using the next generation of RDMA-enabled network technology without any inherent bottlenecks. Our experiments with the TPC-C benchmark show that our system scales linearly to over 6.5 million new-order (14.5 million total) distributed transactions per second on 56 machines.","author":["Erfan Zamanian","Carsten Binnig","Tim Harris","Tim Kraska"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 6","February 2017","pp   685\u2013696","https://doi.org/10.14778/3055330.3055335"],"date":"01 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"M.

LocLok has two features: (a) it protects locations under temporal correlations described through hidden Markov model; (b) it releases the optimal noisy location with the planar isotropic mechanism (PIM), the first mechanism that achieves the lower bound of differential privacy. We show the detailed computation of LocLok with the following components: (a) how to generate the possible locations with Markov model, (b) how to perturb the location with PIM, and (c) how to make inference about the true location in Markov model.

In this paper, we present key runtime and algorithmic principles to consider when performing graph analytics on extreme-scale graphs on Optane PMM and highlight principles that can apply to graph analytics on all large-memory platforms.To demonstrate the importance of these principles, we evaluate four existing shared-memory graph frameworks and one out-of-core graph framework on large real-world graphs using a machine with 6TB of Optane PMM. Our results show that frameworks using the runtime and algorithmic principles advocated in this paper (i) perform significantly better than the others and (ii) are competitive with graph analytics frameworks running on production clusters.","author":["Gurbinder Gill","Roshan Dathathri","Loc Hoang","Ramesh Peri","Keshav Pingali"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 13","Issue 8","April 2020","pp   1304\u20131318","https://doi.org/10.14778/3389133.3389145"],"date":"01 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"Graph 500 Benchmarks, 2017.","order":1},{"text":"Z.

Py-Torch is a widely-adopted scientific computing package used in deep learning research and applications. Recent advances in deep learning argue for the value of large datasets and large models, which necessitates the ability to scale out model training to more computational resources. Data parallelism has emerged as a popular solution for distributed training thanks to its straightforward principle and broad applicability. In general, the technique of distributed data parallelism replicates the model on every computational resource to generate gradients independently and then communicates those gradients at each iteration to keep model replicas consistent. Despite the conceptual simplicity of the technique, the subtle dependencies between computation and communication make it non-trivial to optimize the distributed training efficiency. As of v1.5, PyTorch natively provides several techniques to accelerate distributed data parallel, including bucketing gradients, overlapping computation with communication, and skipping gradient synchronization. Evaluations show that, when configured appropriately, the PyTorch distributed data parallel module attains near-linear scalability using 256 GPUs.","author":["Shen Li","Yanli Zhao","Rohan Varma","Omkar Salpekar","Pieter Noordhuis","Teng Li","Adam Paszke","Jeff Smith","Brian Vaughan","Pritam Damania","Soumith Chintala"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 13","Issue 12","August 2020","pp   3005\u20133018","https://doi.org/10.14778/3415478.3415530"],"date":"01 August 2020","ref":[{"text":"Gloo: a collective communications library. https://github.com/facebookincubator/gloo, 2019.","order":1},{"text":"NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL). https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl, 2019.","order":2},{"text":"NVLINK AND NVSWITCH: The Building Blocks of Advanced Multi-GPU Communication. https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink/, 2019.","order":3},{"text":"Open MPI: A High Performance Message Passing Library. https://www.open-mpi.org/, 2019.","order":4},{"text":"Pybind11: Seamless operability between C++11 and Python. https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/, 2019.","order":5},{"text":"PyTorch Distributed RPC Framework. https://pytorch.org/docs/master/rpc.html, 2019.","order":6},{"text":"PyTorch Module forward Function. https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module.forward, 2019.","order":7},{"text":"SciPy: open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. https://docs.scipy.org/, 2019.","order":8},{"text":"PyTorch DistributedDataParallel. https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel, 2020.","order":9},{"text":"TensorFlow Distributed Training MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy. https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training#multiworkermirroredstrategy, 2020.","order":10},{"text":"TensorFlow Distributed Training ParameterServerStrategy. https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training#parameterserverstrategy, 2020.","order":11},{"text":"Y.

This requires advanced knowledge reasoning performed by various processing modules. We argue that it is important to understand the nature of the various reasoning mechanisms involved and to separate not only, for instance, interpretation, generation, and dialogue management but also domain knowledge and task reasoning. This facilitates portability of the dialogue system to new domains and makes it easier to enhance its capabilities.

The search consists of two parts: a forward, time-synchronous, trellis search and a backward, time asynchronous, tree search. In the first module the well known Viterbi algorithm is used for finding the best hypothesis and for preparing a map of all partial paths scores time synchronously. In the second module a tree search is used to grow partial paths backward and time asynchronously. Each partial path in the backward tree search is rank ordered in a stack by the corresponding full path score, which is computed by adding the partial path score with the best possible score of the remaining path obtained from the trellis path map. In each path growing cycle, the current best partial path, which is at the top of the stack, is extended by one arc (word). The new tree-trellis search is different from the traditional time synchronous Viterbi search in its ability for finding not just the best but the <i>N</i>-best paths of different word content. The new search is also different from the <i>A</i> algorithm, or the stack algorithm, in its capability for providing an exact, full path score estimate of any given partial (i.e., incomplete) path before its completion. When compared with the best candidate Viterbi search, the search complexities for finding the <i>N</i>-best strings are rather low, i.e., only a fraction more computation is needed.","author":["Frank K.

These advances, which include the incorporation of inter-word, context-dependent units and an improved feature analysis, lead to a recognition system which achieve better than 95% word accuracy for speaker independent recognition of the 1000-word, DARPA resource management task using the standard word-pair grammar (with a perplexity of about 60). It will be shown that the incorporation of inter-word units into training results in better acoustic models of word juncture coarticulation and gives a 20% reduction in error rate. The effect of an improved set of spectral and log energy features is to further reduce word error rate by about 30%. We also found that the spectral vectors, corresponding to the same speech unit, behave differently statistically, depending on whether they are at word boundaries or within a word. The results suggest that intra-word and inter-word units should be modeled independently, even when they appear in the same context. Using a set of sub-word units which included variants for intra-word and inter-word, context-dependent phones, an additional decrease of about 10% in word error rate resulted.","author":["C.-H.

CRFs are log-linear, allowing the incorporation of arbitrary features into the model. To train on unlabeled data, we require unsupervised estimation methods for log-linear models; few exist. We describe a novel approach, contrastive estimation. We show that the new technique can be intuitively understood as exploiting implicit negative evidence and is computationally efficient. Applied to a sequence labeling problem---POS tagging given a tagging dictionary and unlabeled text---contrastive estimation outperforms EM (with the same feature set), is more robust to degradations of the dictionary, and can largely recover by modeling additional features.","author":["Noah A.

In this model, morphological analysis is considered as a process of candidate generation and candidate selection. In order to increase the performance of the system, the number of candidates is highly reduced and the system requires small number of dictionary accesses. Idiosynchratic features of a syllable, formalized as a characteristic function, make it possible to reject implausible candidates before dictionary confirmation. Instead of a letter, syllable is a basic processing unit for the practical implementation of the morphological analyzer.","author":["Seung-Shik Kang","Yung Taek Kim"],"issue":["COLING '94: Proceedings of the 15th conference on Computational linguistics - Volume 1","August 1994","Pages   221\u2013226","https://doi.org/10.3115/991886.991923"],"date":"05 August 1994","ref":[{"text":"{Abe86} M.

Although a number of semi-supervised methods have been proposed, their effectiveness on NLP tasks is not always clear. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that employs a learning paradigm which we call structural learning. The idea is to find \"what good classifiers are like\" by learning from thousands of automatically generated auxiliary classification problems on unlabeled data. By doing so, the common predictive structure shared by the multiple classification problems can be discovered, which can then be used to improve performance on the target problem. The method produces performance higher than the previous best results on CoNLL'00 syntactic chunking and CoNLL'03 named entity chunking (English and German).","author":["Rie Kubota Ando","Tong Zhang"],"issue":["ACL '05: Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics","June 2005","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.3115/1219840.1219841"],"date":"25 June 2005","ref":[{"text":"Rie Kubota Ando and Tong Zhang. 2004.

Adjacency pair theory has widespread acceptance, but traditional classification features (in particular, 'previous-tag' type features) do not exploit this information optimally. We suggest a method of dialogue segmentation that verifies adjacency pairs and allows us to use dialogue-level information within the entire segment and not just the previous utterance. We also use the X2 test for statistical significance as 'noise reduction' to refine a list of pairs. Together, these methods can be used to extend expectation beyond the traditional classification features.","author":["T.
