[{"_id":"10.1145/1014052.1014073","title":"Mining and summarizing customer reviews","abstract":"Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. For the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. In this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. This summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. Our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. This paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. Our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques.","author":["Minqing Hu","Bing Liu"],"issue":["KDD '04: Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2004","Pages   168\u2013177","https://doi.org/10.1145/1014052.1014073"],"date":"22 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"Agrawal, R. & Srikant, R. 1994.

We model documents as if they were generated by a two-stage stochastic process. Each author is represented by a probability distribution over topics, and each topic is represented as a probability distribution over words for that topic. The words in a multi-author paper are assumed to be the result of a mixture of each authors' topic mixture. The topic-word and author-topic distributions are learned from data in an unsupervised manner using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We apply the methodology to a large corpus of 160,000 abstracts and 85,000 authors from the well-known CiteSeer digital library, and learn a model with 300 topics. We discuss in detail the interpretation of the results discovered by the system including specific topic and author models, ranking of authors by topic and topics by author, significant trends in the computer science literature between 1990 and 2002, parsing of abstracts by topics and authors and detection of unusual papers by specific authors. An online query interface to the model is also discussed that allows interactive exploration of author-topic models for corpora such as CiteSeer.","author":["Mark Steyvers","Padhraic Smyth","Michal Rosen-Zvi","Thomas Griffiths"],"issue":["KDD '04: Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2004","Pages   306\u2013315","https://doi.org/10.1145/1014052.1014087"],"date":"22 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"Blei, D.

The page miss ratio curve(MRC), i.e. page miss rate vs. memory size curve, is a good performance-directed metric to serve this purpose. However, dynamically tracking MRC at run time is challenging in systems with virtual memory because not every memory reference passes through the operating system (OS).This paper proposes two methods to dynamically track MRC of applications at run time. The first method is using a hardware MRC monitor that can track MRC at fine time granularity. Our simulation results show that this monitor has negligible performance and energy overheads. The second method is an OS-only implementation that can track MRC at coarse time granularity. Our implementation results on Linux show that it adds only 7--10% overhead.We have also used the dynamic MRC to guide both memory allocation for multiprogramming systems and memory energy management. Our real system experiments on Linux with applications including Apache Web Server show that the MRC-directed memory allocation can speed up the applications' execution/response time by up to a factor of 5.86 and reduce the number of page faults by up to 63.1%. Our execution-driven simulation results with SPEC2000 benchmarks show that the MRC-directed memory energy management can improve the Energy * Delay metric by 27--58% over previously proposed static and dynamic schemes.","author":["Pin Zhou","Vivek Pandey","Jagadeesan Sundaresan","Anand Raghuraman","Yuanyuan Zhou","Sanjeev Kumar"],"issue":["ASPLOS XI: Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Architectural support for programming languages and operating systems","October 2004","Pages   177\u2013188","https://doi.org/10.1145/1024393.1024415"],"date":"07 October 2004","ref":[{"text":"Apache web server. http://httpd.apache.org/test/flood.]]","order":1},{"text":"Flood: A profile driven http load tester. http://httpd.apache.org/test/flood.]]","order":2},{"text":"G.

With the recent technology breakthroughs in both capacity and reliability, flash-memory storage systems are now very popular in many types of embedded systems. However, because flash memory is a write-once and bulk-erase medium, we need a translation layer and a garbage-collection mechanism to provide applications a transparent storage service. In the past work, various techniques were introduced to improve the garbage-collection mechanism. These techniques aimed at both performance and endurance issues, but they all failed in providing applications a guaranteed performance. In this paper, we propose a real-time garbage-collection mechanism, which provides a guaranteed performance, for hard real-time systems. On the other hand, the proposed mechanism supports non-real-time tasks so that the potential bandwidth of the storage system can be fully utilized. A wear-leveling method, which is executed as a non-real-time service, is presented to resolve the endurance problem of flash memory. The capability of the proposed mechanism is demonstrated by a series of experiments over our system prototype.","author":["Li-Pin Chang","Tei-Wei Kuo","Shi-Wu Lo"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 3","Issue 4","November 2004","pp   837\u2013863","https://doi.org/10.1145/1027794.1027801"],"date":"01 November 2004","ref":[{"text":"Baker, T.

Floorplanning techniques are very good at handling macros, but do not scale to hundreds of thousands of placeable objects. Therefore we combine floorplanning techniques with placement techniques to solve the more general placement problem. Our work shows how to place macros consistently with large numbers of small standard cells. Proposed techniques can also be used to guide circuit designers who prefer to place macros by hand.We address the computational difficulty of layout problems involving large macros and numerous small logic cells at the same time. Proposed algorithms are evaluated in the context of wirelength minimization because a computational method that is not scalable in optimizing wirelength is unlikely to be successful for more complex objectives (congestion, delay, power, etc.)We propose several different design flows to place mixed-size placement instances. The first flow relies on an arbitrary black-box standard-cell placer to obtain an initial placement and then removes possible overlaps using a fixed-outline floorplanner. This results in valid placements for macros, which are considered fixed. Remaining standard cells are then placed by another call to the standard-cell placer. In the second flow a standard-cell placer generates an initial placement and a force-directed placer is used in the engineering change order (ECO) mode to generate an overlap-free placement. Empirical evaluation on ibm benchmarks shows that in most cases our proposed flows compare favorably with previously published mixed-size placers, Kraftwerk, and the mixed-size floor-placer proposed at the 2003 Conference on Design, Automation, and Test in Europe (DATE 2003), and are competitive with mPG-MS.","author":["S.

In order to drive physical design research over the next few years, a new benchmark suit is being released in conjunction with the ISPD2005 placement contest. These benchmarks are directly derived from industrial ASIC designs, with circuit sizes ranging from 210 thousand to 2.1 million placeable objects. Unlike the ISPD98 benchmarks, the physical structure of these designs is completely preserved, giving realistic challenging designs for today's placement tools. Hopefully, these benchmarks will help accelerate new physical design research in the placement, floor-planning, and routing.","author":["Gi-Joon Nam","Charles J.

To meet this need, we have developed a new instrumentation system called Pin. Our goals are to provide easy-to-use, portable, transparent, and efficient instrumentation. Instrumentation tools (called Pintools) are written in C/C++ using Pin's rich API. Pin follows the model of ATOM, allowing the tool writer to analyze an application at the instruction level without the need for detailed knowledge of the underlying instruction set. The API is designed to be architecture independent whenever possible, making Pintools source compatible across different architectures. However, a Pintool can access architecture-specific details when necessary. Instrumentation with Pin is mostly transparent as the application and Pintool observe the application's original, uninstrumented behavior. Pin uses dynamic compilation to instrument executables while they are running. For efficiency, Pin uses several techniques, including inlining, register re-allocation, liveness analysis, and instruction scheduling to optimize instrumentation. This fully automated approach delivers significantly better instrumentation performance than similar tools. For example, Pin is 3.3x faster than Valgrind and 2x faster than DynamoRIO for basic-block counting. To illustrate Pin's versatility, we describe two Pintools in daily use to analyze production software. Pin is publicly available for Linux platforms on four architectures: IA32 (32-bit x86), EM64T (64-bit x86), Itanium\u00ae, and ARM. In the ten months since Pin 2 was released in July 2004, there have been over 3000 downloads from its website.","author":["Chi-Keung Luk","Robert Cohn","Robert Muth","Harish Patil","Artur Klauser","Geoff Lowney","Steven Wallace","Vijay Janapa Reddi","Kim Hazelwood"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 40","Issue 6","June 2005","pp   190\u2013200","https://doi.org/10.1145/1064978.1065034"],"date":"12 June 2005","ref":[{"text":"AMBER home page. http://amber.scripps.edu/.]]","order":1},{"text":"Fluent home page. http://www.fluent.com/.]]","order":2},{"text":"LS-DYNA home page. http://www.lstc.com/.]]","order":3},{"text":"RenderMan home page. http://RenderMan.pixar.com/.]]","order":4},{"text":"A.-R.

Due to their repetitive computing and memory intensive nature, they can take effective advantage from Processor-In-Memory (PIM) technology. In this paper, a new low-power PIM-based 32-bit reconfigurable datapath optimized for multimedia applications is presented. The new circuit efficiently performs parallel arithmetic operations on either 8-, 16-, or 32-bit integer data or on 32-bit single precision floating-point data. As a result, high flexibility is provided at a very low hardware cost. When implemented using the UMC 0.18 \u03bcm 1.8 V CMOS technology, the proposed datapath exhibits a 285 MHz running frequency, dissipates just 0.12 mW/MHz and occupies a silicon area of only 107,323 \u03bcm2.

Because flash memories are nonvolatile and relatively dense, they are now used to store files and other persistent objects in handheld computers, mobile phones, digital cameras, portable music players, and many other computer systems in which magnetic disks are inappropriate. Flash, like earlier EEPROM devices, suffers from two limitations. First, bits can only be cleared by erasing a large block of memory. Second, each block can only sustain a limited number of erasures, after which it can no longer reliably store data. Due to these limitations, sophisticated data structures and algorithms are required to effectively use flash memories. These algorithms and data structures support efficient not-in-place updates of data, reduce the number of erasures, and level the wear of the blocks in the device.

In this paper, we regard the clustering task as indexing the search results. Here, an index means a structured label list that can makes it easier for the user to comprehend the labels and search results. To realize this goal, we make three proposals. First is to use Named Entity Extraction for term extraction. Second is a new label selecting criterion based on importance in the search result and the relation between terms and search queries. The third is label categorization using category information of labels, which is generated by NE extraction. We implement a prototype system based on these proposals and find that it offers much higher performance than existing methods; we focus on news articles in this paper.","author":["Hiroyuki Toda","Ryoji Kataoka"],"issue":["WIDM '05: Proceedings of the 7th annual ACM international workshop on Web information and data management","November 2005","Pages   81\u201386","https://doi.org/10.1145/1097047.1097063"],"date":"04 November 2005","ref":[{"text":"Belkin, N.

Several research groups have attempted to address this by developing new architectures that include registered switchpoints within their interconnect. Unfortunately, this pipelined communication presents a new and difficult problem for detailed routing tools. Known as the N-Delay Routing Problem, it has been proven to be NP-Complete. Although there have been two heuristics developed to address this issue, both have certain limitations and neither approach considers timing during the routing process. While timing-driven conventional routing is largely considered to be a solved problem, there are several issues inherent to the N-Delay Routing problem make addressing timing particularly difficult. In this paper we discuss the nature of these problems and present a new timing-driven pipeline-aware router that produces as much as 60% better critical path delay than previous efforts.","author":["Ken Eguro","Scott Hauck"],"issue":["FPGA '06: Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/SIGDA 14th international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2006","Pages   169\u2013178","https://doi.org/10.1145/1117201.1117227"],"date":"22 February 2006","ref":[{"text":"Betz, Vaughn, Jonathan Rose, and Alexander Marquardt, Architecture and CAD for Deep-Submicron FPGAs, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1999.","doi":"10.5555/553523","order":1},{"text":"C.

Our approach reduces energy consumption by actively switching memories to lowpower mode at low bus utilization. At higher bus utilization, the scheme switches memories to open page mode to reduce precharge energy as well as program execution time. This bus utilization predictor reduces memory energy consumption without the expense of increasing program execution time. It achieved the performance level of open page policy by consuming 20% less of memory energy.","author":["Ning-Yaun Ker","Chung-Ho Chen"],"issue":["ASP-DAC '03: Proceedings of the 2003 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2003","Pages   515\u2013518","https://doi.org/10.1145/1119772.1119879"],"date":"21 January 2003","ref":[{"text":"Miura, S.

The refinement process inserts automatically control structures to treat delays induced by the use of RTL IPs. It also inserts a control structure to coordinate the execution of parallel clocked IP. The delays may be managed by registers or by counters included in the control structure. The experimentations show that the approach can produce efficient RTL architecture and allow a huge save of time.","author":["Nacer-Eddine Zergainoh","Katalin Popovici","Ahmed Jerraya","Pascal Urard"],"issue":["ASP-DAC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2005","Pages   612\u2013618","https://doi.org/10.1145/1120725.1120976"],"date":"18 January 2005","ref":[{"text":"International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, 2001 Edition Report available http://public.itrs.net","order":1},{"text":"G.

A new figure of merit, namely the gmfT-to-current ratio, (gmfT/ID), is defined for a MOS transistor, which accounts for both the unity-gain frequency and current consumption. It is demonstrated both analytically and experimentally that the gmfT/ID reaches its maximum value in moderate inversion region. Next, using the proposed method, a power optimized common-gate low-noise amplifier (LNA) with active load has been designed and fabricated in a CMOS 0.18\u03bcm process operating at 950MHz.

These two approaches to problem solving have a lot in common as evidenced by similar ideas underlying the branch and prune algorithms that are most successful at solving both kinds of problems. They also exhibit differences in the way they are used to state and solve problems since SAT's approach is, in general, a black-box approach, while CP aims at being tunable and programmable.

Key setup/sharing is crucial to the protection of such applications/services from attacks, but existing (public-key, cluster-based, or pairwise) solutions become too expensive (hence, inefficient) when the underlying applications/services require communications between distant sensor nodes. To remedy this inefficiency, we propose a novel distributed key-sharing scheme, in which each participating sensor node shares unique keys with a small number of other sensor nodes\u2014called distributed key servers (DKSs)\u2014chosen according to their geographic distance and communication direction. Using DKSs, we develop two secure routing protocols: (1) secure geographic forwarding that delivers packets by using a chain of DKS lookups, each secured with its own key and forwarded geographically; and (2) key establishment that creates a secure session between two distant sensor nodes based solely on symmetric-ciphers. These protocols enable low-cost, low-power sensors to provide high-level security at a very low cost.","author":["Taejoon Park","Kang G.

They have recently been adopted by several data communication standards such as DVB-S2 and WiMax. LDPCs are represented by bipartite graphs, also called Tanner graphs, and their decoding demands very intensive computation. For that reason, VLSI dedicated architectures have been investigated and developed over the last few years. This paper proposes a new approach for LDPC decoding on graphics processing units (GPUs). Efficient data structures and an new algorithm are proposed to represent the Tanner graph and to perform LDPC decoding according to the stream-based computing model. GPUs were programmed to efficiently implement the proposed algorithms by applying data-parallel intensive computing. Experimental results show that GPUs perform LDPC decoding nearly three orders of magnitude faster than modern CPUs. Moreover, they lead to the conclusion that GPUs with their tremendous processing power can be considered as a consistent alternative to state-of-the-art hardware LDPC decoders.","author":["Gabriel Falc\u00e3o","Leonel Sousa","Vitor Silva"],"issue":["PPoPP '08: Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and practice of parallel programming","February 2008","Pages   83\u201390","https://doi.org/10.1145/1345206.1345221"],"date":"20 February 2008","ref":[{"text":"R.

OpenFlow is based on an Ethernet switch, with an internal flow-table, and a standardized interface to add and remove flow entries. Our goal is to encourage networking vendors to add OpenFlow to their switch products for deployment in college campus backbones and wiring closets. We believe that OpenFlow is a pragmatic compromise: on one hand, it allows researchers to run experiments on heterogeneous switches in a uniform way at line-rate and with high port-density; while on the other hand, vendors do not need to expose the internal workings of their switches. In addition to allowing researchers to evaluate their ideas in real-world traffic settings, OpenFlow could serve as a useful campus component in proposed large-scale testbeds like GENI. Two buildings at Stanford University will soon run OpenFlow networks, using commercial Ethernet switches and routers.

This involves two central problems of matching the circuit graphs with each other (graph isomorphism) and extracting a higher level of circuit from a given level by finding subcircuits in the circuit graph (subgraph isomorphism). Modern day VLSI layouts contain millions of devices. Hence the memory requirements of the data structures required by tools for verifying them become huge and can easily exceed the amount of internal memory available on a computer. In such a scenario, a program not aware of the memory hierarchy performs badly because of its unorganized input/output operations (I/Os) as the speed of a disk access is about a million times slower than accessing a main memory location. In this article, we present I/O-efficient algorithms for the graph isomorphism and subgraph isomorphism problems in the context of verification of VLSI layouts. Experimental results show the need and utility of I/O-efficient algorithms for handling problems with large memory requirements.","author":["Yokesh Kumar","Prosenjit Gupta"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 14","Issue 2","March 2009","Article No.: 30","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/1497561.1497573"],"date":"07 April 2009","ref":[{"text":"Abadir, M.

Much of this energy is wasted in idle systems: in typical deployments, server utilization is below 30%, but idle servers still consume 60% of their peak power draw. Typical idle periods though frequent--last seconds or less, confounding simple energy-conservation approaches.In this paper, we propose PowerNap, an energy-conservation approach where the entire system transitions rapidly between a high-performance active state and a near-zero-power idle state in response to instantaneous load. Rather than requiring fine-grained power-performance states and complex load-proportional operation from each system component, PowerNap instead calls for minimizing idle power and transition time, which are simpler optimization goals. Based on the PowerNap concept, we develop requirements and outline mechanisms to eliminate idle power waste in enterprise blade servers. Because PowerNap operates in low-efficiency regions of current blade center power supplies, we introduce the Redundant Array for Inexpensive Load Sharing (RAILS), a power provisioning approach that provides high conversion efficiency across the entire range of PowerNap's power demands. Using utilization traces collected from enterprise-scale commercial deployments, we demonstrate that, together, PowerNap and RAILS reduce average server power consumption by 74%.","author":["David Meisner","Brian T.

We argue that evolving legacy libraries for dense and banded linear algebra is not a viable solution due to constraints imposed by early design decisions. We propose a philosophy of abstraction and separation of concerns that provides a promising solution in this problem domain. The first abstraction, FLASH, allows algorithms to express computation with matrices consisting of contiguous blocks, facilitating algorithms-by-blocks. Operand descriptions are registered for a particular operation a priori by the library implementor. A runtime system, SuperMatrix, uses this information to identify data dependencies between suboperations, allowing them to be scheduled to threads out-of-order and executed in parallel. But not all classical algorithms in linear algebra lend themselves to conversion to algorithms-by-blocks. We show how our recently proposed LU factorization with incremental pivoting and a closely related algorithm-by-blocks for the QR factorization, both originally designed for out-of-core computation, overcome this difficulty. Anecdotal evidence regarding the development of routines with a core functionality demonstrates how the methodology supports high productivity while experimental results suggest that high performance is abundantly achievable.","author":["Gregorio Quintana-Ort\u00ed","Enrique S.

Scaling such models to full-sized, high-dimensional images remains a difficult problem. To address this problem, we present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model which scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique which shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images.","author":["Honglak Lee","Roger Grosse","Rajesh Ranganath","Andrew Y.

The existing work either uses spanning structures, such as chains or trees, to compress the complete transitive closure, or utilizes the 2-hop strategy to describe the reachability. Almost all of these approaches work well for very sparse graphs. However, the challenging problem is that as the ratio of the number of edges to the number of vertices increases, the size of the compressed transitive closure grows very large. In this paper, we propose a new 3-hop indexing scheme for directed graphs with higher density. The basic idea of 3-hop indexing is to use chain structures in combination with hops to minimize the number of structures that must be indexed. Technically, our goal is to find a 3-hop scheme over dense DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) with minimum index size. We develop an efficient algorithm to discover a transitive closure contour, which yields near optimal index size. Empirical studies show that our 3-hop scheme has much smaller index size than state-of-the-art reachability query schemes such as 2-hop and path-tree when DAGs are not very sparse, while our query time is close to path-tree, which is considered to be one of the best reachability query schemes.","author":["Ruoming Jin","Yang Xiang","Ning Ruan","David Fuhry"],"issue":["SIGMOD '09: Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data","June 2009","Pages   813\u2013826","https://doi.org/10.1145/1559845.1559930"],"date":"29 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"R.

Prestigious clients such as these cannot make do with approximate translations; for all kinds of reasons, ranging from the legal obligations to good marketing practice, they require target-language texts of the highest quality. The task of producing such high-quality translations is a demanding and time-consuming one that is generally conferred to expert human translators. The problem is that, with growing globalization, the demand for high-quality translation has been steadily increasing, to the point where there are just not enough qualified translators available today to satisfy it. This has dramatically raised the need for improved machine translation (MT) technologies.The field of MT has undergone something of a revolution over the last 15 years, with the adoption of empirical, data-driven techniques originally inspired by the success of automatic speech recognition. Given the requisite corpora, it is now possible to develop new MT systems in a fraction of the time and with much less effort than was previously required under the formerly dominant rule-based paradigm. As for the quality of the translations produced by this new generation of MT systems, there has also been considerable progress; generally speaking, however, it remains well below that of human translation. No one would seriously consider directly using the output of even the best of these systems to translate a CV or a corporate Web site, for example, without submitting the machine translation to a careful human revision. As a result, those who require publication-quality translation are forced to make a diffcult choice between systems that are fully automatic but whose output must be attentively post-edited, and computer-assisted translation systems (or CAT tools for short) that allow for high quality but to the detriment of full automation.Currently, the best known CAT tools are translation memory (TM) systems. These systems recycle sentences that have previously been translated, either within the current document or earlier in other documents. This is very useful for highly repetitive texts, but not of much help for the vast majority of texts composed of original materials.Since TM systems were first introduced, very few other types of CAT tools have been forthcoming. Notable exceptions are the TransType system and its successor TransType2 (TT2). These systems represent a novel rework-ing of the old idea of interactive machine translation (IMT). Initial efforts on TransType are described in detail in Foster; suffice it to say here the system's principal novelty lies in the fact the human-machine interaction focuses on the drafting of the target text, rather than on the disambiguation of the source text, as in all former IMT systems.In the TT2 project, this idea was further developed. A full-fledged MT engine was embedded in an interactive editing environment and used to generate suggested completions of each target sentence being translated. These completions may be accepted or amended by the translator; but once validated, they are exploited by the MT engine to produce further, hopefully improved suggestions. This is in marked contrast with traditional MT, where typically the system is first used to produce a complete draft translation of a source text, which is then post-edited (corrected) offline by a human translator. TT2's interactive approach offers a significant advantage over traditional post-editing. In the latter paradigm, there is no way for the system, which is off-line, to benefit from the user's corrections; in TransType, just the opposite is true. As soon as the user begins to revise an incorrect segment, the system immediately responds to that new information by proposing an alternative completion to the target segment, which is compatible with the prefix that the user has input.Another notable feature of the work described in this article is the importance accorded to a formal treatment of human-machine interaction, something that is seldom considered in the now-prevalent framework of statistical pattern recognition.","author":["Francisco Casacuberta","Jorge Civera","Elsa Cubel","Antonio L.

There are numerous HTHs sources including untrusted foundries, synthesis tools and libraries, testing and verification tools, and configuration scripts. HTH attacks can greatly comprise security and privacy of hardware users either directly or through interaction with pertinent systems and application software or with data. However, while there has been a huge research and development effort for detecting software Trojan horses, surprisingly, HTHs are rarely addressed. HTH detection is a particularly difficult task in modern and pending deep submicron technologies due to intrinsic manufacturing variability. Our goal is to provide an impetus for HTH research by creating a generic and easily applicable set of techniques and tools for HTH detection. We start by introducing a technique for recovery of characteristics of gates in terms of leakage current, switching power, and delay, which utilizes linear programming to solve a system of equations created using non-destructive measurements of power or delays. This technique is combined with constraint manipulation techniques to detect embedded HTHs. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on a number of standard benchmarks.","author":["Miodrag Potkonjak","Ani Nahapetian","Michael Nelson","Tammara Massey"],"issue":["DAC '09: Proceedings of the 46th Annual Design Automation Conference","July 2009","Pages   688\u2013693","https://doi.org/10.1145/1629911.1630091"],"date":"26 July 2009","ref":[{"text":"Defense Science Board (DSB) study on high performance microchip supply, http://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/2005-02-hpms_report_final.pdf, 2006.","order":1},{"text":"D.

However, the labeled data available in many applications is scarce and hence the metrics learned are often unsatisfactory. In this paper, we consider a transfer learning setting in which some related source tasks with labeled data are available to help the learning of the target task. We first propose a convex formulation for multi-task metric learning by modeling the task relationships in the form of a task covariance matrix. Then we regard transfer learning as a special case of multi-task learning and adapt the formulation of multi-task metric learning to the transfer learning setting for our method, called transfer metric learning (TML). In TML, we learn the metric and the task covariances between the source tasks and the target task under a unified convex formulation. To solve the convex optimization problem, we use an alternating method in which each subproblem has an efficient solution. Experimental results on some commonly used transfer learning applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","author":["Yu Zhang","Dit-Yan Yeung"],"issue":["KDD '10: Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","July 2010","Pages   1199\u20131208","https://doi.org/10.1145/1835804.1835954"],"date":"25 July 2010","ref":[{"text":"A.

The proposed compressors provide up to 20% energy reduction depending on the target delay at 65nm CMOS technology.

It fetches words/phrases that belong to the selected set of POS patterns. We design four systems based on chunking method and the features they use. These systems are trained on a naive Bayes classifier with a set of web pages annotated with 'advertising' keywords. The systems can then find advertising keywords from previously unseen web pages. Empirical evaluation shows that systems using the proposed chunking method perform better than the systems using N-Gram based chunking.

We describe the basic architecture of th SCMA, and show the requirements and the design of SCMAs to scalably operate over multiple devices. We implement a prototype of the SCMA with three ALTERA Stratix III FPGAs, which form a 1--3 FPGA array by conecting three DE3 boards with different clock sources. The prototype SCMA demonstrates that the difference in operating clock frequency hardly influences the total execution cycles while it slightly causes stall cycles to sub-SCMAs on different FPGAs. With three banchmark programs of typical computing kernels based on the finite difference method, we show that the increased FPGAs provide higher performance proportional to the number of devices, resulting in almost linear speedup.","author":["Kentaro Sano","Luzhou Wang","Satoru Yamamoto"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 38","Issue 4","September 2010","pp   80\u201386","https://doi.org/10.1145/1926367.1926381"],"date":"14 January 2011","ref":[{"text":"W.

Additional challenges are introduced when the lower levels of the hierarchy are shared by multiple clients. Sharing can have both positive and negative effects. While data fetched by one client can be used by another client without incurring additional delays, clients competing for cache buffers can evict each other\u2019s blocks and interfere with exclusive caching schemes.We present a global noncentralized, dynamic and informed management policy for multiple levels of cache, accessed by multiple clients. Our algorithm, MC2, combines local, per client management with a global, system-wide scheme, to emphasize the positive effects of sharing and reduce the negative ones. Our local management scheme, Karma, uses readily available information about the client\u2019s future access profile to save the most valuable blocks, and to choose the best replacement policy for them. The global scheme uses the same information to divide the shared cache space between clients, and to manage this space. Exclusive caching is maintained for nonshared data and is disabled when sharing is identified.Previous studies have partially addressed these challenges through minor changes to the storage interface. We show that all these challenges can in fact be addressed by combining minor interface changes with smart allocation and replacement policies. We show the superiority of our approach through comparison to existing solutions, including LRU, ARC, MultiQ, LRU-SP, and Demote, as well as a lower bound on optimal I/O response times. Our simulation results demonstrate better cache performance than all other solutions and up to 87% better performance than LRU on representative workloads.","author":["Gala Yadgar","Michael Factor","Kai Li","Assaf Schuster"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Computer Systems","Volume 29","Issue 2","May 2011","Article No.: 5","pp   1\u201351","https://doi.org/10.1145/1963559.1963561"],"date":"01 May 2011","ref":[{"text":"1987.

Current centralized Hard Disk Drive (HDD) checkpointing results in overhead of 25% or more at petascale. Since systems become more vulnerable as the node count keeps increasing, novel techniques that enable fast and frequent checkpointing are critical to the future exascale system implementation.In this work, we first introduce one of the emerging nonvolatile memory technologies, Phase-Change Random Access Memory (PCRAM), as a proper candidate of the fast checkpointing device. After a thorough analysis of MPP systems, failure rates and failure sources, we propose a PCRAM-based hybrid local/global checkpointing mechanism which not only provides a faster checkpoint storage, but also boosts the effectiveness of other orthogonal techniques such as incremental checkpointing and background checkpointing. Three variant implementations of the PCRAM-based hybrid checkpointing are designed to be adopted at different stages and to offer a smooth transition from the conventional in-disk checkpointing to the instant in-memory approach. Analyzing the overhead by using a hybrid checkpointing performance model, we show the proposed approach only incurs less than 3% performance overhead on a projected exascale system.","author":["Xiangyu Dong","Yuan Xie","Naveen Muralimanohar","Norman P.

However, processors cannot operate reliably below a minimum voltage, Vccmin, since hardware structures may fail. Cell failures in large memory arrays (e.g., caches) typically determine Vccmin for the whole processor. We observe that most cache lines exhibit zero or one failures at low voltages. However, a few lines, especially in large caches, exhibit multi-bit failures and increase Vccmin. Previous solutions either significantly reduce cache capacity to enable uniform error correction across all lines, or significantly increase latency and bandwidth overheads when amortizing the cost of error-correcting codes (ECC) over large lines. In this paper, we propose a novel cache architecture that uses variable-strength error-correcting codes (VS-ECC). In the common case, lines with zero or one failures use a simple and fast ECC. A small number of lines with multi-bit failures use a strong multi-bit ECC that requires some additional area and latency. We present a novel dynamic cache characterization mechanism to determine which lines will exhibit multi-bit failures. In particular, we use multi-bit correction to protect a fraction of the cache after switching to low voltage, while dynamically testing the remaining lines for multi-bit failures. Compared to prior multi-bit-correcting proposals, VS-ECC significantly reduces power and energy, avoids significant reductions in cache capacity, incurs little area overhead, and avoids large increases in latency and bandwidth.","author":["Alaa R.

Adaptive routing allows more freedom in the paths taken by messages, spreading load over physical channels more evenly. The flexibility of adaptive routing introduces new possibilities of deadlock. Previous deadlock avoidance schemes in k-ary n-cubes require an exponential number of virtual channels. We describe a family of deadlock-free routing algorithms, called planar-adaptive routing algorithms, that require only a constant number of virtual channels, independent of networks size and dimension. Planar-adaptive routing algorithms reduce the complexity of deadlock prevention by reducing the number of choices at each routing step. In the fault-free case, planar-adaptive networks are guaranteed to be  deadlock-free. In the presence of network faults, the planar-adaptive router can be extended with misrouting to produce a working network which remains provably deadlock free and is provably livelock free. In addition, planar-adaptive networks can simultaneously support both in-order and adaptive, out-of-order packet delivery.Planar-adaptive routing is of practical significance. It provides the simplest known support for deadlock-free adaptive routing in k-ary n-cubes of more than two dimensions (with k>2). Restricting adaptivity reduces the hardware complexity, improving router speed or allowing additional performance-enhancing network features. The structure of planar-adaptive routers is amenable to efficient implementation.Simulation studies show that  planar-adaptive routers can increase the robustness of network throughput for nonuniform communication patterns. Planar-adaptive routers outperform deterministic routers with equal hardware resources. Further, adding virtual lanes to planar-adaptive routers increases this advantage. Comparisons with fully adaptive routers show that planar-adaptive routers, limited adaptive routers, can give superior performance. These results indicate the best way to allocate router resources to combine adaptivity and virtual lanes.Planar-adaptive routers are a special case of limited adaptivity routers. We define a class of adaptive routers with f degrees of routing freedom. This class, termed f-flat adaptive routers, allows a direct cost-performance tradeoff between implementation cost  (speed and silicon area) and routing freedom (channel utilization). For a network of a particular dimension, the cost of adaptivity grows linearly with the routing freedom. However, the rate of growth is a much larger constant for high-dimensional networks. All of the properties proven for planar-adaptive routers, such as deadlock and livelock freedom, also apply to f-flat adaptive routers.","author":["Andrew A. Chien","Jae H.

We present a new approach to gesture recognition that attends to both body and hands, and interprets gestures continuously from an unsegmented and unbounded input stream. This article describes the whole procedure of continuous body and hand gesture recognition, from the signal acquisition to processing, to the interpretation of the processed signals.Our system takes a vision-based approach, tracking body and hands using a single stereo camera. Body postures are reconstructed in 3D space using a generative model-based approach with a particle filter, combining both static and dynamic attributes of motion as the input feature to make tracking robust to self-occlusion. The reconstructed body postures guide searching for hands. Hand shapes are classified into one of several canonical hand shapes using an appearance-based approach with a multiclass support vector machine. Finally, the extracted body and hand features are combined and used as the input feature for gesture recognition. We consider our task as an online sequence labeling and segmentation problem. A latent-dynamic conditional random field is used with a temporal sliding window to perform the task continuously. We augment this with a novel technique called multilayered filtering, which performs filtering both on the input layer and the prediction layer. Filtering on the input layer allows capturing long-range temporal dependencies and reducing input signal noise; filtering on the prediction layer allows taking weighted votes of multiple overlapping prediction results as well as reducing estimation noise.We tested our system in a scenario of real-world gestural interaction using the NATOPS dataset, an official vocabulary of aircraft handling gestures. Our experimental results show that: (1) the use of both static and dynamic attributes of motion in body tracking allows statistically significant improvement of the recognition performance over using static attributes of motion alone; and (2) the multilayered filtering statistically significantly improves recognition performance over the nonfiltering method. We also show that, on a set of twenty-four NATOPS gestures, our system achieves a recognition accuracy of 75.37%.","author":["Yale Song","David Demirdjian","Randall Davis"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems","Volume 2","Issue 1","March 2012","Article No.: 5","pp   1\u201328","https://doi.org/10.1145/2133366.2133371"],"date":"20 March 2012","ref":[{"text":"Barr, A. 1981.

Moreover, input tables had to be copied to GPU memory before they could be processed, and after computation was completed, query results had to be copied back to CPU memory. The newest generation of Nvidia GPUs and development tools introduces a common memory address space, which now allows the GPU to access CPU memory directly, lifting size limitations and obviating data copy operations. We confirm that this new technology can sustain 98% of its nominal rate of 6.3 GB/sec in practice, and exploit it to process database hash joins at the same rate, i.e., the join is processed \"on the fly\" as the GPU reads the input tables from CPU memory at PCI-E speeds. Compared to the fastest published results for in-memory joins on the CPU, this represents more than half an order of magnitude speed-up. All of our results include the cost of result materialization (often omitted in earlier work), and we investigate the implications of changing join predicate selectivity and table size.","author":["Tim Kaldewey","Guy Lohman","Rene Mueller","Peter Volk"],"issue":["DaMoN '12: Proceedings of the Eighth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware","May 2012","Pages   55\u201362","https://doi.org/10.1145/2236584.2236592"],"date":"21 May 2012","ref":[{"text":"A.

In such cases, cost-based query optimization often is not possible. One practical reason for this is that statistics typically are missing in web scale setting such as the Linked Open Datasets (LOD). The more profound reason is that due to the absence of schematic structure in RDF, join-hit ratio estimation requires complicated forms of correlated join statistics; and currently there are no methods to identify the relevant correlations beforehand. For this reason, the use of good heuristics is essential in SPARQL query optimization, even in the case that are partially used with cost-based statistics (i.e., hybrid query optimization). In this paper we describe a set of useful heuristics for SPARQL query optimizers. We present these in the context of a new Heuristic SPARQL Planner (HSP) that is capable of exploiting the syntactic and the structural variations of the triple patterns in a SPARQL query in order to choose an execution plan without the need of any cost model. For this, we define the variable graph and we show a reduction of the SPARQL query optimization problem to the maximum weight independent set problem. We implemented our planner on top of the MonetDB open source column-store and evaluated its effectiveness against the state-of-the-art RDF-3X engine as well as comparing the plan quality with a relational (SQL) equivalent of the benchmarks.","author":["Petros Tsialiamanis","Lefteris Sidirourgos","Irini Fundulaki","Vassilis Christophides","Peter Boncz"],"issue":["EDBT '12: Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology","March 2012","Pages   324\u2013335","https://doi.org/10.1145/2247596.2247635"],"date":"27 March 2012","ref":[{"text":"Yet Another Great Ontology. http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/yago-naga/yago.","order":1},{"text":"Abadi, D.

Many advanced database applications are beginning to support this need by integrating domain knowledge encoded as ontologies into queries over relational data. However, it is extremely difficult to express queries against graph structured ontology in the relational SQL query language or its extensions. Moreover, semantic queries are usually not precise, especially when data and its related ontology are complicated. Users often only have a vague notion of their information needs and are not able to specify queries precisely. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a novel method to support semantic queries in relational databases with ease. Instead of casting ontology into relational form and creating new language constructs to express such queries, we ask the user to provide a small number of examples that satisfy the query she has in mind. Using those examples as seeds, the system infers the exact query automatically, and the user is therefore shielded from the complexity of interfacing with the ontology. Our approach consists of three steps. In the first step, the user provides several examples that satisfy the query. In the second step, we use machine learning techniques to mine the semantics of the query from the given examples and related ontologies. Finally, we apply the query semantics on the data to generate the full query result. We also implement an optional active learning mechanism to find the query semantics accurately and quickly. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.","author":["Lipyeow Lim","Haixun Wang","Min Wang"],"issue":["EDBT '13: Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology","March 2013","Pages   347\u2013358","https://doi.org/10.1145/2452376.2452417"],"date":"18 March 2013","ref":[{"text":"A.

Phase variations of the coefficients of a complex-valued steerable pyramid over time correspond to motion, and can be temporally processed and amplified to reveal imperceptible motions, or attenuated to remove distracting changes. This processing does not involve the computation of optical flow, and in comparison to the previous Eulerian Video Magnification method it supports larger amplification factors and is significantly less sensitive to noise. These improved capabilities broaden the set of applications for motion processing in videos.

To make GPUs easier to program and easier to integrate with existing systems, we propose making the host's file system directly accessible from GPU code. GPUfs provides a POSIX-like API for GPU programs, exploits GPU parallelism for efficiency, and optimizes GPU file access by extending the buffer cache into GPU memory. Our experiments, based on a set of real benchmarks adopted to use our file system, demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of our approach. For example, we demonstrate a simple self-contained GPU program which searches for a set of strings in the entire tree of Linux kernel source files over seven times faster than an eight-core CPU run.","author":["Mark Silberstein","Bryan Ford","Idit Keidar","Emmett Witchel"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 48","Issue 4","April 2013","pp   485\u2013498","https://doi.org/10.1145/2499368.2451169"],"date":"16 March 2013","ref":[{"text":"Amittai Aviram, Shu-Chun Weng, Sen Hu, and Bryan Ford.

Both coarse-grain parallelism (e.g., multi-core) and fine-grain parallelism (e.g., vector SIMD) must be effectively exploited, but despite decades of progress at both ends, current compiler optimization schemes that attempt to address data locality and both kinds of parallelism often fail at one of the three objectives.We address this problem by proposing a 3-step framework, which aims for integrated data locality, multi-core parallelism and SIMD execution of programs. We define the concept of vectorizable codelets, with properties tailored to achieve effective SIMD code generation for the codelets. We leverage the power of a modern high-level transformation framework to restructure a program to expose good ISA-independent vectorizable codelets, exploiting multi-dimensional data reuse. Then, we generate ISA-specific customized code for the codelets, using a collection of lower-level SIMD-focused optimizations.We demonstrate our approach on a collection of numerical kernels that we automatically tile, parallelize and vectorize, exhibiting significant performance improvements over existing compilers.","author":["Martin Kong","Richard Veras","Kevin Stock","Franz Franchetti","Louis-No\u00ebl Pouchet","P.

Despite the success, we come to realize that, for many applications, the key bottleneck is not the qualify of classifiers but that of features. Not being able to automatically get useful features has become the main limitation for shallow models. Since 2006, learning high-level features using deep architectures from raw data has become a huge wave of new learning paradigms. In recent two years, deep learning has made many performance breakthroughs, for example, in the areas of image understanding and speech recognition. In this talk, I will walk through some of the latest technology advances of deep learning within Baidu, and discuss the main challenges, e.g., developing effective models for various applications, and scaling up the model training using many GPUs. In the end of the talk I will discuss what might be interesting future directions.","author":["Kai Yu"],"issue":["CIKM '13: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management","October 2013","Pages   2211\u20132212","https://doi.org/10.1145/2505515.2514699"],"date":"27 October 2013"},{"_id":"10.1145/2517326.2451529","doi":"10.1145/2517326.2451529","title":"Optimizing virtual machine live storage migration in heterogeneous storage environment","abstract":"Virtual machine (VM) live storage migration techniques significantly increase the mobility and manageability of virtual machines in the era of cloud computing. On the other hand, as solid state drives (SSDs) become increasingly popular in data centers, VM live storage migration will inevitably encounter heterogeneous storage environments. Nevertheless, conventional migration mechanisms do not consider the speed discrepancy and SSD's wear-out issue, which not only causes significant performance degradation but also shortens SSD's lifetime. This paper, for the first time, addresses the efficiency of VM live storage migration in heterogeneous storage environments from a multi-dimensional perspective, i.e., user experience, device wearing, and manageability. We derive a flexible metric (migration cost), which captures various design preference. Based on that, we propose and prototype three new storage migration strategies, namely: 1) Low Redundancy (LR), which generates the least amount of redundant writes; 2) Source-based Low Redundancy (SLR), which keeps the balance between IO performance and write redundancy; and 3) Asynchronous IO Mirroring, which seeks the highest IO performance. The evaluation of our prototyped system shows that our techniques outperform existing live storage migration by a significant margin. Furthermore, by adaptively mixing our proposed schemes, the cost of massive VM live storage migration can be even lower than that of only using the best of individual mechanism.","author":["Ruijin Zhou","Fang Liu","Chao Li","Tao Li"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 48","Issue 7","July 2013","pp   73\u201384","https://doi.org/10.1145/2517326.2451529"],"date":"16 March 2013","ref":[{"text":"\"Amazon EC2\", http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/","order":1},{"text":"\"Microsoft Azure\", http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/","order":2},{"text":"\"Flash Drives Replace Disks at Amazon, Facebook, Dropbox\", http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/06/flash-data-centers/","order":3},{"text":"\"Morphlabs, Dell DCS Team on SSD-Powered Cloud\", http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2012/03/28/morphlabs-dell-dcs-team-on-ssd-powered-cloud/","order":4},{"text":"\"SolidFire Develops All-SSD System for Cloud Storage Providers\", http://searchstoragechannel.techtarget.com/news/2240037093/SolidFire-develops-all-SSD-system-for-cloud-storage-providers","order":5},{"text":"\"Intel Takes Their SSD Reliability to the Datacenter\", http://www.zdnet.com/blog/datacenter/intel-takes-their-ssd-reliability-to-the-datacenter/1316","order":6},{"text":"Gokul Soundararajan, Vijayan Prabhakaran, et al., Extending SSD Lifetimes with Disk-Based Write Caches, FAST 2010","doi":"10.5555/1855511.1855519","order":7},{"text":"EMC, http://www.us.emc.com/index.htm","order":8},{"text":"Winchester Systems, http://www.winsys.com","order":9},{"text":"Ali Mashtizadeh, et al., The Design and Evolution of Live Storage Migration in VMware ESX, ATC 2011","doi":"10.5555/2002181.2002195","order":10},{"text":"Robert Bradford, Evangelos Kotsovinos, Anja Feldmann, Harald Schioberg, Live Wide-Area Migration of Virtual Machines Including Local Persistent State, VEE 2007","doi":"10.1145/1254810.1254834","order":11},{"text":"Yingwei Luo, Binbin Zhang, et al., Live and Incremental Whole-System Migration of Virtual Machines Using Block-Bitmap, ICCC 2008","order":12},{"text":"Jie Zheng, T.

Web services are particularly important. As an increasing number of Web services provides equivalent functions, one common issue faced by users is the selection of the most appropriate one based on quality. This article presents a conceptual framework that characterizes the quality of Web services, an algorithm that quantifies them, and a system architecture that ranks Web services by using the proposed algorithm. In particular, the algorithm, called UsageQoS that computes the scores of quality of service (QoS) of Web services within a community, makes use of the usage frequencies of Web services. The frequencies are defined as the numbers of times invoked by other services in a given time period. The UsageQoS algorithm is able to optionally take user ratings as its initial input. The proposed approach has been validated by extensively experimenting on several datasets, including two real datasets. The results of the experiments have demonstrated that our approach is capable of estimating QoS parameters of Web services, regardless of whether user ratings are available or not.","author":["Xiaodi Huang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on the Web","Volume 8","Issue 1","December 2013","Article No.: 1","pp   1\u201331","https://doi.org/10.1145/2532635"],"date":"01 December 2013","ref":[{"text":"Ahn, Y.

Implicit-storing is related to error-code-tagging, a technique that distinguishes between faults in data and invariant attributes of a location when the attributes are not stored in the memory array but are encoded in the error-correction-codes. Both error-code-tagging and implicit-storing cause a code-strength reduction due to their encoding of additional information in the code meant to only protect data. Redundant-encoding-of-attributes is introduced to improve the strength of a code by encoding same information in multiple codewords in a cache or memory. We demonstrate how EREA and IREA, two derivatives of redundant-encoding, alleviate the code-strength reduction experienced by error-code-tagging and implicit-storing respectively. Implementing the proposed methods requires minor modifications in the encoding and decoding logic of the baseline error-correction scheme used in this work. The paper discusses several uses of the proposed schemes to help demonstrate their usefulness.","author":["Yiannakis Sazeides","Emre \u00d6zer","Danny Kershaw","Panagiota Nikolaou","Marios Kleanthous","Jaume Abella"],"issue":["MICRO-46: Proceedings of the 46th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2013","Pages   160\u2013171","https://doi.org/10.1145/2540708.2540723"],"date":"07 December 2013","ref":[{"text":"Artisan Memory Compilers. www.arm.com/products/physical-ip/embedded-memory-ip, 2013.","order":1},{"text":"Cortex-A9 technical reference manual. infocenter.arm.com, 2010.","order":2},{"text":"Cortex-r4 and cortex-r4f technical reference manual. infocenter.arm.com, 2010.","order":3},{"text":"J.

TLR provides runtime support for the secure component based on a .NET implementation for embedded devices. TLR reduces the TCB of an open source .NET implementation by a factor of $78$ with a tolerable performance cost. The main benefit of the TLR is to bring the developer benefits of managed code to trusted computing.

In recent years, tuned software libraries for multi-core microprocessors (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the status quo for computing SpMxV. However, the computational throughput of these libraries for sparse matrices tends to be significantly lower than that of dense matrices, mostly due to the fact that the compression formats required to efficiently store sparse matrices mismatches traditional computing architectures. This paper describes an FPGA-based SpMxV kernel that is scalable to efficiently utilize the available memory bandwidth and computing resources. Benchmarking on a Virtex-5 SX95T FPGA demonstrates an average computational efficiency of 91.85%. The kernel achieves a peak computational efficiency of 99.8%, a >50x improvement over two Intel Core i7 processors (i7-2600 and i7-4770) and showing a >300x improvement over two NVIDA GPUs (GTX 660 and GTX Titan), when running the MKL and cuSPARSE sparse-BLAS libraries, respectively. In addition, the SpMxV FPGA kernel is able to achieve higher performance than its CPU and GPU counterparts, while using only 64 single-precision processing elements, with an overall 38-50x improvement in energy efficiency.","author":["Richard Dorrance","Fengbo Ren","Dejan Markovi\u0107"],"issue":["FPGA '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM/SIGDA international symposium on Field-programmable gate arrays","February 2014","Pages   161\u2013170","https://doi.org/10.1145/2554688.2554785"],"date":"26 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"S.

We first investigate the number of communication buffers needed by a DRFPGA. These buffers are needed because the time-multiplexednature of DRFPGAs means that only a portion of the circuit implemented on the chip is present at any given time instance. Thus there is a need to store OT buffer signals until they are no longer needed. The hardware cost in a DRFPGA is the maximum number of buffers (plus associated routing) needed at any given time. We show experimentally that this number is almost as large as the number of computation nodes needed at any given time, and in some circuits twice as large. We also give a heuristic algorithm based on rescheduling nodes that reduces the number of buffers needed by 23%. Next we investigate time-multiplexed I/0 on a DRFPGA. We show that by using time-multiplexed 1/0pins, the number of physical I/0pins needed can be reduced by up to 83%.","author":["Douglas Chang","Malgorzata Marek-Sadowska"],"issue":["FPGA '97: Proceedings of the 1997 ACM fifth international symposium on Field-programmable gate arrays","February 1997","Pages   142\u2013148","https://doi.org/10.1145/258305.258331"],"date":"09 February 1997","ref":[{"text":"N.

DBX is an in-memory database that uses Intel's restricted transactional memory (RTM) to achieve high performance and good scalability across multi-core machines. The main limitation (and also key to practicality) of RTM is its constrained working set size: an RTM region that reads or writes too much data will always be aborted. The design of DBX addresses this challenge in several ways. First, DBX builds a database transaction layer on top of an underlying shared-memory store. The two layers use separate RTM regions to synchronize shared memory access. Second, DBX uses optimistic concurrency control to separate transaction execution from its commit. Only the commit stage uses RTM for synchronization. As a result, the working set of the RTMs used scales with the meta-data of reads and writes in a database transaction as opposed to the amount of data read/written. Our evaluation using TPC-C workload mix shows that DBX achieves 506,817 transactions per second on a 4-core machine.","author":["Zhaoguo Wang","Hao Qian","Jinyang Li","Haibo Chen"],"issue":["EuroSys '14: Proceedings of the Ninth European Conference on Computer Systems","April 2014","Article No.: 26","Pages   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/2592798.2592815"],"date":"14 April 2014","ref":[{"text":"D.

However, extreme sparsity of user-POI matrices creates a severe challenge. To cope with this challenge, viewing mobility records on location-based social networks (LBSNs) as implicit feedback for POI recommendation, we first propose to exploit weighted matrix factorization for this task since it usually serves collaborative filtering with implicit feedback better. Besides, researchers have recently discovered a spatial clustering phenomenon in human mobility behavior on the LBSNs, i.e., individual visiting locations tend to cluster together, and also demonstrated its effectiveness in POI recommendation, thus we incorporate it into the factorization model. Particularly, we augment users' and POIs' latent factors in the factorization model with activity area vectors of users and influence area vectors of POIs, respectively. Based on such an augmented model, we not only capture the spatial clustering phenomenon in terms of two-dimensional kernel density estimation, but we also explain why the introduction of such a phenomenon into matrix factorization helps to deal with the challenge from matrix sparsity. We then evaluate the proposed algorithm on a large-scale LBSN dataset. The results indicate that weighted matrix factorization is superior to other forms of factorization models and that incorporating the spatial clustering phenomenon into matrix factorization improves recommendation performance.","author":["Defu Lian","Cong Zhao","Xing Xie","Guangzhong Sun","Enhong Chen","Yong Rui"],"issue":["KDD '14: Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2014","Pages   831\u2013840","https://doi.org/10.1145/2623330.2623638"],"date":"24 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"G.

However, they suffer from serious reliability and endurance issues during the operating lifetime that can be handled by the use of appropriate error correction codes (ECCs) in order to reconstruct the information when needed. Adaptable ECCs may provide the flexibility to avoid worst-case reliability design, thus leading to improved performance. However, a way to control such adaptable ECCs' strength is required. This article proposes FLARES, an algorithm able to adapt the ECC correction capability of each page of a flash based on a flash RBER prediction model and on a measurement of the number of errors detected in a given time window.FLARES has been fully implemented within the YAFFS 2 filesystem under the Linux operating system. This allowed us to perform an extensive set of simulations on a set of standard benchmarks that highlighted the benefit of FLARES on the overall storage subsystem performances.","author":["Stefano Di Carlo","Salvatore Galfano","Marco Indaco","Paolo Prinetto","Davide Bertozzi","Piero Olivo","Cristian Zambelli"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 11","Issue 3","October 2014","Article No.: 26","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2631919"],"date":"31 July 2014","ref":[{"text":"Lilian Atieno, Jonathan Allen, Dennis Goeckel, and Russell Tessier. 2006.

With conventional subtitles, the viewer has to constantly look away from the main viewing area to read the subtitles at the bottom of the screen, which disrupts the viewing experience and causes unnecessary eyestrain. Our method places on-screen subtitles next to the respective speakers to allow the viewer to follow the visual content while simultaneously reading the subtitles. We use novel identification algorithms to detect the speakers based on audio and visual information. Then the placement of the subtitles is determined using global optimization. A comprehensive usability study indicated that our subtitle placement method outperformed both conventional fixed-position subtitling and another previous dynamic subtitling method in terms of enhancing the overall viewing experience and reducing eyestrain.","author":["Yongtao Hu","Jan Kautz","Yizhou Yu","Wenping Wang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications","Volume 11","Issue 2","December 2014","Article No.: 32","pp   1\u201317","https://doi.org/10.1145/2632111"],"date":"07 January 2015","ref":[{"text":"X.

DRAM cells that permanently exhibit short retention times are fairly easy to identify and repair through the use of memory tests and row and column redundancy. However, the retention time of many cells may vary over time due to a property called Variable Retention Time (VRT). Since these cells intermittently transition between failing and non-failing states, they are particularly difficult to identify through memory tests alone. In addition, the high temperature packaging process may aggravate this problem as the susceptibility of cells to VRT increases after the assembly of DRAM chips. A promising alternative to manufacture-time testing is to detect and mitigate retention failures after the system has become operational. Such a system would require mechanisms to detect and mitigate retention failures in the field, but would be responsive to retention failures introduced after system assembly and could dramatically reduce the cost of testing, enabling much longer tests than are practical with manufacturer testing equipment.In this paper, we analyze the efficacy of three common error mitigation techniques (memory tests, guardbands, and error correcting codes (ECC)) in real DRAM chips exhibiting both intermittent and permanent retention failures. Our analysis allows us to quantify the efficacy of recent system-level error mitigation mechanisms that build upon these techniques. We revisit prior works in the context of the experimental data we present, showing that our measured results significantly impact these works' conclusions. We find that mitigation techniques that rely on run-time testing alone [38, 27, 50, 26] are unable to ensure reliable operation even after many months of testing. Techniques that incorporate ECC[4, 52], however, can ensure reliable DRAM operation after only a few hours of testing. For example, VS-ECC[4], which couples testing with variable strength codes to allocate the strongest codes to the most error-prone memory regions, can ensure reliable operation for 10 years after only 19 minutes of testing. We conclude that the viability of these mitigation techniques depend on efficient online profiling of DRAM performed without disrupting system operation.","author":["Samira Khan","Donghyuk Lee","Yoongu Kim","Alaa R.

Despite extensive research efforts for decades, it remains one of the most challenging open problems that considerably hinders the successes of real-world CBIR systems. The key challenge has been attributed to the well-known ``semantic gap'' issue that exists between low-level image pixels captured by machines and high-level semantic concepts perceived by human. Among various techniques, machine learning has been actively investigated as a possible direction to bridge the semantic gap in the long term. Inspired by recent successes of deep learning techniques for computer vision and other applications, in this paper, we attempt to address an open problem: if deep learning is a hope for bridging the semantic gap in CBIR and how much improvements in CBIR tasks can be achieved by exploring the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for learning feature representations and similarity measures. Specifically, we investigate a framework of deep learning with application to CBIR tasks with an extensive set of empirical studies by examining a state-of-the-art deep learning method (Convolutional Neural Networks) for CBIR tasks under varied settings. From our empirical studies, we find some encouraging results and summarize some important insights for future research.","author":["Ji Wan","Dayong Wang","Steven Chu Hong Hoi","Pengcheng Wu","Jianke Zhu","Yongdong Zhang","Jintao Li"],"issue":["MM '14: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Multimedia","November 2014","Pages   157\u2013166","https://doi.org/10.1145/2647868.2654948"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"D.

In the OpenFlow implementation of the SDN model, the control layer, commonly referred to as a network operating system (NOS), has been realized by a range of competing implementations that offer various performance and functionality advantages: Floodlight, POX, NOX, and ONIX. In this paper we focus on the question of control layer resilience, when rapidly developed prototype network applications go awry, or third-party network applications incorporate unexpected vulnerabilities, fatal instabilities, or even malicious logic. We demonstrate how simple and common failures in a network application may lead to loss of the control layer, and in effect, loss of network control. To address these concerns we present the ROSEMARY controller, which implements a network application containment and resilience strategy based around the notion of spawning applications independently within a micro-NOS. ROSEMARY distinguishes itself by its blend of process containment, resource utilization monitoring, and an application permission structure, all designed to prevent common failures of network applications from halting operation of the SDN Stack. We present our design and implementation of ROSEMARY, along with an extensive evaluation of its performance relative to several of the mostly well-known and widely used controllers. Rather than imposing significant performance costs, we find that with the integration of two optimization features, ROSEMARY offers a competitive performance advantage over the majority of other controllers.","author":["Seungwon Shin","Yongjoo Song","Taekyung Lee","Sangho Lee","Jaewoong Chung","Phillip Porras","Vinod Yegneswaran","Jiseong Noh","Brent Byunghoon Kang"],"issue":["CCS '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","November 2014","Pages   78\u201389","https://doi.org/10.1145/2660267.2660353"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"ACCETTA, M., BARON, R., BOLOSKY, W., GOLUB, D., RASHID, R., TEVANIAN, A., AND YOUNG, M.

Many data mining tasks have been exploited in heterogeneous networks, among which clustering and ranking are two basic tasks. These two tasks are usually done separately, whereas recent researches show that they can mutually enhance each other. Unfortunately, these works are limited to heterogeneous networks with special structures (e.g. bipartite or star-schema network). However, real data are more complex and irregular, so it is desirable to design a general method to manage objects and relations in heterogeneous networks with arbitrary schema. In this paper, we study the ranking-based clustering problem in a general heterogeneous information network and propose a novel solution HeProjI. HeProjI projects a general heterogeneous network into a sequence of sub-networks and an information transfer mechanism is designed to keep the consistency among sub-networks. For each sub-network, a path-based random walk model is built to estimate the reachable probability of objects which can be used for clustering and ranking analysis. Iteratively analyzing each sub-network leads to effective ranking-based clustering. Extensive experiments on three real datasets illustrate that HeProjI can achieve better clustering and ranking performances compared to other well-established algorithms.","author":["Chuan Shi","Ran Wang","Yitong Li","Philip S.

Existing studies usually require a lot of labeled images to train deep convolutional networks. Our study suggests exploring multiple datasets and learning effective representation to learn related visual concepts. The practice of learning from multiple facets implicitly enforces to share features for image recognition. We show deep neural network benefits from the learning of multiple person-related categories in photos. Faceted classification systems learn from multiple resources, and alleviate the overfitting problems in deep learning. Moreover, by exploring multiple taxonomies of an object, it provides a finer annotation for the query images.","author":["Liangliang Cao","Zhicheng Yan","John R.

These are also applications where the use of FPGAs is continuously growing. To date, however there is no direct integration between FPGAs, which are digital, and the analog world (except for the newest generation of FPGAs). Currently, an external analog-to-digital converter (ADC) has to be added to the system, thus limiting its overall compactness and flexibility. To address this issue we propose a novel architecture implementing a high speed ADC in reconfigurable devices. The system exploits picosecond resolution time-to-digital converters (TDCs) to reach a conversion as fast as its clock speed. The resulting analog-through-time-to-digital converter (ATDC) can achieve a sampling rate of 200 MS/s with a 7 bit resolution for signals ranging from 0 to 2.5 V. Except for the external resistor needed for the analog reference ramp, the system is fully integrated inside the target FPGA. Moreover, our design can be easily scaled for multichannel ADCs, proving the suitability of reconfigurable devices for applications requiring a deep integration between analog and digital world.","author":["Harald Homulle","Francesco Regazzoni","Edoardo Charbon"],"issue":["FPGA '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2015","Pages   228\u2013235","https://doi.org/10.1145/2684746.2689070"],"date":"22 February 2015","ref":[{"text":"C.

We investigate how the perception of erroneous robot behavior may influence human interaction choices and the willingness to cooperate with the robot by following a number of its unusual requests. For this purpose, we conducted an experiment in which participants interacted with a home companion robot in one of two experimental conditions: (1) the correct mode or (2) the faulty mode. Our findings reveal that, while significantly affecting subjective perceptions of the robot and assessments of its reliability and trustworthiness, the robot's performance does not seem to substantially influence participants' decisions to (not) comply with its requests. However, our results further suggest that the nature of the task requested by the robot, e.g. whether its effects are revocable as opposed to irrevocable, has a significant impact on participants' willingness to follow its instructions.","author":["Maha Salem","Gabriella Lakatos","Farshid Amirabdollahian","Kerstin Dautenhahn"],"issue":["HRI '15: Proceedings of the Tenth Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","March 2015","Pages   141\u2013148","https://doi.org/10.1145/2696454.2696497"],"date":"02 March 2015","ref":[{"text":"W.

Building interconnects that enable concurrent communication tasks introduces decisive opportunities for reducing the overall communication latency. This work identifies three levels of parallelism at the interconnect level: global parallelism across different independent domains; local or intradomain parallelism, relying on inherently concurrent interconnect components such as crossbars; and interdomain parallelism, where multiple concurrent paths across different local domains are exploited. We propose an automated methodology to search the design space, aimed at maximizing the exploitation of these forms of parallelism. The approach also takes into consideration possible dependencies between communication tasks, which further constrains the design space, making the identification of a feasible solution more challenging. By jointly solving a scheduling and interconnect synthesis problem, the methodology turns the description of the application communication requirements, including data dependencies, into an on-chip synthesizable interconnection structure along with a communication schedule satisfying given area constraints. The article thoroughly describes the formalisms and the methodology used to derive such optimized heterogeneous topologies. It also discusses some case studies emphasizing the impact of the proposed approach and highlighting the essential differences with a few other solutions presented in the technical literature.","author":["Alessandro Cilardo","Edoardo Fusella","Luca Gallo","Antonino Mazzeo"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 14","Issue 3","May 2015","Article No.: 57","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/2700075"],"date":"30 April 2015","ref":[{"text":"ARM Limited. 2008.

The 15nm OCL is based on a generic predictive state-of-the-art technology node. The proposed cell library is intended to provide access to advanced technology node for universities and other research institutions, in order to design digital integrated circuits and also to develop cell-based design flows, EDA tools and associated algorithms. Developing a 15nm standard cell library brings out design challenges which are not present in previous technology nodes. Some of these challenges include double-patterning for both metal and poly layers, a very restrictive set of physical design rules, and the demand for lithography-friendly patterns. This paper discusses the development of the library considering the challenges associated with advanced technology nodes.","author":["Mayler Martins","Jody Maick Matos","Renato P.

Built on our experience with Shark, Spark SQL lets Spark programmers leverage the benefits of relational processing (e.g. declarative queries and optimized storage), and lets SQL users call complex analytics libraries in Spark (e.g. machine learning). Compared to previous systems, Spark SQL makes two main additions. First, it offers much tighter integration between relational and procedural processing, through a declarative DataFrame API that integrates with procedural Spark code. Second, it includes a highly extensible optimizer, Catalyst, built using features of the Scala programming language, that makes it easy to add composable rules, control code generation, and define extension points. Using Catalyst, we have built a variety of features (e.g. schema inference for JSON, machine learning types, and query federation to external databases) tailored for the complex needs of modern data analysis. We see Spark SQL as an evolution of both SQL-on-Spark and of Spark itself, offering richer APIs and optimizations while keeping the benefits of the Spark programming model.","author":["Michael Armbrust","Reynold S.

Large and complex datasets, such as Yago or DBLP, can be modeled as HINs. Recent work has studied how to make use of these rich information sources. In particular, meta-paths, which represent sequences of node classes and edge types between two nodes in a HIN, have been proposed for such tasks as information retrieval, decision making, and product recommendation. Current methods assume meta-paths are found by domain experts. However, in a large and complex HIN, retrieving meta-paths manually can be tedious and difficult. We thus study how to discover meta-paths automatically. Specifically, users are asked to provide example pairs of nodes that exhibit high proximity. We then investigate how to generate meta-paths that can best explain the relationship between these node pairs. Since this problem is computationally intractable, we propose a greedy algorithm to select the most relevant meta-paths. We also present a data structure to enable efficient execution of this algorithm. We further incorporate hierarchical relationships among node classes in our solutions. Extensive experiments on real-world HIN show that our approach captures important meta-paths in an efficient and scalable manner.","author":["Changping Meng","Reynold Cheng","Silviu Maniu","Pierre Senellart","Wangda Zhang"],"issue":["WWW '15: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web","May 2015","Pages   754\u2013764","https://doi.org/10.1145/2736277.2741123"],"date":"18 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"E.

Many designs have been proposed and realized with traditional CMOS technology or emerging devices. In this work, we proposed a spiking neuromorphic design built on resistive crossbar structures and implemented with IBM 130nm technology. Our design adopts a rate coding scheme where pre- and post-neuron signals are represented by digitalized pulses. The weighting function of pre-neuron signals is executed on the resistive crossbar in analog format. The computing result is transferred into digitalized output spikes via an integrate-and-fire circuit (IFC) as the post-neuron. We calibrated the computation accuracy of the entire system through circuit simulations. The results demonstrated a good match to our analytic modeling. Furthermore, we implemented both feedforward and Hopfield networks by utilizing the proposed neuromorphic design. The system performance and robustness were studied through massive Monte-Carlo simulations based on the application of digital image recognition. Comparing to the previous crossbar-based computing engine that represents data with voltage amplitude, our design can achieve >50% energy savings, while the average probability of failed recognition increase only 1.46% and 5.99% in the feedforward and Hopfield implementations, respectively.","author":["Chenchen Liu","Bonan Yan","Chaofei Yang","Linghao Song","Zheng Li","Beiye Liu","Yiran Chen","Hai Li","Qing Wu","Hao Jiang"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 14","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744783"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"W.

The conventional die-stacked DRAM cache has both a TLB and a cache tag array, which are responsible for virtual-to-physical and physical-to-cache address translation, respectively. We propose to align the granularity of caching with OS page size and take a unified approach to address translation and cache tag management. To this end, we introduce cache-map TLB (cTLB), which stores virtual-to-cache, instead of virtual-to-physical, address mappings. At a TLB miss, the TLB miss handler allocates the requested block into the cache if it is not cached yet, and updates both the page table and cTLB with the virtual-to-cache address mapping. Assuming the availability of large in-package DRAM caches, this ensures that an access to the memory region within the TLB reach always hits in the cache with low hit latency since a TLB access immediately returns the exact location of the requested block in the cache, hence saving a tag-checking operation. The remaining cache space is used as victim cache for memory pages that are recently evicted from cTLB. By completely eliminating data structures for cache tag management, from either on-die SRAM or in-package DRAM, the proposed DRAM cache achieves best scalability and hit latency, while maintaining high hit rate of a fully associative cache. Our evaluation with 3D Through-Silicon Via (TSV)-based in-package DRAM demonstrates that the proposed cache improves the IPC and energy efficiency by 30.9% and 39.5%, respectively, compared to the baseline with no DRAM cache. These numbers translate to 4.3% and 23.8% improvements over an impractical SRAM-tag cache requiring megabytes of on-die SRAM storage, due to low hit latency and zero energy waste for cache tags.","author":["Yongjun Lee","Jongwon Kim","Hakbeom Jang","Hyunggyun Yang","Jangwoo Kim","Jinkyu Jeong","Jae W.

Although these operations simply relocate the data in the memory, they are costly on conventional systems mainly due to inefficient access patterns, limited data reuse and roundtrip data traversal throughout the memory hierarchy. This paper presents a two pronged approach for efficient data reorganization, which combines (i) a proposed DRAM-aware reshape accelerator integrated within 3D-stacked DRAM, and (ii) a mathematical framework that is used to represent and optimize the reorganization operations. We evaluate our proposed system through two major use cases. First, we demonstrate the reshape accelerator in performing a physical address remapping via data layout transform to utilize the internal parallelism/locality of the 3D-stacked DRAM structure more efficiently for general purpose workloads. Then, we focus on offloading and accelerating commonly used data reorganization routines selected from the Intel Math Kernel Library package. We evaluate the energy and performance benefits of our approach by comparing it against existing optimized implementations on state-of-the-art GPUs and CPUs. For the various test cases, in-memory data reorganization provides orders of magnitude performance and energy efficiency improvements via low overhead hardware.","author":["Berkin Akin","Franz Franchetti","James C.

The observation driving approximate computing is that many applications tolerate small amounts of error which allows for an opportunistic relaxation of guard bands (e.g., clock rate and voltage). Besides affecting performance and power, reducing guard bands exposes analog properties of traditionally digital components. For DRAM, one analog property exposed by approximation is the variability of memory cell decay times. In this paper, we show how the differing cell decay times of approximate DRAM creates an error pattern that serves as a system identifying fingerprint. To validate this observation, we build an approximate memory platform and perform experiments that show that the fingerprint due to approximation is device dependent and resilient to changes in environment and level of approximation. To identify a DRAM chip given an approximate output, we develop a distance metric that yields a two-orders-of-magnitude difference in the distance between approximate results produced by the same DRAM chip and those produced by other DRAM chips. We use these results to create a mathematical model of approximate DRAM that we leverage to explore the end-to-end deanonymizing effects of approximate memory using a commodity system running an image manipulation program. The results from our experiment show that given less than 100 approximate outputs, the fingerprint for an approximate DRAM begins to converge to a single, machine identifying fingerprint.","author":["Amir Rahmati","Matthew Hicks","Daniel E.

However, adopting traditional memory technologies such as SRAM and embedded DRAM (eDRAM) leakage and scalability problems. Spin-transfer torque magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) is a novel nonvolatile memory technology that has emerged as a promising alternative for constructing on-chip caches in high-end mobile processors. STT-MRAM has many advantages, such as short read latency, zero leakage from the memory cell, and better scalability than eDRAM and SRAM. Multilevel cell (MLC) STT-MRAM further enlarges capacity and reduces per-bit cost by storing more bits in one cell.However, MLC STT-MRAM has long write latency which limits the effectiveness of MLC STT-MRAM-based LLCs. In this article, we address this limitation with three novel designs: line pairing (LP), line swapping (LS), and dynamic LP/LS enabler (DLE). LP forms fast cache lines by reorganizing MLC soft bits which are faster to write. LS dynamically stores frequently-written data into these fast cache lines. We then propose a dynamic LP/LS enabler (DLE) to enable LP and LS only if they help to improve the overall cache performance. Our experimental results show that the proposed designs improve system performance by 9--15% and reduce energy consumption by 14--21% for various types of mobile processors.","author":["Lei Jiang","Bo Zhao","Jun Yang","Youtao Zhang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 20","Issue 4","September 2015","Article No.: 54","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/2764903"],"date":"28 September 2015","ref":[{"text":"Mohammad Alizadeh, Adel Javanmard, Shang-Tse Chuang, Sundar Iyer, and Yi Lu. 2012.

We consider a 3D stacked processor executing independent instruction streams from different threads, on each die. We propose the vertical clustering of functionally identical computational blocks in order to enable the utilization of the 3D specific low-latency interlayer communication infrastructure. The clustering facilitates the parallel re-execution of instructions on idle units located in the proximity of the units which initially computed them and in this way creates the means for fault diagnosis and detection. We detail the control, interconnection communication infrastructure, instruction distribution, and results processing policies required for our scheme. To determine the effectiveness of the approach, we evaluate its performance in terms of diagnosis latency and percentage of verified operations on 3 to 8 core processors implemented on 3 to 8 tier 3D-SICs, respectively, by means of simulations. Our experiments indicate that the diagnosis latency ranges from 9 to 5 cycles, for 3 to 8 cores, respectively. For transient fault detection our simulations indicate that 86% to 94% of all executed instructions are verified, for 3 to 8 cores, respectively. When only one of the layers is protected against transient faults the number of verified operations increases to 94% to 99%, for the same simulation conditions. This suggests that, if certain conditions are fulfilled at design time, our approach can completely protect one instruction stream identified as being critical for the application. Our simulations clearly indicate that the proposed scheme has the potential to improve the 3D stacked integrated circuits dependability with no performance overhead and at the expense of little area overhead.","author":["Saleh Safiruddin","Mihai Lefter","Demid Borodin","George Voicu","Sorin Dan Cotofana"],"issue":["NANOARCH '12: Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","July 2012","Pages   123\u2013130","https://doi.org/10.1145/2765491.2765514"],"date":"04 July 2012","ref":[{"text":"G.

To this end, we make several important contributions: (1) We present a novel word representation learning model called Bilingual Word Embeddings Skip-Gram (BWESG) which is the first model able to learn bilingual word embeddings solely on the basis of document-aligned comparable data; (2) We demonstrate a simple yet effective approach to building document embeddings from single word embeddings by utilizing models from compositional distributional semantics. BWESG induces a shared cross-lingual embedding vector space in which both words, queries, and documents may be presented as dense real-valued vectors; (3) We build novel ad-hoc MoIR and CLIR models which rely on the induced word and document embeddings and the shared cross-lingual embedding space; (4) Experiments for English and Dutch MoIR, as well as for English-to-Dutch and Dutch-to-English CLIR using benchmarking CLEF 2001-2003 collections and queries demonstrate the utility of our WE-based MoIR and CLIR models. The best results on the CLEF collections are obtained by the combination of the WE-based approach and a unigram language model.

We consider the framework to use the world knowledge as indirect supervision. World knowledge is general-purpose knowledge, which is not designed for any specific domain. Then the key challenges are how to adapt the world knowledge to domains and how to represent it for learning. In this paper, we provide an example of using world knowledge for domain dependent document clustering. We provide three ways to specify the world knowledge to domains by resolving the ambiguity of the entities and their types, and represent the data with world knowledge as a heterogeneous information network. Then we propose a clustering algorithm that can cluster multiple types and incorporate the sub-type information as constraints. In the experiments, we use two existing knowledge bases as our sources of world knowledge. One is Freebase, which is collaboratively collected knowledge about entities and their organizations. The other is YAGO2, a knowledge base automatically extracted from Wikipedia and maps knowledge to the linguistic knowledge base, WordNet. Experimental results on two text benchmark datasets (20newsgroups and RCV1) show that incorporating world knowledge as indirect supervision can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art clustering algorithms as well as clustering algorithms enhanced with world knowledge features.","author":["Chenguang Wang","Yangqiu Song","Ahmed El-Kishky","Dan Roth","Ming Zhang","Jiawei Han"],"issue":["KDD '15: Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2015","Pages   1215\u20131224","https://doi.org/10.1145/2783258.2783374"],"date":"10 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"S.

Specifically, we show that it is possible to design devices and WiFi APs such that the WiFi AP in the process of transmitting data to normal WiFi clients can decode backscatter signals which the devices generate by modulating information on to the ambient WiFi transmission. We show via prototypes and experiments that it is possible to achieve communication rates of up to 5 Mbps at a range of 1 m and 1 Mbps at a range of 5 meters. Such performance is an order to three orders of magnitude better than the best known prior WiFi backscatter system [27,25]. BackFi design is energy efficient, as it relies on backscattering alone and needs insignificant power, hence the energy consumed per bit is small.","author":["Dinesh Bharadia","Kiran Raj Joshi","Manikanta Kotaru","Sachin Katti"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Conference on Special Interest Group on Data Communication","August 2015","Pages   283\u2013296","https://doi.org/10.1145/2785956.2787490"],"date":"17 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"Analog Devices ADG904 RF SP4T. http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADG904_904R.pdf .","order":1},{"text":"Cypress Semiconductor CY62146EV30 SRAM. http://www.cypress.com/?docID=48695 .","order":2},{"text":"EPC Class-1 Gen-2 UHF RFID. http://www.gs1.org/gsmp/kc/epcglobal/uhfc1g2/uhfc1g2_1_2_0-standard-20080511.pdf .","order":3},{"text":"ThingMagic.

Approximate computing is a promising approach that trades quality of result for gains in efficiency and performance. State- of-the-art approximate programming models require extensive manual annotations on program data and operations to guarantee safe execution of approximate programs. The need for extensive manual annotations hinders the practical use of approximation techniques. This paper describes FlexJava, a small set of language extensions, that significantly reduces the annotation effort, paving the way for practical approximate programming. These extensions enable programmers to annotate approximation-tolerant method outputs. The FlexJava compiler, which is equipped with an approximation safety analysis, automatically infers the operations and data that affect these outputs and selectively marks them approximable while giving safety guarantees. The automation and the language\u2013compiler codesign relieve programmers from manually and explicitly an- notating data declarations or operations as safe to approximate. FlexJava is designed to support safety, modularity, generality, and scalability in software development. We have implemented FlexJava annotations as a Java library and we demonstrate its practicality using a wide range of Java applications and by con- ducting a user study. Compared to EnerJ, a recent approximate programming system, FlexJava provides the same energy savings with significant reduction (from 2\u00d7 to 17\u00d7) in the number of annotations. In our user study, programmers spend 6\u00d7 to 12\u00d7 less time annotating programs using FlexJava than when using EnerJ.","author":["Jongse Park","Hadi Esmaeilzadeh","Xin Zhang","Mayur Naik","William Harris"],"issue":["ESEC/FSE 2015: Proceedings of the 2015 10th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering","August 2015","Pages   745\u2013757","https://doi.org/10.1145/2786805.2786807"],"date":"30 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"J.

The SSDs employ a RAM-based write buffer, which delays write requests for reducing write traffic, reorders requests for mitigating garbage-collection overhead, and produces parallel page writes for improving channel time utilization. This work presents a novel write buffer algorithm that exploits temporal and spatial correlations among buffer pages. The write-buffer groups temporally or spatially correlate buffer pages and then write the grouped buffer pages to the same flash block. In this way, when the correlated page data are updated in the future, flash blocks will receive bulk page invalidations and become good candidates for garbage collection. With multichannel architectures, the write buffer adaptively disperses read-most sequential data over channels for high page-level parallelism of sequential reads, while clustering write-most sequential data in the same channel for a reduced cost of garbage collection. We evaluated the proposed method and previously proposed buffer algorithms. Our method was shown to outperform the existing methods by up to 134%. We also implemented our buffer design on the OpenSSD platform; the time and space overheads of our design were reported to be very low.","author":["Sheng-Min Huang","Li-Pin Chang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 15","Issue 1","February 2016","Article No.: 12","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2815622"],"date":"13 January 2016","ref":[{"text":"Nitin Agrawal, Vijayan Prabhakaran, Ted Wobber, John D.

In this article, we present an enhanced systolic array architecture to realize QR decomposition based on the Givens rotation (GR) method for a 4 \u00d7 4 real matrix. The coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) algorithm is adopted and modified to speed up and simplify the process of GR. To verify the function and evaluate the performance, the proposed architectures are validated on a Virtex 5 FPGA development platform. Compared to a commercial implementation of vectoring CORDIC, the enhanced vectoring CORDIC is presented that uses 37.7% less hardware resources, dissipates 71.6% less power, and provides a 1.8 times speedup while maintaining the same computation accuracy. The enhanced QR systolic array architecture based on the enhanced vectoring CORDIC saves 24.5% in power dissipation, provides a factor of 1.5-fold improvement in throughput, and the hardware efficiency is improved 1.45-fold with no accuracy penalty when compared to our previously proposed QR systolic array architecture.","author":["Jianfeng Zhang","Paul Chow","Hengzhu Liu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 9","Issue 2","February 2016","Article No.: 9","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/2827700"],"date":"14 December 2015","ref":[{"text":"Ray Andraka. 1998.

SpotFi only uses information that is already exposed by WiFi chips and does not require any hardware or firmware changes, yet achieves the same accuracy as state-of-the-art localization systems. SpotFi makes two key technical contributions. First, SpotFi incorporates super-resolution algorithms that can accurately compute the angle of arrival (AoA) of multipath components even when the access point (AP) has only three antennas. Second, it incorporates novel filtering and estimation techniques to identify AoA of direct path between the localization target and AP by assigning values for each path depending on how likely the particular path is the direct path. Our experiments in a multipath rich indoor environment show that SpotFi achieves a median accuracy of 40 cm and is robust to indoor hindrances such as obstacles and multipath.","author":["Manikanta Kotaru","Kiran Joshi","Dinesh Bharadia","Sachin Katti"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 45","Issue 4","October 2015","pp   269\u2013282","https://doi.org/10.1145/2829988.2787487"],"date":"17 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"J.

Newcomer are important to the survival, long-term success, and continuity of these communities. However, newcomers face many barriers when making their first contribution to an OSS project, leading in many cases to dropouts. Therefore, a major challenge for OSS projects is to provide ways to support newcomers during their first contribution. In this paper, we propose and evaluate FLOSScoach, a portal created to support newcomers to OSS projects. FLOSScoach was designed based on a conceptual model of barriers created in our previous work. To evaluate the portal, we conducted a study with 65 students, relying on qualitative data from diaries, self-efficacy questionnaires, and the Technology Acceptance Model. The results indicate that FLOSScoach played an important role in guiding newcomers and in lowering barriers related to the orientation and contribution process, whereas it was not effective in lowering technical barriers. We also found that FLOSScoach is useful, easy to use, and increased newcomers' confidence to contribute. Our results can help project maintainers on deciding the points that need more attention in order to help OSS project newcomers overcome entry barriers.","author":["Igor Steinmacher","Tayana Uchoa Conte","Christoph Treude","Marco Aur\u00e9lio Gerosa"],"issue":["ICSE '16: Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Software Engineering","May 2016","Pages   273\u2013284","https://doi.org/10.1145/2884781.2884806"],"date":"14 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"Adler, A., Gujar, A., Harrison, B.

However, in TrueNorth chip, low quantization resolution of the synaptic weights and spikes significantly limits the inference (e.g., classification) accuracy of the deployed neural network model. Existing workaround, i.e., averaging the results over multiple copies instantiated in spatial and temporal domains, rapidly exhausts the hardware resources and slows down the computation. In this work, we propose a novel learning method on TrueNorth platform that constrains the random variance of each computation copy and reduces the number of needed copies. Compared to the existing learning method, our method can achieve up to 68.8% reduction of the required neuro-synaptic cores or 6.5\u00d7 speedup, with even slightly improved inference accuracy.","author":["Wei Wen","Chunpeng Wu","Yandan Wang","Kent Nixon","Qing Wu","Mark Barnell","Hai Li","Yiran Chen"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 18","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2897968"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"F.

However, developing customized wrappers at each IP for security requirements may incur significant overhead in area and hardware resources. In this paper, we address this problem by exploiting the extensive design-for-debug (DfD) instrumentation already available on-chip. In addition to reduction in the overall hardware overhead, the approach also adds flexibility to the security architecture itself, e.g., permitting use of on-field DfD instrumentation, survivability and control hooks to patch security policy implementation in response to bugs and attacks found at post-silicon or changing security requirements on-field. We show how to design scalable interface between security and debug architectures that provides the benefits of flexibility to security policy implementation without interfering with existing debug and survivability use cases and at minimal additional cost in energy and design complexity.","author":["Abhishek Basak","Swarup Bhunia","Sandip Ray"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 167","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898020"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"J.

The emerging metal-oxide resistive random-access memory (RRAM) and RRAM crossbar have shown great potential on neuromorphic applications with high energy efficiency. However, the interfaces between analog RRAM crossbars and digital peripheral functions, namely Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) and Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs), consume most of the area and energy of RRAM-based CNN design due to the large amount of intermediate data in CNN. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient structure for RRAM-based CNN. Based on the analysis of data distribution, a quantization method is proposed to transfer the intermediate data into 1 bit and eliminate DACs. An energy efficient structure using input data as selection signals is proposed to reduce the ADC cost for merging results of multiple crossbars. The experimental results show that the proposed method and structure can save 80% area and more than 95% energy while maintaining the same or comparable classification accuracy of CNN on MNIST.","author":["Lixue Xia","Tianqi Tang","Wenqin Huangfu","Ming Cheng","Xiling Yin","Boxun Li","Yu Wang","Huazhong Yang"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 125","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898101"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"J.

As we find that optimizing replacement algorithms is of limited effect for this purpose, a promising approach is to use a compact data organization and data compression to increase effective cache size. However, this approach has the risk of degrading the cache's performance due to additional computation cost. A common perception is that a high-performance KV cache is not compatible with use of data compacting techniques. In this paper, we show that, by leveraging highly skewed data access pattern common in real-world KV cache workloads, we can both reduce miss ratio through improved memory efficiency and maintain high performance for a KV cache. Specifically, we design and implement a KV cache system, named zExpander, which dynamically partitions the cache into two sub-caches. One serves frequently accessed data for high performance, and the other compacts data and metadata for high memory efficiency to reduce misses. Experiments show that zExpander can increase memcached's effective cache size by up to 2x and reduce miss ratio by up to 46%. When integrated with a cache of a higher performance, its advantages remain. For example, with 24 threads on a YCSB workload zExpander can achieve throughput of 32 million RPS with 36% of its cache misses removed.","author":["Xingbo Wu","Li Zhang","Yandong Wang","Yufei Ren","Michel Hack","Song Jiang"],"issue":["EuroSys '16: Proceedings of the Eleventh European Conference on Computer Systems","April 2016","Article No.: 14","Pages   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/2901318.2901332"],"date":"18 April 2016","ref":[{"text":"LZ4: Extremely Fast Compression algorithm. https://code.google.com/p/lz4/.","order":1},{"text":"LevelDB: A Fast and Lightweight Key/Value Database Library by Google. https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/.","order":2},{"text":"A Memory Allocator. http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html.","order":3},{"text":"TCMalloc: Thread-Caching Malloc. http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html.","order":4},{"text":"complete binary tree. http://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/completeBinaryTree.html.","order":5},{"text":"Memcached: A distributed memory object caching system. http://memcached.org/.","order":6},{"text":"Protocol Buffers. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers.","order":7},{"text":"How we cut down memory usage by 82 http://labs.octivi.com/how-we-cut-down-memory-usage-by-82/.","order":8},{"text":"How much text versus metadata is in a tweet? http://goo.gl/EBFIFs.","order":9},{"text":"zram: Compressed RAM based block devices. https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/blockdev/zram.txt.","order":10},{"text":"The zswap compressed swap cache. https://lwn.net/Articles/537422/.","order":11},{"text":"A.

It performs well in discrete error spaces but not on the continuous-valued problems that compose most system identification tasks. In this paper, we develop a new form of lexicase selection for symbolic regression, named \u03b5-lexicase selection, that redefines the pass condition for individuals on each test case in a more effective way. We run a series of experiments on real-world and synthetic problems with several treatments of \u03b5 and quantify how \u03b5 affects parent selection and model performance. \u03b5-lexicase selection is shown to be effective for regression, producing better fit models compared to other techniques such as tournament selection and age-fitness Pareto optimization. We demonstrate that \u03b5 can be adapted automatically for individual test cases based on the population performance distribution. Our experiments show that \u03b5-lexicase selection with automatic \u03b5 produces the most accurate models across tested problems with negligible computational overhead. We show that behavioral diversity is exceptionally high in lexicase selection treatments, and that \u03b5-lexicase selection makes use of more fitness cases when selecting parents than lexicase selection, which helps explain the performance improvement.","author":["William La Cava","Lee Spector","Kourosh Danai"],"issue":["GECCO '16: Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference 2016","July 2016","Pages   741\u2013748","https://doi.org/10.1145/2908812.2908898"],"date":"20 July 2016","ref":[{"text":"A.

FPGA have the unique feature of a reconfigurable architecture by opposition to CPU, GPU or DSP which have a fixed architecture and are only programmable. For example the elementary functions in an FPGA can be configured according to an addressable memory, as such the interconnection among them, the internal memory organization, but also even the ultra high-speed input/output of the chip to interface with the outside world. This fine grain configurability allows high performance and power efficiency. We introduce the architecture of modern FPGA with their main building blocks and how functional operations can be expressed. The translation of imperative languages down to the hardware level is done through High-Level Synthesis. It can be done in several ways with different time/surface trade-off, for example by playing on parallelism and pipelining.","author":["Jeff Fifield","Ronan Keryell","Herv\u00e9 Ratigner","Henry Styles","Jim Wu"],"issue":["IWOCL '16: Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on OpenCL","April 2016","Article No.: 5","Pages   1\u20132","https://doi.org/10.1145/2909437.2909447"],"date":"19 April 2016"},{"_id":"10.1145/2911451.2914807","title":"Constructing and Mining Web-scale Knowledge Graphs","abstract":"Recent years have witnessed a proliferation of large-scale knowledge graphs, from purely academic projects such as YAGO to major commercial projects such as Google's Knowledge Graph and Microsoft's Satori. Whereas there is a large body of research on mining homogeneous graphs, this new generation of information networks are highly heterogeneous, with thousands of entity and relation types and billions of instances of those types (graph vertices and edges). In this tutorial, we present the state of the art in constructing, mining, and growing knowledge graphs. The purpose of the tutorial is to equip newcomers to this exciting field with an understanding of the basic concepts, tools and methodologies, open research challenges, as well as pointers to available datasets and relevant literature. Knowledge graphs have become an enabling resource for a plethora of new knowledge-rich applications. Consequently, the tutorial will also discuss the role of knowledge bases in empowering a range of web applications, from web search to social networks to digital assistants. A publicly available knowledge base (Freebase) will be used throughout the tutorial to exemplify the different techniques.","author":["Evgeniy Gabrilovich","Nicolas Usunier"],"issue":["SIGIR '16: Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","July 2016","Pages   1195\u20131197","https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2914807"],"date":"07 July 2016","ref":[{"text":"M.

Given an n-party protocol that takes $R$ rounds assuming noiseless communication, the goal is to find a coding scheme that takes R' rounds and computes the same function with high probability even when the communication is noisy, while maintaining a constant asymptotic rate, i.e., while keeping n,R\u2192\u221e R/R' positive. Rajagopalan and Schulman (STOC '94) were the first to consider this question, and provided a coding scheme with rate O(1/log (d+1)), where d is the maximal degree in the network. While that scheme provides a constant rate coding for many practical situations, in the worst case, e.g., when the network is a complete graph, the rate is~O(1/log n), which tends to 0 as n tends to infinity. We revisit this question and provide an efficient coding scheme with a constant rate for the interesting case of fully connected networks. We furthermore extend the result and show that if a (d-regular) network has mixing timem, then there exists an efficient coding scheme with rate O(1/m3log m). This implies a constant rate coding scheme for any n-party protocol over a d-regular network with a constant mixing time, and in particular for random graphs with $n$ vertices and degrees n\u03a9(1).","author":["Noga Alon","Mark Braverman","Klim Efremenko","Ran Gelles","Bernhard Haeupler"],"issue":["PODC '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing","July 2016","Pages   165\u2013173","https://doi.org/10.1145/2933057.2933085"],"date":"25 July 2016","ref":[{"text":"S.

While we can tweak scheduling parameters, we cannot modify algorithmic logic, or add a completely new algorithm, after the switch has been designed. This paper presents a design for a {\\em programmable} packet scheduler, which allows scheduling algorithms---potentially algorithms that are unknown today---to be programmed into a switch without requiring hardware redesign. Our design uses the property that scheduling algorithms make two decisions: in what order to schedule packets and when to schedule them. Further, we observe that in many scheduling algorithms, definitive decisions on these two questions can be made when packets are enqueued. We use these observations to build a programmable scheduler using a single abstraction: the push-in first-out queue (PIFO), a priority queue that maintains the scheduling order or time. We show that a PIFO-based scheduler lets us program a wide variety of scheduling algorithms. We present a hardware design for this scheduler for a 64-port 10 Gbit/s shared-memory (output-queued) switch. Our design costs an additional 4% in chip area. In return, it lets us program many sophisticated algorithms, such as a 5-level hierarchical scheduler with programmable decisions at each level.","author":["Anirudh Sivaraman","Suvinay Subramanian","Mohammad Alizadeh","Sharad Chole","Shang-Tse Chuang","Anurag Agrawal","Hari Balakrishnan","Tom Edsall","Sachin Katti","Nick McKeown"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGCOMM Conference","August 2016","Pages   44\u201357","https://doi.org/10.1145/2934872.2934899"],"date":"22 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"Barefoot: The World's Fastest and Most Programmable Networks. https://barefootnetworks.com/media/white_papers/Barefoot-Worlds-Fastest-Most-Programmable-Networks.pdf.","order":1},{"text":"Cadence Encounter RTL Compiler. http://www.cadence.com/products/ld/rtl_compiler.","order":2},{"text":"High Capacity StrataXGSTrident II Ethernet Switch Series. http://www.broadcom.com/products/Switching/Data-Center/BCM56850-Series.","order":3},{"text":"High-Density 25/100 Gigabit Ethernet StrataXGS Tomahawk Ethernet Switch Series. http://www.broadcom.com/products/Switching/Data-Center/BCM56960-Series.","order":4},{"text":"Intel FlexPipe. http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-briefs/ethernet-switch-fm6000-series-brief.pdf.","order":5},{"text":"Packet Buffers. http://people.ucsc.edu/ warner/buffer.html.","order":6},{"text":"Priority Flow Control: Build Reliable Layer 2 Infrastructure. http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps9441/ps9670/white_paper_c11-542809_ns783_Networking_Solutions_White_Paper.html.","order":7},{"text":"SRAM - ARM. https://www.arm.com/products/physical-ip/embedded-memory-ip/sram.php.","order":8},{"text":"System Verilog. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SystemVerilog.","order":9},{"text":"Token Bucket. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket.","order":10},{"text":"XPliant Ethernet Switch Product Family. http://www.cavium.com/XPliant-Ethernet-Switch-Product-Family.html.","order":11},{"text":"M.

The existing graph embedding methods cannot preserve the asymmetric transitivity well, which is a critical property of directed graphs. Asymmetric transitivity depicts the correlation among directed edges, that is, if there is a directed path from u to v, then there is likely a directed edge from u to v. Asymmetric transitivity can help in capturing structures of graphs and recovering from partially observed graphs. To tackle this challenge, we propose the idea of preserving asymmetric transitivity by approximating high-order proximity which are based on asymmetric transitivity. In particular, we develop a novel graph embedding algorithm, High-Order Proximity preserved Embedding (HOPE for short), which is scalable to preserve high-order proximities of large scale graphs and capable of capturing the asymmetric transitivity. More specifically, we first derive a general formulation that cover multiple popular high-order proximity measurements, then propose a scalable embedding algorithm to approximate the high-order proximity measurements based on their general formulation. Moreover, we provide a theoretical upper bound on the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) of the approximation. Our empirical experiments on a synthetic dataset and three real-world datasets demonstrate that HOPE can approximate the high-order proximities significantly better than the state-of-art algorithms and outperform the state-of-art algorithms in tasks of reconstruction, link prediction and vertex recommendation.","author":["Mingdong Ou","Peng Cui","Jian Pei","Ziwei Zhang","Wenwu Zhu"],"issue":["KDD '16: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2016","Pages   1105\u20131114","https://doi.org/10.1145/2939672.2939751"],"date":"13 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"M.

The representation allows complex arithmetic to be performed with very simple logic, but it suffers from high latency and poor precision. Furthermore, the results are always somewhat inaccurate due to random fluctuations. The random or pseudorandom sources required to generate the representation are costly, consuming a majority of the circuit area (and diminishing the overall gains in area). In this paper, we show that randomness is not a requirement for this computational paradigm. If properly structured, the same arithmetical constructs can operate on deterministic bit streams, with the data represented uniformly by the fraction of 1's versus 0's. This paper presents three approaches for the computation: relatively prime stream lengths, rotation, and clock division. The three methods are evaluated on a collection of arithmetical functions. Unlike stochastic methods, all three of our deterministic methods produce completely accurate results. The cost of generating the deterministic streams is a small fraction of the cost of generating streams from random/pseudorandom sources. Most importantly, the latency is reduced by a factor of 1/2n, where n is the equivalent number of bits of precision.","author":["Devon Jenson","Marc Riedel"],"issue":["ICCAD '16: Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2016","Article No.: 102","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2966988"],"date":"07 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"B.

Traditional triggers base on rare events, such as rare values or sequences. While in most cases these trigger circuits are able to hide a Trojan attack, exhaustive functional simulation and testing will reveal the Trojan due to violation of the specification. Our trigger behaves functionally and formally equivalent to the hardware description language (HDL) specification throughout the entire FPGA design flow, until the design is written by the place-and-route tool as bitstream configuration file . From then, Trojan payload is always on. We implement the trigger signal using a 4-input lookup table (LUT), each of the inputs connecting to the same signal. This lets us directly address the least significant bit (LSB) and most significant bit (MSB) of the LUT. With the remaining 14 bits, we realize a \"magic\" unary operation. This way, we are able to implement 16 different Triggers. We demonstrate the attack with a simple example and discuss the effectiveness of the recent detection techniques unused circuit identification (UCI), functional analysis for nearly-unused circuit identification (FANCI) and VeriTrust in order to reveal our trigger.","author":["Christian Krieg","Clifford Wolf","Axel Jantsch"],"issue":["ICCAD '16: Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2016","Article No.: 43","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967054"],"date":"07 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"M.

It is well suited for applications running in resource-restricted devices such as smart cards. At present, there is no efficient algorithm or known sub-exponential algorithm to break ECC theoretically. However, a hardware implementation of ECC leaks secret key information due to power analysis attacks particularly differential power analysis attack(DPA). These attacks break the system with far less effort when compared to all other attacks based on algebraic weaknesses of the algorithms. There are many solutions to overcome the power analysis attack, but all the available solutions have their own advantages and disadvantages by compromising either its security or performance. In this paper, we present a secure and efficient algorithm to solve the elliptic curve scalar multiplication(ECSM) using initial points randomization and by delaying the point addition operation. The implementation results and performance analysis shows that the proposed algorithm is efficient and secure against power analysis attacks.","author":["T. Sudhakar","V. Natarajan","A.

The vast majority of these algorithms are designed to work with independent and identically distributed documents. However, in many real-world applications, documents are inherently linked. For example, web documents such as blogs and online news often have hyperlinks to other web documents, and scientific articles usually cite other articles. Linked documents present new challenges to traditional document embedding algorithms. In addition, most existing document embedding algorithms are unsupervised and their learned representations may not be optimal for classification when labeling information is available. In this paper, we study the problem of linked document embedding for classification and propose a linked document embedding framework LDE, which combines link and label information with content information to learn document representations for classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Further experiments are conducted to understand the importance of link and label information in the proposed framework LDE.","author":["Suhang Wang","Jiliang Tang","Charu Aggarwal","Huan Liu"],"issue":["CIKM '16: Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2016","Pages   115\u2013124","https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983755"],"date":"24 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"Jacob Abernethy, Olivier Chapelle, and Carlos Castillo.

However, there have been few positive results of deep models on ad-hoc retrieval tasks. This is partially due to the fact that many important characteristics of the ad-hoc retrieval task have not been well addressed in deep models yet. Typically, the ad-hoc retrieval task is formalized as a matching problem between two pieces of text in existing work using deep models, and treated equivalent to many NLP tasks such as paraphrase identification, question answering and automatic conversation. However, we argue that the ad-hoc retrieval task is mainly about relevance matching while most NLP matching tasks concern semantic matching, and there are some fundamental differences between these two matching tasks. Successful relevance matching requires proper handling of the exact matching signals, query term importance, and diverse matching requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel deep relevance matching model (DRMM) for ad-hoc retrieval. Specifically, our model employs a joint deep architecture at the query term level for relevance matching. By using matching histogram mapping, a feed forward matching network, and a term gating network, we can effectively deal with the three relevance matching factors mentioned above. Experimental results on two representative benchmark collections show that our model can significantly outperform some well-known retrieval models as well as state-of-the-art deep matching models.","author":["Jiafeng Guo","Yixing Fan","Qingyao Ai","W.

We merge designing of a 3D urban model with a controlled long-lasting spatiotemporal interactive simulation of weather. Starting from the fundamental dynamical equations similar to those used in state-of-the-art weather models, we present a novel simplified urban weather model for interactive graphics. Control of physically based weather phenomena is accomplished via an inverse modeling methodology. In our results, we present several scenarios of forward design, inverse design with high-level and detailed-level weather control and optimization, and comparisons of our method against well-known weather simulation results and systems.","author":["Ignacio Garcia-Dorado","Daniel G.

Our framework allows types to be polymorphic in the type qualifiers. We present a const-inference system for C as an example application of the framework.

In many and perhaps most of these applications, users need to trade off competing goals. Machine learning, however, has evolved around the optimization of a single, usually narrowly-defined criterion. In most cases, an expert makes (or should be making) trade-offs between these criteria which requires high-level (human) intelligence. With interactive customization and optimization the expert can incorporate secondary criteria into the model-generation process in an interactive way. In this paper we develop the techniques to perform customized and interactive model optimization, and demonstrate the approach on several examples. The keys to our approach are (i) a machine learning architecture which is modular and supports primary and secondary loss functions, while users can directly manipulate its parameters during training (ii) high-performance training so that non-trivial models can be trained in real-time (using roofline design and GPU hardware), and (iii) highly-interactive visualization tools that support dynamic creation of visualizations and controls to match various optimization criteria.","author":["Biye Jiang","John Canny"],"issue":["IUI '17: Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces","March 2017","Pages   535\u2013546","https://doi.org/10.1145/3025171.3025172"],"date":"07 March 2017","ref":[{"text":"Amershi, S., Cakmak, M., Knox, W.

Built upon a decentralized peer to peer system, it supports transparent, fast, cost effective, and irreversible transactions, without the need for trusting third party financial institutions. We know however little about people's motivation and experience with bitcoin currency. This paper reports on interviews with 20 bitcoin users in Malaysia about their experience and trust challenges. Findings show that bitcoins are used more as store of value for speculative investment or savings' protection. The paper advances the HCI theories on trust by identifying main bitcoin characteristics and their impact on trust, such as decentralization, unregulation, embedded expertise, and reputation, as well as transactions' transparency, low cost, and easiness to complete. We discuss insecure transactions, the risk of dishonest traders and its mitigating strategies. The paper concludes with design implications including support for the transparency of two-way transactions, tools for materializing trust, and tools for supporting reversible transactions.","author":["Corina Sas","Irni Eliana Khairuddin"],"issue":["CHI '17: Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","May 2017","Pages   6499\u20136510","https://doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025886"],"date":"02 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"Michael Bacharach and Diego Gambetta. 2003.

Analysis of the query log from our academic search engine, SemanticScholar.org, reveals that a major error source is its inability to understand the meaning of research concepts in queries. To addresses this challenge, ESR represents queries and documents in the entity space and ranks them based on their semantic connections from their knowledge graph embedding. Experiments demonstrate ESR's ability in improving Semantic Scholar's online production system, especially on hard queries where word-based ranking fails.","author":["Chenyan Xiong","Russell Power","Jamie Callan"],"issue":["WWW '17: Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web","April 2017","Pages   1271\u20131279","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052558"],"date":"03 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

In this work, we study the connection between metric learning and collaborative filtering. We propose Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) which learns a joint metric space to encode not only users' preferences but also the user-user and item-item similarity. The proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms on a wide range of recommendation tasks and uncovers the underlying spectrum of users' fine-grained preferences. CML also achieves significant speedup for Top-K recommendation tasks using off-the-shelf, approximate nearest-neighbor search, with negligible accuracy reduction.","author":["Cheng-Kang Hsieh","Longqi Yang","Yin Cui","Tsung-Yi Lin","Serge Belongie","Deborah Estrin"],"issue":["WWW '17: Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web","April 2017","Pages   193\u2013201","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052639"],"date":"03 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"D.

This paper proposes the first online sample preparation algorithm based on the lookup table method, named LUTOSAP. LUTOSAP enables fast query response for online sample preparation requirements with the solution where the weighted sum of sample consumption, buffer consumption, and the number of mix-split operations is optimized. Experimental results show that LUTOSAP obtains optimal sample preparation solutions in microseconds within the accuracy tolerance of $0.2\\%$ for both single and double concentration values, which is orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms. For multiple concentration values, the multiple-target sample preparation algorithm in LUTOSAP obtains near-optimal solution based on the constructed lookup table in microseconds, which well meets the critical fast-response requirements in online sample preparation.","author":["Lingxuan Shao","Yibin Yang","Hailong Yao","Tsung-Yi Ho","Yici Cai"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '17: Proceedings of the on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI 2017","May 2017","Pages   447\u2013450","https://doi.org/10.1145/3060403.3060446"],"date":"10 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"J.

In this work, we advance the state-of-the-art counterfeit detection of flash memory, which is widely used in electronic systems. Fake memories may be used in critical systems, such as missiles, military aircrafts and helicopters, thus diminishing their reliability. In addition, there are countless stories of fake flash drives in the general consumer market. We propose a comprehensive framework called FFD to detect fake flash memories (i.e., recycled, remarked and cloned parts). FFD is validated with 200,000 commercial flash memory pages. Experimental results show that our framework performs well in: 1) nearly 100% detection accuracy of flash with as little as 5% usage, 2) estimating the flash memory usage with high resolution (\u2264 5% of its maximal endurance). Another contribution of this work is a chip ID generation technique that can generate unique flash fingerprints with greater than 99.3% reliability.","author":["Zimu Guo","Xiaolin Xu","Mark M.

Considering the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions, the always changing environment, and the infeasibility to analyze complete dynamics of designed systems over all probable conditions, autonomous self-adjustment is necessary for systems to be robust against internal and external variations. However, to date, the essential self-adapting capability remains missing from most synthetic designs. The deficiency hinders the robustness of designed systems, limiting applicable scenarios. To remedy the deficiency, we propose a cell-compatible way that exploits the similarities between two biological signal transmission media, i.e., cell signaling pathways and action potential of spiking neurons. Given the ubiquity and versatility of cell signaling pathways preserved across various cells and organisms, the proposed method can potentially embed self-adapting neuromorphic computation into biochemical reaction systems of a broader realm.","author":["Katherine H.

While chipmakers provide hardware support for basic security and privacy primitives such as enclaves and memory encryption. these primitives do not address hiding of the memory access pattern, information about which may enable attacks on the system or reveal characteristics of sensitive user data. State-of-the-art approaches to protecting the access pattern are largely based on Oblivious RAM (ORAM). Unfortunately, current ORAM implementations suffer from very significant practicality and overhead concerns, including roughly an order of magnitude slowdown, more than 100% memory capacity overheads, and the potential for system deadlock. Memory technology trends are moving towards 3D and 2.5D integration, enabling significant logic capabilities and sophisticated memory interfaces. Leveraging the trends, we propose a new approach to access pattern obfuscation, called ObfusMem. ObfusMem adds the memory to the trusted computing base and incorporates cryptographic engines within the memory. ObfusMem encrypts commands and addresses on the memory bus, hence the access pattern is cryptographically obfuscated from external observers. Our evaluation shows that ObfusMem incurs an overhead of 10.9% on average, which is about an order of magnitude faster than ORAM implementations. Furthermore, ObfusMem does not incur capacity overheads and does not amplify writes. We analyze and compare the security protections provided by ObfusMem and ORAM, and highlight their differences.","author":["Amro Awad","Yipeng Wang","Deborah Shands","Yan Solihin"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   107\u2013119","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080230"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"2000.

However, DNNs impose significant computational challenges owing to the complexity of the networks and the amount of data they process, both of which are projected to grow in the future. To improve the efficiency of DNNs, we propose ScaleDeep, a dense, scalable server architecture, whose processing, memory and interconnect subsystems are specialized to leverage the compute and communication characteristics of DNNs. While several DNN accelerator designs have been proposed in recent years, the key difference is that ScaleDeep primarily targets DNN training, as opposed to only inference or evaluation. The key architectural features from which ScaleDeep derives its efficiency are: (i) heterogeneous processing tiles and chips to match the wide diversity in computational characteristics (FLOPs and Bytes/FLOP ratio) that manifest at different levels of granularity in DNNs, (ii) a memory hierarchy and 3-tiered interconnect topology that is suited to the memory access and communication patterns in DNNs, (iii) a low-overhead synchronization mechanism based on hardware data-flow trackers, and (iv) methods to map DNNs to the proposed architecture that minimize data movement and improve core utilization through nested pipelining. We have developed a compiler to allow any DNN topology to be programmed onto ScaleDeep, and a detailed architectural simulator to estimate performance and energy. The simulator incorporates timing and power models of ScaleDeep's components based on synthesis to Intel's 14nm technology. We evaluate an embodiment of ScaleDeep with 7032 processing tiles that operates at 600 MHz and has a peak performance of 680 TFLOPs (single precision) and 1.35 PFLOPs (half-precision) at 1.4KW. Across 11 state-of-the-art DNNs containing 0.65M-14.9M neurons and 6.8M-145.9M weights, including winners from 5 years of the ImageNet competition, ScaleDeep demonstrates 6x-28x speedup at iso-power over the state-of-the-art performance on GPUs.","author":["Swagath Venkataramani","Ashish Ranjan","Subarno Banerjee","Dipankar Das","Sasikanth Avancha","Ashok Jagannathan","Ajaya Durg","Dheemanth Nagaraj","Bharat Kaul","Pradeep Dubey","Anand Raghunathan"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   13\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080244"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"2013.

However, the reliability is sacrificed due to much higher raw bit error rates. As a result, conventional error correction codes (ECCs), such as BCH codes, are not sufficient. Low-density parity check (LDPC) codes with stronger error correction capability are adopted in NAND flash to guarantee data reliability. However, read performance using LDPC is poor because of its decoding complexity. It has been found that flash cells with fewer electrons are more prone to program interference errors. As a result, program interference errors show the characteristic of value dependence. This characteristic can be exploited and translated into extra information facilitating the decoding convergence. Motivated by this observation, we propose PEAL: a flash <underline>p</underline>rogram interference <underline>e</underline>rror <underline>a</underline>ware <underline>L</underline>DPC scheme to enhance the decoding performance. PEAL integrates the obtained extra information from the value dependence into the soft-to-hard decision process in LDPC decoding to decrease decoding iterations and improve the decoding convergence speed. Simulation results show that decoding iterations are reduced by up to 69.37% and the decoding convergence speed is improved by up to 2.5\u00d7, compared with the normalized min-sum (NMS) algorithm with 2KB information lengths at an approximate raw bit error rate of 11.5 \u00d7 10\u22123.","author":["Fei Wu","Meng Zhang","Yajuan Du","Xubin He","Ping Huang","Changsheng Xie","Jiguang Wan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 16","Issue 5s","October 2017","Article No.: 141","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/3126563"],"date":"27 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"Y.

Over the past decade, several research works have explored approximate computing at both the software level and hardware level of abstraction with encouraging results. At the hardware level of abstraction, adders (being the fundamental and most widely used data operators in digital systems) have attracted a significant attention for approximation. In this article, we first explain briefly the need/significance of approximate adders. We then propose four Approximate Full Adders (AFAs) for high-performance energy-efficient approximate computing. The key design objective behind the proposed AFAs is to curtail the length of carry propagation subjected to minimal error rate. Next, we exploit one of the proposed AFAs (optimal one) to construct an N-bit approximate adder that hereinafter is referred as \u201cApproxADD.\u201d An emergent property of ApproxADD is that carries do not propagate in it, and, consequently, it provides bit-width-aware constant delay (O(1)). ApproxADD also provides improvement in dynamic power consumption by 46.31% and in area by 28.57% w.r.t. Ripple Carry Adder (RCA), which exhibits the lowest power and area. Although ApproxADD provides a significant improvement in delay, power, and area, it may not be preferred for some of the error-resilient applications because its: (i) Error Distance (ED) is too high; and (ii) Error Rate (ER) increases rapidly with bit-width (N). To improve ED and ER, we exploit the concept of carry-lifetime and Error Detection and Correction logic, respectively. In this way, we introduce two more (improved) versions of ApproxADD--ApproxADD\u03c51 and ApproxADD. We call these as ApproxADD\u03c51 and ApproxADD\u03c52 with existing approximate adders based on conventional design metrics and approximate computing design metrics. Furthermore, to inspect effectiveness of the proposed approach in real-life applications, we demonstrate image compression and decompression by replacing the conventional addition operations in Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT) modules with ApproxADD\u03c52.","author":["Sunil Dutt","Sukumar Nandi","Gaurav Trivedi"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 17","Issue 2","April 2018","Article No.: 40","pp   1\u201328","https://doi.org/10.1145/3131274"],"date":"07 December 2017","ref":[{"text":"Richard P.

Stylometry research has yielded several methods and tools over the past 200 years to handle a variety of challenging cases. This survey reviews several articles within five prominent subtasks: authorship attribution, authorship verification, authorship profiling, stylochronometry, and adversarial stylometry. Discussions on datasets, features, experimental techniques, and recent approaches are provided. Further, a current research challenge lies in the inability of authorship analysis techniques to scale to a large number of authors with few text samples. Here, we perform an extensive performance analysis on a corpus of 1,000 authors to investigate authorship attribution, verification, and clustering using 14 algorithms from the literature. Finally, several remaining research challenges are discussed, along with descriptions of various open-source and commercial software that may be useful for stylometry subtasks.","author":["Tempestt Neal","Kalaivani Sundararajan","Aneez Fatima","Yiming Yan","Yingfei Xiang","Damon Woodard"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 50","Issue 6","January 2018","Article No.: 86","pp   1\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132039"],"date":"22 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"Novino Nirmala, Kyung-Ah Sohn, and T.

Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase of network bandwidth in data centers, shifting the bottleneck of most KVS from the network to the CPU. RDMA-capable NIC partly alleviates the problem, but the primitives provided by RDMA abstraction are rather limited. Meanwhile, programmable NICs become available in data centers, enabling in-network processing. In this paper, we present KV-Direct, a high performance KVS that leverages programmable NIC to extend RDMA primitives and enable remote direct key-value access to the main host memory. We develop several novel techniques to maximize the throughput and hide the latency of the PCIe connection between the NIC and the host memory, which becomes the new bottleneck. Combined, these mechanisms allow a single NIC KV-Direct to achieve up to 180 M key-value operations per second, equivalent to the throughput of tens of CPU cores. Compared with CPU based KVS implementation, KV-Direct improves power efficiency by 3x, while keeping tail latency below 10 \u03bcs. Moreover, KV-Direct can achieve near linear scalability with multiple NICs. With 10 programmable NIC cards in a commodity server, we achieve 1.22 billion KV operations per second, which is almost an order-of-magnitude improvement over existing systems, setting a new milestone for a general-purpose in-memory key-value store.","author":["Bojie Li","Zhenyuan Ruan","Wencong Xiao","Yuanwei Lu","Yongqiang Xiong","Andrew Putnam","Enhong Chen","Lintao Zhang"],"issue":["SOSP '17: Proceedings of the 26th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","October 2017","Pages   137\u2013152","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132747.3132756"],"date":"14 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"2000.

In this paper, we introduce a novel method based on knowledge graph, which takes advantage of both knowledge reasoning and statistic learning. First, we present a model to build a knowledge graph for the given entity. The knowledge graph integrates the fragmented knowledge on how humans create morphs. Then, the candidate morphs are generated based on the rules summarized from the knowledge graph. At last, we use a classification method to filter the useless candidates and identify the target morphs. The experiments conducted on real world dataset demonstrate efficiency of our proposed method in terms of precision and recall.","author":["Longtao Huang","Lin Zhao","Shangwen Lv","Fangzhou Lu","Yue Zhai","Songlin Hu"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   2111\u20132114","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133123"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"H.

Such devices operate only intermittently, as energy is available, presenting a number of challenges for software developers. Programmers face a complex design space requiring reasoning about energy, memory consistency, and forward progress. This paper introduces Alpaca, a low-overhead programming model for intermittent computing on energy-harvesting devices. Alpaca programs are composed of a sequence of user-defined tasks. The Alpaca runtime preserves execution progress at the granularity of a task. The key insight in Alpaca is the privatization of data shared between tasks. Shared values written in a task are detected using idempotence analysis and copied into a buffer private to the task. At the end of the task, modified values from the private buffer are atomically committed to main memory, ensuring that data remain consistent despite power failures. Alpaca provides a familiar programming interface, a highly efficient runtime model, and places fewer restrictions on a target device's hardware architecture. We implemented a prototype of Alpaca as an extension to C with an LLVM compiler pass. We evaluated Alpaca, and directly compared to two systems from prior work. Alpaca eliminates checkpoints, which improves performance up to 15x, and avoids static multi-versioning, which improves memory consumption by up to 5.5x.","author":["Kiwan Maeng","Alexei Colin","Brandon Lucia"],"issue":["Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages","Volume 1","Issue OOPSLA","October 2017","Article No.: 96","pp   1\u201330","https://doi.org/10.1145/3133920"],"date":"12 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Henko Aantjes, Amjad Y Majid, Przemyslaw Pawelczak, Jethro Tan, Aaron Parks, and Joshua R Smith. 2017.

Considerable efforts have gone into devising effective quality control mechanisms that identify or discourage cheat submissions in an attempt to improve the quality of noisy crowd judgments. Besides purposeful cheating, there is another source of noise that is often alluded to but insufficiently studied: Cognitive biases.   This paper investigates the prevalence and effect size of a range of common cognitive biases on a standard relevance judgment task. Our experiments are based on three sizable publicly available document collections and note significant detrimental effects on annotation quality, system ranking and the performance of derived rankers when task design does not account for such biases.","author":["Carsten Eickhoff"],"issue":["WSDM '18: Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2018","Pages   162\u2013170","https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159654"],"date":"02 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Omar Alonso, Daniel E Rose, and Benjamin Stewart . 2008.

Existing recommendation algorithms -- including both shallow and deep approaches -- usually embed a user\u00bbs historical records into a single latent vector/representation, which may have lost the per item- or feature-level correlations between a user\u00bbs historical records and future interests. In this paper, we aim to express, store, and manipulate users\u00bb historical records in a more explicit, dynamic, and effective manner. To do so, we introduce the memory mechanism to recommender systems. Specifically, we design a memory-augmented neural network (MANN) integrated with the insights of collaborative filtering for recommendation. By leveraging the external memory matrix in MANN, we store and update users\u00bb historical records explicitly, which enhances the expressiveness of the model. We further adapt our framework to both item- and feature-level versions, and design the corresponding memory reading/writing operations according to the nature of personalized recommendation scenarios. Compared with state-of-the-art methods that consider users\u00bb sequential behavior for recommendation, e.g., sequential recommenders with recurrent neural networks (RNN) or Markov chains, our method achieves significantly and consistently better performance on four real-world datasets. Moreover, experimental analyses show that our method is able to extract the intuitive patterns of how users\u00bb future actions are affected by previous behaviors.","author":["Xu Chen","Hongteng Xu","Yongfeng Zhang","Jiaxi Tang","Yixin Cao","Zheng Qin","Hongyuan Zha"],"issue":["WSDM '18: Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2018","Pages   108\u2013116","https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159668"],"date":"02 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"S.

In this work, we present a customizable matrix multiplication framework for the Intel HARPv2 CPU+FPGA platform that includes support for both traditional single precision floating point and reduced precision workloads. Our framework supports arbitrary size GEMMs and consists of two parts: (1) a simple application programming interface (API) for easy configuration and integration into existing software and (2) a highly customizable hardware template. The API provides both compile and runtime options for controlling key aspects of the hardware template including dynamic precision switching; interleaving and block size control; and fused deep learning specific operations. The framework currently supports single precision floating point (FP32), 16, 8, 4 and 2 bit Integer and Fixed Point (INT16, INT8, INT4, INT2) and more exotic data types for deep learning workloads: INT16xTernary, INT8xTernary, BinaryxBinary.  We compare our implementation to the latest NVIDIA Pascal GPU and evaluate the performance benefits provided by optimizations built into the hardware template. Using three neural networks (AlexNet, VGGNet and ResNet) we illustrate that reduced precision representations such as binary achieve the best performance, and that the HARPv2 enables fine-grained partitioning of computations over both the Xeon and FPGA. We observe up to 50x improvement in execution time compared to single precision floating point, and that runtime configuration options can improve the efficiency of certain layers in AlexNet up to 4x, achieving an overall 1.3x improvement over the entire network.","author":["Duncan J.M Moss","Srivatsan Krishnan","Eriko Nurvitadhi","Piotr Ratuszniak","Chris Johnson","Jaewoong Sim","Asit Mishra","Debbie Marr","Suchit Subhaschandra","Philip H.W.

A resist model bridges the aerial image simulation to printed patterns. While the effectiveness of learning-based solutions for resist modeling has been demonstrated, they are considerably data-demanding. Meanwhile, a set of manufactured data for a specific lithography configuration is only valid for the training of one single model, indicating low data efficiency. Due to the complexity of the manufacturing process, obtaining enough data for acceptable accuracy becomes very expensive in terms of both time and cost, especially during the evolution of technology generations when the design space is intensively explored. In this work, we propose a new resist modeling framework for contact layers that utilizes existing data from old technology nodes to reduce the amount of data required from a target lithography configuration. Our framework based on residual neural networks and transfer learning techniques is effective within a competitive range of accuracy, i.e., 2-10X reduction on the amount of training data with comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art learning approach.","author":["Yibo Lin","Yuki Watanabe","Taiki Kimura","Tetsuaki Matsunawa","Shigeki Nojima","Meng Li","David Z.

Online personalized news recommendation is a highly challenging problem due to the dynamic nature of news features and user preferences. Although some online recommendation models have been proposed to address the dynamic nature of news recommendation, these methods have three major issues. First, they only try to model current reward (e.g., Click Through Rate). Second, very few studies consider to use user feedback other than click / no click labels (e.g., how frequent user returns) to help improve recommendation. Third, these methods tend to keep recommending similar news to users, which may cause users to get bored. Therefore, to address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a Deep Q-Learning based recommendation framework, which can model future reward explicitly. We further consider user return pattern as a supplement to click / no click label in order to capture more user feedback information. In addition, an effective exploration strategy is incorporated to find new attractive news for users. Extensive experiments are conducted on the offline dataset and online production environment of a commercial news recommendation application and have shown the superior performance of our methods.","author":["Guanjie Zheng","Fuzheng Zhang","Zihan Zheng","Yang Xiang","Nicholas Jing Yuan","Xing Xie","Zhenhui Li"],"issue":["WWW '18: Proceedings of the 2018 World Wide Web Conference","April 2018","Pages   167\u2013176","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3185994"],"date":"23 April 2018","ref":[{"text":"Gediminas Adomavicius and YoungOk Kwon. 2012.

Most major manufacturers including Tesla, GM, Ford, BMW, and Waymo/Google are working on building and testing different types of autonomous vehicles. The lawmakers of several US states including California, Texas, and New York have passed new legislation to fast-track the process of testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles on their roads. However, despite their spectacular progress, DNNs, just like traditional software, often demonstrate incorrect or unexpected corner-case behaviors that can lead to potentially fatal collisions. Several such real-world accidents involving autonomous cars have already happened including one which resulted in a fatality. Most existing testing techniques for DNN-driven vehicles are heavily dependent on the manual collection of test data under different driving conditions which become prohibitively expensive as the number of test conditions increases. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate DeepTest, a systematic testing tool for automatically detecting erroneous behaviors of DNN-driven vehicles that can potentially lead to fatal crashes. First, our tool is designed to automatically generated test cases leveraging real-world changes in driving conditions like rain, fog, lighting conditions, etc. DeepTest systematically explore different parts of the DNN logic by generating test inputs that maximize the numbers of activated neurons. DeepTest found thousands of erroneous behaviors under different realistic driving conditions (e.g., blurring, rain, fog, etc.) many of which lead to potentially fatal crashes in three top performing DNNs in the Udacity self-driving car challenge.","author":["Yuchi Tian","Kexin Pei","Suman Jana","Baishakhi Ray"],"issue":["ICSE '18: Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Software Engineering","May 2018","Pages   303\u2013314","https://doi.org/10.1145/3180155.3180220"],"date":"27 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"2013.

To stimulate research on this promise and the limits thereof, in this article, we outline the challenges and opportunities of blockchain for business process management (BPM). We first reflect how blockchains could be used in the context of the established BPM lifecycle and second how they might become relevant beyond. We conclude our discourse with a summary of seven research directions for investigating the application of blockchain technology in the context of BPM.","author":["Jan Mendling","Ingo Weber","Wil Van Der Aalst","Jan Vom Brocke","Cristina Cabanillas","Florian Daniel","S\u00f8ren Debois","Claudio Di Ciccio","Marlon Dumas","Schahram Dustdar","Avigdor Gal","Luciano Garc\u00eda-Ba\u00f1uelos","Guido Governatori","Richard Hull","Marcello La Rosa","Henrik Leopold","Frank Leymann","Jan Recker","Manfred Reichert","Hajo A.

SignFi uses Channel State Information (CSI) measured by WiFi packets as the input and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the classification algorithm. Existing WiFi-based sign gesture recognition technologies are tested on no more than 25 gestures that only involve hand and/or finger gestures. SignFi is able to recognize 276 sign gestures, which involve the head, arm, hand, and finger gestures, with high accuracy. SignFi collects CSI measurements to capture wireless signal characteristics of sign gestures. Raw CSI measurements are pre-processed to remove noises and recover CSI changes over sub-carriers and sampling time. Pre-processed CSI measurements are fed to a 9-layer CNN for sign gesture classification. We collect CSI traces and evaluate SignFi in the lab and home environments. There are 8,280 gesture instances, 5,520 from the lab and 2,760 from the home, for 276 sign gestures in total. For 5-fold cross validation using CSI traces of one user, the average recognition accuracy of SignFi is 98.01%, 98.91%, and 94.81% for the lab, home, and lab+home environment, respectively. We also run tests using CSI traces from 5 different users in the lab environment. The average recognition accuracy of SignFi is 86.66% for 7,500 instances of 150 sign gestures performed by 5 different users.","author":["Yongsen Ma","Gang Zhou","Shuangquan Wang","Hongyang Zhao","Woosub Jung"],"issue":["Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies","Volume 2","Issue 1","March 2018","Article No.: 23","pp   1\u201321","https://doi.org/10.1145/3191755"],"date":"26 March 2018","ref":[{"text":"H.

Insteadof integrating complex logic units in cost-sensitive memory, PIMA-Logic exploits a hardware-friendly approach to implement Boolean logic functions between operands either located in the same row or the same column within entire memory arrays. Furthermore, it can efficiently process more complex logic functions between multiple operands to further reduce the latency and power-hungry data movement. The proposed architecture is developed based on Spin Orbit Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (SOT-MRAM) array and it can simultaneously work as a non-volatile memory and a reconfigurable in-memory logic. The device-to-architecture co-simulation results show that PIMA-Logic can achieve up to 56% and 31.6% improvements with respect to overall energy and delay on combinational logic benchmarks compared to recent Pinatubo architecture. We further implement an in-memory data encryption engine based on PIMA-Logic as a case study. With AES application, it shows 77.2% and 21% lower energy consumption compared to CMOS-ASIC and recent RIMPA implementation, respectively.","author":["Shaahin Angizi","Zhezhi He","Deliang Fan"],"issue":["DAC '18: Proceedings of the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2018","Article No.: 162","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3196092"],"date":"24 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"P.

In this work, we investigate the impact of temperature on the ReRAM-based neuromorphic architectures and show how varying temperatures have a negative impact on the computation accuracy. We first classify ReRAM crossbar cells based on their temperature and identify effective neural network weights that have large impacts on network outputs. Then, we propose a novel temperature-aware training and mapping scheme to prevent the effective weights from being mapped to hot cells to restore the system accuracy.

New design methods try to automate most designers tasks in order to bridge this gap. In addition, new Models of Computation (MoC), as those dataflow-based, ease the expression of parallelism within applications and lead to higher productivity. Rapid prototyping design tools offer fast estimations of the soundness of design choices. A key step when prototyping an application is to have representative performance indicators to estimate the validity of the design choices. Such indicators can be obtained using hardware information through the Performance API (PAPI). In this work, PAPI and a dataflow MoC are integrated within a Y-chart design flow. The implementation takes the form of a dedicated automatic code generation scheme within the Preesm tool. Preliminary results show that depending on the complexity of the application, the computation time overhead due to monitoring varies from being almost negligible to more than 50%. Also, on top of offering accurate hardware performance indicators, the extracted values can be combined to estimate power or energy consumption.","author":["D. Madro\u00f1al","A. Morvan","R.

Such intrinsic in-memory logic (AND/OR/XOR) could be used to process data within memory to greatly reduce power-hungry and long distance massive data communication in conventional Von Neumann computing systems. A comprehensive reliability analysis is performed, which confirms \u223c90mV and \u223c10mV (worst-case) sense margin for memory and in-memory logic operation in variations on resistance-area product and tunnel magnetoresistance. We further show that sense margin for in-memory logic computation can be significantly increased by increasing the oxide thickness. Furthermore, we employ bulk bitwise vector operation and data encryption engine as case studies to investigate the performance of our proposed design. IMFlexCom shows \u223c35\u00d7 energy saving and \u223c18\u00d7 speedup for bulk bitwise in-memory vector AND/OR operation compared to DRAM-based in-memory logic. Again, IMFlexCom can achieve 77.27% and 85.4% lower energy consumption compared to CMOS-ASIC- and CMOL-based Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) implementations, respectively. It offers almost similar energy consumption as recent DW-AES implementation with 66.7% less area overhead.","author":["Farhana Parveen","Shaahin Angizi","Deliang Fan"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 14","Issue 3","October 2018","Article No.: 35","pp   1\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/3223047"],"date":"23 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Z.

These CS coding frameworks face the challenges of improving the coding efficiency at the encoder, while also suffering from high computational complexity at the decoder. In this paper, we move forward a step and propose a novel deep network based CS coding framework of natural images, which consists of three sub-networks: sampling sub-network, offset sub-network and reconstruction sub-network that responsible for sampling, quantization and reconstruction, respectively. By cooperatively utilizing these sub-networks, it can be trained in the form of an end-to-end metric with a proposed rate-distortion optimization loss function. The proposed framework not only improves the coding performance, but also reduces the computational cost of the image reconstruction dramatically. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of achieving superior rate-distortion performance against state-of-the-art methods.","author":["Wenxue Cui","Feng Jiang","Xinwei Gao","Shengping Zhang","Debin Zhao"],"issue":["MM '18: Proceedings of the 26th ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2018","Pages   1777\u20131785","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240508.3240706"],"date":"15 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Amir Adler, David Boublil, Michael Elad, and Michael Zibulevsky. 2016.

A fully trusted supply chain for all used components and chipsets is an important, yet extremely difficult to achieve, prerequisite to validate a complete board-level system for safe and secure operation. An increasing risk is that most chips nowadays run software or firmware, typically updated throughout the system lifetime, making it practically impossible to validate the full system at every given point in the manufacturing, integration and operational life cycle. This risk is elevated in devices that run 3rd party firmware. In this paper we show that an FPGA used as a common accelerator in various boards can be reprogrammed by software to introduce a sensor, suitable as a remote power analysis side-channel attack vector at the board-level. We show successful power analysis attacks from one FPGA on the board to another chip implementing RSA and AES cryptographic modules. Since the sensor is only mapped through firmware, this threat is very hard to detect, because data can be exfiltrated without requiring inter-chip communication between victim and attacker. Our results also prove the potential vulnerability in which any untrusted chip on the board can launch such attacks on the remaining system.","author":["Falk Schellenberg","Dennis R. E.

Previous work mainly focuses on skipping zero values to deal with remarkable ineffectual computation, while zero bits in non-zero values, as another major source of ineffectual computation, is often ignored. The reason lies on the difficulty of extracting essential bits during operating multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) in the processing element. Based on the fact that zero bits occupy as high as 68.9% fraction in the overall weights of modern deep convolutional neural network models, this paper firstly proposes a weight kneading technique that could eliminate ineffectual computation caused by either zero value weights or zero bits in non-zero weights, simultaneously. Besides, a split-and-accumulate (SAC) computing pattern in replacement of conventional MAC, as well as the corresponding hardware accelerator design called Tetris are proposed to support weight kneading at the hardware level. Experimental results prove that Tetris could speed up inference up to 1.50x, and improve power efficiency up to 5.33x compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.","author":["Hang Lu","Xin Wei","Ning Lin","Guihai Yan","Xiaowei Li"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 21","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240855"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"K.

While technology advances have helped to increase the storage density and reduce costs, they have also led to reduced endurance and larger block variations, which cannot be compensated solely by stronger ECC or read-retry schemes but have to be addressed holistically.Our goal is to enable low-cost NAND flash in enterprise storage for cost efficiency. We present novel flash-management approaches that reduce write amplification, achieve better wear leveling, and enhance endurance without sacrificing performance. We introduce block calibration, a technique to determine optimal read-threshold voltage levels that minimize error rates, and novel garbage-collection as well as data-placement schemes that alleviate the effects of block health variability and show how these techniques complement one another and thereby achieve enterprise storage requirements.By combining the proposed schemes, we improve endurance by up to 15\u00d7 compared to the baseline endurance of NAND flash without using a stronger ECC scheme. The flash-management algorithms presented herein were designed and implemented in simulators, hardware test platforms, and eventually in the flash controllers of production enterprise all-flash arrays. Their effectiveness has been validated across thousands of customer deployments since 2015.","author":["Roman Pletka","Ioannis Koltsidas","Nikolas Ioannou","Sa\u0161a Tomi\u0107","Nikolaos Papandreou","Thomas Parnell","Haralampos Pozidis","Aaron Fry","Tim Fisher"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 14","Issue 4","December 2018","Article No.: 33","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/3241060"],"date":"04 December 2018","ref":[{"text":"Jens Axboe. 2014.

Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is the most commonly used accelerator for HPC supported by regularly executed high degree of parallel operations which causes performance bottleneck in some cases. On the other hand, there are great opportunities to flexibly and efficiently utilize FPGAs in logic circuits to fit various computing situations. However, it is not easy for application developers to implement FPGA logic circuits for their applications and algorithms, which generally require complicated hardware logic descriptions. Because of the progress made in the FPGA development environment in recent years, the High-Level Synthesis (HLS) development environment using the OpenCL language has become popular. Based on our experience describing kernels using OpenCL, we found that a more aggressive programming strategy is necessary to realize true high performance based on a \"codesign\" concept to implement the necessary features and operations to fit the target application in an FPGA design. In this paper, we optimize the Authentic Radiation Transfer (ART) method on an FPGA using OpenCL. We also discuss a method to parallelize its computation in an FPGA and a method to optimize the OpenCL code on FPGAs. Using a codesigned method for the optimized programming of a specific application with OpenCL for an FPGA, we achieved a performance that is 6.9 times faster than that of a CPU implementation using OpenMP, and almost the same performance as a GPU implementation using CUDA. The ART code should work on a larger configuration with multiple FPGAs requiring interconnections between them. Considering the current advanced FPGAs with interconnection features, we believe that their parallelized implementation with multiple FPGAs will achieve a higher performance than GPU.","author":["Norihisa Fujita","Ryohei Kobayashi","Yoshiki Yamaguchi","Yuma Oobata","Taisuke Boku","Makito Abe","Kohji Yoshikawa","Masayuki Umemura"],"issue":["HEART 2018: Proceedings of the 9th International Symposium on Highly-Efficient Accelerators and Reconfigurable Technologies","June 2018","Article No.: 6","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.1145/3241793.3241799"],"date":"20 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"K.

Recently, various hardware implementations of CeNNs have emerged in the literature, with Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) being one of the most popular choices due to its high flexibility and low time-to-market. However, CeNNs typically involve extensive computations in a recursive manner. As an example, to simply process an image of 1,920 \u00d7 1,080 pixels requires 4--8 Giga floating point multiplications (for 3 \u00d7 3 templates and 50\u2013100 iterations), which needs to be done in a timely manner for real-time applications. To address this issue, in this article, we propose a compressed CeNN framework for efficient FPGA implementations. It involves various techniques, such as incremental quantization and early exit, which significantly reduces computation demands while maintaining an acceptable performance. Particularly, incremental quantization quantizes the numbers in CeNN templates to powers of two, so that complex and expensive multiplications can be converted to simple and cheap shift operations, which only require a minimum number of registers and logical elements (LEs). While a similar concept has been explored in hardware implementations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), CeNNs have completely different computation patterns, which require different quantization and implementation strategies. Experimental results on FPGAs show that incremental quantization and early exit can achieve a speedup of up to 7.8\u00d7 and 8.3\u00d7, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art implementations, while with almost no performance loss with four widely adopted applications. We also discover that different from CNNs, the optimal quantization strategies of CeNNs depend heavily on the applications. We hope that our work can serve as a pioneer in the hardware optimization of CeNNs.","author":["Xiaowei Xu","Qing Lu","Tianchen Wang","Yu Hu","Chen Zhuo","Jinglan Liu","Yiyu Shi"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 14","Issue 4","October 2018","Article No.: 48","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/3264817"],"date":"01 December 2018","ref":[{"text":"Stephen J.

The storing device in this technology, the Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ), is developed using magnetic layers that requires new fabrication materials and processes. Due to complexities of fabrication steps and materials, MTJ cells are subject to various failure mechanisms. As a consequence, the functionality of the neuromorphic computing architecture based on this technology is severely affected. In this paper, we have developed a framework to analyze the functional capability of the neural network inference in the presence of the several MTJ defects. Using this framework, we have demonstrated the required memory array size that is necessary to tolerate the given amount of defects and how to actively decrease this overhead by disabling parts of the network.","author":["Christopher M\u00fcnch","Rajendra Bishnoi","Mehdi B.

Neural networks are now widely adopted in regions like image, speech, and video recognition. But the high computation and storage complexity of neural network inference poses great difficulty on its application. It is difficult for CPU platforms to offer enough computation capacity. GPU platforms are the first choice for neural network processes because of its high computation capacity and easy-to-use development frameworks.However, FPGA-based neural network inference accelerator is becoming a research topic. With specifically designed hardware, FPGA is the next possible solution to surpass GPU in speed and energy efficiency. Various FPGA-based accelerator designs have been proposed with software and hardware optimization techniques to achieve high speed and energy efficiency. In this article, we give an overview of previous work on neural network inference accelerators based on FPGA and summarize the main techniques used. An investigation from software to hardware, from circuit level to system level is carried out to complete analysis of FPGA-based neural network inference accelerator design and serves as a guide to future work.","author":["Kaiyuan Guo","Shulin Zeng","Jincheng Yu","Yu Wang","Huazhong Yang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 12","Issue 1","April 2018","Article No.: 2","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/3289185"],"date":"28 March 2019","ref":[{"text":"Xilinx Inc. 2018.

This structure frequently emerges in traffic systems, biology, and social networks via underlying spatial positioning of the vertices. While core-periphery structure is ubiquitous, there have been limited attempts at modeling network data with this structure. Here, we develop a generative, random network model with core-periphery structure that jointly accounts for topological and spatial information by \"core scores'' of vertices. Our model achieves substantially higher likelihood than existing generative models of core-periphery structure, and we demonstrate how the core scores can be used in downstream data mining tasks, such as predicting airline traffic and classifying fungal networks. We also develop nearly linear time algorithms for learning model parameters and network sampling by using a method akin to the fast multipole method, a technique traditional to computational physics, which allow us to scale to networks with millions of vertices with minor tradeoffs in accuracy.","author":["Junteng Jia","Austin R.

It is hoped that the result of the AES process will be the specification of a new non-classified encryption algorithm that will have the global acceptance achieved by DES as well as the capability of long-term protection of sensitive information. The technical analysis used in determining which of the potential AES candidates will be selected as the Advanced Encryption Algorithm includes efficiency testing of both hardware and software implementations of candidate algorithms. Reprogrammable devices such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are highly attractive options for hardware implementations of encryption algorithms as they provide cryptographic algorithm agility, physical security, and potentially much higher performance than software solutions. This contribution investigates the significance of an FPGA implementation of Serpent, one of the Advanced Encryption Standard candidate algorithms. Multiple architecture options of the Serpent algorithm will be explored with a strong focus being placed on a high speed implementation within an FPGA in order to support security for current and future high bandwidth applications. One of the main findings is that Serpent can be implemented with encryption rates beyond 4 Gbit/s on current FPGAs.","author":["A. J. Elbirt","C.

They usually learn node representations by transforming, propagating and aggregating node features and have been proven to improve the performance of many graph related tasks such as node classification and link prediction. To apply graph neural networks for the graph classification task, approaches to generate thegraph representation from node representations are demanded. A common way is to globally combine the node representations. However, rich structural information is overlooked. Thus a hierarchical pooling procedure is desired to preserve the graph structure during the graph representation learning. There are some recent works on hierarchically learning graph representation analogous to the pooling step in conventional convolutional neural (CNN) networks. However, the local structural information is still largely neglected during the pooling process. In this paper, we introduce a pooling operator $\\pooling$ based on graph Fourier transform, which can utilize the node features and local structures during the pooling process. We then design pooling layers based on the pooling operator, which are further combined with traditional GCN convolutional layers to form a graph neural network framework $\\m$ for graph classification. Theoretical analysis is provided to understand $\\pooling$ from both local and global perspectives. Experimental results of the graph classification task on $6$ commonly used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","author":["Yao Ma","Suhang Wang","Charu C.

It is increasingly more expensive and time-demanding to introduce new drugs into the market. One of the main reasons is the slow progress in finding novel targets for drug candidates and the lack of insight in terms of the associated mechanisms of action. Current works in this area mainly utilise different chemical, genetic and proteomic methods, which are limited in terms of the scalability of experimentation and the scope of studied drugs and targets per experiment. This is mainly due to their dependency on laboratory experiments and available physical resource. This has led to an increasing importance of computational methods for the identification of candidate drug targets. In this work, we introduce a novel computational approach for predicting drug target proteins. We approach the problem as a link prediction task on knowledge graphs. We process drug and target information as a knowledge graph of interconnected drugs, proteins, disease, pathways and other relevant entities. We then apply knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models over this data to enable scoring drug-target associations, where we employ a customised version of state-of-the-art KGE model ComplEx. We generate a benchmarking dataset based on KEGG database to train and evaluate our method. Our experiments show that our method achieves best results in comparison to other traditional KGE models. Specifically, the method predicts drug target links with mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 0.78 and [email\u00a0protected] of 0.88. This provides a promising basis for further experimentation and comparisons with domain-specific predictive models.","author":["Sameh K.

While voice-based interface is intuitive, it is insufficient in many scenarios, such as in noisy or quiet environments, for users with language barriers, or in applications that require continuous motion tracking. Motion-based control is attractive and complementary to existing voice-based control. However, accurate and reliable room-scale motion tracking poses a significant challenge due to low SNR, interference, and varying mobility. To this end, we develop a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) based system that uses speakers and microphones to realize accurate room-scale tracking. Our system jointly estimates the propagation distance and angle-of-arrival (AoA) of signals reflected by the hand, based on AoA-distance profiles generated by 2D MUSIC. We design a series of techniques to significantly enhance the profile quality under low SNR. We feed the profiles in a recent history to our RNN to estimate the distance and AoA. In this way, we can exploit the temporal structure among consecutive profiles to remove the impact of noise, interference and mobility. Using extensive evaluation, we show our system achieves 1.2--3.7~cm error within 4.5~m range, supports tracking multiple users, and is robust against ambient sound. To our knowledge, this is the first acoustic device-free room-scale tracking system.","author":["Wenguang Mao","Mei Wang","Wei Sun","Lili Qiu","Swadhin Pradhan","Yi-Chao Chen"],"issue":["MobiCom '19: The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking","August 2019","Article No.: 38","Pages   1\u201316","https://doi.org/10.1145/3300061.3345439"],"date":"11 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Fadel Adib, Zachary Kabelac, and Dina Katabi. 2015.

Tofu is designed to partition a dataflow graph of fine-grained tensor operators used by platforms like MXNet and TensorFlow. In order to automatically partition each operator, we propose to describe the semantics of an operator in a simple language inspired by Halide. To optimally partition different operators in a dataflow graph, Tofu uses a recursive search algorithm that minimizes the total communication cost. Our experiments on an 8-GPU machine show that Tofu enables the training of very large CNN and RNN models. It also achieves 25% - 400% speedup over alternative approaches to train very large models.","author":["Minjie Wang","Chien-chin Huang","Jinyang Li"],"issue":["EuroSys '19: Proceedings of the Fourteenth EuroSys Conference 2019","March 2019","Article No.: 26","Pages   1\u201317","https://doi.org/10.1145/3302424.3303953"],"date":"25 March 2019","ref":[{"text":"Sergey Zagoruyko and Nikos Komodakis.

However, large DNN models are both storage and computation intensive, posing significant challenges for adopting DNNs in resource-constrained scenarios. Thus, model compression becomes a crucial technique to ensure wide deployment of DNNs. This paper advances the state-of-the-art by considering tensor train (TT) decomposition, an very promising but yet explored compression technique in architecture domain. The method features with the extremely high compression ratio. However, the challenge is that the inference on the TT-format DNN models inherently incurs massive amount of redundant computations, causing significant energy consumption. Thus, the straightforward application of TT decomposition is not feasible. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper develops a computation-efficient inference scheme for TT-format DNN, which enjoys two key merits: 1) it achieves theoretical limit of number of multiplications, thus eliminating all redundant computations; and 2) the multi-stage processing scheme reduces the intensive memory access to all tensor cores, bringing significant energy saving. Based on the novel inference scheme, we develop TIE, a TT-format compressed DNN-targeted inference engine. TIE is highly flexible, supporting different types of networks for different needs. A 16-processing elements (PE) prototype is implemented using CMOS 28nm technology. Operating on 1000MHz, the TIE accelerator consumes 1.74mm2 and 154.8mW. Compared with EIE, TIE achieves 7.22\u00d7 ~ 10.66\u00d7 better area efficiency and 3.03\u00d7 ~ 4.48\u00d7 better energy efficiency on different workloads, respectively. Compared with CirCNN, TIE achieves 5.96\u00d7 and 4.56\u00d7 higher throughput and energy efficiency, respectively. The results show that TIE exhibits significant advantages over state-of-the-art solutions.","author":["Chunhua Deng","Fangxuan Sun","Xuehai Qian","Jun Lin","Zhongfeng Wang","Bo Yuan"],"issue":["ISCA '19: Proceedings of the 46th International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2019","Pages   264\u2013278","https://doi.org/10.1145/3307650.3322258"],"date":"22 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"V Aklaghi, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Kambiz Samadi, H Esmaeilzadeh, and RK Gupta. 2018.

Existing models tend to be computationally expensive and memory intensive, however, and so methods for hardware-oriented approximation have become a hot topic. Research has shown that custom hardware-based neural network accelerators can surpass their general-purpose processor equivalents in terms of both throughput and energy efficiency. Application-tailored accelerators, when co-designed with approximation-based network training methods, transform large, dense, and computationally expensive networks into small, sparse, and hardware-efficient alternatives, increasing the feasibility of network deployment. In this article, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of approximation methods for high-performance network inference along with in-depth discussion of their effectiveness for custom hardware implementation. We also include proposals for future research based on a thorough analysis of current trends. This article represents the first survey providing detailed comparisons of custom hardware accelerators featuring approximation for both convolutional and recurrent neural networks, through which we hope to inspire exciting new developments in the field.","author":["Erwei Wang","James J.

At present, there are many machine learning methods applied in the field of intrusion detection. However, with the increase of the amount of data in the network and the diversification of network intrusion methods, the traditional intrusion detection system has been unable to meet the current needs of the complex network environment. But with the development of Alphago, FaceID and auto-driving technology, we have seen the successful application of convolutional neural network in current complex network environment. Therefore, this paper proposes a network intrusion detection system based on the convolutional neural network model Lenet-5. In addition, in order to improve the stability, increase the accuracy of the model and speed up the converge rate of the model, we also introduce the OHE coding and normalization method to deal with the feature matrix, making it easier for the model to detect the characteristics of the traffic data packet.","author":["Pengju Liu"],"issue":["ICCAE 2019: Proceedings of the 2019 11th International Conference on Computer and Automation Engineering","February 2019","Pages   62\u201367","https://doi.org/10.1145/3313991.3314009"],"date":"23 February 2019","ref":[{"text":"Kumar, Sandeep, & Spafford, a.

Traditional synchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) achieves good accuracy for a wide variety of tasks, but relies on global synchronization to accumulate the gradients at every training step. In this paper, we propose eager-SGD, which relaxes the global synchronization for decentralized accumulation. To implement eager-SGD, we propose to use two partial collectives: solo and majority. With solo allreduce, the faster processes contribute their gradients eagerly without waiting for the slower processes, whereas with majority allreduce, at least half of the participants must contribute gradients before continuing, all without using a central parameter server. We theoretically prove the convergence of the algorithms and describe the partial collectives in detail. Experiments are conducted on a variety of neural networks and datasets. The results on load-imbalanced environments show that eager-SGD achieves 2.64 X speedup (ResNet-50 on ImageNet) over the asynchronous centralized SGD, and achieves 1.29 X speedup (ResNet-50 on ImageNet) and 1.27X speedup (LSTM on UCF101) over the state-of-the-art synchronous decentralized SGDs, without losing accuracy.","author":["Shigang Li","Tal Ben-Nun","Salvatore Di Girolamo","Dan Alistarh","Torsten Hoefler"],"issue":["PPoPP '20: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming","February 2020","Pages   45\u201361","https://doi.org/10.1145/3332466.3374528"],"date":"19 February 2020","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen, Craig Citro, Greg S.

Although powerful, such systems require manual configuration and tuning. To this end, we view CNNs as configurable systems and propose an end-to-end framework that allows the configuration, evaluation and automated search for CNN architectures. Therefore, our contribution is threefold. First, we model the variability of CNN architectures with a Feature Model (FM) that generalizes over existing architectures. Each valid configuration of the FM corresponds to a valid CNN model that can be built and trained. Second, we implement, on top of Tensorflow, an automated procedure to deploy, train and evaluate the performance of a configured model. Third, we propose a method to search for configurations and demonstrate that it leads to good CNN models. We evaluate our method by applying it on image classification tasks (MNIST, CIFAR-10) and show that, with limited amount of computation and training, our method can identify high-performing architectures (with high accuracy). We also demonstrate that we outperform existing state-of-the-art architectures handcrafted by ML researchers. Our FM and framework have been released to support replication and future research.","author":["Salah Ghamizi","Maxime Cordy","Mike Papadakis","Yves Le Traon"],"issue":["SPLC '19: Proceedings of the 23rd International Systems and Software Product Line Conference - Volume A","September 2019","Pages   119\u2013130","https://doi.org/10.1145/3336294.3336306"],"date":"09 September 2019","ref":[{"text":"Bowen Baker, Otkrist Gupta, Nikhil Naik, and Ramesh Raskar. 2017.

This can be understood in at least two ways. One is that the network just knows what to do in all kinds of situations because of the use of AI and the second is that 6G radio will be widely used to sense the environment where the users are. In this view, 6G is seen as a continuation of the merge of the physical and the virtual words. An outcome of the Summit is a 6G White Paper documenting the ideas of some 60 invited people from the 300 participants about the future generation coming after 5G. This paper provides further discussion and justification of the trust and security aspects of the Networking Chapter in the White Paper. The paper focuses on principles and only refers to some verification in order not to clutter the discussion with technical detail. Opinions expressed here are of the author of this paper who was also the main editor of the Networking Chapter.

However, CPS with static RAM (SRAM)-based processors suffers from the high leakage power issue of SRAM, thus limiting the energy efficiency of CPS. Recently, Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM) has emerged and been widely regarded as a great alternative as the on-chip memory within processors, owing to STT-RAM's high density and near-zero leakage power characteristics. In addition, recent advances in Magnetic Tunneling Junction (MTJ) technology also realize the multi-level cell (MLC) STT-RAM to further enhance the memory density. Nevertheless, the write disturbance issue greatly limits the energy efficiency of MLC STT-RAM. Even though studies have been proposed to alleviate this issue, most of the previous disturbance reduction strategies could induce additional management overhead by utilizing counters or cause frequent swap operations when the write disturbance happens. Such observations motivate us to propose a simple and effective solution to unify the direct and split mapping cache designs for improving the energy efficiency of MLC STT-RAM. The proposed design is evaluated through a series of experiments on an emulator with encouraging results.","author":["Shuo-Han Chen","Yu-Pei Liang","Yuan-Hao Chang","Yun-Fei Liu","Chun-Feng Wu","Hsin-Wen Wei","Wei-Kuan Shih"],"issue":["SAC '20: Proceedings of the 35th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing","March 2020","Pages   202\u2013209","https://doi.org/10.1145/3341105.3373849"],"date":"30 March 2020","ref":[{"text":"[n. d.].

However, the dependency among multiple modalities and high-level temporal-feature learning using deeper LSTM networks is yet to be investigated. Thus, we propose a multimodal residual LSTM (MMResLSTM) network for emotion recognition. The MMResLSTM network shares the weights across the modalities in each LSTM layer to learn the correlation between the EEG and other physiological signals. It contains both the spatial shortcut paths provided by the residual network and temporal shortcut paths provided by LSTM for efficiently learning emotion-related high-level features. The proposed network was evaluated using a publicly available dataset for EEG-based emotion recognition, DEAP. The experimental results indicate that the proposed MMResLSTM network yielded a promising result, with a classification accuracy of 92.87% for arousal and 92.30% for valence.","author":["Jiaxin Ma","Hao Tang","Wei-Long Zheng","Bao-Liang Lu"],"issue":["MM '19: Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Multimedia","October 2019","Pages   176\u2013183","https://doi.org/10.1145/3343031.3350871"],"date":"15 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Salma Alhagry, Aly Aly, and Reda El-Khoribi. 2017.

Unlike conventional feed-forward DNNs, RNNs remember past information to improve the accuracy of future predictions and, therefore, they are very effective for sequence processing problems. For each application run, each recurrent layer is executed many times for processing a potentially large sequence of inputs (words, images, audio frames, etc.). In this paper, we make the observation that the output of a neuron exhibits small changes in consecutive invocations. We exploit this property to build a neuron-level fuzzy memoization scheme, which dynamically caches the output of each neuron and reuses it whenever it is predicted that the current output will be similar to a previously computed result, avoiding in this way the output computations. The main challenge in this scheme is determining whether the new neuron's output for the current input in the sequence will be similar to a recently computed result. To this end, we extend the recurrent layer with a much simpler Bitwise Neural Network (BNN), and show that the BNN and RNN outputs are highly correlated: if two BNN outputs are very similar, the corresponding outputs in the original RNN layer are likely to exhibit negligible changes. The BNN provides a low-cost and effective mechanism for deciding when fuzzy memoization can be applied with a small impact on accuracy. We evaluate our memoization scheme on top of a state-of-the-art accelerator for RNNs, for a variety of different neural networks from multiple application domains. We show that our technique avoids more than 24.2% of computations, resulting in 18.5% energy savings and 1.35x speedup on average.","author":["Franyell Silfa","Gem Dot","Jose-Maria Arnau","Antonio Gonz\u00e0lez"],"issue":["MICRO '52: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","October 2019","Pages   782\u2013793","https://doi.org/10.1145/3352460.3358309"],"date":"12 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen, Craig Citro, Gregory S.

The majority of these designs focus on accelerating compute-intensive regions of ML workloads such as general matrix multiplications (GEMMs) and convolutions. While this is a legitimate approach, we observe in this work that ML workloads also comprise data-intensive computations that manifest low compute-to-byte ratios and can often contribute considerably to the total execution time. Further, we also observe that, the presence of such computations opens up an exciting opportunity for near-data processing (NDP) architectures as they often provision for higher memory bandwidth that can benefit such computations. Based on the above observations, in this work we make a case for a more collaborative approach to ML acceleration, termed Co-ML, in which memory plays an active role and is responsible for NDP-amenable computations while the compute-intensive computations are executed on the host accelerator as before. We demonstrate how even a relatively simple NDP design can increase performance of data-intensive computations in ML by up to 20\u00d7. Further, for a suite of ML workloads we demonstrate that Co-ML can deliver speedups as high as 20% with average speedups of 14%. Finally, we show that with increasing efforts to build better accelerators for compute-intensive computations, these benefits will likely increase.","author":["Shaizeen Aga","Nuwan Jayasena","Mike Ignatowski"],"issue":["MEMSYS '19: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Memory Systems","September 2019","Pages   506\u2013517","https://doi.org/10.1145/3357526.3357532"],"date":"30 September 2019","ref":[{"text":"2014.

Despite the robustness by the ML algorithms against random noise, it has been shown that inclusion of specially crafted perturbations to the input data termed as adversarial samples can lead to a significant degradation in the ML performance. Existing defenses to mitigate or minimize the impact of adversarial samples including adversarial training or randomization are confined to specific categories of adversaries, compute-intensive and/or often lead to reduce performance even without adversaries. To overcome the shortcomings of the existing works on adversarial defense, we propose a two-stage adversarial defense technique (R2AD). To thwart the exploitation of the deep neural network by the attacker, we first include a random nullification (RNF) layer. The RNF nullifies/removes some of the features from the input randomly to reduce the impact of adversarial noise and minimizes attacker's feasibility to extract the model parameters. However, the removal of input features through RNF leads to a reduction in the performance of the ML. As an antidote, we equip the network with a Reconstructor. The Reconstructor primarily contributes to reconstructing the input data by utilizing an autoencoder network, but based on the distribution of the normal samples, thereby improving the performance, and also being robust to the adversarial noise. We evaluated the performance of proposed multi-stage R^2AD on the MNIST digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets against multiple adversarial attacks including FGSM, JSMA, BIM, Deepfool, and CW attacks. Our findings report improvements as high as 80% in the performance compared to the existing defenses such as adversarial training and randomization-based defense.","author":["Marzieh Ashrafiamiri","Sai Manoj Pudukotai Dinakarrao","Amir Hosein Afandizadeh Zargari","Minjun Seo","Fadi Kurdahi","Houman Homayoun"],"issue":["MLCAD '20: Proceedings of the 2020 ACM/IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for CAD","November 2020","Pages   21\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/3380446.3430628"],"date":"16 November 2020","ref":[{"text":"Mart'in Abadi and et al. 2016.

Finding the degree of similarity between two genomes requires executing a compute-intensive dynamic programming algorithm, such as Smith-Waterman. Traditional von Neumann architectures have limited parallelism and cannot provide an efficient solution for large-scale genomic data. Approximate heuristic methods (e.g. BLAST) are commonly used. However, they are suboptimal and still compute-intensive. In this work, we present BioSEAL, a biological sequence alignment accelerator. BioSEAL is a massively parallel non-von Neumann processing-in-memory architecture for large-scale DNA and protein sequence alignment. BioSEAL is based on resistive content addressable memory, capable of energy-efficient and highperformance associative processing. We present an associative processing algorithm for entire database sequence alignment on BioSEAL and compare its performance and power consumption with state-of-art solutions. We show that BioSEAL can achieve up to 57\u00d7 speedup and 156\u00d7 better energy efficiency, compared with existing solutions for genome sequence alignment and protein sequence database search.","author":["Roman Kaplan","Leonid Yavits","Ran Ginosasr"],"issue":["SYSTOR '20: Proceedings of the 13th ACM International Systems and Storage Conference","May 2020","Pages   36\u201348","https://doi.org/10.1145/3383669.3398279"],"date":"30 May 2020","ref":[{"text":"Ahmed, N., Sima, V.-M., Houtgast, E., Bertels, K. and Al-Ars, Z. 2015.

This is compounded by the difficulty of fairly evaluating FPGA architectural choices, which requires sophisticated high-quality Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools to target each potential architecture. This article describes version 8.0 of the open source Verilog to Routing (VTR) project, which provides such a design flow. VTR 8 expands the scope of FPGA architectures that can be modelled, allowing VTR to target and model many details of both commercial and proposed FPGA architectures. The VTR design flow also serves as a baseline for evaluating new CAD algorithms. It is therefore important, for both CAD algorithm comparisons and the validity of architectural conclusions, that VTR produce high-quality circuit implementations. VTR 8 significantly improves optimization quality (reductions of 15% minimum routable channel width, 41% wirelength, and 12% critical path delay), run-time (5.3\u00d7 faster) and memory footprint (3.3\u00d7 lower). Finally, we demonstrate VTR is run-time and memory footprint efficient, while producing circuit implementations of reasonable quality compared to highly-tuned architecture-specific industrial tools\u2014showing that architecture generality, good implementation quality, and run-time efficiency are not mutually exclusive goals.","author":["Kevin E.

By giving some processing abilities to memories, processing-in-memory (PIM) is a promising technique to alleviate the memory wall bottleneck. In this work, we proposed a novel PIM architecture by employing ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs). The proposed design, named FePIM, is able to perform in-memory bitwise logic and add operations between two selected rows or between one selected row and an immediate operand. By utilizing unique features of FeFET devices, we further propose novel solutions to eliminate simultaneous-read-and-write (SRAW) contentions such that stalls are eliminated. Experimental results show that FePIM reduces 15% of the memory access latency and 44% of the memory access energy, compared with an enhanced version of a state-of-the-art FeFET-based PIM design which cannot handle SRAW contentions.","author":["Xiaoming Chen","Yuping Wu","Yinhe Han"],"issue":["ASPDAC '21: Proceedings of the 26th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2021","Pages   114\u2013119","https://doi.org/10.1145/3394885.3431530"],"date":"18 January 2021","ref":[{"text":"J.

With serverless computing, developers simply provide an event-driven function to cloud providers, and the provider seamlessly scales function invocations to meet demands as event-triggers occur. As current and future serverless offerings support a wide variety of serverless applications, effective techniques to manage serverless workloads becomes an important issue. This work examines current management and scheduling practices in cloud providers, uncovering many issues including inflated application run times, function drops, inefficient allocations, and other undocumented and unexpected behavior. To fix these issues, a new quality-of-service function scheduling and allocation framework, called Sequoia, is designed. Sequoia allows developers or administrators to easily def ne how serverless functions and applications should be deployed, capped, prioritized, or altered based on easily configured, flexible policies. Results with controlled and realistic workloads show Sequoia seamlessly adapts to policies, eliminates mid-chain drops, reduces queuing times by up to 6.4X, enforces tight chain-level fairness, and improves run-time performance up to 25X.","author":["Ali Tariq","Austin Pahl","Sharat Nimmagadda","Eric Rozner","Siddharth Lanka"],"issue":["SoCC '20: Proceedings of the 11th ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing","October 2020","Pages   311\u2013327","https://doi.org/10.1145/3419111.3421306"],"date":"12 October 2020","ref":[{"text":"2006.

This paper describes extensions of this algorithm in the areas of texture simulation and lighting models. The parametrization of a patch defines a coordinate system which is used as a key for mapping patterns onto the surface. The intensity of the pattern at each picture element is computed as a weighted average of regions of the pattern definition function. The shape and size of this weighting function are chosen using digital signal processing theory. The patch rendering algorithm allows accurate computation of the surface normal to the patch at each picture element, permitting the simulation of mirror reflections. The amount of light coming from a given direction is modeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping and then added to the intensity obtained from the texture mapping. Several examples of images synthesized using these new techniques are included.","author":["James F. Blinn","Martin E.

Actually, two BCD digits can be compressed optimally and reversibly into 7 bits, and three digits into 10 bits, by a very simple algorithm based on the fixed-length combination of two variable field-length encodings. In over half of the cases the compressed code results from the conventional BCD code by simple removal of redundant 0 bits. A long decimal message can be subdivided into three-digit blocks, and separately compressed; the result differs from the asymptotic minimum length by only 0.34 percent. The hardware requirement is small, and the mappings can be done manually.","author":["Tien Chi Chen","Irving T.

We describe the methodology that we used to validate a microprocessor simulator against a Compaq DS-10L workstation, which contains an Alpha 21264 processor. Our evaluation suite consists of a set of 21 microbenchmarks that stress different aspects of the 21264 microarchitecture. Using the microbenchmark suite as the set of workloads, we describe how we reduced our simulator error to an arithmetic mean of 2%, and include details about the specific aspects of the pipeline that required extra care to reduce the error. We show how these low-level optimizations reduce average error from 40% to less than 20% on macrobenchmarks drawn from the SPEC2000 suite. Finally, we examine the degree to which performance optimizations are stable across different simulators, showing that researchers would draw different conclusions, in some cases, if using validated simulators.","author":["Rajagopalan Desikan","Doug Burger","Stephen W.

This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes.","author":["Ion Stoica","Robert Morris","David Karger","M.

A RON is an application-layer overlay on top of the existing Internet routing substrate. The RON nodes monitor the functioning and quality of the Internet paths among themselves, and use this information to decide whether to route packets directly over the Internet or by way of other RON nodes, optimizing application-specific routing metrics.Results from two sets of measurements of a working RON deployed at sites scattered across the Internet demonstrate the benefits of our architecture. For instance, over a 64-hour sampling period in March 2001 across a twelve-node RON, there were 32 significant outages, each lasting over thirty minutes, over the 132 measured paths. RON's routing mechanism was able to detect, recover, and route around all of them, in less than twenty seconds on average, showing that its methods for fault detection and recovery work well at discovering alternate paths in the Internet. Furthermore, RON was able to improve the loss rate, latency, or throughput perceived by data transfers; for example, about 5% of the transfers doubled their TCP throughput and 5% of our transfers saw their loss probability reduced by 0.05. We found that forwarding packets via at most one intermediate RON node is sufficient to overcome faults and improve performance in most cases. These improvements, particularly in the area of fault detection and recovery, demonstrate the benefits of moving some of the control over routing into the hands of end-systems.","author":["David Andersen","Hari Balakrishnan","Frans Kaashoek","Robert Morris"],"issue":["ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","Volume 35","Issue 5","Dec. 2001","pp   131\u2013145","https://doi.org/10.1145/502059.502048"],"date":"21 October 2001","ref":[{"text":"ANDERSEN, D.

In this paper, we extend question-answering techniques, first studied in the information retrieval literature, to the web and experimentally evaluate their performance.First we introduce Mulder, which we believe to be the first general-purpose, fully-automated question-answering system available on the web. Second, we describe Mulder's architecture, which relies on multiple search-engine queries, natural-language parsing, and a novel voting procedure to yield reliable answers coupled with high recall. Finally, we compare Mulder's performance to that of Google and AskJeeves on questions drawn from the TREC-8 question answering track. We find that Mulder's recall is more than a factor of three higher than that of AskJeeves. In addition, we find that Google requires 6.6 times as much user effort to achieve the same level of recall as Mulder.","author":["Cody Kwok","Oren Etzioni","Daniel S.

This opportunity has been demonstrated by many prior experiments. It is tempting to believe that providing greater spatial flexibility-by moving from flat 2D to 3D user interfaces-will further enhance user performance. This paper describes an experiment that investigates the effectiveness of spatial memory in real-world physical models and in equivalent computer-based virtual systems. The different models vary the user's freedom to use depth and perspective in spatial arrangements of images representing web pages. Results show that the subjects' performance deteriorated in both the physical and virtual systems as their freedom to locate items in the third dimension increased. Subjective measures reinforce the performance measures, indicating that users found interfaces with higher dimensions more 'cluttered' and less efficient","author":["Andy Cockburn","Bruce McKenzie"],"issue":["CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","April 2002","Pages   203\u2013210","https://doi.org/10.1145/503376.503413"],"date":"20 April 2002","ref":[{"text":"Barfield, W. and Rosenberg, C.

In a practical situation, there are restrictions on where buffers may be inserted; for instance, it may be possible to route wires over a preplaced macro cell, but may not be possible to insert buffers in that region. As a result, it is desirable to perform route planning and buffer insertion simultaneously. Furthermore it is necessary that such an algorithm be aware of the trade-off between cost (e.g., total capacitance) and delay. In this context we propose the delay reduction to cost ratio (DRCR) problem and present a fast algorithm for the same. Solutions identified by the algorithm are characterized with respect to the overall cost versus performance trade-off curve. Computational experiments demonstrate the viability of the approach.","author":["Ashok Jagannathan","Sung-Woo Hur","John Lillis"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 7","Issue 1","January 2002","pp   173\u2013188","https://doi.org/10.1145/504914.504922"],"date":"01 January 2002","ref":[{"text":"CHU, C.

Let F denote a rectangular floor containing a set A of n points. The portion of a straight line formed by two points from the set A is called a line segment. A monotone increasing path (MP) in F is a connected and ordered sequence of line segments from the bottom-left corner of F to its top-right corner, such that the slope of each line segment is nonnegative, and each pair of consecutive line segments share a common point of A. An MP is said to be maximal (MMP) if no other point in A can be included in it preserving monotonicity. Let AL denote the subset of A corresponding to the end points of the line segments in an MMP, L. The path L partitions the set of points A\\AL into two subsets lying on its two sides. The objective of monotone bipartitioning is to find an MMP L, such that the difference in the number of points in these two subsets is minimum. This problem can be formulated as finding a path between two designated vertices of an edge-weighted digraph (the weight of an edge being an integer lying in the range [-n, n]), for which the absolute value of the algebraic sum of weights is minimized. An O(n\u00d7 e) time algorithm is proposed for this problem, where e denotes the number of edges of the graph determined from the geometry of the point set. The monotone bipartitioning problem has various applications to image processing, facility location, and plant layout problems. A related problem arises while partitioning a VLSI floorplan. Given a floorplan with n rectangular blocks, the goal is to find a monotone staircase channel from one corner of the floor to its diagonally opposite corner such that the difference in the numbers of blocks lying on its two sides is minimum. The problem is referred to as the staircase bipartitioning problem. The proposed algorithm for a point set can be directly used to solve this problem in O(n2) time. However, an improved O(n) time algorithm is reported for this special case. This leads to an O(n log n) time algorithm for hierarchical decomposition of a floorplan with a sequence of staircase channels. Staircase bipartitioning has many applications to channel and global routing.","author":["Parthasarathi Dasgupta","Peichen Pan","Subhas C. Nandy","Bhargab B.

Many programs have wildly different behavior on even the very largest of scales (over the complete execution of the program). This realization has ramifications for many architectural and compiler techniques, from thread scheduling, to feedback directed optimizations, to the way programs are simulated. However, in order to take advantage of time-varying behavior, we must first develop the analytical tools necessary to automatically and efficiently analyze program behavior over large sections of execution.Our goal is to develop automatic techniques that are capable of finding and exploiting the Large Scale Behavior of programs (behavior seen over billions of instructions). The first step towards this goal is the development of a hardware independent metric that can concisely summarize the behavior of an arbitrary section of execution in a program. To this end we examine the use of Basic Block Vectors. We quantify the effectiveness of Basic Block Vectors in capturing program behavior across several different architectural metrics, explore the large scale behavior of several programs, and develop a set of algorithms based on clustering capable of analyzing this behavior. We then demonstrate an application of this technology to automatically determine where to simulate for a program to help guide computer architecture research.","author":["Timothy Sherwood","Erez Perelman","Greg Hamerly","Brad Calder"],"issue":["ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","Volume 36","Issue 5","December 2002","pp   45\u201357","https://doi.org/10.1145/635508.605403"],"date":"01 October 2002","ref":[{"text":"A.

It concentrates primarily on the description of the R* commit protocols, Presumed Abort (PA) and Presumed Commit (PC). PA and PC are extensions of the well-known, two-phase (2P) commit protocol. PA is optimized for read-only transactions and a class of multisite update transactions, and PC is optimized for other classes of multisite update transactions. The optimizations result in reduced intersite message traffic and log writes, and, consequently, a better response time.

In this article, we focus on methods for similarity search that make the general assumption that similarity is represented with a distance metric d. Existing methods for handling similarity search in this setting typically fall into one of two classes. The first directly indexes the objects based on distances (distance-based indexing), while the second is based on mapping to a vector space (mapping-based approach). The main part of this article is dedicated to a survey of distance-based indexing methods, but we also briefly outline how search occurs in mapping-based methods. We also present a general framework for performing search based on distances, and present algorithms for common types of queries that operate on an arbitrary \"search hierarchy.\" These algorithms can be applied on each of the methods presented, provided a suitable search hierarchy is defined.","author":["Gisli R.

In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical monothetic clustering algorithm to build a topic hierarchy for a collection of search results retrieved in response to a query. At every level of the hierarchy, the new algorithm progressively identifies topics in a way that maximizes the coverage while maintaining distinctiveness of the topics. We refer the proposed algorithm to as DisCover. Evaluating the quality of a topic hierarchy is a non-trivial task, the ultimate test being user judgment. We use several objective measures such as coverage and reach time for an empirical comparison of the proposed algorithm with two other monothetic clustering algorithms to demonstrate its superiority. Even though our algorithm is slightly more computationally intensive than one of the algorithms, it generates better hierarchies. Our user studies also show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the other algorithms as a summarizing and browsing tool.","author":["Krishna Kummamuru","Rohit Lotlikar","Shourya Roy","Karan Singal","Raghu Krishnapuram"],"issue":["WWW '04: Proceedings of the 13th international conference on World Wide Web","May 2004","Pages   658\u2013665","https://doi.org/10.1145/988672.988762"],"date":"17 May 2004","ref":[{"text":"G.

Memory bandwidth, which has riot kept pace with the increasing number of cores, has become the primary processing bottleneck, replacing disk I/O as the limiting factor. To address this challenge, we provide novel algorithms for increasing the throughput of Business Intelligence (BI) queries, as well as for ensuring fairness and avoiding starvation among a concurrent set of such queries. To maximize throughput, we propose a novel FullSharing scheme that allows all concurrent queries, when performing base-table I/O, to share the cache belonging to a given core. We then generalize this approach to a BatchSharing scheme that avoids thrashing on \"agg-tables\" ---hash tables that are used for aggregation processing---caused by execution of too many queries on a core. This scheme partitions queries into batches such that the working-set of agg-table entries for each batch can fit into a cache; an efficient sampling technique is used to estimate selectivities and working-set sizes for purposes of query partitioning. Finally, we use lottery-scheduling techniques to ensure fairness and impose a hard upper bound on staging time to avoid starvation. On our 8-core testbed, we were able to completely remove the memory I/O bottleneck, increasing throughput by a factor of 2 to 2.5, while also maintaining fairness and avoiding starvation.","author":["Lin Qiao","Vijayshankar Raman","Frederick Reiss","Peter J.

However, they present significant challenges in designing tree indexes due to their fundamentally different read and write characteristics in comparison to magnetic disks.In this paper, we present the Lazy-Adaptive Tree (LA-Tree), a novel index structure that is designed to improve performance by minimizing accesses to flash. The LA-tree has three key features: 1) it amortizes the cost of node reads and writes by performing update operations in a lazy manner using cascaded buffers, 2) it dynamically adapts buffer sizes to workload using an online algorithm, which we prove to be optimal under the cost model for raw NAND flashes, and 3) it optimizes index parameters, memory management, and storage reclamation to address flash constraints. Our performance results on raw NAND flashes show that the LA-Tree achieves 2x to 12x gains over the best of alternate schemes across a range of workloads and memory constraints. Initial results on SSDs are also promising, with 3x to 6x gains in most cases.","author":["Devesh Agrawal","Deepak Ganesan","Ramesh Sitaraman","Yanlei Diao","Shashi Singh"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 2","Issue 1","August 2009","pp   361\u2013372","https://doi.org/10.14778/1687627.1687669"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"L.

At the core of many advanced network operations lies a common and critical graph query primitive: how to search graph structures efficiently within a large network? Unfortunately, the graph query is hard due to the NP-complete nature of subgraph isomorphism. It becomes even challenging when the network examined is large and diverse. In this paper, we present a high performance graph indexing mechanism, SPath, to address the graph query problem on large networks. SPath leverages decomposed shortest paths around vertex neighborhood as basic indexing units, which prove to be both effective in graph search space pruning and highly scalable in index construction and deployment. Via SPath, a graph query is processed and optimized beyond the traditional vertex-at-a-time fashion to a more efficient path-at-a-time way: the query is first decomposed to a set of shortest paths, among which a subset of candidates with good selectivity is picked by a query plan optimizer; Candidate paths are further joined together to help recover the query graph to finalize the graph query processing. We evaluate SPath with the state-of-the-art GraphQL on both real and synthetic data sets. Our experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of SPath, which proves to be a more practical and efficient indexing method in addressing graph queries on large networks.","author":["Peixiang Zhao","Jiawei Han"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   340\u2013351","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920887"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":".

Recently, a new distributed computing paradigm, called MapReduce, and its open source implementation Hadoop, has been widely adopted due to its impressive scalability and flexibility to handle structured as well as unstructured data. In this paper, we describe our data warehouse system, called Cheetah, built on top of MapReduce. Cheetah is designed specifically for our online advertising application to allow various simplifications and custom optimizations. First, we take a fresh look at the data warehouse schema design. In particular, we define a virtual view on top of the common star or snowflake data warehouse schema. This virtual view abstraction not only allows us to design a SQL-like but much more succinct query language, but also makes it easier to support many advanced query processing features. Next, we describe a stack of optimization techniques ranging from data compression and access method to multi-query optimization and exploiting materialized views. In fact, each node with commodity hardware in our cluster is able to process raw data at 1GBytes/s. Lastly, we show how to seamlessly integrate Cheetah into any ad-hoc MapReduce jobs. This allows MapReduce developers to fully leverage the power of both MapReduce and data warehouse technologies.","author":["Songting Chen"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   1459\u20131468","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1921020"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"D.

Our Deuteronomy project separates transactional functionality from data management functionality, enabling a flexible response to exploiting new platforms. This separation requires, however, that recovery is described logically. In this paper, we extend current recovery methods to work in this logical setting. While this is straightforward in principle, performance is an issue. We show how ARIES style recovery optimizations can work for logical recovery where page information is not captured on the log. In side-by-side performance experiments using a common log, we compare logical recovery with a state-of-the art ARIES style recovery implementation and show that logical redo performance can be competitive.","author":["David Lomet","Kostas Tzoumas","Michael Zwilling"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 4","Issue 7","April 2011","pp   430\u2013439","https://doi.org/10.14778/1988776.1988779"],"date":"01 April 2011","ref":[{"text":"R.

This mechanism incurs non-negligible performance overhead in the presence of multiple indexes on a table, where changes need to be propagated to all indexes. Additionally, an uncommitted record update will block other active transactions from using the index to fetch the most recently committed values for the updated record. In general, in order to support snapshot isolation and/or multi-version concurrency, either each active transaction is forced to search a database temporary area (e.g., roll-back segments) to fetch old values of desired records, or each transaction is forced to scan the entire table to find the older versions of the record in a multi-version database (in the absence of specialized temporal indexes).In this work, we describe a novel kV-Indirection structure to enable efficient (parallelizable) optimistic and pessimistic multi-version concurrency control by utilizing the old versions of records (at most two versions of each record) to provide direct access to the recent changes of records without the need of temporal indexes. As a result, our technique results in higher degree of concurrency by reducing the clashes between readers and writers of data and avoiding extended lock delays. We have a working prototype of our concurrency model and kV-Indirection structure in a commercial database and conducted an extensive evaluation to demonstrate the benefits of our multi-version concurrency control, and we obtained orders of magnitude speed up over the single-version concurrency control.","author":["Mohammad Sadoghi","Mustafa Canim","Bishwaranjan Bhattacharjee","Fabian Nagel","Kenneth A.

SimRank is a notable measure of this type, with the intuition that \"two nodes are similar if their in-neighbors are similar\". While most existing work retrieving SimRank only considers all-pairs SimRank s(*, *) and single-source SimRank s(*, j) (scores between every node and query j), there are appealing applications for partial-pairs SimRank, e.g., similarity join. Given two node subsets A and B in a graph, partial-pairs SimRank assessment aims to retrieve only {s(a, b)}\u2200a\u03b5A,\u2200b\u03b5B. However, the best-known solution appears not self-contained since it hinges on the premise that the SimRank scores with node-pairs in an h-go cover set must be given beforehand.This paper focuses on efficient assessment of partial-pairs SimRank in a self-contained manner. (1) We devise a novel \"seed germination\" model that computes partial-pairs SimRank in O(k|E| min{|A|, |B|}) time and O(|E| + k|V|) memory for k iterations on a graph of |V| nodes and |E| edges. (2) We further eliminate unnecessary edge access to improve the time of partial-pairs SimRank to O(m min{|A|, |B|}), where m \u2264 min{k|E|, \u03942k}, and \u0394 is the maximum degree. (3) We show that our partial-pairs SimRank model also can handle the computations of all-pairs and single-source SimRanks. (4) We empirically verify that our algorithms are (a) 38x faster than the best-known competitors, and (b) memory-efficient, allowing scores to be assessed accurately on graphs with tens of millions of links.","author":["Weiren Yu","Julie A.

Our hash join is not restricted to outer tables that fit wholly in memory. Key to this hash join is a new concise hash table (CHT), a linear probing hash table that has 100% fill factor, and uses a sparse bitmap with embedded population counts to almost entirely avoid collisions. This bitmap also serves as a Bloom filter for use in multi-table joins.We study the random access characteristics of hash joins, and renew the case for non-partitioned hash joins. We introduce a variant of partitioned joins in which only the build is partitioned, but the probe is not, as this is more efficient for large outer tables than traditional partitioned joins. This also avoids partitioning costs during the probe, while at the same time allowing parallel build without latching overheads. Additionally, we present a variant of CHT, called a concise array table (CAT), that can be used when the key domain is moderately dense. CAT is collision-free and avoids storing join keys in the hash table.We perform a detailed comparison of CHT and CAT against leading in-memory hash joins. Our experiments show that we can reduce the memory usage by one to three orders of magnitude, while also being competitive in performance.","author":["R. Barber","G. Lohman","I. Pandis","V.

Popular mobile applications such as messenger, email and social network services rely on SQLite for their data management need. Those mobile applications tend to execute relatively short transactions in the autocommit mode for transactional consistency in databases. This often has adverse effect on the flash memory storage in mobile devices because the small random updates cause high write amplification and high write latency. In order to address this problem, we propose a new optimization strategy, called per-page logging (PPL), for mobile data management, and have implemented the key functions in SQLite/PPL. The hardware component of SQLite/PPL includes phase change memory (PCM) with a byte-addressable, persistent memory abstraction. By capturing an update in a physiological log record and adding it to the PCM log sector, SQLite/PPL can replace a multitude of successive page writes made to the same logical page with much smaller log writes done to PCM much more efficiently. We have observed that SQLite/PPL would potentially improve the performance of mobile applications by an order of magnitude while supporting transactional atomicity and durability.","author":["Gihwan Oh","Sangchul Kim","Sang-Won Lee","Bongki Moon"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 12","August 2015","pp   1454\u20131465","https://doi.org/10.14778/2824032.2824044"],"date":"01 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"AndroBench. http://www.androbench.org/.","order":1},{"text":"SQLite. http://www.sqlite.org/.","order":2},{"text":"A.

We implement our ideas in Caribou, an intelligent distributed storage layer incorporating many of the lessons learned while building systems with specialized hardware. Caribou provides access to DRAM/NVRAM storage over the network through a simple key-value store interface, with each storage node providing high-bandwidth near-data processing at line rate and fault tolerance through replication. The result is a highly efficient, distributed, intelligent data storage that can be used to both boost performance and reduce power consumption and real estate usage in the data center thanks to the micro-server architecture adopted.","author":["Zsolt Istv\u00e1n","David Sidler","Gustavo Alonso"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 11","August 2017","pp   1202\u20131213","https://doi.org/10.14778/3137628.3137632"],"date":"01 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

A big gap between the knowledge in existing knowledge repositories and the knowledge in the real world is the knowledge on tail verticals (i.e., less popular domains). Such knowledge, though not necessarily globally popular, can be personal hobbies to many people and thus collectively impactful. This paper studies the problem of knowledge verification for tail verticals; that is, deciding the correctness of a given triple.Through comprehensive experimental study we answer the following questions. 1) Can we find evidence for tail knowledge from an extensive set of sources, including knowledge bases, the web, and query logs? 2) Can we judge correctness of the triples based on the collected evidence? 3) How can we further improve knowledge verification on tail verticals? Our empirical study suggests a new knowledge-verification framework, which we call Facty, that applies various kinds of evidence collection techniques followed by knowledge fusion. Facty can verify 50% of the (correct) tail knowledge with a precision of 84%, and it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Detailed error analysis on the obtained results suggests future research directions.","author":["Furong Li","Xin Luna Dong","Anno Langen","Yang Li"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 11","August 2017","pp   1370\u20131381","https://doi.org/10.14778/3137628.3137646"],"date":"01 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"S.

Some of the techniques that are being used to achieve privacy are to remove identifiers, alter quasi-identifiers, and perturb values. Unfortunately, these approaches suffer from two limitations. First, it has been shown that private information can still be leaked if attackers possess some background knowledge or other information sources. Second, they do not take into account the adverse impact these methods will have on the utility of the released data. In this paper, we propose a method that meets both requirements. Our method, called table-GAN, uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to synthesize fake tables that are statistically similar to the original table yet do not incur information leakage. We show that the machine learning models trained using our synthetic tables exhibit performance that is similar to that of models trained using the original table for unknown testing cases. We call this property model compatibility. We believe that anonymization/perturbation/synthesis methods without model compatibility are of little value. We used four real-world datasets from four different domains for our experiments and conducted indepth comparisons with state-of-the-art anonymization, perturbation, and generation techniques. Throughout our experiments, only our method consistently shows balance between privacy level and model compatibility.","author":["Noseong Park","Mahmoud Mohammadi","Kshitij Gorde","Sushil Jajodia","Hongkyu Park","Youngmin Kim"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 10","June 2018","pp   1071\u20131083","https://doi.org/10.14778/3231751.3231757"],"date":"01 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Adult Dataset. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult.","order":1},{"text":"Airline Dataset. https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DataIndex.asp.","order":2},{"text":"ARX - Data Anonymization Tool. http://arx.deidentifier.org.","order":3},{"text":"Health Dataset. https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Default.aspx.","order":4},{"text":"Los Angeles City Government Employee Payroll Dataset. https://controllerdata.lacity.org/Payroll/City-Employee-Payroll/pazn-qyym.","order":5},{"text":"Scikit-learn: Machine learning in Python. http://scikit-learn.org.","order":6},{"text":"sdcMicro: Statistical Disclosure Control Methods for Anonymization of Microdata and Risk Estimation. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sdcMicro/index.html.","order":7},{"text":"C.

Systems such as TensorFlow and Caffe2 train models with parallel synchronous stochastic gradient descent: they process a batch of training data at a time, partitioned across GPUs, and average the resulting partial gradients to obtain an updated global model. To fully utilise all GPUs, systems must increase the batch size, which hinders statistical efficiency. Users tune hyper-parameters such as the learning rate to compensate for this, which is complex and model-specific.We describe Crossbow, a new single-server multi-GPU system for training deep learning models that enables users to freely choose their preferred batch size---however small---while scaling to multiple GPUs. Crossbow uses many parallel model replicas and avoids reduced statistical efficiency through a new synchronous training method. We introduce SMA, a synchronous variant of model averaging in which replicas independently explore the solution space with gradient descent, but adjust their search synchronously based on the trajectory of a globally-consistent average model. Crossbow achieves high hardware efficiency with small batch sizes by potentially training multiple model replicas per GPU, automatically tuning the number of replicas to maximise throughput. our experiments show that Crossbow improves the training time of deep learning models on an 8-GPU server by 1.3--4X compared to TensorFlow.","author":["Alexandros Koliousis","Pijika Watcharapichat","Matthias Weidlich","Luo Mai","Paolo Costa","Peter Pietzuch"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 12","Issue 11","July 2019","pp   1399\u20131412","https://doi.org/10.14778/3342263.3342276"],"date":"01 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"M.

Graph Neural Network (GNN) becomes an effective way to address the graph learning problem by converting the graph data into a low dimensional space while keeping both the structural and property information to the maximum extent and constructing a neural network for training and referencing. However, it is challenging to provide an efficient graph storage and computation capabilities to facilitate GNN training and enable development of new GNN algorithms. In this paper, we present a comprehensive graph neural network system, namely AliGraph, which consists of distributed graph storage, optimized sampling operators and runtime to efficiently support not only existing popular GNNs but also a series of in-house developed ones for different scenarios. The system is currently deployed at Alibaba to support a variety of business scenarios, including product recommendation and personalized search at Alibaba's E-Commerce platform. By conducting extensive experiments on a real-world dataset with 492.90 million vertices, 6.82 billion edges and rich attributes, AliGraph performs an order of magnitude faster in terms of graph building (5 minutes vs hours reported from the state-of-the-art PowerGraph platform). At training, AliGraph runs 40%-50% faster with the novel caching strategy and demonstrates around 12 times speed up with the improved runtime. In addition, our in-house developed GNN models all showcase their statistically significant superiorities in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency (e.g., 4.12%--17.19% lift by F1 scores).","author":["Rong Zhu","Kun Zhao","Hongxia Yang","Wei Lin","Chang Zhou","Baole Ai","Yong Li","Jingren Zhou"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 12","Issue 12","August 2019","pp   2094\u20132105","https://doi.org/10.14778/3352063.3352127"],"date":"01 August 2019","ref":[{"text":"P.

Although the classical reachability query (i.e., reachability query without label constraint) has been extensively studied, LCR query is much more challenging because the number of possible label constraint set is exponential to the size of the labels. We observe that the existing techniques for LCR queries only construct partial index for better scalability, and their worst query time is not guaranteed and could be the same as an online breadth-first search (BFS).In this paper, we propose novel label-constrained 2-hop indexing techniques with novel pruning rules and order strategies. It is shown that our worst query time could be bounded by the in-out index entry size. With all these techniques, comprehensive experiments show that our proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art technique in terms of query response time (up to 5 orders of magnitude speedup), index size and index construction time. In particular, our proposed method can answer LCR queries within microsecond over billion-scale graphs in a single machine.","author":["You Peng","Ying Zhang","Xuemin Lin","Lu Qin","Wenjie Zhang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 13","Issue 6","February 2020","pp   812\u2013825","https://doi.org/10.14778/3380750.3380753"],"date":"01 February 2020","ref":[{"text":"I.

While individual first-order classifiers perform comparably to middle-scoring teams' systems, the combination achieves high performance. We discuss trade-offs and empirical performance. Finally, we present an analysis of the combination, examining how ensemble performance depends on error independence and task difficulty.","author":["Dan Klein","Kristina Toutanova","H.

Experiments have, however, shown that the over-fitting problem often arises when these kernels are used in NLP tasks. This paper discusses this issue of convolution kernels, and then proposes a new approach based on statistical feature selection that avoids this issue. To enable the proposed method to be executed efficiently, it is embedded into an original kernel calculation process by using sub-structure mining algorithms. Experiments are undertaken on real NLP tasks to confirm the problem with a conventional method and to compare its performance with that of the proposed method.","author":["Jun Suzuki","Hideki Isozaki","Eisaku Maeda"],"issue":["ACL '04: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics","July 2004","Pages   119\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.3115/1218955.1218971"],"date":"21 July 2004","ref":[{"text":"N.

Such corrections require contextual information and are not handled by conventional spelling programs such as Unix spell. First, we introduce a method called Trigrams that uses part-of-speech trigrams to encode the context. This method uses a small number of parameters compared to previous methods based on word trigrams. However, it is effectively unable to distinguish among words that have the same part of speech. For this case, an alternative feature-based method called Bayes performs better; but Bayes is less effective than Trigrams when the distinction among words depends on syntactic constraints. A hybrid method called Tribayes is then introduced that combines the best of the previous two methods. The improvement in performance of Tribayes over its components is verified experimentally. Tribayes is also compared with the grammar checker in Microsoft Word, and is found to have substantially higher performance.","author":["Andrew R.

According to their different characteristics, the results of two classifiers are merged to achieve better performance. We propose an automatic corpus expansion method for SVM and CRF to overcome the shortage of the annotated training data. In addition, we incorporate a keyword-based post-processing step to deal with the remaining problems such as assigning an appropriate named entity tag to the word/phrase containing parentheses.","author":["Yu Song","Eunju Kim","Gary Geunbae Lee","Byoung-kee Yi"],"issue":["JNLPBA '04: Proceedings of the International Joint Workshop on Natural Language Processing in Biomedicine and its Applications","August 2004","Pages   100\u2013103"],"date":"28 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"J.Lafferty, A.

The non-probabilistic parser is a standard finite-state transducer implementation of two-level morphology formalism. A disambiguated text corpus of 200 million words is used to stochastize the morphotactics transducer, then it is composed with the morphophonemics transducer to get a stochastic morphological parser. We present two applications to evaluate the effectiveness of the stochastic parser; spelling correction and morphology-based language modeling for speech recognition.","author":["Ha\u015fim Sak","Tunga G\u00fcng\u00f6r","Murat Sara\u00e7lar"],"issue":["ACLShort '09: Proceedings of the ACL-IJCNLP 2009 Conference Short Papers","August 2009","Pages   273\u2013276"],"date":"04 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"Cyril Allauzen, Michael Riley, Johan Schalkwyk, Wojciech Skut, and Mehryar Mohri. 2007.
