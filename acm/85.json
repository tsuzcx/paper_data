Our main advance is to use context-sensitive speech recognition in a general way, with a representation of dialogue context that is rich and flexible enough to support conversation about multiple interleaved topics, as well as the interpretation of corrective fragments. We explain, by use of worked examples, the use of our \"Conversational Intelligence Architecture\" (CIA) to represent conversational threads, and how each thread can be associated with a language model (LM) for more robust speech recognition. The CIA uses fine-grained dynamic representations of dialogue context, which supersede those used in finite-state or form-based dialogue managers. In an evaluation of a dialogue system built using this architecture we found that 87.9% of recognized utterances were recognized using a context-specific language model, resulting in an 11.5% reduction in the overall utterance recognition error rate, and a 13.4% reduction in concept error rate. Thus we show that by using context-sensitive recognition based on the predicted type of the user's next dialogue move, a more flexible dialogue system can also exhibit an improvement in speech recognition performance.","author":["Oliver Lemon","Alexander Gruenstein"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction","Volume 11","Issue 3","September 2004","pp   241\u2013267","https://doi.org/10.1145/1017494.1017496"],"date":"01 September 2004","ref":[{"text":"Allen, J., Byron, D., Dzikovska, M., Ferguson, G., Galescu, L., and Stent, A. 2001.

The SCL protocol produces a speculative load value, typically from an invalid cache line, permitting the processor to compute with incoherent data. In parallel, the coherence protocol obtains the necessary coherence permissions and the correct value. Eventually, the speculative use of the incoherent data can be verified against the coherent data. Thus, coherence decoupling can greatly reduce --- if not eliminate --- the effects of false sharing. Furthermore, coherence decoupling can also reduce latencies incurred by true sharing. SCL protocols reduce those latencies by speculatively writing updates into invalid lines, thereby increasing the accuracy of speculation, without complicating the simple, underlying coherence protocol that guarantees correctness.The performance benefits of coherence decoupling are evaluated using a full-system simulator and a mix of commercial and scientific benchmarks. Our results show that 40% to 90% of all coherence misses can be speculated correctly, and therefore their latencies partially or fully hidden. This capability results in performance improvements ranging from 3% to over 16%, in most cases where the latencies of coherence misses have an effect on performance.","author":["Jaehyuk Huh","Jichuan Chang","Doug Burger","Gurindar S.

However, except for network visualization, criminal network analysis remains primarily a manual process. Existing tools do not provide advanced structural analysis techniques that allow extraction of network knowledge from large volumes of criminal-justice data. To help law enforcement and intelligence agencies discover criminal network knowledge efficiently and effectively, in this research we proposed a framework for automated network analysis and visualization. The framework included four stages: network creation, network partition, structural analysis, and network visualization. Based upon it, we have developed a system called CrimeNet Explorer that incorporates several advanced techniques: a concept space approach, hierarchical clustering, social network analysis methods, and multidimensional scaling. Results from controlled experiments involving student subjects demonstrated that our system could achieve higher clustering recall and precision than did untrained subjects when detecting subgroups from criminal networks. Moreover, subjects identified central members and interaction patterns between groups significantly faster with the help of structural analysis functionality than with only visualization functionality. No significant gain in effectiveness was present, however. Our domain experts also reported that they believed CrimeNet Explorer could be very useful in crime investigation.","author":["Jennifer J.

We define a Markov Random Field (MRF)-based similarity metric for measuring the quality of synthesized texture with respect to a given input sample. This allows us to formulate the synthesis problem as minimization of an energy function, which is optimized using an Expectation Maximization (EM)-like algorithm. In contrast to most example-based techniques that do region-growing, ours is a joint optimization approach that progressively refines the entire texture. Additionally, our approach is ideally suited to allow for controllable synthesis of textures. Specifically, we demonstrate controllability by animating image textures using flow fields. We allow for general two-dimensional flow fields that may dynamically change over time. Applications of this technique include dynamic texturing of fluid animations and texture-based flow visualization.","author":["Vivek Kwatra","Irfan Essa","Aaron Bobick","Nipun Kwatra"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 24","Issue 3","July 2005","pp   795\u2013802","https://doi.org/10.1145/1073204.1073263"],"date":"01 July 2005","ref":[{"text":"Ashikhmin, M. 2001.

The method tightly integrates visibility culling and out-of-core data management with a level-of-detail framework. At preprocessing time, we generate a coarse volume hierarchy by binary space partitioning the input triangle soup. Leaf nodes partition the original data into chunks of a fixed maximum number of triangles, while inner nodes are discretized into a fixed number of cubical voxels. Each voxel contains a compact direction dependent approximation of the appearance of the associated volumetric subpart of the model when viewed from a distance. The approximation is constructed by a visibility aware algorithm that fits parametric shaders to samples obtained by casting rays against the full resolution dataset. At rendering time, the volumetric structure, maintained off-core, is refined and rendered in front-to-back order, exploiting vertex programs for GPU evaluation of view-dependent voxel representations, hardware occlusion queries for culling occluded subtrees, and asynchronous I/O for detecting and avoiding data access latencies. Since the granularity of the multiresolution structure is coarse, data management, traversal and occlusion culling cost is amortized over many graphics primitives.

Trilinos addresses two fundamental issues of developing software for these problems: (i) providing a streamlined process and set of tools for development of new algorithmic implementations and (ii) promoting interoperability of independently developed software.Trilinos uses a two-level software structure designed around collections of packages. A Trilinos package is an integral unit usually developed by a small team of experts in a particular algorithms area such as algebraic preconditioners, nonlinear solvers, etc. Packages exist underneath the Trilinos top level, which provides a common look-and-feel, including configuration, documentation, licensing, and bug-tracking.Here we present the overall Trilinos design, describing our use of abstract interfaces and default concrete implementations. We discuss the services that Trilinos provides to a prospective package and how these services are used by various packages. We also illustrate how packages can be combined to rapidly develop new algorithms. Finally, we discuss how Trilinos facilitates high-quality software engineering practices that are increasingly required from simulation software.","author":["Michael A. Heroux","Roscoe A.

However, it is this nonspecific nature that has limited the use of FPGAs in scientific applications that require floating-point arithmetic. Even simple floating-point operations consume a large amount of computational resources. In this paper, we introduce embedding floating-point multiply-add units in an island style FPGA.

We focus on applications of environmental monitoring, in which the goal is to reconstruct a spatial map of environmental factors of interest. Traditional sampling theory deals with data collection processes that are completely independent of the target map to be estimated, aside from possible a priori specifications reflective of assumed properties of the target. We refer to such processes as passive learning methods. Alternatively, one can envision sequential, adaptive data collection procedures that use information gleaned from previous observations to guide the process. We refer to such feedback-driven processes as active learning methods. Active learning is naturally suited to mobile path planning, in which previous samples are used to guide the motion of the mobiles for further sampling. This paper presents some of the most encouraging theoretical results to date that support the effectiveness of active over passive learning, and focuses on new results regarding the capabilities of active learning methods for mobile sensing. Tradeoffs between latency, path lengths, and accuracy are carefully assessed using our theory. Adaptive path planning methods are developed to guide mobiles in order to focus attention in interesting regions of the sensing domain, thus conducting spatial surveys much more rapidly while maintaining the accuracy of the estimated map. The theory and methods are illustrated in the application of water current mapping in a freshwater lake.","author":["Aarti Singh","Robert Nowak","Parmesh Ramanathan"],"issue":["IPSN '06: Proceedings of the 5th international conference on Information processing in sensor networks","April 2006","Pages   60\u201368","https://doi.org/10.1145/1127777.1127790"],"date":"19 April 2006","ref":[{"text":"http://limnosun.limnology.wisc.edu/.","order":1},{"text":"http://www.cens.ucla.edu/portal/nims/.","order":2},{"text":"M.

The problem of constructing a wait-free implementation of one data object from another lies at the heart of much recent work in concurrent algorithms, concurrent data structures, and multiprocessor architectures. First, we introduce a simple and general technique, based on reduction to a concensus protocol, for proving statements of the form, \u201cthere is no wait-free implementation of X by Y.\u201d We derive a hierarchy of objects such that no object at one level has a wait-free implementation in terms of objects at lower levels. In particular, we show that    atomic read/write registers, which have been the focus of much recent attention, are at the bottom of the hierarchy: thay cannot be used to construct wait-free implementations of many simple and familiar data types. Moreover, classical synchronization primitives such astest&set and fetch&add, while more powerful than read and write, are also computationally weak, as are the standard message-passing primitives. Second, nevertheless, we show that there do exist simple universal objects from which one can construct a wait-free implementation of any sequential object.","author":["Maurice Herlihy"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems","Volume 13","Issue 1","Jan. 1991","pp   124\u2013149","https://doi.org/10.1145/114005.102808"],"date":"01 January 1991","ref":[{"text":"ANDERSON, J.

Our photo explorer uses image-based rendering techniques to smoothly transition between photographs, while also enabling full 3D navigation and exploration of the set of images and world geometry, along with auxiliary information such as overhead maps. Our system also makes it easy to construct photo tours of scenic or historic locations, and to annotate image details, which are automatically transferred to other relevant images.

Specifically, probabilistic adders and multipliers, realized using elements such as gates that are in turn probabilistic, are shown to form a natural basis for primitives in the signal processing (DSP) domain. In this paper, we show that probabilistic arithmetic can be used to compute the FFT in an extremely energy-efficient manner, yielding energy savings of over 5. 6X in the context of the widely used synthetic aperture radar (SAR) application [1]. Our results are derived using novel probabilistic cmos (PC-MOS) technology, characterized and applied in the past to realize ultra-efficient architectures for probabilistic applications [2, 3, 4]. When applied to the dsp domain, the resulting error in the output of a probabilistic arithmetic primitive, such as an adder for example, manifests as degradation in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ofthe sar image that is reconstructed through the FFT algorithm. In return for this degradation that is enabled by our probabilistic arithmetic primitives ?- degradation visually indistinguishable from an image reconstructed using conventional deterministic approaches -- significant energy savings and performance gains are shown to be possible per unit of SNR degradation. These savings stem from a novel method of voltage scaling, which we refer to as biased voltage scaling (or BIVOS), that is the major technical innovation on which our probabilistic designs are based.","author":["J.

This paper proposes a novel superblockbased FTL scheme, which combines a set of adjacent logical blocks into a superblock. In the proposed FTL scheme, superblocks are mapped at coarse granularity,while pages inside the superblock are mapped freely at fine granularity to any location in several physical blocks. To reduce extra storage and flash memory operations, the fine-grain mapping information is stored in the spare area of NAND flash memory. This hybrid mapping technique has the flexibility provided by fine-grain address translation, while reducing the memory overhead to the level of coarse-grain address translation. Our experimental results show that the proposed FTL scheme decreases the garbage collection overhead up to 40% compared to previous FTL schemes.","author":["Jeong-Uk Kang","Heeseung Jo","Jin-Soo Kim","Joonwon Lee"],"issue":["EMSOFT '06: Proceedings of the 6th ACM & IEEE International conference on Embedded software","October 2006","Pages   161\u2013170","https://doi.org/10.1145/1176887.1176911"],"date":"22 October 2006","ref":[{"text":"C.

Harp is a replicated Unix file system accessible via the VFS interface. It provides highly available and reliable storage for files and guarantees that file operations are executed atomically in spite of concurrency and failures. It uses a novel variation of the primary copy replication technique that provides good performance because it allows us to trade disk accesses for network communication. Harp is intended to be used within a file service in a distributed network; in our current implementation, it is accessed via NFS. Preliminary performance results indicate that Harp provides equal or better response time and system capacity than an unreplicated implementation of NFS that uses Unix files directly.","author":["Barbara Liskov","Sanjay Ghemawat","Robert Gruber","Paul Johnson","Liuba Shrira","Michael Williams"],"issue":["SOSP '91: Proceedings of the thirteenth ACM symposium on Operating systems principles","September 1991","Pages   226\u2013238","https://doi.org/10.1145/121132.121169"],"date":"01 September 1991","ref":[{"text":"Alsberg, P., and Day, J.

Using standard-based protocols (such as SOAP and WSDL), composite services can be constructed by integrating atomic services developed independently. Algorithms are needed to select service components with various QoS levels according to some application-dependent performance requirements. We design a broker-based architecture to facilitate the selection of QoS-based services. The objective of service selection is to maximize an application-specific utility function under the end-to-end QoS constraints. The problem is modeled in two ways: the combinatorial model and the graph model. The combinatorial model defines the problem as a multidimension multichoice 0-1 knapsack problem (MMKP). The graph model defines the problem as a multiconstraint optimal path (MCOP) problem. Efficient heuristic algorithms for service processes of different composition structures are presented in this article and their performances are studied by simulations. We also compare the pros and cons between the two models.","author":["Tao Yu","Yue Zhang","Kwei-Jay Lin"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on the Web","Volume 1","Issue 1","May 2007","pp   6\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.1145/1232722.1232728"],"date":"01 May 2007","ref":[{"text":"Aggarwal, R., Verma, K., Miller, J., and Milnor, W. 2004.

Twenty-eight people conducted the three kinds of searches in a between-subjects study and twelve others conducted the three kinds of searches on all three systems in a within-subjects study. Quantitative results demonstrate that the alternative general-purpose user interfaces that accept automated structuring of data offer comparable effectiveness, efficiency, and aesthetics to manually constructed architectures.

However, in some of the sensor networking applications, an additional facility is available to ameliorate the energy problem: harvesting energy from the environment. Certain considerations in using an energy harvesting source are fundamentally different from that in using a battery, because, rather than a limit on the maximum energy, it has a limit on the maximum rate at which the energy can be used. Further, the harvested energy availability typically varies with time in a nondeterministic manner. While a deterministic metric, such as residual battery, suffices to characterize the energy availability in the case of batteries, a more sophisticated characterization may be required for a harvesting source. Another issue that becomes important in networked systems with multiple harvesting nodes is that different nodes may have different harvesting opportunity. In a distributed application, the same end-user performance may be achieved using different workload allocations, and resultant energy consumptions at multiple nodes. In this case, it is important to align the workload allocation with the energy availability at the harvesting nodes. We consider the above issues in power management for energy-harvesting sensor networks. We develop abstractions to characterize the complex time varying nature of such sources with analytically tractable models and use them to address key design issues. We also develop distributed methods to efficiently use harvested energy and test these both in simulation and experimentally on an energy-harvesting sensor network, prototyped for this work.","author":["Aman Kansal","Jason Hsu","Sadaf Zahedi","Mani B.

Our objective is to improve the endurance of flash memory with limited overhead and without many modifications to popular implementation designs, such as Flash Translation Layer protocol (FTL) and NAND Flash Translation Layer protocol (NFTL). A static wear leveling mechanism is proposed with limited memory-space requirements and an efficient implementation. The propreties of the mechanism are then explored with various implementation considerations. Through a series of experiments based on a realistic trace, we show that the endurance of FTL and NFTL could be significantly improved with limited system overheads.","author":["Yuan-Hao Chang","Jen-Wei Hsieh","Tei-Wei Kuo"],"issue":["DAC '07: Proceedings of the 44th annual Design Automation Conference","June 2007","Pages   212\u2013217","https://doi.org/10.1145/1278480.1278533"],"date":"04 June 2007","ref":[{"text":"Flash Cache Memory Puts Robson in the Middle.","order":1},{"text":"Flash File System.

For delineating this complex, interdisciplinary field, a novel bibliometric retrieval strategy is used. Given that the performance of unsupervised clustering and classification of scientific publications is significantly improved by deeply merging textual contents with the structure of the citation graph, we proceed with a hybrid clustering method based on Fisher's inverse chi-square. The optimal number of clusters is determined by a compound semiautomatic strategy comprising a combination of distance-based and stability-based methods. We also investigate the relationship between number of Latent Semantic Indexing factors, number of clusters, and clustering performance. The HITS and PageRank algorithms are used to determine representative publications in each cluster. Next, we develop a methodology for dynamic hybrid clustering of evolving bibliographic data sets. The same clustering methodology is applied to consecutive periods defined by time windows on the set, and in a subsequent phase chains are formed by matching and tracking clusters through time. Term networks for the eleven resulting cluster chains present the cognitive structure of the field. Finally, we provide a view on how much attention the bioinformatics community has devoted to the different subfields through time.","author":["Frizo Janssens","Wolfgang Gl\u00e4nzel","Bart De Moor"],"issue":["KDD '07: Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2007","Pages   360\u2013369","https://doi.org/10.1145/1281192.1281233"],"date":"12 August 2007","ref":[{"text":"R.

In Zyzzyva, replicas respond to a client's request without first running an expensive three-phase commit protocol to reach agreement on the order in which the request must be processed. Instead, they optimistically adopt the order proposed by the primary and respond immediately to the client. Replicas can thus become temporarily inconsistent with one another, but clients detect inconsistencies, help correct replicas converge on a single total ordering of requests, and only rely on responses that are consistent with this total order. This approach allows Zyzzyva to reduce replication overheads to near their theoretical minimal.","author":["Ramakrishna Kotla","Lorenzo Alvisi","Mike Dahlin","Allen Clement","Edmund Wong"],"issue":["ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","Volume 41","Issue 6","December 2007","pp   45\u201358","https://doi.org/10.1145/1323293.1294267"],"date":"14 October 2007","ref":[{"text":"OpenSSL. http://www.openssl.org/.","order":1},{"text":"US secret service report on insider attacks. http://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/press/insider-2005.html.","order":2},{"text":"M.

The shape of the programmable aperture can be adjusted and used to capture light field at full sensor resolution through multiple exposures without any additional optics and without moving the camera. High acquisition efficiency is achieved by employing an optimal multiplexing scheme, and quality data is obtained by using the two post-processing algorithms designed for self calibration of photometric distortion and for multi-view depth estimation. View-dependent depth maps thus generated help boost the angular resolution of light field. Various post-exposure photographic effects are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system and the quality of the captured light field.","author":["Chia-Kai Liang","Tai-Hsu Lin","Bing-Yi Wong","Chi Liu","Homer H.

The flexibility provided by the N-variants enables a number of important tasks, including IP protection, IP metering, security, design optimization, self-adaptation and fault-tolerance. The method is based on extending the finite state machine (FSM) of the design to include multiple variants of the same design specification. The state transitions are managed by added signals that may come from various triggers depending on the target application. We devise an algorithm for implementing the N-variant IC design. We discuss the necessary manipulations of the added signals that would facilitate the various tasks. The key advantage to integrating the heterogeneity in the functional specification of the design is that we can configure the variants during or post-manufacturing, but removal, extraction or deletion of the variants is not viable. Experimental results on benchmark circuits demonstrate that the method can be automatically and efficiently implemented. Because of its lightweight, N-variant design is particularly well-suited for securing embedded systems. As a proof-of-concept, we implement the N-variant method for content protection in portable media players, e.g., iPod. We discuss how the N-variant design methodology readily enables new digital rights management methods.","author":["Yousra Alkabani","Farinaz Koushanfar"],"issue":["DAC '08: Proceedings of the 45th annual Design Automation Conference","June 2008","Pages   546\u2013551","https://doi.org/10.1145/1391469.1391606"],"date":"08 June 2008","ref":[{"text":"Y.

On the one hand, it is much easier to build a number of small quantum computers rather than a single large one. On the other hand, the best results concerning some of the fundamental problems in distributed computing can potentially be dramatically improved upon by taking advantage of the superior resources and processing power that quantum mechanics offers. This survey has the purpose to highlight both of these benefits. We first review the current results regarding the implementation of arbitrary quantum algorithms on distributed hardware. We then discuss existing proposals for quantum solutions of leader election - a fundamental problem from distributed computing. Quantum mechanics allows leader election to be solved with no communication, provided that certain pre-shared entanglement is already in place. Further, an impossibility result from classical distributed computing is circumvented by the quantum solution of anonymous leader election - a unique leader is elected in finite time with certainty. Finally, we discuss the viability of these proposals from a practical perspective. Although, theoretically, distributed quantum computing looks promising, it is still unclear how to build quantum hardware and how to create and maintain robust large-scale entangled states. Moreover, it is not clear whether the costs of creating entangled states and working with them are smaller than the costs of existing classical solutions.","author":["Vasil S.

Current optical tags, such as barcodes, must be read within a short range and the codes occupy valuable physical space on products. We present a new low-cost optical design so that the tags can be shrunk to 3mm visible diameter, and unmodified ordinary cameras several meters away can be set up to decode the identity plus the relative distance and angle. The design exploits the bokeh effect of ordinary cameras lenses, which maps rays exiting from an out of focus scene point into a disk like blur on the camera sensor. This bokeh-code or Bokode is a barcode design with a simple lenslet over the pattern. We show that a code with 15\u03bcm features can be read using an off-the-shelf camera from distances of up to 2 meters. We use intelligent binary coding to estimate the relative distance and angle to the camera, and show potential for applications in augmented reality and motion capture. We analyze the constraints and performance of the optical system, and discuss several plausible application scenarios.","author":["Ankit Mohan","Grace Woo","Shinsaku Hiura","Quinn Smithwick","Ramesh Raskar"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 28","Issue 3","August 2009","Article No.: 98","pp   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/1531326.1531404"],"date":"27 July 2009","ref":[{"text":"Abowd, G.

The best solution to these choices is often tightly coupled to different architectures, problem sizes, data, and available system resources. In some cases, completely different algorithms may provide the best performance. Current compiler and programming language techniques are able to change some of these parameters, but today there is no simple way for the programmer to express or the compiler to choose different algorithms to handle different parts of the data. Existing solutions normally can handle only coarse-grained, library level selections or hand coded cutoffs between base cases and recursive cases. We present PetaBricks, a new implicitly parallel language and compiler where having multiple implementations of multiple algorithms to solve a problem is the natural way of programming. We make algorithmic choice a first class construct of the language. Choices are provided in a way that also allows our compiler to tune at a finer granularity. The PetaBricks compiler autotunes programs by making both fine-grained as well as algorithmic choices. Choices also include different automatic parallelization techniques, data distributions, algorithmic parameters, transformations, and blocking. Additionally, we introduce novel techniques to autotune algorithms for different convergence criteria. When choosing between various direct and iterative methods, the PetaBricks compiler is able to tune a program in such a way that delivers near-optimal efficiency for any desired level of accuracy. The compiler has the flexibility of utilizing different convergence criteria for the various components within a single algorithm, providing the user with accuracy choice alongside algorithmic choice.","author":["Jason Ansel","Cy Chan","Yee Lok Wong","Marek Olszewski","Qin Zhao","Alan Edelman","Saman Amarasinghe"],"issue":["PLDI '09: Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation","June 2009","Pages   38\u201349","https://doi.org/10.1145/1542476.1542481"],"date":"15 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"Ayaz Ali, Lennart Johnsson, and Jaspal Subhlok.

Most leading companies use large clusters of server computers to achieve acceptable turn-around time. Thus coprocessor acceleration is very attractive for obtaining increased computational performance with a reduced power consumption. This article describes the implementation of a customized accelerator on FPGA using a polygon-based simulation model. An application-specific memory partitioning scheme is designed to meet the bandwidth requirements for a large number of processing elements. Deep loop pipelining and ping-pong buffer based function block pipelining are also implemented in our design. Initial results show a 15X speedup versus the software implementation running on a microprocessor, and more speedup is expected via further performance tuning. The implementation also leverages state-of-art C-to-RTL synthesis tools. At the same time, we also identify the need for manual architecture-level exploration for parallel implementations. Moreover, we implement the algorithm on NVIDIA GPUs using the CUDA programming environment, and provide some useful comparisons for different kinds of accelerators.","author":["Jason Cong","Yi Zou"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 2","Issue 3","September 2009","Article No.: 17","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/1575774.1575776"],"date":"01 September 2009","ref":[{"text":"Cao, Y., Lu, Y.-W., Chen, L., and Ye, J. 2004.

A basic workload characteristic assumption of most existing solutions to the problem is that there exists a strong inverse correlation between file access frequency and file size. In other words, the most popular files are typically small in size, while the large files are relatively unpopular. Recent studies on the characteristics of Web proxy traces suggested, however, the correlation, if any, is so weak that it can be ignored. Hence, the following two questions arise naturally. First, can existing algorithms still perform well when the workload assumption does not hold? Second, if not, can one develop a new file assignment strategy that is immune to the workload assumption? To answer these questions, we first evaluate the performance of three well-known file assignment algorithms with and without the workload assumption, respectively. Next, we develop a novel static nonpartitioned file assignment strategy for parallel I/O systems, called static round-robin (SOR), which is immune to the workload assumption. Comprehensive experimental results show that SOR consistently improves the performance in terms of mean response time over the existing schemes.","author":["Tao Xie","Yao Sun"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 5","Issue 3","November 2009","Article No.: 10","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/1629075.1629079"],"date":"30 November 2009","ref":[{"text":"Almeda, V., Cesario, M., Fonseca, R., Meira, W.

Excessive runtime thermal variations compromise the performance and reliability of integrated circuits. To address these thermal issues, state-of-the-art chips have integrated thermal sensors that monitor temperatures at a few selected die locations. These temperature measurements are then used by thermal management techniques to appropriately manage chip performance. Thermal sensors and their support circuitry incur design overheads, die area, and manufacturing costs. In this paper, we propose a new direction for full thermal characterization of integrated circuits based on spectral Fourier analysis techniques. Application of these techniques to temperature sensing is based on the observation that die temperature is simply a space-varying signal, and that space-varying signals are treated identically to time-varying signals in signal analysis. We utilize Nyquist-Shannon sampling theory to devise methods that can almost fully reconstruct the thermal status of an integrated circuit during runtime using a minimal number of thermal sensors. We propose methods that can handle uniform and non-uniform thermal sensor placements. We develop an extensive experimental setup and demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods by thermally characterizing a 16-core processor. Our method produces full thermal characterization with an average absolute error of 0.6% using a limited number of sensors.","author":["Ryan Cochran","Sherief Reda"],"issue":["DAC '09: Proceedings of the 46th Annual Design Automation Conference","July 2009","Pages   478\u2013483","https://doi.org/10.1145/1629911.1630037"],"date":"26 July 2009","ref":[{"text":"D.

In this paper we evaluate the search accuracy and complexity of the global GIST descriptor for two applications, for which a local description is usually preferred: same location/object recognition and copy detection. We identify the cases in which a global description can reasonably be used. The comparison is performed against a state-of-the-art bag-of-features representation. To evaluate the impact of GIST's spatial grid, we compare GIST with a bag-of-features restricted to the same spatial grid as in GIST. Finally, we propose an indexing strategy for global descriptors that optimizes the trade-off between memory usage and precision. Our scheme provides a reasonable accuracy in some widespread application cases together with very high efficiency: In our experiments, querying an image database of 110 million images takes 0.18 second per image on a single machine. For common copyright attacks, this efficiency is obtained without noticeably sacrificing the search accuracy compared with state-of-the-art approaches.","author":["Matthijs Douze","Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou","Harsimrat Sandhawalia","Laurent Amsaleg","Cordelia Schmid"],"issue":["CIVR '09: Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Image and Video Retrieval","July 2009","Article No.: 19","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/1646396.1646421"],"date":"08 July 2009","ref":[{"text":"O.

We present in this paper a comparative study of PLASMA's performance against established linear algebra packages (LAPACK and ScaLAPACK), against new approaches at parallel execution (Task Based Linear Algebra Subroutines -- TBLAS), and against equivalent commercial software offerings (MKL, ESSL and PESSL). Our experiments were conducted on one-sided linear algebra factorizations (LU, QR and Cholesky) and used multi-core architectures (based on Intel Xeon EMT64 and IBM Power6). A performance improvement of 67% was for instance obtained on the Cholesky factorization of a matrix of order 4000, using 32 cores.","author":["Emmanuel Agullo","Bilel Hadri","Hatem Ltaief","Jack Dongarrra"],"issue":["SC '09: Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Computing Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2009","Article No.: 20","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/1654059.1654080"],"date":"14 November 2009","ref":[{"text":"H.

Recently, there are proposals aiming at better main-memory energy efficiency by dividing a memory rank into subsets. We holistically assess the effectiveness of rank subsetting in the context of system-wide performance, energy-efficiency, and reliability perspectives. We identify the impact of rank subsetting on memory power and processor performance analytically, then verify the analyses by simulating a chipmultiprocessor system using multithreaded and consolidated workloads. We extend the design of Multicore DIMM, one proposal embodying rank subsetting, for high-reliability systems and show that compared with conventional chipkill approaches, it can lead to much higher system-level energy efficiency and performance at the cost of additional DRAM devices.","author":["Jung Ho Ahn","Norman P.

However, for tightly-coupled modules, this solution incurs prohibitive context switch overhead. In this paper, we present a software approach to implementing fault isolation within a single address space.Our approach has two parts. First, we load the code and data for a distrusted module into its own fault do main, a logically separate portion of the application's address space. Second, we modify the object code of a distrusted module to prevent it from writing or jumping to an address outside its fault domain. Both these software operations are portable and programming language independent.Our approach poses a tradeoff relative to hardware fault isolation: substantially faster communication between fault domains, at a cost of slightly increased execution time for distrusted modules. We demonstrate that for frequently communicating modules, implementing fault isolation in software rather than hardware can substantially improve end-to-end application performance.","author":["Robert Wahbe","Steven Lucco","Thomas E.

As a potential contender for the next-generation memory technology of choice, the recently found \"the missing fourth circuit element\", memristor, has drawn a great deal of research interests. In this paper, we characterize the fundamental electrical properties of memristor devices by encapsulating them into a set of compact closed-form expressions. Our derivations provide valuable design insights and allow a deeper understanding of key design implications of memristor-based memories. In particular, we investigate the design of read and write circuits and analyze data integrity and noise-tolerance issues.","author":["Yenpo Ho","Garng M.

This boilerplate text typically is not related to the main content, may deteriorate search precision and thus needs to be detected properly. In this paper, we analyze a small set of shallow text features for classifying the individual text elements in a Web page. We compare the approach to complex, state-of-the-art techniques and show that competitive accuracy can be achieved, at almost no cost. Moreover, we derive a simple and plausible stochastic model for describing the boilerplate creation process. With the help of our model, we also quantify the impact of boilerplate removal to retrieval performance and show significant improvements over the baseline. Finally, we extend the principled approach by straight-forward heuristics, achieving a remarkable detection accuracy.","author":["Christian Kohlsch\u00fctter","Peter Fankhauser","Wolfgang Nejdl"],"issue":["WSDM '10: Proceedings of the third ACM international conference on Web search and data mining","February 2010","Pages   441\u2013450","https://doi.org/10.1145/1718487.1718542"],"date":"04 February 2010","ref":[{"text":"G.

For workloads that are amenable to partitioning, some argue that transactions should be executed serially on each partition without any concurrency at all. This strategy makes sense for a main memory database where there are no disk or user stalls, since the CPU can be fully utilized and the overhead of traditional concurrency control, such as two-phase locking, can be avoided. Unfortunately, many OLTP applications have some transactions which access multiple partitions. This introduces network stalls in order to coordinate distributed transactions, which will limit the performance of a database that does not allow concurrency. In this paper, we compare two low overhead concurrency control schemes that allow partitions to work on other transactions during network stalls, yet have little cost in the common case when concurrency is not needed. The first is a light-weight locking scheme, and the second is an even lighter-weight type of speculative concurrency control that avoids the overhead of tracking reads and writes, but sometimes performs work that eventually must be undone. We quantify the range of workloads over which each technique is beneficial, showing that speculative concurrency control generally outperforms locking as long as there are few aborts or few distributed transactions that involve multiple rounds of communication. On a modified TPC-C benchmark, speculative concurrency control can improve throughput relative to the other schemes by up to a factor of two.","author":["Evan P.C. Jones","Daniel J.

The nano-scale memristive device has the potential to construct some novel computing systems because of its distinctive characters, such as non-volatility, non-linearity, low-power, and good scalability. These electrical characteristics of memristors are mainly determined by the material characteristic and the fabrication process. For example, process variations may cause the deviation of the actual electrical behavior of memristors from the original design and result in the malfunction of the device. Therefore, it is very important to understand and characterize the impact of process variations on the electrical behaviors of the memristor and its implication to the circuit design. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the geometry variations on the electrical characteristics of the memristor. Two parameters - NARD (Normalized Accumulative Resistance Deviation) and NAARD (Normalized Accumulative Absolute Resistance Deviation), are introduced to measure the fluctuation of the overall internal state (or the resistance) of a memristor under the impact of process variations. Based on our analysis, Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted to evaluate the device mismatch effects in the memristor-based memory.","author":["Dimin Niu","Yiran Chen","Cong Xu","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["DAC '10: Proceedings of the 47th Design Automation Conference","June 2010","Pages   877\u2013882","https://doi.org/10.1145/1837274.1837495"],"date":"13 June 2010","ref":[{"text":"L.

Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to building recommender systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. With the advent of online social networks, the social network based approach to recommendation has emerged. This approach assumes a social network among users and makes recommendations for a user based on the ratings of the users that have direct or indirect social relations with the given user. As one of their major benefits, social network based approaches have been shown to reduce the problems with cold start users. In this paper, we explore a model-based approach for recommendation in social networks, employing matrix factorization techniques. Advancing previous work, we incorporate the mechanism of trust propagation into the model. Trust propagation has been shown to be a crucial phenomenon in the social sciences, in social network analysis and in trust-based recommendation. We have conducted experiments on two real life data sets, the public domain Epinions.com dataset and a much larger dataset that we have recently crawled from Flixster.com. Our experiments demonstrate that modeling trust propagation leads to a substantial increase in recommendation accuracy, in particular for cold start users.","author":["Mohsen Jamali","Martin Ester"],"issue":["RecSys '10: Proceedings of the fourth ACM conference on Recommender systems","September 2010","Pages   135\u2013142","https://doi.org/10.1145/1864708.1864736"],"date":"26 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"}}D.

Sora combines the performance and fidelity of hardware software-defined radio (SDR) platforms with the programmability and flexibility of general-purpose processor (GPP) SDR platforms. Sora uses both hardware and software techniques to address the challenges of using PC architectures for high-speed SDR. The Sora hardware components consist of a radio front-end for reception and transmission, and a radio control board for high-throughput, low-latency data transfer between radio and host memories. Sora makes extensive use of features of contemporary processor architectures to accelerate wireless protocol processing and satisfy protocol timing requirements, including using dedicated CPU cores, large low-latency caches to store lookup tables, and SIMD processor extensions for highly efficient physical layer processing on GPPs. Using the Sora platform, we have developed a few demonstration wireless systems, including SoftWiFi, an 802.11a/b/g implementation that seamlessly interoperates with commercial 802.11 NICs at all modulation rates, and SoftLTE, a 3GPP LTE uplink PHY implementation that supports up to 43.8Mbps data rate.","author":["Kun Tan","He Liu","Jiansong Zhang","Yongguang Zhang","Ji Fang","Geoffrey M.

Our focus is on universal codes in which the codeword length is a monotonically non-decreasing function of the uncompressed integer value; such codes are widely used for compressing \"small integers\". In contrast to traditional integer compression, our algorithms make use of the SIMD capabilities of modern processors by encoding multiple integer values at once. More specifically, we provide SIMD versions of both null suppression and Elias gamma encoding. Our experiments show that these versions provide a speedup from 1.5x up to 6.7x for decompression, while maintaining a similar compression performance.","author":["Benjamin Schlegel","Rainer Gemulla","Wolfgang Lehner"],"issue":["DaMoN '10: Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware","June 2010","Pages   34\u201340","https://doi.org/10.1145/1869389.1869394"],"date":"07 June 2010","ref":[{"text":"}}Abadi, D., Madden, S., and Ferreira, M.

Various stream ciphers are deployed in wireless telecommunication applications because they have simple hardware circuitry, are generally fast and consume very low power. On the other hand, scan-based Design-for-Test (DFT) is one of the most popular methods to test IC devices. All flip-flops in the Design Under Test are connected to one or more scan chains and the states of the flip-flops can be scanned out through these chains. In this paper, we present an attack on stream cipher implementations by determining the scan chain structure of the Linear Feedback Shift Registers in their implementations. Although scan-based DFT is a powerful testing scheme, we show that it can be used to retrieve the information stored in a crypto chip thus compromising its theoretically proven security.","author":["Yu Liu","Kaijie Wu","Ramesh Karri"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 16","Issue 2","March 2011","Article No.: 20","pp   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/1929943.1929952"],"date":"07 April 2011","ref":[{"text":"Berbain, C., Billet, O., Canteaut, A., Courtois, N., Debraize, B., Gilbert, H., Goubin, L., Gouget, A., Granboulan, L., Lauradoux, C., Minier, M., Pornin, T., and Sibert, H.

In our approach we do not rely on an external example database or use the whole input image as a source for example patches. Instead, we follow a local self-similarity assumption on natural images and extract patches from extremely localized regions in the input image. This allows us to reduce considerably the nearest-patch search time without compromising quality in most images. Tests, that we perform and report, show that the local self-similarity assumption holds better for small scaling factors where there are more example patches of greater relevance. We implement these small scalings using dedicated novel nondyadic filter banks, that we derive based on principles that model the upscaling process. Moreover, the new filters are nearly biorthogonal and hence produce high-resolution images that are highly consistent with the input image without solving implicit back-projection equations. The local and explicit nature of our algorithm makes it simple, efficient, and allows a trivial parallel implementation on a GPU. We demonstrate the new method ability to produce high-quality resolution enhancement, its application to video sequences with no algorithmic modification, and its efficiency to perform real-time enhancement of low-resolution video standard into recent high-definition formats.","author":["Gilad Freedman","Raanan Fattal"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 30","Issue 2","April 2011","Article No.: 12","pp   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/1944846.1944852"],"date":"22 April 2011","ref":[{"text":"Aly, H. and Dubois, E. 2005.

However, the slow speed of persistent storage (i.e., disk) has restricted their design and limited their performance. Fast, byte-addressable, non-volatile technologies, such as phase change memory, will remove this constraint and allow programmers to build high-performance, persistent data structures in non-volatile storage that is almost as fast as DRAM. Creating these data structures requires a system that is lightweight enough to expose the performance of the underlying memories but also ensures safety in the presence of application and system failures by avoiding familiar bugs such as dangling pointers, multiple free()s, and locking errors. In addition, the system must prevent new types of hard-to-find pointer safety bugs that only arise with persistent objects. These bugs are especially dangerous since any corruption they cause will be permanent.We have implemented a lightweight, high-performance persistent object system called NV-heaps that provides transactional semantics while preventing these errors and providing a model for persistence that is easy to use and reason about. We implement search trees, hash tables, sparse graphs, and arrays using NV-heaps, BerkeleyDB, and Stasis. Our results show that NV-heap performance scales with thread count and that data structures implemented using NV-heaps out-perform BerkeleyDB and Stasis implementations by 32x and 244x, respectively, by avoiding the operating system and minimizing other software overheads. We also quantify the cost of enforcing the safety guarantees that NV-heaps provide and measure the costs of NV-heap primitive operations.","author":["Joel Coburn","Adrian M.

After one century of development, craniofacial superimposition has become an interdisciplinary research field where computer sciences have acquired a key role as a complement of forensic sciences. Moreover, the availability of new digital equipment (such as computers and 3D scanners) has resulted in a significant advance in the applicability of this forensic identification technique. The purpose of this contribution is twofold. On the one hand, we aim to clearly define the different stages involved in the computer-aided craniofacial superimposition process. Besides, we aim to clarify the role played by computers in the methods considered.In order to accomplish these objectives, an up-to-date review of the recent works is presented along with a discussion of advantages and drawbacks of the existing approaches, with an emphasis on the automatic ones. Future case studies will be easily categorized by identifying which stage is tackled and which kind of computer-aided approach is chosen to face the identification problem. Remaining challenges are indicated and some directions for future research are given.","author":["Sergio Damas","Oscar Cord\u00f3n","Oscar Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez","Jose Santamar\u00eda","Inmaculada Alem\u00e1n","Miguel Botella","Fernando Navarro"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 43","Issue 4","October 2011","Article No.: 27","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/1978802.1978806"],"date":"18 October 2011","ref":[{"text":"Al-Amad, S., McCullough, M., Graham, J., Clement, J., and Hill, A. 2006.

Processing such queries requires human input for providing information that is missing from the database, for performing computationally difficult functions, and for matching, ranking, or aggregating results based on fuzzy criteria. CrowdDB uses human input via crowdsourcing to process queries that neither database systems nor search engines can adequately answer. It uses SQL both as a language for posing complex queries and as a way to model data. While CrowdDB leverages many aspects of traditional database systems, there are also important differences. Conceptually, a major change is that the traditional closed-world assumption for query processing does not hold for human input. From an implementation perspective, human-oriented query operators are needed to solicit, integrate and cleanse crowdsourced data. Furthermore, performance and cost depend on a number of new factors including worker affinity, training, fatigue, motivation and location. We describe the design of CrowdDB, report on an initial set of experiments using Amazon Mechanical Turk, and outline important avenues for future work in the development of crowdsourced query processing systems.","author":["Michael J.

MapReduce is a popular programming model for processing large datasets using a cluster of machines. However, the traditional MapReduce model is not well-suited for one-pass analytics, since it is geared towards batch processing and requires the data set to be fully loaded into the cluster before running analytical queries. This paper examines, from a systems standpoint, what architectural design changes are necessary to bring the benefits of the MapReduce model to incremental one-pass analytics. Our empirical and theoretical analyses of Hadoop-based MapReduce systems show that the widely-used sort-merge implementation for partitioning and parallel processing poses a fundamental barrier to incremental one-pass analytics, despite various optimizations. To address these limitations, we propose a new data analysis platform that employs hash techniques to enable fast in-memory processing, and a new frequent key based technique to extend such processing to workloads that require a large key-state space. Evaluation of our Hadoop-based prototype using real-world workloads shows that our new platform significantly improves the progress of map tasks, allows the reduce progress to keep up with the map progress, with up to 3 orders of magnitude reduction of internal data spills, and enables results to be returned continuously during the job.","author":["Boduo Li","Edward Mazur","Yanlei Diao","Andrew McGregor","Prashant Shenoy"],"issue":["SIGMOD '11: Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data","June 2011","Pages   985\u2013996","https://doi.org/10.1145/1989323.1989426"],"date":"12 June 2011","ref":[{"text":"D.

In preparation for systems containing tens or hundreds of accelerators, we characterize a diverse pool of accelerators and find each contains significant amounts of SRAM memory (up to 90% of their area). We take advantage of this discovery and introduce the accelerator store, a scalable architectural component to minimize accelerator area by sharing its memories between accelerators. We evaluate the accelerator store for two applications and find significant system area reductions (30%) in exchange for small overheads (2% performance, 0%--8% energy).

Nanomagnet Logic (NML) is one such alternative. NML operates at room temperature, it has the potential for low power consumption, and it is CMOS compatible. In this aricle, we present an NML programmable logic array (PLA) based on a previously proposed reprogrammable quantum-dot cellular automata PLA design. We also discuss the fabrication and simulation validation of the circuit structures unique to the NML PLA, present area, energy, and delay estimates for the NML PLA, compare the area of NML PLAs to other reprogrammable nanotechnologies, and analyze how architectural-level redundancy will affect performance and defect tolerance in NML PLAs. We will use results from this study to shape a concluding discussion about, which architectures appear to be most suitable for NML.","author":["Michael Crocker","Michael Niemier","X.

Given the constant chip-level power budgets, this exponentially decreases the percentage of transistors that can switch at full frequency with each technology generation. Hence, while the transistor budget continues to increase exponentially, the power budget has become the dominant limiting factor in processor design. In this regime, utilizing transistors to design specialized cores that optimize energy-per-computation becomes an effective approach to improve system performance. To trade transistors for energy efficiency in a scalable manner, we propose Quasi-specific Cores, or QsCores, specialized processors capable of executing multiple general-purpose computations while providing an order of magnitude more energy efficiency than a general-purpose processor. The QsCores design flow is based on the insight that similar code patterns exist within and across applications. Our approach exploits these similar code patterns to ensure that a small set of specialized cores support a large number of commonly used computations. We evaluate QsCores's ability to target both a single application library (e.g., data structures) as well as a diverse workload consisting of applications selected from different domains (e.g., SPECINT, EEMBC, and Vision). Our results show that QsCores can provide 18.4 x better energy efficiency than general-purpose processors while reducing the amount of specialized logic required to support the workload by up to 66%.","author":["Ganesh Venkatesh","Jack Sampson","Nathan Goulding-Hotta","Sravanthi Kota Venkata","Michael Bedford Taylor","Steven Swanson"],"issue":["MICRO-44: Proceedings of the 44th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2011","Pages   163\u2013174","https://doi.org/10.1145/2155620.2155640"],"date":"03 December 2011","ref":[{"text":"U.

Our algorithm starts by finding, embedding, and aligning uniquely realizable subsets of neighboring sensors called patches. In the noise-free case, each patch agrees with its global positioning up to an unknown rigid motion of translation, rotation, and possibly reflection. The reflections and rotations are estimated using the recently developed eigenvector synchronization algorithm, while the translations are estimated by solving an overdetermined linear system. The algorithm is scalable as the number of nodes increases and can be implemented in a distributed fashion. Extensive numerical experiments show that it compares favorably to other existing algorithms in terms of robustness to noise, sparse connectivity, and running time. While our approach is applicable to higher dimensions, in the current article, we focus on the two-dimensional case.","author":["Mihai Cucuringu","Yaron Lipman","Amit Singer"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks","Volume 8","Issue 3","July 2012","Article No.: 19","pp   1\u201342","https://doi.org/10.1145/2240092.2240093"],"date":"02 August 2012","ref":[{"text":"Anderson, B.

In the most common usage model, parallel code sections are offloaded to the MIC coprocessor using LEO (Language Extensions for Offload). The developer is responsible for identifying and specifying offloadable code regions, managing data transfers between the CPU and MIC and optimizing the application for performance, which requires some amount of effort and experimentation. In this paper, we present Apricot, an optimizing compiler and productivity tool for x86-compatible many-core coprocessors (such as Intel MIC) that minimizes developer effort by (i) automatically inserting LEO clauses for parallelizable code regions, (ii) selectively offloading some of the code regions to the coprocessor at runtime based on a cost model that we have developed, (iii) applying a set ofoptimizations for minimizing the data communication overhead and improving overall performance. Apricot is intended to assist programmers in porting existing multi-core applications and writing new ones to take advantage of the many-core coprocessor, while maximizing overall performance. Experiments with SpecOMP and NAS Parallel benchmarks show that Apricot can successfully transform OpenMP applications to run on the MIC coprocessor with good performance gains.","author":["Nishkam Ravi","Yi Yang","Tao Bao","Srimat Chakradhar"],"issue":["ICS '12: Proceedings of the 26th ACM international conference on Supercomputing","June 2012","Pages   47\u201358","https://doi.org/10.1145/2304576.2304585"],"date":"25 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"Automatic parallelization with intel compilers. http://software.intel.com/file/39655.","order":1},{"text":"C++ accelerated massive parallelism. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh265137.","order":2},{"text":"Gnu compiler collection. http://gcc.gnu.org.","order":3},{"text":"Gnu gprof. http://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/gprof.","order":4},{"text":"Intel c++ compiler. http://www.intel.com/Compilers.","order":5},{"text":"Nas parallel benchmarks. http://nas.nasa.gov/Software/NPB.","order":6},{"text":"Openacc: Directives for accelerators. http://www.openacc-standard.org/.","order":7},{"text":"Opencl. http://www.khronos.org/opencl.","order":8},{"text":"The openmp api. http://www.openmp.org.","order":9},{"text":"R-stream compiler. https://www.reservoir.com/rstream.","order":10},{"text":"Spec openmp benchmark suite. http://www.spec.org/omp2001.","order":11},{"text":"M.

Multi-level cell (MLC) ReRAM, which can store multiple bits in a single ReRAM cell, can further improve density and reduce cost-per-bit, and therefore has recently been investigated extensively. However, the majority of the prior studies on MLC ReRAM are at the device level. The design implications for MLC ReRAM at the circuit and system levels remain to be explored. This paper aim to provide the first comprehensive investigation of the design trade-offs involved in MLC ReRAM. Our study indicates that different resistance allocation schemes, programming strategies, peripheral designs, and material selections profoundly affect the area, latency, power, and reliability of MLC ReRAM. Based on this analysis, we conduct two case studies: first we compare MLC ReRAM design against MLC phase-change memory (PCM) and multi-layer cross-point ReRAM design, and point out why multi-level ReRAM is appealing; second we further explore the design space for MLC ReRAM.","author":["Cong Xu","Dimin Niu","Naveen Muralimanohar","Norman P.

In this article, we investigate the use of multilevel spin-transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM) cells in the design of processor caches. We start with examining the access (read and write) scheme for multilevel cell (MLC) STT-RAM from a circuit design perspective, detailing the read and write circuits. Compared to traditional SRAM caches, a multilevel cell (MLC) STT-RAM cache design is denser, fast, and requires less energy. However, a number of critical architecture-level issues remain to be solved before MLC STT-RAM technology can be deployed in processor caches. We shall offer solutions to the issue of bit encoding as well as tackle the write endurance problem. In particular, the latter has been neglected in previous works on STT-RAM caches. We propose a set remapping scheme that can potentially prolong the lifetime of a MLC STT-RAM cache by 80\u00d7 on average. Furthermore, a method for recovering the performance that may be lost in some applications due to set remapping is proposed. The impacts of process variations of the MLC STT-RAM cell on the robustness of the memory hierarchy is also discussed, together with various enhancement techniques, namely, ECC and design redundancy.","author":["Yiran Chen","Weng-Fai Wong","Hai Li","Cheng-Kok Koh","Yaojun Zhang","Wujie Wen"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 9","Issue 2","May 2013","Article No.: 16","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/2463585.2463592"],"date":"29 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"Baek, I., Kim, D., et al. 2005.

This paper offers an analysis of Amazon Mechanical Turk, a popular human computation system, as a site of technically mediated worker-employer relations. We argue that human computation currently relies on worker invisibility. We then present Turkopticon, an activist system that allows workers to publicize and evaluate their relationships with employers. As a common infrastructure, Turkopticon also enables workers to engage one another in mutual aid. We conclude by discussing the potentials and challenges of sustaining activist technologies that intervene in large, existing socio-technical systems.","author":["Lilly C. Irani","M.

This paper describes the design, implementation, and performance of Petal, a system that attempts to approximate this ideal in practice through a novel combination of features. Petal consists of a collection of network-connected servers that cooperatively manage a pool of physical disks. To a Petal client, this collection appears as a highly available block-level storage system that provides large abstract containers called virtual disks. A virtual disk is globally accessible to all Petal clients on the network. A client can create a virtual disk on demand to tap the entire capacity and performance of the underlying physical resources. Furthermore, additional resources, such as servers and disks, can be automatically incorporated into Petal.We have an initial Petal prototype consisting of four 225 MHz DEC 3000/700 workstations running Digital Unix and connected by a 155 Mbit/s ATM network. The prototype provides clients with virtual disks that tolerate and recover from disk, server, and network failures. Latency is comparable to a locally attached disk, and throughput scales with the number of servers. The prototype can achieve I/O rates of up to 3150 requests/sec and bandwidth up to 43.1 Mbytes/sec.","author":["Edward K. Lee","Chandramohan A.

However, SIMD control flow divergence effects can result in reduced execution efficiency in a class of GPGPU applications, classified as divergent applications. Improving SIMD efficiency, therefore, has the potential to bring significant performance and energy benefits to a wide range of such data parallel applications. Recently, the SIMD divergence problem has received increased attention, and several micro-architectural techniques have been proposed to address various aspects of this problem. However, these techniques are often quite complex and, therefore, unlikely candidates for practical implementation. In this paper, we propose two micro-architectural optimizations for GPGPU architectures, which utilize relatively simple execution cycle compression techniques when certain groups of turned-off lanes exist in the instruction stream. We refer to these optimizations as basic cycle compression (BCC) and swizzled-cycle compression (SCC), respectively. In this paper, we will outline the additional requirements for implementing these optimizations in the context of the studied GPGPU architecture. Our evaluations with divergent SIMD workloads from OpenCL (GPGPU) and OpenGL (graphics) applications show that BCC and SCC reduce execution cycles in divergent applications by as much as 42% (20% on average). For a subset of divergent workloads, the execution time is reduced by an average of 7% for today's GPUs or by 18% for future GPUs with a better provisioned memory subsystem. The key contribution of our work is in simplifying the micro-architecture for delivering divergence optimizations while providing the bulk of the benefits of more complex approaches.","author":["Aniruddha S.

A read-disturb error, which causes data loss, occurs to data in a page when a large number of reads are performed to its neighboring pages in the same block. In this paper, we propose a novel read-disturb management technique which reduces the frequency of expensive data migrations needed for avoiding read-disturb errors. Our technique proactively converts highly skewed read accesses to a small number of blocks into more balanced read accesses to a large number of blocks by intelligently changing data block locations accessed. Our experimental results show that our technique is effective in handling the read-disturb problem, reducing the time overhead of data migrations on average by 50% over an FTL based on the existing read-disturb management technique.","author":["Keonsoo Ha","Jaeyong Jeong","Jihong Kim"],"issue":["APSys '13: Proceedings of the 4th Asia-Pacific Workshop on Systems","July 2013","Article No.: 13","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2500727.2500743"],"date":"29 July 2013","ref":[{"text":"http://iotta.snia.org/traces/158.","order":1},{"text":"http://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Storage/Storage.","order":2},{"text":"A.

A thorough comparison of different algorithms (a total of fourteen) is provided. In addition to community-level evaluation, we propose a framework for evaluating algorithms' ability to detect overlapping nodes, which helps to assess overdetection and underdetection. After considering community-level detection performance measured by normalized mutual information, the Omega index, and node-level detection performance measured by F-score, we reached the following conclusions. For low overlapping density networks, SLPA, OSLOM, Game, and COPRA offer better performance than the other tested algorithms. For networks with high overlapping density and high overlapping diversity, both SLPA and Game provide relatively stable performance. However, test results also suggest that the detection in such networks is still not yet fully resolved. A common feature observed by various algorithms in real-world networks is the relatively small fraction of overlapping nodes (typically less than 30%), each of which belongs to only 2 or 3 communities.","author":["Jierui Xie","Stephen Kelley","Boleslaw K.

OpenCL was designed with the goal of guaranteeing program portability across hardware from different vendors. However, achieving good performance is hard, requiring manual tuning of the program and expert knowledge of each target device. In this paper we consider a data parallel compiler transformation --- thread-coarsening --- and evaluate its effects across a range of devices by developing a source-to-source OpenCL compiler based on LLVM. We thoroughly evaluate this transformation on 17 benchmarks and five platforms with different coarsening parameters giving over 43,000 different experiments. We achieve speedups over 9x on individual applications and average speedups ranging from 1.15x on the Nvidia Kepler GPU to 1.50x on the AMD Cypress GPU. Finally, we use statistical regression to analyse and explain program performance in terms of hardware-based performance counters.","author":["Alberto Magni","Christophe Dubach","Michael F. P.

Moreover, pFabric delivers this performance with a very simple design that is based on a key conceptual insight: datacenter transport should decouple flow scheduling from rate control. For flow scheduling, packets carry a single priority number set independently by each flow; switches have very small buffers and implement a very simple priority-based scheduling/dropping mechanism. Rate control is also correspondingly simpler; flows start at line rate and throttle back only under high and persistent packet loss. We provide theoretical intuition and show via extensive simulations that the combination of these two simple mechanisms is sufficient to provide near-optimal performance.","author":["Mohammad Alizadeh","Shuang Yang","Milad Sharif","Sachin Katti","Nick McKeown","Balaji Prabhakar","Scott Shenker"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 43","Issue 4","October 2013","pp   435\u2013446","https://doi.org/10.1145/2534169.2486031"],"date":"27 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"M.

To address these challenges, we present SoftCell, a scalable architecture that supports fine-grained policies for mobile devices in cellular core networks, using commodity switches and servers. SoftCell enables operators to realize high-level service policies that direct traffic through sequences of middleboxes based on subscriber attributes and applications. To minimize the size of the forwarding tables, SoftCell aggregates traffic along multiple dimensions---the service policy, the base station, and the mobile device---at different switches in the network. Since most traffic originates from mobile devices, SoftCell performs fine-grained packet classification at the access switches, next to the base stations, where software switches can easily handle the state and bandwidth requirements. SoftCell guarantees that packets belonging to the same connection traverse the same sequence of middleboxes in both directions, even in the presence of mobility. We demonstrate that SoftCell improves the scalability and flexibility of cellular core networks by analyzing real LTE workloads, performing micro-benchmarks on our prototype controller as well as large-scale simulations.","author":["Xin Jin","Li Erran Li","Laurent Vanbever","Jennifer Rexford"],"issue":["CoNEXT '13: Proceedings of the ninth ACM conference on Emerging networking experiments and technologies","December 2013","Pages   163\u2013174","https://doi.org/10.1145/2535372.2535377"],"date":"09 December 2013","ref":[{"text":"M.

Nonetheless, there are not many resources especially designed for children on the Internet and most of the content online is designed for grown-up users. This situation is problematic if we consider the large differences between young users and adults since their topic interests, computer skills, and language capabilities evolve rapidly during childhood. There is little research aimed at exploring and measuring the difficulties that children encounter on the Internet when searching for information and browsing for content. In the first part of this work, we employed query logs from a commercial search engine to quantify the difficulties children of different ages encounter on the Internet and to characterize the topics that they search for. We employed query metrics (e.g., the fraction of queries posed in natural language), session metrics (e.g., the fraction of abandoned sessions), and click activity (e.g., the fraction of ad clicks). The search logs were also used to retrace stages of child development. Concretely, we looked for changes in interests (e.g., the distribution of topics searched) and language development (e.g., the readability of the content accessed and the vocabulary size).In the second part of this work, we employed toolbar logs from a commercial search engine to characterize the browsing behavior of young users, particularly to understand the activities on the Internet that trigger search. We quantified the proportion of browsing and search activity in the toolbar sessions and we estimated the likelihood of a user to carry out search on the Web vertical and multimedia verticals (i.e., videos and images) given that the previous event is another search event or a browsing event.We observed that these metrics clearly demonstrate an increased level of confusion and unsuccessful search sessions among children. We also found a clear relation between the reading level of the clicked pages and characteristics of the users such as age and educational attainment.In terms of browsing behavior, children were found to start their activities on the Internet with a search engine (instead of directly browsing content) more often than adults. We also observed a significantly larger amount of browsing activity for the case of teenager users. Interestingly we also found that if children visit knowledge-related Web sites (i.e., information-dense pages such as Wikipedia articles), they subsequently do more Web searches than adults. Additionally, children and especially teenagers were found to have a greater tendency to engage in multimedia search, which calls to improve the aggregation of multimedia results into the current search result pages.","author":["Sergio Duarte Torres","Ingmar Weber","Djoerd Hiemstra"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on the Web","Volume 8","Issue 2","March 2014","Article No.: 7","pp   1\u201354","https://doi.org/10.1145/2555595"],"date":"01 March 2014","ref":[{"text":"An, S. and Stern, S. 2011.

This tutorial aims to cover all facets of semantic search from a unified point of view and connect real-world applications with results from scientific publications. We provide a comprehensive overview of entity linking and retrieval in the context of semantic search and thoroughly explore techniques for query understanding, entity-based retrieval and ranking on unstructured text, structured knowledge repositories, and a mixture of these.

Handovers serve as the foundation of many human-robot tasks. Fluent, legible handover interactions require appropriate nonverbal cues to signal handover intent, location and timing. Inspired by observations of human-human handovers, we implemented gaze behaviors on a PR2 humanoid robot. The robot handed over water bottles to a total of 102 na\u00efve subjects while varying its gaze behaviour: no gaze, gaze designed to elicit shared attention at the handover location, and the shared attention gaze complemented with a turn-taking cue. We compared subject perception of and reaction time to the robot-initiated handovers across the three gaze conditions. Results indicate that subjects reach for the offered object significantly earlier when a robot provides a shared attention gaze cue during a handover. We also observed a statistical trend of subjects preferring handovers with turn-taking gaze cues over the other conditions. Our work demonstrates that gaze can play a key role in improving user experience of human-robot handovers, and help make handovers fast and fluent.","author":["AJung Moon","Daniel M.

To answer a national language question, the existing work takes a two-stage approach: question understanding and query evaluation. Their focus is on question understanding to deal with the disambiguation of the natural language phrases. The most common technique is the joint disambiguation, which has the exponential search space. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to answer natural language questions over RDF repository (RDF Q/A) from a graph data-driven perspective. We propose a semantic query graph to model the query intention in the natural language question in a structural way, based on which, RDF Q/A is reduced to subgraph matching problem. More importantly, we resolve the ambiguity of natural language questions at the time when matches of query are found. The cost of disambiguation is saved if there are no matching found. We compare our method with some state-of-the-art RDF Q/A systems in the benchmark dataset. Extensive experiments confirm that our method not only improves the precision but also speeds up query performance greatly.","author":["Lei Zou","Ruizhe Huang","Haixun Wang","Jeffrey Xu Yu","Wenqiang He","Dongyan Zhao"],"issue":["SIGMOD '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","June 2014","Pages   313\u2013324","https://doi.org/10.1145/2588555.2610525"],"date":"18 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"Natural language question answering over rdf.

Many of these applications employ iterative methods for solution-finding, wherein a sequence of improving approximate solutions are generated before reaching the final converged solution. In this work, we propose ApproxIt, a novel approximate computing framework for iterative methods with quality guarantees. To be specific, we present a lightweight quality estimator that is able to capture the solution quality of each iteration and use it to guide the selection of approximate computing mode in the next iteration. With the proposed dynamic effort scaling technique, ApproxIt is able to dramatically improve application energy efficiency under quality guarantees, as demonstrated in our experimental results.","author":["Qian Zhang","Feng Yuan","Rong Ye","Qiang Xu"],"issue":["DAC '14: Proceedings of the 51st Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2014","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2593069.2593092"],"date":"01 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"J.

However, as each cell starts to store two or more bits, a threshold voltage range employed to represent a state has to be continuously shrunk, and a narrowed threshold voltage range causes more bit errors. An ad-hoc solution to this problem is to apply an enhanced ECC (error correction code) scheme. Still, a comprehensive understanding of the impact of threshold voltage on MLC flash performance and reliability is an open question. In this paper, we first empirically measure the correlations between threshold voltage and program/erase (P/E) performance as well as reliability. After analyzing experimental results, we make several interesting observations: 1) a memory cell programmed to a lower threshold voltage has a faster programming speed (up to 31%) as well as a fewer number of bit errors; 2) the programming time of an MSB page is about 2 to 3 times shorter than that of an LSB page; 3) erase performance is highly correlated to threshold voltage. These new findings provide system implications for the development of a better SSD. Further, to demonstrate how these findings can be leveraged to enhance MLC flash, we propose an approach called threshold voltage reduction (TVR), which increases programming speed and longevity by 50% and 7.1%, respectively. Finally, we conduct a study on TVR-powered SSDs. Simulation results show that overall mean response time can be reduced by up to 35%.","author":["Wei Wang","Tao Xie","Deng Zhou"],"issue":["ICS '14: Proceedings of the 28th ACM international conference on Supercomputing","June 2014","Pages   201\u2013210","https://doi.org/10.1145/2597652.2597681"],"date":"10 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"N.

In conventional research on acoustic levitation, small objects are trapped in the acoustic beams of standing waves. We expand this method by changing the distribution of the acoustic-potential field (APF). Using this technique, we can generate the graphics using levitated small objects. Our approach makes available many expressions, such as the expression by materials and non-digital appearance. These kinds of expressions are used in many applications, and we aim to combine them with digital controllability. In the current system, multiple particles are levitated together at 4.25-mm intervals. The spatial resolution of the position is 0.5 mm. Particles move at up to 72 cm/s. The allowable density of the material can be up to 7 g/cm3. For this study, we use three options of APF: 2D grid, high-speed movement, and combination with motion capture. These are used to realize floating screen or mid-air raster graphics, mid-air vector graphics, and interaction with levitated objects. This paper reports the details of the acoustic-potential field generator on the design, control, performance evaluation, and exploration of the application space. To discuss the various noncontact manipulation technologies in a unified manner, we introduce a concept called \"computational potential field\" (CPF).","author":["Yoichi Ochiai","Takayuki Hoshi","Jun Rekimoto"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 33","Issue 4","July 2014","Article No.: 85","pp   1\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/2601097.2601118"],"date":"27 July 2014","ref":[{"text":"Barnum, P.

Recently, researchers have studied the multi-modal hashing to meet the need of similarity search across different types of media. However, most of the existing methods are applied to search across multi-views among which explicit bridge information is provided. Given a heterogeneous media search task, we observe that abundant multi-view data can be found on the Web which can serve as an auxiliary bridge. In this paper, we propose a Heterogeneous Translated Hashing (HTH) method with such auxiliary bridge incorporated not only to improve current multi-view search but also to enable similarity search across heterogeneous media which have no direct correspondence. HTH simultaneously learns hash functions embedding heterogeneous media into different Hamming spaces, and translators aligning these spaces. Unlike almost all existing methods that map heterogeneous data in a common Hamming space, mapping to different spaces provides more flexible and discriminative ability. We empirically verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm on two real world large datasets, one publicly available dataset of Flickr and the other MIRFLICKR-Yahoo Answers dataset.","author":["Ying Wei","Yangqiu Song","Yi Zhen","Bo Liu","Qiang Yang"],"issue":["KDD '14: Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2014","Pages   791\u2013800","https://doi.org/10.1145/2623330.2623688"],"date":"24 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, racetrack memory accesses require frequent magnetic domain shifting, introducing overheads in access latency and energy consumption. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several different physical layout strategies and array organizations. From this evaluation, a workload-oriented racetrack LLC architecture is proposed that combines different array types, each of which is tailored to a specific data access pattern. Further, a resizable cache access strategy is applied to reduce shifting overheads at runtime. Our simulation results show that compared with the leading racetrack-based cache, the proposed racetrack LLC can improve system performance by 13.2% reduce LLC energy consumption by 30.4%.","author":["Zhenyu Sun","Xiuyuan Bi","Alex K.

We show how to instantiate this framework for Sequential Consistency (SC), Total Store Order (TSO), C++ restricted to release-acquire atomics, and Power. For Power, we compare our model to a preceding operational model in which we found a flaw. To do so, we define an operational model that we show equivalent to our axiomatic model.We also propose a model for ARM. Our testing on this architecture revealed a behaviour later acknowledged as a bug by ARM, and more recently, 31 additional anomalies.We offer a new simulation tool, called herd, which allows the user to specify the model of his choice in a concise way. Given a specification of a model, the tool becomes a simulator for that model. The tool relies on an axiomatic description; this choice allows us to outperform all previous simulation tools. Additionally, we confirm that verification time is vastly improved, in the case of bounded model checking.Finally, we put our models in perspective, in the light of empirical data obtained by analysing the C and C++ code of a Debian Linux distribution. We present our new analysis tool, called mole, which explores a piece of code to find the weak memory idioms that it uses.","author":["Jade Alglave","Luc Maranget","Michael Tautschnig"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems","Volume 36","Issue 2","July 2014","Article No.: 7","pp   1\u201374","https://doi.org/10.1145/2627752"],"date":"01 July 2014","ref":[{"text":"Parosh Aziz Abdulla, Mohamed Faouzi Atig, Yu-Fang Chen, Carl Leonardsson, and Ahmed Rezine. 2012.

At the same time, a small set of machine-learning algorithms (especially Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks, i.e., CNNs and DNNs) are proving to be state-of-the-art across many applications. As architectures evolve towards heterogeneous multi-cores composed of a mix of cores and accelerators, a machine-learning accelerator can achieve the rare combination of efficiency (due to the small number of target algorithms) and broad application scope.Until now, most machine-learning accelerator designs have focused on efficiently implementing the computational part of the algorithms. However, recent state-of-the-art CNNs and DNNs are characterized by their large size. In this study, we design an accelerator for large-scale CNNs and DNNs, with a special emphasis on the impact of memory on accelerator design, performance and energy.We show that it is possible to design an accelerator with a high throughput, capable of performing 452 GOP/s (key NN operations such as synaptic weight multiplications and neurons outputs additions) in a small footprint of 3.02 mm2 and 485 mW; compared to a 128-bit 2GHz SIMD processor, the accelerator is 117.87x faster, and it can reduce the total energy by 21.08x. The accelerator characteristics are obtained after layout at 65 nm. Such a high throughput in a small footprint can open up the usage of state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms in a broad set of systems and for a broad set of applications.","author":["Tianshi Chen","Zidong Du","Ninghui Sun","Jia Wang","Chengyong Wu","Yunji Chen","Olivier Temam"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 49","Issue 4","April 2014","pp   269\u2013284","https://doi.org/10.1145/2644865.2541967"],"date":"24 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"R.

With shrinking device sizes, the total circuit sensitivity to both permanent and transient faults has increased significantly. Research for fault tolerant processors has primarily focused on the conventional processor architectures. Neural network computing has been employed to solve a wide range of problems. This paper presents a design and implementation of a physical neural network that is resilient to permanent hardware faults. To achieve scalability, it uses tiled neuron clusters where neuron outputs are efficiently forwarded to the target neurons using source based spanning tree routing. To achieve fault resilience in the face of increasing number of permanent hardware failures, the design pro-actively preserves neural network computing performance by selectively replicating performance critical neurons. Furthermore, the paper presents a spanning tree recovery solution that mitigates disruption to distribution of neuron outputs caused by failed neuron clusters. The proposed neuron cluster design is implemented in Verilog. We studied the fault resilience performance of the described design using a RBM neural network trained for classifying handwritten digit images. Results demonstrate that our approach can achieve improved fault resilience performance by replicating only 5% most important neurons.","author":["Weidong Shi","Yuanfeng Wen","Ziyi Liu","Xi Zhao","Dainis Boumber","Ricardo Vilalta","Lei Xu"],"issue":["CASES '14: Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Compilers, Architecture and Synthesis for Embedded Systems","October 2014","Article No.: 24","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2656106.2656126"],"date":"12 October 2014","ref":[{"text":"A.

A key problem in the context of web search queries is that this process needs to run under severe time constraints as it has to be performed before any actual retrieval takes place, typically within milliseconds. In this paper we propose a probabilistic model that leverages user-generated information on the web to link queries to entities in a knowledge base. There are three key ingredients that make the algorithm fast and space-efficient. First, the linking process ignores any dependencies between the different entity candidates, which allows for a O(k2) implementation in the number of query terms. Second, we leverage hashing and compression techniques to reduce the memory footprint. Finally, to equip the algorithm with contextual knowledge without sacrificing speed, we factor the distance between distributional semantics of the query words and entities into the model. We show that our solution significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines by more than 14% while being able to process queries in sub-millisecond times---at least two orders of magnitude faster than existing systems.","author":["Roi Blanco","Giuseppe Ottaviano","Edgar Meij"],"issue":["WSDM '15: Proceedings of the Eighth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2015","Pages   179\u2013188","https://doi.org/10.1145/2684822.2685317"],"date":"02 February 2015","ref":[{"text":"E.

Although general-purpose CPUs and GPUs have provided straightforward solutions, their energy-efficiencies are limited due to their excessive supports for flexibility. Hardware accelerators may achieve better energy-efficiencies, but each accelerator often accommodates only a single ML technique (family). According to the famous No-Free-Lunch theorem in the ML domain, however, an ML technique performs well on a dataset may perform poorly on another dataset, which implies that such accelerator may sometimes lead to poor learning accuracy. Even if regardless of the learning accuracy, such accelerator can still become inapplicable simply because the concrete ML task is altered, or the user chooses another ML technique. In this study, we present an ML accelerator called PuDianNao, which accommodates seven representative ML techniques, including k-means, k-nearest neighbors, naive bayes, support vector machine, linear regression, classification tree, and deep neural network. Benefited from our thorough analysis on computational primitives and locality properties of different ML techniques, PuDianNao can perform up to 1056 GOP/s (e.g., additions and multiplications) in an area of 3.51 mm^2, and consumes 596 mW only. Compared with the NVIDIA K20M GPU (28nm process), PuDianNao (65nm process) is 1.20x faster, and can reduce the energy by 128.41x.","author":["Daofu Liu","Tianshi Chen","Shaoli Liu","Jinhong Zhou","Shengyuan Zhou","Olivier Teman","Xiaobing Feng","Xuehai Zhou","Yunji Chen"],"issue":["ASPLOS '15: Proceedings of the Twentieth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2015","Pages   369\u2013381","https://doi.org/10.1145/2694344.2694358"],"date":"14 March 2015","ref":[{"text":"UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/. {Online; accessed 31-July-2014}.","order":1},{"text":"Naomi S Altman.

To consolidate various hardware resources in an elastic, programmable and reconfigurable manner, we design and build a flexible and consolidated framework, OpenANFV, to support virtualized accelerators for MBs in the cloud environment. OpenANFV is seamlessly and efficiently put into Openstack to provide high performance on top of commodity hardware to cope with various virtual function requirements. OpenANFV works as an independent component to manage and virtualize the acceleration resources (e.g. cinder manages block storage resources and nova manages computing resources). Specially, OpenANFV mainly has the following three features. (1)Automated Management. Provisioning for multiple Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) is automated to meet the dynamic requirements of NFV environment. Such automation alleviates the time pressure of the complicated provisioning and configuration as well as reduces the probability of manually induced configuration errors. (2) Elasticity. VNFs are created, migrated, and destroyed on demand in real time. The reconfigurable hardware resources in pool can rapidly and flexibly offload the corresponding services to the accelerator platform in the dynamic NFV environment. (3) Coordinating with Openstack. The design and implementation of the OpenANFV APIs coordinate with the mechanisms in Openstack to support required virtualized MBs for multiple tenants.","author":["Xiongzi Ge","Yi Liu","David H.C.

A preventive approach to mitigate WD errors is to allocate sufficient inter-cell thermal band. However, this approach greatly reduces chip capacity due to low cell density. A cost effective approach VnC (verify-and-correct), relies on Verification after each write and Correction if errors do happen. Simple VnC improves chip capacity but introduces large performance degradation. In this paper, we propose to exploit the cell level write imbalance to mitigate WD errors. A memory line is often split into cell groups so that the cells within one group are written synchronously. We observe that only few cell groups are critical, which prolong write latency and degrade system performance. By rescuing the disturbance errors from critical groups with unused Error Correction Pointer(ECP) entries, we can greatly minimize the VnC impact on performance. The experimental results show that our proposed scheme effectively eliminates VnC overhead with minimal hardware adjustments.","author":["Rujia Wang","Lei Jiang","Youtao Zhang","Linzhang Wang","Jun Yang"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 88","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744841"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"Pin tool. https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pintool.","order":1},{"text":"S.

It can achieve ultra-high storage density. Also, its read/write speed is comparable to that of SRAM. Due to the tape-like structure of its storage cell, a \"shift\" operation is introduced to access racetrack memory. Thus, prior research mainly focused on minimizing shift latency/energy of racetrack memory while leveraging its ultra-high storage density. Yet the reliability issue of a shift operation, however, is not well addressed. In fact, racetrack memory suffers from unsuccessful shift due to domain misalignment. Such a problem is called \"position error\" in this work. It can significantly reduce mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) of racetrack memory to an intolerable level. Even worse, conventional error correction codes (ECCs), which are designed for \"bit errors\", cannot protect racetrack memory from the position errors. In this work, we investigate the position error model of a shift operation and categorize position errors into two types: \"stop-in-middle\" error and \"out-of-step\" error. To eliminate the stop-in-middle error, we propose a technique called sub-threshold shift (STS) to perform a more reliable shift in two stages. To detect and recover the out-of-step error, a protection mechanism called position error correction code (p-ECC) is proposed. We first describe how to design a p-ECC for different protection strength and analyze corresponding design overhead. Then, we further propose how to reduce area cost of p-ECC by leveraging the \"overhead region\" in a racetrack memory stripe. With these protection mechanisms, we introduce a position-error-aware shift architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that, after using our techniques, the overall MTTF of racetrack memory is improved from 1.33\u03bcs to more than 69 years, with only 0:2% performance degradation. Trade-off among reliability, area, performance, and energy is also explored with comprehensive discussion.","author":["Chao Zhang","Guangyu Sun","Xian Zhang","Weiqi Zhang","Weisheng Zhao","Tao Wang","Yun Liang","Yongpan Liu","Yu Wang","Jiwu Shu"],"issue":["ISCA '15: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2015","Pages   694\u2013706","https://doi.org/10.1145/2749469.2750388"],"date":"13 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"\"Amd eighth-generation processor architecture.\" ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, October 2001. {Online}.

Today\u2019s tools for GPU analysis include simulators like GPGPU-Sim, Multi2Sim, and Barra. While useful for modeling first-order effects, these tools do not provide a detailed view of GPU microarchitecture and physical design. Further, as GPGPU research evolves, design ideas and modifications demand detailed estimates of impact on overall area and power. Fueled by this need, we introduce MIAOW (Many-core Integrated Accelerator Of Wisconsin), an open-source RTL implementation of the AMD Southern Islands GPGPU ISA, capable of running unmodified OpenCL-based applications. We present our design motivated by our goals to create a realistic, flexible, OpenCL-compatible GPGPU, capable of emulating a full system. We first explore if MIAOW is realistic and then use four case studies to show that MIAOW enables the following: physical design perspective to \u201ctraditional\u201d microarchitecture, new types of research exploration, and validation/calibration of simulator-based characterization of hardware. The findings and ideas are contributions in their own right, in addition to MIAOW\u2019s utility as a tool for others\u2019 research.","author":["Raghuraman Balasubramanian","Vinay Gangadhar","Ziliang Guo","Chen-Han Ho","Cherin Joseph","Jaikrishnan Menon","Mario Paulo Drumond","Robin Paul","Sharath Prasad","Pradip Valathol","Karthikeyan Sankaralingam"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 12","Issue 2","July 2015","Article No.: 21","pp   21:1\u201321:25","https://doi.org/10.1145/2764908"],"date":"24 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"2009.

This paper investigates the memristor as a post-CMOS component for memory design. The proposed cell requires one transistor and one memristor (i.e. 1T1M); this cell employs novel read and write mechanisms for improved performance. Initially, it is shown that differently from previous designs, the proposed scheme accomplishes a read operation that does not affect the memory state; this cell is assessed with respect to different parameters as related to its design (such as applied write voltage, memristor range and size). It is shown that at array-level, the write operation may still incur in a state change due to voltage degradation. A detailed assessment of the relationship between a linear array size (as dimension of a square memory array) and the cell parameters, is pursued. Moreover, a comparison with a DRAM cell (i.e. 1T1C) in CMOS is pursued; the advantages and disadvantages of DRAM versus memristor based arrays are then presented.","author":["Vikas Sakode","Fabrizio Lombardi","Jie Han"],"issue":["NANOARCH '12: Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","July 2012","Pages   152\u2013159","https://doi.org/10.1145/2765491.2765519"],"date":"04 July 2012","ref":[{"text":"L.

We propose two novel modifications to standard neural net training that address challenges and exploit properties that are peculiar, if not exclusive, to medical data. First, we examine a general framework for using prior knowledge to regularize parameters in the topmost layers. This framework can leverage priors of any form, ranging from formal ontologies (e.g., ICD9 codes) to data-derived similarity. Second, we describe a scalable procedure for training a collection of neural networks of different sizes but with partially shared architectures. Both of these innovations are well-suited to medical applications, where available data are not yet Internet scale and have many sparse outputs (e.g., rare diagnoses) but which have exploitable structure (e.g., temporal order and relationships between labels). However, both techniques are sufficiently general to be applied to other problems and domains. We demonstrate the empirical efficacy of both techniques on two real-world hospital data sets and show that the resulting neural nets learn interpretable and clinically relevant features.","author":["Zhengping Che","David Kale","Wenzhe Li","Mohammad Taha Bahadori","Yan Liu"],"issue":["KDD '15: Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2015","Pages   507\u2013516","https://doi.org/10.1145/2783258.2783365"],"date":"10 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"S.

In this paper, we show for the first time that WiFi signals can also be exploited to recognize keystrokes. The intuition is that while typing a certain key, the hands and fingers of a user move in a unique formation and direction and thus generate a unique pattern in the time-series of Channel State Information (CSI) values, which we call CSI-waveform for that key. In this paper, we propose a WiFi signal based keystroke recognition system called WiKey. WiKey consists of two Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) WiFi devices, a sender (such as a router) and a receiver (such as a laptop). The sender continuously emits signals and the receiver continuously receives signals. When a human subject types on a keyboard, WiKey recognizes the typed keys based on how the CSI values at the WiFi signal receiver end. We implemented the WiKey system using a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND WiFi router and a Lenovo X200 laptop. WiKey achieves more than 97.5\\% detection rate for detecting the keystroke and 96.4% recognition accuracy for classifying single keys. In real-world experiments, WiKey can recognize keystrokes in a continuously typed sentence with an accuracy of 93.5%.","author":["Kamran Ali","Alex X.

Many approaches have been suggested, based on lexical matching, handcrafted patterns, syntactic parse trees, external sources of structured semantic knowledge and distributional semantics. However, lexical features, like string matching, do not capture semantic similarity beyond a trivial level. Furthermore, handcrafted patterns and external sources of structured semantic knowledge cannot be assumed to be available in all circumstances and for all domains. Lastly, approaches depending on parse trees are restricted to syntactically well-formed texts, typically of one sentence in length. We investigate whether determining short text similarity is possible using only semantic features---where by semantic we mean, pertaining to a representation of meaning---rather than relying on similarity in lexical or syntactic representations. We use word embeddings, vector representations of terms, computed from unlabelled data, that represent terms in a semantic space in which proximity of vectors can be interpreted as semantic similarity. We propose to go from word-level to text-level semantics by combining insights from methods based on external sources of semantic knowledge with word embeddings. A novel feature of our approach is that an arbitrary number of word embedding sets can be incorporated. We derive multiple types of meta-features from the comparison of the word vectors for short text pairs, and from the vector means of their respective word embeddings. The features representing labelled short text pairs are used to train a supervised learning algorithm. We use the trained model at testing time to predict the semantic similarity of new, unlabelled pairs of short texts  We show on a publicly available evaluation set commonly used for the task of semantic similarity that our method outperforms baseline methods that work under the same conditions.","author":["Tom Kenter","Maarten de Rijke"],"issue":["CIKM '15: Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2015","Pages   1411\u20131420","https://doi.org/10.1145/2806416.2806475"],"date":"17 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"E.

People often expressed it verbally through the use of heavy tonal stress and certain gestural clues like rolling of the eyes. These tonal and gestural clues are obviously not available for expressing sarcasm in text, making its detection reliant upon other factors. In this paper, two approaches to detect sarcasm in the text of Twitter data were proposed. The first is a parsing-based lexicon generation algorithm (PBLGA) and the second was to detect sarcasm based on the occurrence of the interjection word. The combination of two approaches is also shown and compared with the existing state-of-the-art approach to detect sarcasm. First approach attains a 0.89, 0.81 and 0.84 precision, recall and f -- score respectively. Second approach attains 0.85, 0.96 and 0.90 precision, recall and f -- score respectively in tweets with sarcastic hashtag.","author":["Santosh Kumar Bharti","Korra Sathya Babu","Sanjay Kumar Jena"],"issue":["ASONAM '15: Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining 2015","August 2015","Pages   1373\u20131380","https://doi.org/10.1145/2808797.2808910"],"date":"25 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"R.

The primary barriers for its adoption include the lack of fine-grained and up-to-date indoor maps and the potential deployment and maintenance cost. In this paper we investigate the feasibility of utilizing crowdsourced data for building a smartphone-based indoor navigation system, focusing on the technical challenges caused by the varying quality of crowdsourced data. We developed iMoon, an indoor navigation system based on sensor-enriched 3D models of indoor environment, and evaluated its performance via a field study in a public building covering around 1,100 square meters. iMoon builds 3D models of indoor environment from crowdsourced 2D photos, and compiles a navigation mesh from the generated 3D models. Depending on the input for 3D modelling, indoor pedestrian paths may be partly missing from the output. iMoon solves this issue by integrating into navigation mesh the pedestrian paths recognized from crowdsourced user motion trajectories. With photo-based 3D models, iMoon supports image-based localization that identifies user's position and facing direction with photos, and provides visual navigation instructions that show when and where to turn. To reduce response delay while maintaining the accuracy of localization, iMoon partitions 3D models based on the density of 3D points, and selects partitions for image-based localization using Wi-Fi fingerprints. According to our experimental results, iMoon works properly, and our solution of indoor localization achieves competitive performance compared with traditional approaches: in most cases, a user can be located within an average of 3.85 seconds with a location error of less than 2 meters and a facing direction error of less than 6 degrees.","author":["Jiang Dong","Yu Xiao","Marius Noreikis","Zhonghong Ou","Antti Yl\u00e4-J\u00e4\u00e4ski"],"issue":["SenSys '15: Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems","November 2015","Pages   85\u201397","https://doi.org/10.1145/2809695.2809722"],"date":"01 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"Siftgpu: A gpu implementation of scale invariant feature transform (sift). http://cs.unc.edu/~ccwu/siftgpu/.","order":1},{"text":"Visualsfm : A visual structure from motion system. http://ccwu.me/vsfm/.","order":2},{"text":"S.

In contrast to previous work in this genre, our attack does not require the attacker to install software on the victim's machine; to facilitate the attack, the victim needs only to browse to an untrusted webpage that contains attacker-controlled content. This makes our attack model highly scalable, and extremely relevant and practical to today's Web, as most desktop browsers currently used to access the Internet are affected by such side channel threats. Our attack, which is an extension to the last-level cache attacks of Liu et al., allows a remote adversary to recover information belonging to other processes, users, and even virtual machines running on the same physical host with the victim web browser. We describe the fundamentals behind our attack, and evaluate its performance characteristics. In addition, we show how it can be used to compromise user privacy in a common setting, letting an attacker spy after a victim that uses private browsing. Defending against this side channel is possible, but the required countermeasures can exact an impractical cost on benign uses of the browser.","author":["Yossef Oren","Vasileios P.

This article introduces drama as a form of intangible cultural heritage and presents a solution for its preservation in terms of a formal encoding through a computational ontology.After the review of a formal representation of drama, called Drammar, developed in previous works, we show how an abstraction of drama can be encoded into a digital item. We also show how the method proposed is compliant with the major initiatives for the documentation of cultural heritage, namely CIDOC-CRM and FRBR. Finally, we test the applicability of our solution by showing how the major tenets of two well-known theories of drama can be encoded in Drammar and presenting the results of a focus group of drama scholars and practitioners who have accessed the encoding through a visualization system. The encoding and visualization system have turned out to be a promising support for teaching and investigating drama.","author":["Vincenzo Lombardo","Antonio Pizzo","Rossana Damiano"],"issue":["Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage","Volume 9","Issue 1","February 2016","Article No.: 5","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/2812814"],"date":"20 February 2016","ref":[{"text":"Eneko Agirre, Ander Barrena, Oier Lopez de Lacalle, Aitor Soroa, Samuel Fernando, and Mark Stevenson. 2012.

Computing exhibits the same phenomenon; we have gone from mainframes to PCs and local networks in the past, and over the last decade we have seen a centralization and consolidation of services and applications in data centers and clouds. We position that a new shift is necessary. Technological advances such as powerful dedicated connection boxes deployed in most homes, high capacity mobile end-user devices and powerful wireless networks, along with growing user concerns about trust, privacy, and autonomy requires taking the control of computing applications, data, and services away from some central nodes (the \"core\") to the other logical extreme (the \"edge\") of the Internet. We also position that this development can help blurring the boundary between man and machine, and embrace social computing in which humans are part of the computation and decision making loop, resulting in a human-centered system design. We refer to this vision of human-centered edge-device based computing as Edge-centric Computing. We elaborate in this position paper on this vision and present the research challenges associated with its implementation.","author":["Pedro Garcia Lopez","Alberto Montresor","Dick Epema","Anwitaman Datta","Teruo Higashino","Adriana Iamnitchi","Marinho Barcellos","Pascal Felber","Etienne Riviere"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 45","Issue 5","October 2015","pp   37\u201342","https://doi.org/10.1145/2831347.2831354"],"date":"30 September 2015","ref":[{"text":"F.

Today\u2019s systems, however, cannot fully utilize the higher bandwidth offered by TSVs, due to the limited internal bandwidth within each layer of the 3D-stacked DRAM. We identify that the bottleneck to enabling higher bandwidth in 3D-stacked DRAM is now the global bitline interface, the connection between the DRAM row buffer and the peripheral IO circuits. The global bitline interface consists of a limited and expensive set of wires and structures, called global bitlines and global sense amplifiers, whose high cost makes it difficult to simply scale up the bandwidth of the interface within a single DRAM layer in the 3D stack. We alleviate this bandwidth bottleneck by exploiting the observation that several global bitline interfaces already exist across the multiple DRAM layers in current 3D-stacked designs, but only a fraction of them are enabled at the same time.We propose a new 3D-stacked DRAM architecture, called Simultaneous Multi-Layer Access (SMLA), which increases the internal DRAM bandwidth by accessing multiple DRAM layers concurrently, thus making much greater use of the bandwidth that the TSVs offer. To avoid channel contention, the DRAM layers must coordinate with each other when simultaneously transferring data. We propose two approaches to coordination, both of which deliver four times the bandwidth for a four-layer DRAM, over a baseline that accesses only one layer at a time. Our first approach, Dedicated-IO, statically partitions the TSVs by assigning each layer to a dedicated set of TSVs that operate at a higher frequency. Unfortunately, Dedicated-IO requires a nonuniform design for each layer (increasing manufacturing costs), and its DRAM energy consumption scales linearly with the number of layers. Our second approach, Cascaded-IO, solves both issues by instead time multiplexing all of the TSVs across layers. Cascaded-IO reduces DRAM energy consumption by lowering the operating frequency of higher layers. Our evaluations show that SMLA provides significant performance improvement and energy reduction across a variety of workloads (55%/18% on average for multiprogrammed workloads, respectively) over a baseline 3D-stacked DRAM, with low overhead.","author":["Donghyuk Lee","Saugata Ghose","Gennady Pekhimenko","Samira Khan","Onur Mutlu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 12","Issue 4","January 2016","Article No.: 63","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/2832911"],"date":"06 January 2016","ref":[{"text":"Bryan Black, Murali Annavaram, Ned Brekelbaum, John DeVale, Lei Jiang, Gabriel H.

Recently, approximate storage emerges in the area of computer architecture. It trades off precision for better performance and/or energy consumption. Previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of approximate storage for applications that are tolerant to imprecision such as image processing. However, it is still an open question whether and how approximate storage can be used for applications that do not expose such intrinsic tolerance. In this paper, we study one of the most basic operations in database--sorting on a hybrid storage system with both precise storage and approximate storage. Particularly, we start with a study of three common sorting algorithms on approximate storage. Experimental results show that a 95% sorted sequence can be obtained with up to 40% reduction in total write latencies. Thus, we propose an approx-refine execution mechanism to improve the performance of sorting algorithms on the hybrid storage system to produce precise results. Our optimization gains the performance benefits by offloading the sorting operation to approximate storage, followed by an efficient refinement to resolve the unsortedness on the output of the approximate storage. Our experiments show that our approx-refine can reduce the total memory access time by up to 11%. These studies shed light on the potential of approximate hardware for improving the performance of applications that require precise results.","author":["Shuang Chen","Shunning Jiang","Bingsheng He","Xueyan Tang"],"issue":["SIGMOD '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data","June 2016","Pages   647\u2013662","https://doi.org/10.1145/2882903.2882908"],"date":"14 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"S.

Observing that directly adopting stochastic computing to DNN has some challenges including random error fluctuation, range limitation, and overhead in accumulation, we address these problems by removing near-zero weights, applying weight-scaling, and integrating the activation function with the accumulator. The approach allows an easy implementation of early decision termination with a fixed hardware design by exploiting the progressive precision characteristics of stochastic computing, which was not easy with existing approaches. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the conventional binary logic in terms of gate area, latency, and power consumption.","author":["Kyounghoon Kim","Jungki Kim","Joonsang Yu","Jungwoo Seo","Jongeun Lee","Kiyoung Choi"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 124","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898011"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"R.

The Blech criterion is agnostic to the product lifetime and temperature conditions: many Blech-mortal wires may never experience EM during the product lifetime. We develop new methods that evaluate the transient evolution of stress, relative to the product lifetime, and present an improved set of simple and practical mortality criteria. On a set of power grid benchmarks, we demonstrate that the actual number of mortal wires may depend strongly on the lifetime and reliability conditions.","author":["Vivek Mishra","Sachin S.

Recently, 2-bit multi-level cell (MLC) STT-RAM has been proposed to further increase data density. However, a key drawback for MLC STT-RAM is that the magnetization directions of its hard and soft domains cannot be flipped to two opposite directions simultaneously, which leads to the two-step problem in state transitions. Two-step state transitions would significantly impact the lifetime of MLC STT-RAM due to the wasted flips in the soft domains. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a novel two-step state transition minimization (TSTM) scheme, to improve the lifetime of MLC STT-RAM when it is employed in cache design. The basic idea is by sacrificing certain cells as auxiliary flags, the two-step state transitions in STT-RAM can be well eliminated. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can improve the lifetime of MLC STT-RAM to 318.5%.","author":["Huizhang Luo","Jingtong Hu","Liang Shi","Chun Jason Xue","Qingfeng Zhuge"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 171","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898106"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"H.

Recent systems propose using 100s to 1000s of machines to train networks with tens of layers and billions of connections. While the computation involved can be done more efficiently on GPUs than on more traditional CPU cores, training such networks on a single GPU is too slow and training on distributed GPUs can be inefficient, due to data movement overheads, GPU stalls, and limited GPU memory. This paper describes a new parameter server, called GeePS, that supports scalable deep learning across GPUs distributed among multiple machines, overcoming these obstacles. We show that GeePS enables a state-of-the-art single-node GPU implementation to scale well, such as to 13 times the number of training images processed per second on 16 machines (relative to the original optimized single-node code). Moreover, GeePS achieves a higher training throughput with just four GPU machines than that a state-of-the-art CPU-only system achieves with 108 machines.","author":["Henggang Cui","Hao Zhang","Gregory R.

However, its capacity and bandwidth are often underutilized as it is difficult to design servers with the right balance of CPU, memory and Flash resources over time and for multiple applications. This work examines Flash disaggregation as a way to deal with Flash overprovisioning. We tune remote access to Flash over commodity networks and analyze its impact on workloads sampled from real datacenter applications. We show that, while remote Flash access introduces a 20% throughput drop at the application level, disaggregation allows us to make up for these overheads through resource-efficient scale-out. Hence, we show that Flash disaggregation allows scaling CPU and Flash resources independently in a cost effective manner. We use our analysis to draw conclusions about data and control plane issues in remote storage.","author":["Ana Klimovic","Christos Kozyrakis","Eno Thereska","Binu John","Sanjeev Kumar"],"issue":["EuroSys '16: Proceedings of the Eleventh European Conference on Computer Systems","April 2016","Article No.: 29","Pages   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/2901318.2901337"],"date":"18 April 2016","ref":[{"text":"Amazon.

However, previous research has demonstrated that these NVMs cannot completely replace DRAM due to either lifetime/performance (PCRAM) or density (STT-RAM) issues. Recently, a new type of emerging NVM, called Racetrack Memory (RM), has attracted more and more attention of memory researchers because it has ultra-high density and fast access speed without the write cycle issue. However, there lacks research on how to leverage RM for main memory. To this end, we explore main memory design based on RM technology in both circuit and architecture levels. In the circuit level, we propose the structure of the RM based main memory and investigate different design parameters. In the architecture level, we design a simple and efficient shift-sense address mapping policy to reduce 95% shift operations for performance improvement and power saving. At the same time, we analyze the efficiency of existing optimization strategies for NVM main memory. Our experiments show that RM can outperform DRAM for main memory, in respect of density, performance, and energy efficiency.","author":["Qingda Hu","Guangyu Sun","Jiwu Shu","Chao Zhang"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '16: Proceedings of the 26th edition on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2016","Pages   397\u2013402","https://doi.org/10.1145/2902961.2902967"],"date":"18 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"N.

Most previous approaches that extend these programming models to clusters are based on a common idea: designating a centralized host node and coordinating the other nodes with the host for computation. However, the centralized host node is a serious performance bottleneck when the number of nodes is large. In this paper, we propose a scalable and distributed OpenCL framework called SnuCL-D for large-scale clusters. SnuCL-D's remote device virtualization provides an OpenCL application with an illusion that all compute devices in a cluster are confined in a single node. To reduce the amount of control-message and data communication between nodes, SnuCL-D replicates the OpenCL host program execution and data in each node. We also propose a new OpenCL host API function and a queueing optimization technique that significantly reduce the overhead incurred by the previous centralized approaches. To show the effectiveness of SnuCL-D, we evaluate SnuCL-D with a microbenchmark and eleven benchmark applications on a large-scale CPU cluster and a medium-scale GPU cluster.","author":["Junghyun Kim","Gangwon Jo","Jaehoon Jung","Jungwon Kim","Jaejin Lee"],"issue":["PLDI '16: Proceedings of the 37th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation","June 2016","Pages   553\u2013569","https://doi.org/10.1145/2908080.2908094"],"date":"02 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"Charm++.

With the emergence of flash memory as a new viable storage medium, the new design concern of flash endurance arises, necessitating a revisit of workload characteristics, in particular, of the write behavior. Inspired by Web caching studies where a Zipf-like access pattern is commonly found, we hypothesize that write count distribution at the block level may also follow Zipf\u2019s Law. To validate this hypothesis, we study 48 block I/O traces collected from a wide variety of real and benchmark applications. Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that the Zipf-like pattern indeed widely exists in write traffic provided its disguises are removed by statistical processing. This finding implies that write skew in a large class of applications could be analytically expressed and, thus, facilitates design tradeoff explorations adaptive to workload characteristics.","author":["Yue Yang","Jianwen Zhu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 12","Issue 4","August 2016","Article No.: 21","pp   1\u201319","https://doi.org/10.1145/2908557"],"date":"08 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"Nitin Agrawal, Vijayan Prabhakaran, Ted Wobber, John D.

This flexibility enables improvements over conventional DNN implementations that use a single, uniform representation. This work proposes Proteus, which reduces the data traffic and storage footprint needed by DNNs, resulting in reduced energy and improved area efficiency for DNN implementations. Proteus uses a different representation per layer for both the data (neurons) and the weights (synapses) processed by DNNs. Proteus is a layered extension over existing DNN implementations that converts between the numerical representation used by the DNN execution engines and the shorter, layer-specific fixed-point representation used when reading and writing data values to memory be it on-chip buffers or off-chip memory. Proteus uses a novel memory layout for DNN data, enabling a simple, low-cost and low-energy conversion unit. We evaluate Proteus as an extension to a state-of-the-art accelerator [7] which uses a uniform 16-bit fixed-point representation. On five popular DNNs Proteus reduces data traffic among layers by 43% on average while maintaining accuracy within 1% even when compared to a single precision floating-point implementation. As a result, Proteus improves energy by 15% with no performance loss. Proteus also reduces the data footprint by at least 38% and hence the amount of on-chip buffering needed resulting in an implementation that requires 20% less area overall. This area savings can be used to improve cost by building smaller chips, to process larger DNNs for the same on-chip area, or to incorporate an additional three execution engines increasing peak performance bandwidth by 18%.","author":["Patrick Judd","Jorge Albericio","Tayler Hetherington","Tor M.

Current 3D flash memory faces new challenges including thermal issues and complex manufacturing process. This paper presents TheraPhy, a novel thermal-aware physical space allocation strategy for three-dimensional flash memory storage systems. TheraPhy permutes the allocation of physical blocks. Consecutively accessed logical blocks are distributed to different physical locations in order to prevent the accumulation of hotspots. TheraPhy requires no changes to the file system, on-chip memory hierarchy, or hardware implementation of 3D flash memory. Based on TheraPhy, we present an address mapping strategy that is capable of determining the allocation of physical blocks based on their thermal status. We demonstrate the viability of the proposed technique using a set of extensive experiments. Experimental results show that TheraPhy can reduce the peak temperature by 15.39% with less than 1% extra erase overhead in comparison with the baseline scheme.","author":["Yi Wang","Mingxu Zhang","Lisha Dong","Xuan Yang"],"issue":["ISLPED '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","August 2016","Pages   290\u2013295","https://doi.org/10.1145/2934583.2934638"],"date":"08 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"UMass trace repository. http://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Storage, 2016.","order":1},{"text":"A.

It permits uphill moves under the control of a probabilistic criterion, thus tending to avoid the first local minima encountered.The algorithm has been tested against the Nelder and Mead simplex method and against a version of Adaptive Random Search. The test functions were Rosenbrock valleys and multiminima functions in 2,4, and 10 dimensions.The new method proved to be more reliable than the others, being always able to find the optimum, or at least a point very close to it. It is quite costly in term of function evaluations, but its cost can be predicted in advance, depending only slightly on the starting point.","author":["A. Corana","M. Marchesi","C. Martini","S.

Patient EHR data consists of a sequence of visits over time, where each visit includes multiple medical concepts, e.g., diagnosis, procedure, and medication codes. This hierarchical structure provides two types of relational information, namely sequential order of visits and co-occurrence of the codes within a visit. In this work, we propose Med2Vec, which not only learns the representations for both medical codes and visits from large EHR datasets with over million visits, but also allows us to interpret the learned representations confirmed positively by clinical experts. In the experiments, Med2Vec shows significant improvement in prediction accuracy in clinical applications compared to baselines such as Skip-gram, GloVe, and stacked autoencoder, while providing clinically meaningful interpretation.","author":["Edward Choi","Mohammad Taha Bahadori","Elizabeth Searles","Catherine Coffey","Michael Thompson","James Bost","Javier Tejedor-Sojo","Jimeng Sun"],"issue":["KDD '16: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2016","Pages   1495\u20131504","https://doi.org/10.1145/2939672.2939823"],"date":"13 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"Y.

It effectively reduces the cell size, and makes significant energy reduction and scalability improvement. New applications such as associative processors/accelerators are facilitated by the emergence of the nonvolatile TCAM (nvTCAM). However, nvTCAM design is challenging. In addition to the emerging device's uncertainty, the nvTCAM cell structure is so diverse that it results in a design space too large to explore manually. To tackle these challenges, we propose a circuit-level model and develop a simulation tool, NVSim-CAM, which helps researchers to make early design decisions, and to evaluate device/circuit innovations. The tool is validated by HSPICE simulations and data from fabricated chips. We also present a case study to illustrate how NVSim-CAM benefits the nvTCAM design. In the case study, we propose a novel 3D vertical ReRAM based TCAM cell, the 3DvTCAM. We project the advantages/disadvantages and explore the design space for the proposed cell with NVSim-CAM.","author":["Shuangchen Li","Liu Liu","Peng Gu","Cong Xu","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["ICCAD '16: Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2016","Article No.: 2","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967059"],"date":"07 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"Predictive Technology Model. http://ptm.asu.edu/.","order":1},{"text":"B.

The intuition is that due to the differences in gaits of different people, the WiFi signal reflected by a walking human generates unique variations in the Channel State Information (CSI) on the WiFi receiver. To profile human movement using CSI, we use signal processing techniques to generate spectrograms from CSI measurements so that the resulting spectrograms are similar to those generated by specifically designed Doppler radars. To extract features from spectrograms that best characterize the walking pattern, we perform autocorrelation on the torso reflection to remove imperfection in spectrograms. We evaluated WifiU on a dataset with 2,800 gait instances collected from 50 human subjects walking in a room with an area of 50 square meters. Experimental results show that WifiU achieves top-1, top-2, and top-3 recognition accuracies of 79.28%, 89.52%, and 93.05%, respectively.","author":["Wei Wang","Alex X.

We describe, implement and quantify a new covert channel through shared hardware random number generation (RNG) module that is available on modern processors. We demonstrate that a reliable, high-capacity and low-error covert channel can be created through the RNG module that works across CPU cores and across virtual machines. We quantify the capacity of the RNG channel under different settings and show that transmission rates in the range of 7-200 kbit/s can be achieved depending on a particular system used for transmission, assumptions, and the load level. Finally, we describe challenges in mitigating the RNG channel, and propose several mitigation approaches both in software and hardware.","author":["Dmitry Evtyushkin","Dmitry Ponomarev"],"issue":["CCS '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2016","Pages   843\u2013857","https://doi.org/10.1145/2976749.2978374"],"date":"24 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"AMD.

However, an asynchronous model has been recently proposed to accelerate iterative computations. Nevertheless, it is challenging to recover from failures in such a system, since a typical checkpointing based approach requires many expensive synchronization barriers that largely offset the gains of asynchronous computations. This paper first proposes a fault-tolerant framework that performs recovery by leveraging surviving data, rather than checkpointing. Our fault-tolerant approach guarantees the correctness of computations. Additionally, a novel asynchronous checkpointing method is introduced to further boost the recovery efficiency at the price of nearly zero overhead. Our solutions are implemented on a prototype system, Faiter, to facilitate tolerating failures for asynchronous computations. Also, Faiter performs load balancing on recovery by re-assigning lost data onto multiple machines. We conduct extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of our proposals using a broad spectrum of real-world graphs.","author":["Zhigang Wang","Lixin Gao","Yu Gu","Yubin Bao","Ge Yu"],"issue":["SoCC '16: Proceedings of the Seventh ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing","October 2016","Pages   71\u201383","https://doi.org/10.1145/2987550.2987552"],"date":"05 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"Giraph. http://giraph.apache.org/.","order":1},{"text":"Apache spark. http://spark.apache.org/.","order":2},{"text":"S.

Approximate computing can accelerate the computation and dramatically reduce the energy consumption with controllable accuracy loss. In this paper, we propose a Resistive Associative Unit, called RAU, which approximates computation alongside processing cores. RAU exploits the data locality with associative memory. It finds a row which has the closest distance to input patterns while considering the impact of each bit index on the computation accuracy. Our evaluation shows that RAU can accelerate the GPGPU computation by 1.15x and improve the energy efficiency by 36% at only 10% accuracy loss.","author":["Mohsen Imani","Yan Cheng","Tajana Rosing"],"issue":["MEMSYS '16: Proceedings of the Second International Symposium on Memory Systems","October 2016","Pages   208\u2013210","https://doi.org/10.1145/2989081.2989086"],"date":"03 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"A.

Our model, which we dubbed CostHat, supports both, Microservices deployed on traditional IaaS or PaaS clouds, and services that make use of novel cloud programming paradigms, such as AWS Lambda. CostHat is based on a network model, and allows for what-if and cost sensitivity analysis. Further, we have used this model to implement tooling that warns cloud developers directly in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) about certain classes of potentially costly code changes. We illustrate our work based on a case study, and evaluate the CostHat model using a standalone Python implementation. We show that, once instantiated, cost calculation in CostHat is computationally inexpensive on standard hardware (below 1 ms even for applications consisting of thousand services and endpoints). This enables its use in real-time for developer tooling which continually re-evaluates the costs of an application in the background, while the developer is working on the code.","author":["Philipp Leitner","J\u00fcrgen Cito","Emanuel St\u00f6ckli"],"issue":["UCC '16: Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing","December 2016","Pages   165\u2013174","https://doi.org/10.1145/2996890.2996901"],"date":"06 December 2016","ref":[{"text":"A.

Our scheme employs a Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) to generate the public identity of each device, which is used as the public key for each device for message encryption. We have provided formal proofs of security in the Session Key Security and Universally Composable Framework of the proposed protocol, which demonstrates the resilience of the scheme against passive and active attacks.

These algorithms typically involve a large number of multiply-accumulate (dot-product) operations. A recent project, DaDianNao, adopts a near data processing approach, where a specialized neural functional unit performs all the digital arithmetic operations and receives input weights from adjacent eDRAM banks.This work explores an in-situ processing approach, where memristor crossbar arrays not only store input weights, but are also used to perform dot-product operations in an analog manner. While the use of crossbar memory as an analog dot-product engine is well known, no prior work has designed or characterized a full-fledged accelerator based on crossbars. In particular, our work makes the following contributions: (i) We design a pipelined architecture, with some crossbars dedicated for each neural network layer, and eDRAM buffers that aggregate data between pipeline stages. (ii) We define new data encoding techniques that are amenable to analog computations and that can reduce the high overheads of analog-to-digital conversion (ADC). (iii) We define the many supporting digital components required in an analog CNN accelerator and carry out a design space exploration to identify the best balance of memristor storage/compute, ADCs, and eDRAM storage on a chip. On a suite of CNN and DNN workloads, the proposed ISAAC architecture yields improvements of 14.8\u00d7, 5.5\u00d7, and 7.5\u00d7 in throughput, energy, and computational density (respectively), relative to the state-of-the-art DaDianNao architecture.","author":["Ali Shafiee","Anirban Nag","Naveen Muralimanohar","Rajeev Balasubramonian","John Paul Strachan","Miao Hu","R.

While OpenCL enhances the code portability and programmability of FPGA, it comes at the expense of performance. The key challenge is to optimize the OpenCL kernels to efficiently utilize the flexible hardware resources in FPGA. Simply optimizing the OpenCL kernel code through various compiler options turns out insufficient to achieve desirable performance for both compute-intensive and data-intensive workloads such as convolutional neural networks. In this paper, we first propose an analytical performance model and apply it to perform an in-depth analysis on the resource requirement of CNN classifier kernels and available resources on modern FPGAs. We identify that the key performance bottleneck is the on-chip memory bandwidth. We propose a new kernel design to effectively address such bandwidth limitation and to provide an optimal balance between computation, on-chip, and off-chip memory access. As a case study, we further apply these techniques to design a CNN accelerator based on the VGG model. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our CNN accelerator using an Altera Arria 10 GX1150 board. We achieve 866 Gop/s floating point performance at 370MHz working frequency and 1.79 Top/s 16-bit fixed-point performance at 385MHz. To the best of our knowledge, our implementation achieves the best power efficiency and performance density compared to existing work.","author":["Jialiang Zhang","Jing Li"],"issue":["FPGA '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2017","Pages   25\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/3020078.3021698"],"date":"22 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"C.

By offloading compute operations onto intermediate networking devices (e.g., switches, network accelerators, middleboxes), one can (1) serve network requests on the fly with low latency; (2) reduce datacenter traffic and mitigate network congestion; and (3) save energy by running servers in a low-power mode. However, since (1) existing switch technology doesn't provide general computing capabilities, and (2) commodity datacenter networks are complex (e.g., hierarchical fat-tree topologies, multipath communication), enabling in-network computation inside a datacenter is challenging. In this paper, as a step towards in-network computing, we present IncBricks, an in-network caching fabric with basic computing primitives. IncBricks is a hardware-software co-designed system that supports caching in the network using a programmable network middlebox. As a key-value store accelerator, our prototype lowers request latency by over 30% and doubles throughput for 1024 byte values in a common cluster configuration. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of in-network computing and that efficient datacenter network request processing is possible if we carefully split the computation across the different programmable computing elements in a datacenter, including programmable switches, network accelerators, and end hosts.","author":["Ming Liu","Liang Luo","Jacob Nelson","Luis Ceze","Arvind Krishnamurthy","Kishore Atreya"],"issue":["ASPLOS '17: Proceedings of the Twenty-Second International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","April 2017","Pages   795\u2013809","https://doi.org/10.1145/3037697.3037731"],"date":"04 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"Intel DPDK. http://dpdk.org.","order":1},{"text":"ECMP routing protocol. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-cost_multi-path_routing.","order":2},{"text":"Zipf's law. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law.","order":3},{"text":"Organizationally unique identifier. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizationally_unique_identifier.","order":4},{"text":"Intel Ethernet Switch FM6000 Series, white paper, 2013.","order":5},{"text":"Arista 7150 Series Datasheet. https://www.arista.com/assets/data/pdf/Datasheets/7150S_Datasheet.pdf, 2016.","order":6},{"text":"Microsoft Azure Machine Learning. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/, 2016.","order":7},{"text":"OCTEON Development Kits. http://www.cavium.com/octeon_software_develop_kit.html, 2016.","order":8},{"text":"LiquidIO Server Adapters. http://www.cavium.com/LiquidIO_Server_Adapters.html, 2016.","order":9},{"text":"XPliant Ethernet Switch Product Family. http://www.cavium.com/XPliant-Ethernet-Switch-Product-Family.html, 2016.","order":10},{"text":"Google SyntaxNet. https://research.googleblog.com/2016/05/announcing-syntaxnet-worlds-most.html, 2016.","order":11},{"text":"Mellanox NPS-400 Network Processor. http://www.mellanox.com/related-docs/prod_npu/PB_NPS-400.pdf, 2016.","order":12},{"text":"Netronome NFP-6000 Intelligent Ethernet Controller Family. https://www.netronome.com/media/redactor_files/PB_NFP-6000.pdf, 2016.","order":13},{"text":"M.

One important purpose of KT is to personalize the practice sequence to help students learn knowledge concepts efficiently. However, existing methods such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and Deep Knowledge Tracing either model knowledge state for each predefined concept separately or fail to pinpoint exactly which concepts a student is good at or unfamiliar with. To solve these problems, this work introduces a new model called Dynamic Key-Value Memory Networks (DKVMN) that can exploit the relationships between underlying concepts and directly output a student's mastery level of each concept. Unlike standard memory-augmented neural networks that facilitate a single memory matrix or two static memory matrices, our model has one static matrix called key, which stores the knowledge concepts and the other dynamic matrix called value, which stores and updates the mastery levels of corresponding concepts. Experiments show that our model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art model in a range of KT datasets. Moreover, the DKVMN model can automatically discover underlying concepts of exercises typically performed by human annotations and depict the changing knowledge state of a student.","author":["Jiani Zhang","Xingjian Shi","Irwin King","Dit-Yan Yeung"],"issue":["WWW '17: Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web","April 2017","Pages   765\u2013774","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052580"],"date":"03 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

Simple questions, which can be answered by the extraction of a single fact, constitute a large part of questions asked on the web but still pose challenges to QA systems, especially when asked against a large knowledge resource. Existing QA systems usually rely on various components each specialised in solving different sub-tasks of the problem (such as segmentation, entity recognition, disambiguation, and relation classification etc.). In this work, we follow a quite different approach: We train a neural network for answering simple questions in an end-to-end manner, leaving all decisions to the model. It learns to rank subject-predicate pairs to enable the retrieval of relevant facts given a question. The network contains a nested word/character-level question encoder which allows to handle out-of-vocabulary and rare word problems while still being able to exploit word-level semantics. Our approach achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art end-to-end approaches that rely on an attention mechanism.","author":["Denis Lukovnikov","Asja Fischer","Jens Lehmann","S\u00f6ren Auer"],"issue":["WWW '17: Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web","April 2017","Pages   1211\u20131220","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052675"],"date":"03 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"D.

Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide a promising opportunity to improve performance, security and energy efficiency. Especially background acceleration of computationally complex and long-running tasks is an important field of application. A flexible use of reconfigurable devices within a cloud context requires an abstraction of the actual hardware through virtualization.In this paper we present an approach inspired by paravirtualized machines for the integration of reconfigurable hardware into cloud services. Using partial reconfiguration our hardware and software framework virtualizes a single physical FPGA to enable multiple independent user designs. Essential components are the management of those virtual user-defined accelerators (vFPGA) and their migration between physical FPGAs to achieve higher system-wide utilization. The migration requires saving and restoring the internal state or context of the vFPGA. We demonstrate the application possibilities and the resource trade-off of our approach by transferring a running design from one physical FPGA to another. Moreover, we present future perspectives for the use of FPGAs in cloud-based environments.","author":["Oliver Knodel","Paul R. Genssler","Rainer G.

Potential attacks include having malicious content like malware identified as legitimate or controlling vehicle behavior. Yet, all existing adversarial example attacks require knowledge of either the model internals or its training data. We introduce the first practical demonstration of an attacker controlling a remotely hosted DNN with no such knowledge. Indeed, the only capability of our black-box adversary is to observe labels given by the DNN to chosen inputs. Our attack strategy consists in training a local model to substitute for the target DNN, using inputs synthetically generated by an adversary and labeled by the target DNN. We use the local substitute to craft adversarial examples, and find that they are misclassified by the targeted DNN. To perform a real-world and properly-blinded evaluation, we attack a DNN hosted by MetaMind, an online deep learning API. We find that their DNN misclassifies 84.24% of the adversarial examples crafted with our substitute. We demonstrate the general applicability of our strategy to many ML techniques by conducting the same attack against models hosted by Amazon and Google, using logistic regression substitutes. They yield adversarial examples misclassified by Amazon and Google at rates of 96.19% and 88.94%. We also find that this black-box attack strategy is capable of evading defense strategies previously found to make adversarial example crafting harder.","author":["Nicolas Papernot","Patrick McDaniel","Ian Goodfellow","Somesh Jha","Z.

A major educational issue is the necessity of providing a means for the student to manage the complexity of the material. We have addressed this issue in a multimedia teaching tool called \"Algorithms in Action\" by allowing students to view an algorithm at varying levels of detail. Starting with a high level pseudocode description of the algorithm, with accompanying high level animation and textual explanation, students can expand sections of the pseudocode to expose more detail. Animation and explanation are controlled in a coordinated fashion, becoming correspondingly more detailed as the pseudocode is expanded. The tool also supports dofferem , pdes. corresponding to different stages in the learning process. Student feedback suggests that the availability of multiple levels detail and the facility for the user to control the level of detail being viewed is an effective way to manage content complexity.","author":["Linda Stern","Harald S\u00f8ndergaard","Lee Naish"],"issue":["ITiCSE '99: Proceedings of the 4th annual SIGCSE/SIGCUE ITiCSE conference on Innovation and technology in computer science education","June 1999","Pages   127\u2013130","https://doi.org/10.1145/305786.305891"],"date":"27 June 1999","ref":[{"text":"Marc Brown.

In this paper, we propose a new technique called delay locking to enhance the security of existing logic locking techniques. For delay locking, the key into a locked circuit not only determines its functionality, but also its timing profile.

We propose a game theoretical minimax game to iteratively optimise both models. On one hand, the discriminative model, aiming to mine signals from labelled and unlabelled data, provides guidance to train the generative model towards fitting the underlying relevance distribution over documents given the query. On the other hand, the generative model, acting as an attacker to the current discriminative model, generates difficult examples for the discriminative model in an adversarial way by minimising its discrimination objective. With the competition between these two models, we show that the unified framework takes advantage of both schools of thinking: (i) the generative model learns to fit the relevance distribution over documents via the signals from the discriminative model, and (ii) the discriminative model is able to exploit the unlabelled data selected by the generative model to achieve a better estimation for document ranking.

Recently, many FPGA-based accelerators have been proposed to improve the performance and efficiency of CNNs. Current approaches construct a single processor that computes the CNN layers one at a time; the processor is optimized to maximize the throughput at which the collection of layers is computed. However, this approach leads to inefficient designs because the same processor structure is used to compute CNN layers of radically varying dimensions. We present a new CNN accelerator paradigm and an accompanying automated design methodology that partitions the available FPGA resources into multiple processors, each of which is tailored for a different subset of the CNN convolutional layers. Using the same FPGA resources as a single large processor, multiple smaller specialized processors increase computational efficiency and lead to a higher overall throughput. Our design methodology achieves 3.8x higher throughput than the state-of-the-art approach on evaluating the popular AlexNet CNN on a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. For the more recent SqueezeNet and GoogLeNet, the speedups are 2.2x and 2.0x.","author":["Yongming Shen","Michael Ferdman","Peter Milder"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   535\u2013547","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080221"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Jorge Albericio, Patrick Judd, Tayler Hetherington, Tor Aamodt, Natalie Enright Jerger, and Andreas Moshovos. 2016.

A variety of applications now run simultaneously on an ARM-based processor. For example, devices on the edge of the Internet are provided with higher horsepower to be entrusted with storing, processing and analyzing data collected from IoT devices. This significantly improves efficiency and reduces the amount of data that needs to be transported to the cloud for data processing, analysis and storage. However, commodity OSes are prone to compromise. Once they are exploited, attackers can access the data on these devices. Since the data stored and processed on the devices can be sensitive, left untackled, this is particularly disconcerting. In this paper, we propose a new system, TrustShadow that shields legacy applications from untrusted OSes. TrustShadow takes advantage of ARM TrustZone technology and partitions resources into the secure and normal worlds. In the secure world, TrustShadow constructs a trusted execution environment for security-critical applications. This trusted environment is maintained by a lightweight runtime system that coordinates the communication between applications and the ordinary OS running in the normal world. The runtime system does not provide system services itself. Rather, it forwards requests for system services to the ordinary OS, and verifies the correctness of the responses. To demonstrate the efficiency of this design, we prototyped TrustShadow on a real chip board with ARM TrustZone support, and evaluated its performance using both microbenchmarks and real-world applications. We showed TrustShadow introduces only negligible overhead to real-world applications.","author":["Le Guan","Peng Liu","Xinyu Xing","Xinyang Ge","Shengzhi Zhang","Meng Yu","Trent Jaeger"],"issue":["MobiSys '17: Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services","June 2017","Pages   488\u2013501","https://doi.org/10.1145/3081333.3081349"],"date":"16 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Apache Software Foundation.

This creates a strong need to understand traffic patterns using ubiquitous sensors to allow city officials to be better informed when planning urban construction and to provide an understanding of the traffic dynamics in the city. In this study, we propose our framework ITSKG (Imagery-based Traffic Sensing Knowledge Graph) which utilizes the stationary traffic camera information as sensors to understand the traffic patterns. The proposed system extracts image-based features from traffic camera images, adds a semantic layer to the sensor data for traffic information, and then labels traffic imagery with semantic labels such as congestion. We share a prototype example to highlight the novelty of our system and provide an online demo to enable users to gain a better understanding of our system. This framework adds a new dimension to existing traffic modeling systems by incorporating dynamic image-based features as well as creating a knowledge graph to add a layer of abstraction to understand and interpret concepts like congestion to the traffic event detection system.","author":["RoopTeja Muppalla","Sarasi Lalithsena","Tanvi Banerjee","Amit Sheth"],"issue":["WebSci '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Web Science Conference","June 2017","Pages   431\u2013436","https://doi.org/10.1145/3091478.3162384"],"date":"25 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Pramod Anantharam, Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan, Surendra Marupudi, Amit P Sheth, and Tanvi Banerjee. 2016.

We first show that HTM transactions can be ordered using existing processor instructions without any hardware changes. In contrast, existing solutions posit changes to HTM mechanisms in the form of special instructions or modified functionality. We exploit the ordering mechanism to design a novel persistence method that decouples HTM concurrency from back-end NVM operations. Failure atomicity is achieved using redo logging coupled with aliasing to guard against mistimed cache evictions. Our algorithm uses efficient lock-free mechanisms with bounded static memory requirements. We evaluated our approach using both micro-benchmarks, and, benchmarks in the STAMP suite, and showed that it compares well with standard (volatile) HTM transactions. We also showed that it yields significant gains in throughput and latency in comparison with persistent transactional locking.","author":["Ellis Giles","Kshitij Doshi","Peter Varman"],"issue":["ISMM 2017: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management","June 2017","Pages   70\u201381","https://doi.org/10.1145/3092255.3092270"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"H.

In recent years, the possibility of implementing DL technologies on mobile devices has attracted significant attention. Thanks to this technology, portable devices may become smart objects capable of learning and acting. The path toward these exciting future scenarios, however, entangles a number of important research challenges. DL architectures and algorithms are hardly adapted to the storage and computation resources of a mobile device. Therefore, there is a need for new generations of mobile processors and chipsets, small footprint learning and inference algorithms, new models of collaborative and distributed processing, and a number of other fundamental building blocks. This survey reports the state of the art in this exciting research area, looking back to the evolution of neural networks, and arriving to the most recent results in terms of methodologies, technologies, and applications for mobile environments.","author":["Kaoru Ota","Minh Son Dao","Vasileios Mezaris","Francesco G.

Their considerable computational requirements stretch the capabilities of even modern computing platforms. We propose an approximate multiplier that exploits the inherent application resilience to error and utilizes the notion of computation sharing to achieve improved energy consumption for neural networks. We also propose a Multiplier-less Artificial Neuron (MAN), which is even more compact and energy efficient. We also propose a network retraining methodology to recover some of the accuracy loss due to the use of these approximate multipliers. We evaluated the proposed algorithm/design on several recognition applications. The results show that we achieve \u223c33%, \u223c32%, and \u223c25% reduction in power consumption and \u223c33%, \u223c34%, and \u223c27% reduction in area, respectively, for 12-, 8-, and 4-bit MAN, with a maximum \u223c2.4% loss in accuracy compared to a conventional neuron implementation of equivalent bit precision. These comparisons were performed under iso-speed conditions.","author":["Syed Shakib Sarwar","Swagath Venkataramani","Aayush Ankit","Anand Raghunathan","Kaushik Roy"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 14","Issue 2","July 2018","Article No.: 16","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3097264"],"date":"12 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Handwritten Digit Recognition Dataset MNIST.

Tick applies a number of hardware and software co-design techniques to ensure low latency, including multi-clock-domain pipelining, field-based processing pipeline, separation of data and control flows, etc. We have implemented Tick and validated its effectiveness through extensive evaluations as well as two prototypes of 802.11ac SISO/MIMO and 802.11a/g full-duplex.","author":["Haoyang Wu","Tao Wang","Zengwen Yuan","Chunyi Peng","Zhiwei Li","Zhaowei Tan","Boyan Ding","Xiaoguang Li","Yuanjie Li","Jun Liu","Songwu Lu"],"issue":["MobiCom '17: Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking","October 2017","Pages   101\u2013113","https://doi.org/10.1145/3117811.3117834"],"date":"04 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Analog Devices. 2017.

The Cycletron is conceptually parallel to a tool like Google's n-gram viewer [1] in that it allows users to track the usage of key terms in a text. The Cycletron departs from the n-gram viewer in its use of network graph centrality measures to identify these key terms in a natural language text and its novel visualization of results, which at root, attempts to disentangle and flatten the complexity of the network graph representations offered by tools such as Gephi. The development of the Cycletron was informed Bakhtin's [3] theory of dialogism, Ridolfo and DeVoss' [4] theory on rhetorical velocity, network graph theory, and North American genre theory. Consequently, this article will explain how theory and design cohere in the Cycletron app and argue for its theory-building.","author":["Ryan M.

However, such videos usually require extremely high bitrate which hinders their widely spread over the Internet. Tile-based viewport adaptive streaming is a promising way to deliver 360-degree video due to its on-request portion downloading. But it is not trivial for it to achieve good Quality of Experience (QoE) because Internet request-reply delay is usually much higher than motion-to-photon latency. In this paper, we leverage a probabilistic approach to pre-fetch tiles countering viewport prediction error, and design a QoE-driven viewport adaptation system, 360ProbDASH. It treats user's head movement as probability events, and constructs a probabilistic model to depict the distribution of viewport prediction error. A QoE-driven optimization framework is proposed to minimize total expected distortion of pre-fetched tiles. Besides, to smooth border effects of mixed-rate tiles, the spatial quality variance is also minimized. With the requirement of short-term viewport prediction under a small buffer, it applies a target-buffer-based rate adaptation algorithm to ensure continuous playback. We implement 360ProbDASH prototype and carry out extensive experiments on a simulation test-bed and real-world Internet with real user's head movement traces. The experimental results demonstrate that 360ProbDASH achieves at almost 39% gains on viewport PSNR, and 46% reduction on spatial quality variance against the existed viewport adaptation methods.","author":["Lan Xie","Zhimin Xu","Yixuan Ban","Xinggong Zhang","Zongming Guo"],"issue":["MM '17: Proceedings of the 25th ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2017","Pages   315\u2013323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3123266.3123291"],"date":"19 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"ISO/IEC 23009--1:2014/Amd 2:2015 Spatial Relationship Description, Generalized URL Parameters and Other Extensions.","order":1},{"text":"S.

VR videos are often characterized by a poor quality of experience, due to the high bandwidth required to stream the 360\u00b0 video. To overcome this issue, we spatially divide the VR video into tiles, so that each temporal segment is composed of several spatial tiles. Only the tiles belonging to the viewport, the region of the video watched by the user, are streamed at the highest quality. The other tiles are instead streamed at a lower quality. We also propose an algorithm to predict the future viewport position and minimize quality transitions during viewport changes. The video is delivered using the server push feature of the HTTP/2 protocol. Instead of retrieving each tile individually, the client issues a single push request to the server, so that all the required tiles are automatically pushed back to back. This approach allows to increase the achieved throughput, especially in mobile, high RTT networks. In this paper, we detail the proposed framework and present a prototype developed to test its performance using real-world 4G bandwidth traces. Particularly, our approach can save bandwidth up to 35% without severely impacting the quality viewed by the user, when compared to a traditional non-tiled VR streaming solution. Moreover, in high RTT conditions, our HTTP/2 approach can reach 3 times the throughput of tiled streaming over HTTP/1.1, and consistently reduce freeze time. These results represent a major improvement for the efficient delivery of 360\u00b0 VR videos over the Internet.","author":["Stefano Petrangeli","Viswanathan Swaminathan","Mohammad Hosseini","Filip De Turck"],"issue":["MM '17: Proceedings of the 25th ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2017","Pages   306\u2013314","https://doi.org/10.1145/3123266.3123453"],"date":"19 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"M.

In contrast to conventional planar flash memory, 3D flash memory adopts charge-trapping mechanism. NAND strings punch through multiple stacked layers to form the three-dimensional infrastructure. However, the etching processes for NAND strings are unable to produce perfectly vertical features, especially on the scale of 20 nanometers or less. The process variation will cause uneven distribution of electrons, which poses a threat to the integrity of data stored in flash.This paper present P-Alloc, a process-variation tolerant reliability management strategy for 3D charge-trapping flash memory. P-Alloc offers both hardware and software support to allocate data to the 3D flash in the presence of process variation. P-Alloc predicts the state of a physical page, i.e., the basic unit for each write or read operation in flash memory, and tries to assign critical data to more reliable pages. A hardware-based voltage threshold compensation scheme is also proposed to further reduce the faults. We demonstrate the viability of the proposed scheme using a variety of realistic workloads. Our extensive evaluations show that, P-Alloc significantly enhances the reliability and reduces the access latency compared to the baseline scheme.","author":["Yi Wang","Lisha Dong","Rui Mao"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 16","Issue 5s","October 2017","Article No.: 142","pp   1\u201319","https://doi.org/10.1145/3126554"],"date":"27 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"H.-Y.

SiP devices and materials, however, are still evolving, and dealing with optical data transmission on chip makes designers and researchers face a whole new set of obstacles and challenges.

In this paper, we provide an exhaustive review of recently proposed ONoC architectures, discuss their strengths and weaknesses, and outline active research areas. Moreover, we discuss recent research efforts in key enabling technologies, such as on-chip and adaptive laser sources, automatic synthesis tools, and ring heating techniques, which are essential to enable a widespread commercial adoption of ONoCs in the future.","author":["Sebastian Werner","Javier Navaridas","Mikel Luj\u00e1n"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 50","Issue 6","January 2018","Article No.: 89","pp   1\u201337","https://doi.org/10.1145/3131346"],"date":"06 December 2017","ref":[{"text":"George Kurian, Jason E.

The core of the proposed framework is a neural network model, also called HIN2Vec, designed to capture the rich semantics embedded in HINs by exploiting different types of relationships among nodes. Given a set of relationships specified in forms of meta-paths in an HIN, HIN2Vec carries out multiple prediction training tasks jointly based on a target set of relationships to learn latent vectors of nodes and meta-paths in the HIN. In addition to model design, several issues unique to HIN2Vec, including regularization of meta-path vectors, node type selection in negative sampling, and cycles in random walks, are examined. To validate our ideas, we learn latent vectors of nodes using four large-scale real HIN datasets, including Blogcatalog, Yelp, DBLP and U.S. Patents, and use them as features for multi-label node classification and link prediction applications on those networks. Empirical results show that HIN2Vec soundly outperforms the state-of-the-art representation learning models for network data, including DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec, PTE, HINE and ESim, by 6.6% to 23.8% of $micro$-$f_1$ in multi-label node classification and 5% to 70.8% of $MAP$ in link prediction.","author":["Tao-yang Fu","Wang-Chien Lee","Zhen Lei"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   1797\u20131806","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132953"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"2009.

Several memory vendors have also started to integrate computation logics into the memory, such as Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC), the latest version of which supports up to 18 in-memory atomic instructions. Although industry prototypes have motivated studies for investigating efficient methods and architectures for PIM, researchers have not proposed a systematic way for identifying the benefits of instruction-level PIM offloading. As a result, compiler support for recognizing offloading candidates and utilizing instruction-level PIM offloading is unavailable. In this article, we analyze the advantages of instruction-level PIM offloading in the context of HMC-atomic instructions for graph-computing applications and propose CAIRO, a compiler-assisted technique and decision model for enabling instruction-level offloading of PIM without any burden on programmers. To develop CAIRO, we analyzed how instruction offloading enables performance gain in both CPU and GPU workloads. Our studies show that performance gain from bandwidth savings, the ratio of number of cache misses to total cache accesses, and the overhead of host atomic instructions are the key factors in selecting an offloading candidate. Based on our analytical models, we characterize the properties of beneficial and nonbeneficial candidates for offloading. We evaluate CAIRO with 27 multithreaded CPU and 36 GPU benchmarks. In our evaluation, CAIRO not only doubles the speedup for a set of PIM-beneficial workloads by exploiting HMC-atomic instructions but also prevents slowdown caused by incorrect offloading decisions for other workloads.","author":["Ramyad Hadidi","Lifeng Nai","Hyojong Kim","Hyesoon Kim"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 14","Issue 4","December 2017","Article No.: 48","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/3155287"],"date":"20 December 2017","ref":[{"text":"2017.

However, precise trend prediction is very difficult since the highly volatile and non-stationary nature of the stock market. Exploding information on the Internet together with the advancing development of natural language processing and text mining techniques have enabled investors to unveil market trends and volatility from online content. Unfortunately, the quality, trustworthiness, and comprehensiveness of online content related to stock market vary drastically, and a large portion consists of the low-quality news, comments, or even rumors. To address this challenge, we imitate the learning process of human beings facing such chaotic online news, driven by three principles: sequential content dependency, diverse influence, and effective and efficient learning. In this paper, to capture the first two principles, we designed a Hybrid Attention Networks(HAN) to predict the stock trend based on the sequence of recent related news. Moreover, we apply the self-paced learning mechanism to imitate the third principle. Extensive experiments on real-world stock market data demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. A further simulation illustrates that a straightforward trading strategy based on our proposed framework can significantly increase the annualized return.","author":["Ziniu Hu","Weiqing Liu","Jiang Bian","Xuanzhe Liu","Tie-Yan Liu"],"issue":["WSDM '18: Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2018","Pages   261\u2013269","https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159690"],"date":"02 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"K.

We show that our power-laws fit the real data very well resulting in correlation coefficients of 96% or higher.Our observations provide a novel perspective of the structure of the Internet. The power-laws describe concisely skewed distributions of graph properties such as the node outdegree. In addition, these power-laws can be used to estimate important parameters such as the average neighborhood size, and facilitate the design and the performance analysis of protocols. Furthermore, we can use them to generate and select realistic topologies for simulation purposes.","author":["Michalis Faloutsos","Petros Faloutsos","Christos Faloutsos"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '99: Proceedings of the conference on Applications, technologies, architectures, and protocols for computer communication","August 1999","Pages   251\u2013262","https://doi.org/10.1145/316188.316229"],"date":"30 August 1999","ref":[{"text":"K.

Applications of AGR are increasingly being explored in domains such as security, marketing, and social robotics. However, little is known about stakeholders' perceptions and attitudes towards AGR and how this technology might disproportionately affect vulnerable communities. To begin to address these gaps, we interviewed 13 transgender individuals, including three transgender technology designers, about their perceptions and attitudes towards AGR. We found that transgender individuals have overwhelmingly negative attitudes towards AGR and fundamentally question whether it can accurately recognize such a subjective aspect of their identity. They raised concerns about privacy and potential harms that can result from being incorrectly gendered, or misgendered, by technology. We present a series of recommendations on how to accommodate gender diversity when designing new digital systems.","author":["Foad Hamidi","Morgan Klaus Scheuerman","Stacy M.

Previous works mainly focus on how to overcome the possible endurance issues of PRAM while both main memory and storage own a partition on the same PRAM device. However, a holistic software-level system design should be proposed to fully exploit the benefit of PRAM. This article proposes a <underline>uni</underline>on <underline>stor</underline>age <underline>f</underline>ile <underline>s</underline>ystem (UnistorFS), which aims to jointly manage the PRAM resource for main memory and storage. The proposed UnistorFS realizes the concept of using the PRAM resource as memory and storage interchangeably to achieve resource sharing while main memory and storage coexist on the same PRAM device with no partition or logical boundary. This approach not only enables PRAM resource sharing but also eliminates unnecessary data movements between main memory and storage since they are already in the same address space and can be accessed directly. At the same time, the proposed UnistorFS ensures the persistence of file data and sanity of the file system after power recycling. A series of experiments was conducted on a modified Linux kernel. The results show that the proposed UnistorFS can eliminate unnecessary memory accesses and outperform other PRAM-based file systems for 0.2--8.7 times in terms of read/write performance.","author":["Shuo-Han Chen","Tseng-Yi Chen","Yuan-Hao Chang","Hsin-Wen Wei","Wei-Kuan Shih"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 14","Issue 1","April 2018","Article No.: 3","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/3177918"],"date":"26 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"N.

Despite this attention, state-of-the-art Twitter sentiment analysis approaches perform relatively poorly with reported classification accuracies often below 70%, adversely impacting applications of the derived sentiment information. In this research, we investigate the unique challenges presented by Twitter sentiment analysis and review the literature to determine how the devised approaches have addressed these challenges. To assess the state-of-the-art in Twitter sentiment analysis, we conduct a benchmark evaluation of 28 top academic and commercial systems in tweet sentiment classification across five distinctive data sets. We perform an error analysis to uncover the causes of commonly occurring classification errors. To further the evaluation, we apply select systems in an event detection case study. Finally, we summarize the key trends and takeaways from the review and benchmark evaluation and provide suggestions to guide the design of the next generation of approaches.","author":["David Zimbra","Ahmed Abbasi","Daniel Zeng","Hsinchun Chen"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems","Volume 9","Issue 2","September 2018","Article No.: 5","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/3185045"],"date":"24 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"A.

In this paper, we propose a method to use multi-level, embedded nonvolatile memory (eNVM) to eliminate all off-chip weight accesses. The use of multi-level memory cells increases the probability of faults. Therefore, we co-design the weights and memories such that their properties complement each other and the faults result in no noticeable NN accuracy loss. In the extreme case, the weights in fully connected layers can be stored using a single transistor. With weight pruning and clustering, we show our technique reduces the memory area by over an order of magnitude compared to an SRAM baseline. In the case of VGG16 (130M weights), we are able to store all the weights in 4.9 mm2, well within the area allocated to SRAM in modern NN accelerators [6].","author":["Marco Donato","Brandon Reagen","Lillian Pentecost","Udit Gupta","David Brooks","Gu-Yeon Wei"],"issue":["DAC '18: Proceedings of the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2018","Article No.: 169","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3196083"],"date":"24 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"I.

Revealing its structure or weights would leak confidential information. In this paper we present novel reverse-engineering attacks on CNNs running on a hardware accelerator, where an adversary can feed inputs to the accelerator and observe the resulting off-chip memory accesses. Our study shows that even with data encryption, the adversary can infer the underlying network structure by exploiting the memory and timing side-channels. We further identify the information leakage on the values of weights when a CNN accelerator performs dynamic zero pruning for off-chip memory accesses. Overall, this work reveals the importance of hiding off-chip memory access pattern to truly protect confidential CNN models.","author":["Weizhe Hua","Zhiru Zhang","G.

Chameleon combines the best aspects of generic SFE protocols with the ones that are based upon additive secret sharing. In particular, the framework performs linear operations in the ring $\\mathbbZ _2^l $ using additively secret shared values and nonlinear operations using Yao's Garbled Circuits or the Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson protocol. Chameleon departs from the common assumption of additive or linear secret sharing models where three or more parties need to communicate in the online phase: the framework allows two parties with private inputs to communicate in the online phase under the assumption of a third node generating correlated randomness in an offline phase. Almost all of the heavy cryptographic operations are precomputed in an offline phase which substantially reduces the communication overhead. Chameleon is both scalable and significantly more efficient than the ABY framework (NDSS'15) it is based on. Our framework supports signed fixed-point numbers. In particular, Chameleon's vector dot product of signed fixed-point numbers improves the efficiency of mining and classification of encrypted data for algorithms based upon heavy matrix multiplications. Our evaluation of Chameleon on a 5 layer convolutional deep neural network shows 133x and 4.2x faster executions than Microsoft CryptoNets (ICML'16) and MiniONN (CCS'17), respectively.","author":["M.

Active illumination time-of-flight sensors in particular have become widely used to estimate a 3D representation of a scene. However, the maximum range, density of acquired spatial samples, and overall acquisition time of these sensors is fundamentally limited by the minimum signal required to estimate depth reliably. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method for photon-efficient 3D imaging which leverages sensor fusion and computational reconstruction to rapidly and robustly estimate a dense depth map from low photon counts. Our sensor fusion approach uses measurements of single photon arrival times from a low-resolution single-photon detector array and an intensity image from a conventional high-resolution camera. Using a multi-scale deep convolutional network, we jointly process the raw measurements from both sensors and output a high-resolution depth map. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we implement a hardware prototype and show results using captured data. At low signal-to-background levels, our depth reconstruction algorithm with sensor fusion outperforms other methods for depth estimation from noisy measurements of photon arrival times.","author":["David B.

Deep Learning (DL) practitioners either need to change to less desired network architectures, or nontrivially dissect a network across multiGPUs. These distract DL practitioners from concentrating on their original machine learning tasks. We present SuperNeurons: a dynamic GPU memory scheduling runtime to enable the network training far beyond the GPU DRAM capacity. SuperNeurons features 3 memory optimizations, Liveness Analysis, Unified Tensor Pool, and Cost-Aware Recomputation; together they effectively reduce the network-wide peak memory usage down to the maximal memory usage among layers. We also address the performance issues in these memory-saving techniques. Given the limited GPU DRAM, SuperNeurons not only provisions the necessary memory for the training, but also dynamically allocates the memory for convolution workspaces to achieve the high performance. Evaluations against Caffe, Torch, MXNet and TensorFlow have demonstrated that SuperNeurons trains at least 3.2432 deeper network than current ones with the leading performance. Particularly, SuperNeurons can train ResNet2500 that has 104 basic network layers on a 12GB K40c.","author":["Linnan Wang","Jinmian Ye","Yiyang Zhao","Wei Wu","Ang Li","Shuaiwen Leon Song","Zenglin Xu","Tim Kraska"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 53","Issue 1","January 2018","pp   41\u201353","https://doi.org/10.1145/3200691.3178491"],"date":"10 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mxnet's graph representation of neural networks. http://mxnet.io/architecture/note_memory.html.","order":1},{"text":"M.

In this paper, we design a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) framework to accelerate graph algorithms based on the edge-centric paradigm. Our design is flexible for accelerating general graph algorithms with various vertex attributes and update propagation functions, such as Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication (SpMV), PageRank (PR), Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP), and Weakly Connected Component (WCC). The target platform consists of large external memory to store the graph data and FPGA to accelerate the processing. By taking an edge-centric graph algorithm and hardware resource constraints as inputs, our framework can determine the optimal design parameters and produce an optimized Register-Transfer Level (RTL) FPGA accelerator design. To improve data locality and increase parallelism, we partition the input graph into non-overlapping partitions. This enables our framework to efficiently buffer vertex data in the on-chip memory of FPGA and exploit both inter-partition and intra-partition parallelism. Further, we propose an optimized data layout to improve external memory performance and reduce data communication between FPGA and external memory. Based on our design methodology, we accelerate two fundamental graph algorithms for performance evaluation: Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication (SpMV) and PageRank (PR). Experimental results show that our accelerators sustain a high throughput of up to 2250 Million Traversed Edges Per Second (MTEPS) and 2487 MTEPS for SpMV and PR, respectively. Compared with several highly-optimized multi-core designs, our FPGA framework achieves up to 20.5\u00d7 speedup for SpMV, and 17.7\u00d7 speedup for PR, respectively; compared with two state-of-the-art FPGA frameworks, our designs demonstrate up to 5.3\u00d7 and 1.8\u00d7 throughput improvement for SpMV and PR, respectively.","author":["Shijie Zhou","Rajgopal Kannan","Hanqing Zeng","Viktor K.

The emerging high-level synthesis tools such as the Intel OpenCL SDK for FPGA highlight a streamlined design flow to facilitate the use of FPGAs in scientific computing. Investigating the characteristics of supercomputing applications, such as nuclear reactor simulation, with the emerging HLS development flow is important for researchers to evaluate and adopt FPGA-based heterogeneous programming models in research facilities and laboratories. In this paper, we evaluate the OpenCL-based FPGA design of a nuclear reactor simulation application RSBench. We describe the OpenCL implementations and optimization methods on an Intel Arria10-based FPGA platform. Compared with the na\u00efve OpenCL kernel, the optimizations of the kernel increase the performance by a factor of 295 on the FPGA. Compared with an Intel Xeon 16-core CPU and an Nvidia K80 GPU, the performance per watt on the FPGA is 3.59 X better than the CPU and 5.8X lower than the GPU.","author":["Zheming Jin","Hal Finkel"],"issue":["IWOCL '18: Proceedings of the International Workshop on OpenCL","May 2018","Article No.: 2","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/3204919.3204921"],"date":"14 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"Schatz, M.C., Trapnell, C., Delcher, A.L. and Varshney, A., 2007.

Finite-difference approximations to systems of partial differential equations typically lead to such recurrence equations. The structure of such a system is specified by a dependence graph G having m vertices, in which the directed edges are labeled with integer n-vectors. For certain choices of the set R, necessary and sufficient conditions on G are given for the existence of a schedule to compute all the quantities ai(p) explicitly from their defining equations. Properties of such schedules, such as the degree to which computation can proceed \u201cin parallel,\u201d are characterized.

In a common environment between multiple users with various types of applications, due to the lower number of resources than the number of jobs, there will be multi-wave jobs. Shuffling as the longest phase of running a job has the most adverse effect (network traffic) on the job execution time. On one hand, due to the dependency of shuffle phase to reduce task, the shuffle phase could not start until the reduce task being scheduled. On the other hand, the static scheduling of reduce tasks results in loss of reduce slots. This paper presents our ongoing effort in the designing an intelligent service in which the sort/merge and shuffle phases are completely independent of map and reduce phases and could act in parallel with map and reduce phases. This parallelism mitigates the job completion time.","author":["Neda Maleki","Amir Masoud Rahmani","Mauro Conti"],"issue":["HPDC '18: Proceedings of the 27th International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing","June 2018","Pages   1\u20132","https://doi.org/10.1145/3220192.3220193"],"date":"11 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"T.

However, poorly-designed regexes can yield exponentially many matching steps, and lead to regex Denial-of-Service (ReDoS) attacks under well-conceived string inputs. This paper presents Rescue, a three-phase gray-box analytical technique, to automatically generate ReDoS strings to highlight vulnerabilities of given regexes. Rescue systematically seeds (by a genetic search), incubates (by another genetic search), and finally pumps (by a regex-dedicated algorithm) for generating strings with maximized search time. We implemenmted the Rescue tool and evaluated it against 29,088 practical regexes in real-world projects. The evaluation results show that Rescue found 49% more attack strings compared with the best existing technique, and applying Rescue to popular GitHub projects discovered ten previously unknown ReDoS vulnerabilities.","author":["Yuju Shen","Yanyan Jiang","Chang Xu","Ping Yu","Xiaoxing Ma","Jian Lu"],"issue":["ASE 2018: Proceedings of the 33rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automated Software Engineering","September 2018","Pages   225\u2013235","https://doi.org/10.1145/3238147.3238159"],"date":"03 September 2018","ref":[{"text":"Michela Becchi and Srihari Cadambi. 2007.

Several studies showed that recommender systems are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, in which an attacker injects fake data to a recommender system such that the system makes recommendations as the attacker desires. However, these poisoning attacks are either agnostic to recommendation algorithms or optimized to recommender systems (e.g., association-rule-based or matrix-factorization-based recommender systems) that are not graph-based. Like association-rule-based and matrix-factorization-based recommender systems, graph-based recommender system is also deployed in practice, e.g., eBay, Huawei App Store (a big app store in China). However, how to design optimized poisoning attacks for graph-based recommender systems is still an open problem. In this work, we perform a systematic study on poisoning attacks to graph-based recommender systems. We consider an attacker's goal is to promote a target item to be recommended to as many users as possible. To achieve this goal, our a\"acks inject fake users with carefully crafted rating scores to the recommender system. Due to limited resources and to avoid detection, we assume the number of fake users that can be injected into the system is bounded. The key challenge is how to assign rating scores to the fake users such that the target item is recommended to as many normal users as possible. To address the challenge, we formulate the poisoning attacks as an optimization problem, solving which determines the rating scores for the fake users. We also propose techniques to solve the optimization problem. We evaluate our attacks and compare them with existing attacks under white-box (recommendation algorithm and its parameters are known), gray-box (recommendation algorithm is known but its parameters are unknown), and blackbox (recommendation algorithm is unknown) settings using two real-world datasets. Our results show that our attack is effective and outperforms existing attacks for graph-based recommender systems. For instance, when 1% of users are injected fake users, our attack can make a target item recommended to 580 times more normal users in certain scenarios.","author":["Minghong Fang","Guolei Yang","Neil Zhenqiang Gong","Jia Liu"],"issue":["ACSAC '18: Proceedings of the 34th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference","December 2018","Pages   381\u2013392","https://doi.org/10.1145/3274694.3274706"],"date":"03 December 2018","ref":[{"text":"2018.

Despite their excellent performance and energy efficiency, however, systolic DNN accelerators are naturally facing a resource under-utilization problem - not all DNN models can well match the fixed processing elements (PEs) in a systolic array implementation, because typical DNN models vary significantly from applications to applications. Consequently, state-of-the-art hardware solutions are not expected to deliver the nominal (peak) performance and energy efficiency as claimed because of resource under-utilization. To deal with this dilemma, this study proposes a novel systolic DNN accelerator with a flexible computation mapping and dataflow scheme. By providing three types of parallelism and dynamically switching among them: channel-direction mapping, planar mapping, and hybrid, our accelerator offers the adaptability to match various DNN models to the fixed hardware resources, and thus, enables flexibly exploiting PE provision and data reuse for a wide range of DNN models to achieve optimal performance and energy efficiency.","author":["Bosheng Liu","Xiaoming Chen","Ying Wang","Yinhe Han","Jiajun Li","Haobo Xu","Xiaowei Li"],"issue":["ASPDAC '19: Proceedings of the 24th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2019","Pages   733\u2013738","https://doi.org/10.1145/3287624.3287638"],"date":"21 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"K.

Graph similarity/distance computation, such as Graph Edit Distance (GED) and Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS), is the core operation of graph similarity search and many other applications, but very costly to compute in practice. Inspired by the recent success of neural network approaches to several graph applications, such as node or graph classification, we propose a novel neural network based approach to address this classic yet challenging graph problem, aiming to alleviate the computational burden while preserving a good performance. The proposed approach, called SimGNN, combines two strategies. First, we design a learnable embedding function that maps every graph into an embedding vector, which provides a global summary of a graph. A novel attention mechanism is proposed to emphasize the important nodes with respect to a specific similarity metric. Second, we design a pairwise node comparison method to supplement the graph-level embeddings with fine-grained node-level information. Our model achieves better generalization on unseen graphs, and in the worst case runs in quadratic time with respect to the number of nodes in two graphs. Taking GED computation as an example, experimental results on three real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Specifically, our model achieves smaller error rate and great time reduction compared against a series of baselines, including several approximation algorithms on GED computation, and many existing graph neural network based models. Our study suggests SimGNN provides a new direction for future research on graph similarity computation and graph similarity search.","author":["Yunsheng Bai","Hao Ding","Song Bian","Ting Chen","Yizhou Sun","Wei Wang"],"issue":["WSDM '19: Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","January 2019","Pages   384\u2013392","https://doi.org/10.1145/3289600.3290967"],"date":"30 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"David B Blumenthal and Johann Gamper. 2018.

Principles for human-AI interaction have been discussed in the human-computer interaction community for over two decades, but more study and innovation are needed in light of advances in AI and the growing uses of AI technologies in human-facing applications. We propose 18 generally applicable design guidelines for human-AI interaction. These guidelines are validated through multiple rounds of evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners who tested the guidelines against 20 popular AI-infused products. The results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our knowledge, highlighting opportunities for further research. Based on the evaluations, we believe the set of design guidelines can serve as a resource to practitioners working on the design of applications and features that harness AI technologies, and to researchers interested in the further development of human-AI interaction design principles.","author":["Saleema Amershi","Dan Weld","Mihaela Vorvoreanu","Adam Fourney","Besmira Nushi","Penny Collisson","Jina Suh","Shamsi Iqbal","Paul N.

The computational complexity of these algorithms and a need for high energy-efficiency has led to a surge in research on hardware accelerators. % for this paradigm. To reduce the latency and energy costs of accessing DRAM, most DNN accelerators are spatial in nature, with hundreds of processing elements (PE) operating in parallel and communicating with each other directly. DNNs are evolving at a rapid rate, and it is common to have convolution, recurrent, pooling, and fully-connected layers with varying input and filter sizes in the most recent topologies.They may be dense or sparse. They can also be partitioned in myriad ways (within and across layers) to exploit data reuse (weights and intermediate outputs). All of the above can lead to different dataflow patterns within the accelerator substrate. Unfortunately, most DNN accelerators support only fixed dataflow patterns internally as they perform a careful co-design of the PEs and the network-on-chip (NoC). In fact, the majority of them are only optimized for traffic within a convolutional layer. This makes it challenging to map arbitrary dataflows on the fabric efficiently, and can lead to underutilization of the available compute resources. DNN accelerators need to be programmable to enable mass deployment. For them to be programmable, they need to be configurable internally to support the various dataflow patterns that could be mapped over them. To address this need, we present MAERI, which is a DNN accelerator built with a set of modular and configurable building blocks that can easily support myriad DNN partitions and mappings by appropriately configuring tiny switches. MAERI provides 8-459% better utilization across multiple dataflow mappings over baselines with rigid NoC fabrics.","author":["Hyoukjun Kwon","Ananda Samajdar","Tushar Krishna"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 53","Issue 2","February 2018","pp   461\u2013475","https://doi.org/10.1145/3296957.3173176"],"date":"19 March 2018","ref":[{"text":"K.

However, the high efficiency and high density advantages of ReRAM have not been fully utilized due to the huge communication demands among PEs and the overhead of peripheral circuits. In this paper, we propose a full system stack solution, composed of a reconfigurable architecture design, Field Programmable Synapse Array (FPSA) and its software system including neural synthesizer, temporal-to-spatial mapper, and placement & routing. We highly leverage the software system to make the hardware design compact and efficient. To satisfy the high-performance communication demand, we optimize it with a reconfigurable routing architecture and the placement & routing tool. To improve the computational density, we greatly simplify the PE circuit with the spiking schema and then adopt neural synthesizer to enable the high density computation-resources to support different kinds of NN operations. In addition, we provide spiking memory blocks (SMBs) and configurable logic blocks (CLBs) in hardware and leverage the temporal-to-spatial mapper to utilize them to balance the storage and computation requirements of NN. Owing to the end-to-end software system, we can efficiently deploy existing deep neural networks to FPSA. Evaluations show that, compared to one of state-of-the-art ReRAM-based NN accelerators, PRIME, the computational density of FPSA improves by 31x; for representative NNs, its inference performance can achieve up to 1000x speedup.","author":["Yu Ji","Youyang Zhang","Xinfeng Xie","Shuangchen Li","Peiqi Wang","Xing Hu","Youhui Zhang","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["ASPLOS '19: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","April 2019","Pages   733\u2013747","https://doi.org/10.1145/3297858.3304048"],"date":"04 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"Martin Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, Manjunath Kudlur, Josh Levenberg, Rajat Monga, Sherry Moore, Derek Gordon Murray, Benoit Steiner, Paul A.

The primary motivation for this work stems from the observation that for a variety of analytics over databases, their data-intensive tasks can be decomposed into group-by aggregates over the join of the input database relations. We exemplify the versatility and competitiveness of LMFAO for a handful of widely used analytics: learning ridge linear regression, classification trees, regression trees, and the structure of Bayesian networks using Chow-Liu trees; and data cubes used for exploration in data warehousing. LMFAO consists of several layers of logical and code optimizations that systematically exploit sharing of computation, parallelism, and code specialization. We conducted two types of performance benchmarks. In experiments with four datasets, LMFAO outperforms by several orders of magnitude on one hand, a commercial database system and MonetDB for computing batches of aggregates, and on the other hand, TensorFlow, Scikit, R, and AC/DC for learning a variety of models over databases.","author":["Maximilian Schleich","Dan Olteanu","Mahmoud Abo Khamis","Hung Q.

The decade-old idea of leveraging in-memory processing to eliminate substantial data movements has returned and led extensive research activities. The effectiveness of in-memory processing heavily relies on memory scalability, which cannot be satisfied by traditional memory technologies. Emerging non-volatile memories (eNVMs) that pose appealing qualities such as excellent scaling and low energy consumption, on the other hand, have been heavily investigated and explored for realizing in-memory processing architecture. In this paper, we summarize the recent research progress in eNVM-based in-memory processing from various aspects, including the adopted memory technologies, locations of the in-memory processing in the system, supported arithmetics, as well as applied applications.","author":["Bing Li","Bonan Yan","Hai Li"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '19: Proceedings of the 2019 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2019","Pages   381\u2013386","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299874.3319452"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"David Patterson, Thomas Anderson, Neal Cardwell, Richard Fromm, Kimberly Keeton, Christoforos Kozyrakis, Randi Thomas, and Katherine Yelick.

The paper discusses three challenges that touch upon aspects that are unique to cyber-physical systems, namely, devising novel compositional design methodologies, reasoning about the interaction between discrete and continuous models, and dealing with uncertainty. It then summarizes some of the approaches pursued by the research community to tackle these challenges, with the potential of fostering a new generation of methodologies, algorithms, and tools for system design. Central to the paper is a view of platforms and contracts as formal notions that can bridge the emerging area of cyber-physical system design automation with paradigms that have been successful in the field of electronic design automation.","author":["Pierluigi Nuzzo"],"issue":["ISPD '19: Proceedings of the 2019 International Symposium on Physical Design","April 2019","Pages   117\u2013121","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299902.3311070"],"date":"04 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"Rajeev Alur. 2015.

This work aims to describe a novel VQA model based on semantic concept network construction and deep walk. Extracting visual image semantic representation is a significant and effective method for spanning the semantic gap. Moreover, current research has shown that co-occurrence patterns of concepts can enhance semantic representation. This work is motivated by the challenge that semantic concepts have complex interrelations and the relationships are similar to a network. Therefore, we construct a semantic concept network adopted by leveraging Word Activation Forces (WAFs), and mine the co-occurrence patterns of semantic concepts using deep walk. Then the model performs polynomial logistic regression on the basis of the extracted deep walk vector along with the visual image feature and question feature. The proposed model effectively integrates visual and semantic features of the image and natural language question. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms competitive baselines on three benchmark image QA datasets. Furthermore, through experiments in image annotation refinement and semantic analysis on pre-labeled LabelMe dataset, we test and verify the effectiveness of our constructed concept network for mining concept co-occurrence patterns, sensible concept clusters, and hierarchies.","author":["Qun Li","Fu Xiao","Le An","Xianzhong Long","Xiaochuan Sun"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications","Volume 15","Issue 2s","August 2019","Article No.: 49","pp   1\u201319","https://doi.org/10.1145/3300938"],"date":"03 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"Aishwarya Agrawal, Dhruv Batra, Devi Parikh, and Aniruddha Kembhavi. 2018.

To evaluate a new FPGA architectural idea, one should be able to accurately obtain the area, delay, and energy consumption of the block of interest. However, current FPGA circuit design tools can only model simple, homogeneous FPGA architectures with basic logic blocks and also lack DSP and other heterogeneous block support. Modern FPGAs are instead composed of many different tiles, some of which are designed in a full custom style and some of which mix standard cell and full custom styles.To fill this modelling gap, we introduce COFFE 2, an open-source FPGA design toolset for automatic FPGA circuit design. COFFE 2 uses a mix of full custom and standard cell flows and supports not only complex logic blocks with fracturable lookup tables and hard arithmetic but also arbitrary heterogeneous blocks. To validate COFFE 2 and demonstrate its features, we design and evaluate a multi-mode Stratix III-like DSP block and several logic tiles with fracturable LUTs and hard arithmetic. We also demonstrate how COFFE 2\u2019s interface to VTR allows full evaluation of block-routing interfaces and various fracturable 6-LUT architectures.","author":["Sadegh Yazdanshenas","Vaughn Betz"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 12","Issue 1","April 2018","Article No.: 3","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/3301298"],"date":"30 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Predictive Technology Model. 2018.

We focus on sigmoid-based networks and exploit the fact that the sigmoid is the solution to a quadratic differential equation, which allows us to transform the neural network into an equivalent hybrid system. By composing the network's hybrid system with the plant's, we transform the problem into a hybrid system verification problem which can be solved using state-of-the-art reachability tools. We show that reachability is decidable for networks with one hidden layer and decidable for general networks if Schanuel's conjecture is true. We evaluate the applicability and scalability of Verisig in two case studies, one from reinforcement learning and one in which the neural network is used to approximate a model predictive controller.","author":["Radoslav Ivanov","James Weimer","Rajeev Alur","George J.

However, previous works can not effectively fit the distribution of high dimensional data and suffers from low AUC scores which measures the classification performance of imbalanced data. To solve these problems, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection model based on GAN, i.e., UAD-GAN. Specifically, we adopt transfer learning to extract visual features with pre-trained Inception-v3 model and use the discriminator to detect anomalies. UAD-GAN can fit the data distribution and detect anomalies efficiently. Extensive experiments show that UAD-GAN achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other approaches.","author":["Hanling Wang","Mingyang Li","Fei Ma","Shao-Lun Huang","Lin Zhang"],"issue":["IPSN '19: Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","April 2019","Pages   313\u2013314","https://doi.org/10.1145/3302506.3312605"],"date":"16 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"Yunqiang Chen, Xiang Sean Zhou, and Thomas S Huang. 2001.

The embedded MRAM-based neuron is modeled using precise physics equations. The simulation results exhibit the desired sigmoidal relation between the input voltages and probability of the output state. A probabilistic inference network simulator (PIN-Sim) is developed to realize a circuit-level model of an RBM utilizing resistive crossbar arrays along with differential amplifiers to implement the positive and negative weight values. The PIN-Sim is composed of five main blocks to train a DBN, evaluate its accuracy, and measure its power consumption. The MNIST dataset is leveraged to investigate the energy and accuracy tradeoffs of seven distinct network topologies in SPICE using the 14nm HP-FinFET technology library with the nominal voltage of 0.8V, in which an MRAM-based neuron is used as the activation function. The software and hardware level simulations indicate that a 784\u00d7 200\u00d7 10 topology can achieve less than 5% error rates with \u223c400pJ energy consumption. The error rates can be reduced to 2.5% by using a 784\u00d7 500\u00d7 500\u00d7 500\u00d7 10 DBN at the cost of \u223c10\u00d7 higher energy consumption and significant area overhead. Finally, the effects of specific hardware-level parameters on power dissipation and accuracy tradeoffs are identified via the developed PIN-Sim framework.","author":["Ramtin Zand","Kerem Y.

Time-of-flight-based non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging systems have recently demonstrated impressive results, but several challenges remain. Image formation and inversion models have been slow or limited by the types of hidden surfaces that can be imaged. Moreover, non-planar sampling surfaces and non-confocal scanning methods have not been supported by efficient NLOS algorithms. With this work, we introduce a wave-based image formation model for the problem of NLOS imaging. Inspired by inverse methods used in seismology, we adapt a frequency-domain method, f-k migration, for solving the inverse NLOS problem. Unlike existing NLOS algorithms, f-k migration is both fast and memory efficient, it is robust to specular and other complex reflectance properties, and we show how it can be used with non-confocally scanned measurements as well as for non-planar sampling surfaces. f-k migration is more robust to measurement noise than alternative methods, generally produces better quality reconstructions, and is easy to implement. We experimentally validate our algorithms with a new NLOS imaging system that records room-sized scenes outdoors under indirect sunlight, and scans persons wearing retroreflective clothing at interactive rates.","author":["David B.

Obtaining performance using spatial architectures while supporting diverse applications requires a flexible, high-bandwidth interconnect. Because modern CGRAs support vector units with wide datapaths, designing an interconnect that balances dynamism, communication granularity, and programmability is a challenging task. In this work, we explore the space of spatial architecture interconnect dynamism, granularity, and programmability. We start by characterizing several benchmarks' communication patterns and showing links' imbalanced bandwidth requirements, fanout, and data width. We then describe a compiler stack that maps applications to both static and dynamic networks and performs virtual channel allocation to guarantee deadlock freedom. Finally, using a cycle-accurate simulator and 28 nm ASIC synthesis, we perform a detailed performance, area, and power evaluation across the identified design space for a variety of benchmarks. We show that the best network design depends on both applications and the underlying accelerator architecture. Network performance correlates strongly with bandwidth for streaming accelerators, and scaling raw bandwidth is more area- and energy-efficient with a static network. We show that the application mapping can be optimized to move less data by using a dynamic network as a fallback from a high-bandwidth static network. This static-dynamic hybrid network provides a 1.8x energy-efficiency and 2.8x performance advantage over the purely static and purely dynamic networks, respectively.","author":["Yaqi Zhang","Alexander Rucker","Matthew Vilim","Raghu Prabhakar","William Hwang","Kunle Olukotun"],"issue":["ISCA '19: Proceedings of the 46th International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2019","Pages   615\u2013628","https://doi.org/10.1145/3307650.3322249"],"date":"22 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"Cristinel Ababei, Hamed Sajjadi Kia, Om Prakash Yadav, and Jingcao Hu. 2011.

Recently, Channel State Information (CSI) measured by WiFi networks is widely used for different sensing purposes. To get a better understanding of existing WiFi sensing technologies and future WiFi sensing trends, this survey gives a comprehensive review of the signal processing techniques, algorithms, applications, and performance results of WiFi sensing with CSI. Different WiFi sensing algorithms and signal processing techniques have their own advantages and limitations and are suitable for different WiFi sensing applications. The survey groups CSI-based WiFi sensing applications into three categories, detection, recognition, and estimation, depending on whether the outputs are binary/multi-class classifications or numerical values. With the development and deployment of new WiFi technologies, there will be more WiFi sensing opportunities wherein the targets may go beyond from humans to environments, animals, and objects. The survey highlights three challenges for WiFi sensing: robustness and generalization, privacy and security, and coexistence of WiFi sensing and networking. Finally, the survey presents three future WiFi sensing trends, i.e., integrating cross-layer network information, multi-device cooperation, and fusion of different sensors, for enhancing existing WiFi sensing capabilities and enabling new WiFi sensing opportunities.","author":["Yongsen Ma","Gang Zhou","Shuangquan Wang"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 52","Issue 3","July 2019","Article No.: 46","pp   1\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/3310194"],"date":"18 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"Heba Abdelnasser, Khaled A.

These RBER variations would cause significantly diversed read latencies when reading data with traditional Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes designed for planar flash memories, which induces sub-optimal read performance of flash-based Solid-State Drives (SSDs). To investigate the latency diversity, this paper first performs a preliminary experiment and observes that LDPC read levels proportional to latencies increase in diverse speeds along with data retention. Then, by exploiting the observation results, a Multi-Granularity LDPC (MG-LDPC) read method is proposed to adapt level increase speed for each layer. Five LDPC engines with varied increase granularity are designed to adapt RBER speed requirements. Finally, two implementations for MG-LDPC are applied to assign LDPC engines for each flash layer in a fixed way or dynamically according to prior read levels. Experimental results show that the proposed two implementations can reduce SSD read response time by 21% and 47% on average, respectively.","author":["Yajuan Du","Yao Zhou","Meng Zhang","Wei Liu","Shengwu Xiong"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 37","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317759"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"Nitin Agrawal, Vijayan Prabhakaran, Ted Wobber, John D Davis, Mark S Manasse, and Rina Panigrahy. 2008.

However, the involved deep neural network (DNN) computations which extremely resource-intensive and power-hungry became a big challenge to the edge computing. The programmable ReRAM based neuromorphic engine opened an opportunity for efficient DNN computing; however, memory utilization and communication latency in the training process implementation is still significant in the current research, and as yet, unmet challenges. The problem becomes more severe in DNN with complex training process such as the generative adversarial network (GAN) which is widely adopted in the intelligence computing on edge. In this work, we target to solve these challenges by designing an efficient GAN computing system on ReRAM neuromorphic engine with a online training framework and an optimized backward computation and a cross-parallel computation flow to execute the training process efficiently. The system performance is evaluated and compared with traditional GPU accelerator, and our results show 2.8x speedup and 6.1x energy-saving.","author":["Chenchen Liu"],"issue":["SEC '19: Proceedings of the 4th ACM/IEEE Symposium on Edge Computing","November 2019","Pages   342\u2013343","https://doi.org/10.1145/3318216.3363334"],"date":"07 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"Y.

Existing work mainly focuses on the quality analysis of DL models, but lacks attention to the underlying frameworks on which all DL models depend. In this work, we propose Audee, a novel approach for testing DL frameworks and localizing bugs. Audee adopts a search-based approach and implements three different mutation strategies to generate diverse test cases by exploring combinations of model structures, parameters, weights and inputs. Audee is able to detect three types of bugs: logical bugs, crashes and Not-a-Number (NaN) errors. In particular, for logical bugs, Audee adopts a cross-reference check to detect behavioural inconsistencies across multiple frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow and PyTorch), which may indicate potential bugs in their implementations. For NaN errors, Audee adopts a heuristic-based approach to generate DNNs that tend to output outliers (i.e., too large or small values), and these values are likely to produce NaN. Furthermore, Audee leverages a causal-testing based technique to localize layers as well as parameters that cause inconsistencies or bugs. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we applied Audee on testing four DL frameworks, i.e., TensorFlow, PyTorch, CNTK, and Theano. We generate a large number of DNNs which cover 25 widely-used APIs in the four frameworks. The results demonstrate that Audee is effective in detecting inconsistencies, crashes and NaN errors. In total, 26 unique unknown bugs were discovered, and 7 of them have already been confirmed or fixed by the developers.","author":["Qianyu Guo","Xiaofei Xie","Yi Li","Xiaoyu Zhang","Yang Liu","Xiaohong Li","Chao Shen"],"issue":["ASE '20: Proceedings of the 35th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering","December 2020","Pages   486\u2013498","https://doi.org/10.1145/3324884.3416571"],"date":"27 January 2021","ref":[{"text":"2018.","order":1},{"text":"2019.","order":2},{"text":"2020.","order":3},{"text":"2020.","order":4},{"text":"2020.","order":5},{"text":"Martin Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, Manjunath Kudlur, Josh Levenberg, Rajat Monga, Sherry Moore, Derek G.

Emerging Deep Learning (DL) applications incur new I/O and storage requirements to HPC systems with batched input of small random files. This mandates PFSs to have commensurate features that can meet the needs of DL applications. BeeGFS is a recently emerging PFS that has grabbed the attention of the research and industry world because of its performance, scalability and ease of use. While emphasizing a systematic performance analysis of BeeGFS, in this paper, we present the architectural and system features of BeeGFS, and perform an experimental evaluation using cutting-edge I/O, Metadata and DL application benchmarks. Particularly, we have utilized AlexNet and ResNet-50 models for the classification of ImageNet dataset using the Livermore Big Artificial Neural Network Toolkit (LBANN), and ImageNet data reader pipeline atop TensorFlow and Horovod. Through extensive performance characterization of BeeGFS, our study provides a useful documentation on how to leverage BeeGFS for the emerging DL applications.","author":["Fahim Chowdhury","Yue Zhu","Todd Heer","Saul Paredes","Adam Moody","Robin Goldstone","Kathryn Mohror","Weikuan Yu"],"issue":["ICPP 2019: Proceedings of the 48th International Conference on Parallel Processing","August 2019","Article No.: 80","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3337821.3337902"],"date":"05 August 2019","ref":[{"text":"Advanced HPC announces its exclusive platinum partnership with BeeGFS. https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/advanced-hpc-announces-its-exclusive-platinum-partnership-with-beegfs.","order":1},{"text":"An Overview of Gradient Descent Optimization Algorithms. http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/index.html#minibatchgradientdescent.","order":2},{"text":"AWI uses BeeGFS. https://www.hpcwire.com/2016/12/22/awi-uses-new-cray-cluster-earth-sciences-bioinformatics.","order":3},{"text":"BeeGFS. https://www.beegfs.io/content.","order":4},{"text":"BeeGFS as Burst Buffer. https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/beegfs-based-burst-buffer-enables-world-record-hyperscale-data-distribution.","order":5},{"text":"Caffe2. https://caffe2.ai.","order":6},{"text":"Catalyst. https://hpc.llnl.gov/hardware/platforms/catalyst.","order":7},{"text":"Darshan. https://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/darshan.","order":8},{"text":"IC3 selects BeeGFS for climate modeling storage. http://www.hpcnow.com/index.php/es/company-es/news-es2/92-ic3-selects-beegfs-and-hpcnow-for-climate-modelling-storage.","order":9},{"text":"Intel BLAS Library. https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl-developer-reference-c-blas-and-sparse-blas-routines.","order":10},{"text":"IOR. https://github.com/hpc/ior.","order":11},{"text":"Keras. https://keras.io.","order":12},{"text":"Lustre. http://lustre.org.","order":13},{"text":"MDTest. https://github.com/LLNL/mdtest.","order":14},{"text":"OrangeFS. http://www.orangefs.org.","order":15},{"text":"PanFS. https://www.panasas.com/panfs-architecture/panfs.","order":16},{"text":"PyTorch. https://pytorch.org.","order":17},{"text":"TensorFlow Dataset API. https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.10/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset.","order":18},{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, et al.

However, computing the optical flow in advance is computationally expensive, which restricts action recognition to be real-time. In this paper, we shed light on fast action recognition by lifting the reliance on optical flow. Inspired by Persistence of Vision in human visual system, we design a novel motion cue called Persistence of Appearance (PA), which enables the network to distill motion information directly from adjacent RGB frames. Our PA derives from optical flow and focuses on the small displacements of motion boundaries. Compared with other motion representations, our PA enables the network to achieve competitive accuracy on UCF101. Meanwhile, the inference speed reaches 1855 fps, which is over 120x faster than that of the traditional optical flow based methods. Besides, we devise a decision strategy called Various-timescale inference Pooling (VIP) to empower the network with the ability of long-range temporal modeling across various timescales. We further incorporate the proposed PA and VIP to form a unified framework called Persistent Appearance Network (PAN). Compared with methods using only RGB frames, our delicately designed PAN achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets: UCF101, HMDB51 and Kinetics, where it reaches 96.2%, 74.8% and 82.5% accuracy respectively with the run-time speed as high as 595 fps.

FaaS platforms enable developers to define their application only through a set of service functions, relieving them of infrastructure management tasks, which are executed automatically by the platform. Since its introduction, FaaS has grown to support workloads beyond the lightweight use-cases it was originally intended for, and now serves as a viable paradigm for big data processing. However, several questions regarding FaaS platform quality are still unanswered. Specifically, the impact of automatic infrastructure management on serverless big data applications remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation method (SIEM) to understand the impact of these tasks. For this purpose, we introduce new metrics to quantify quality in different big data application scenarios. We show an application of SIEM by evaluating the four major FaaS providers, and contribute results and new insights for FaaS-based big data processing.","author":["J\u00f6rn Kuhlenkamp","Sebastian Werner","Maria C.

However, these studies do not consider how many or where the auxiliary classifiers, or branches, should be added in a systematic fashion. In this paper, we propose Branch-pruned Conditional Neural Network (BPNet) and its methodology in which the time-accuracy tradeoff for the conditional neural network can be found systematically. We applied BPNet to SqueezeNet, ResNet-20, and VGG-16 with CIFAR-10 and 100. BPNet achieves on average 2.0X of speedups without any accuracy drop on average compared to the base network.","author":["Kyungchul Park","Youngmin Yi"],"issue":["CODES/ISSS '19: Proceedings of the International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis Companion","October 2019","Article No.: 2","Pages   1\u20132","https://doi.org/10.1145/3349567.3351721"],"date":"13 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"K.

However, the emergence of datacenters as single computer entities has made latency as important as bandwidth in designing datacenter networks. PCIe interconnect is known to be latency bottleneck in communication networks as its latency overhead can contribute to up to ~90% of the overall communication latency. Despite its overheads, PCIe is the de facto interconnect standard in servers as it has been well established and maintained for more than two decades. In addition to PCIe overhead, data movements in network software stack consume thousands of processor cycles and make ultra-low latency networking more challenging. Tackling PCIe and data movement overheads, we architect NetDIMM, a near-memory network interface card capable of in-memory buffer cloning. NetDIMM places a network interface card chip into the buffer device of a dual in-line memory module and leverages the asynchronous memory access capability of DDR5 to share the memory modules between the host processor and near-memory NIC. Our evaluation shows NetDIMM, on average, improves per packet latency by 49.9% compared with a baseline network deploying PCIe NICs.","author":["Mohammad Alian","Nam Sung Kim"],"issue":["MICRO '52: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","October 2019","Pages   699\u2013711","https://doi.org/10.1145/3352460.3358278"],"date":"12 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"[n. d.].

However, the current way of random-walk based HIN embedding methods have paid few attention to the higher-order Markov chain nature of meta-path guided random walks, especially to the stationarity issue. In this paper, we systematically formalize the meta-path guided random walk as a higher-order Markov chain process,and present a heterogeneous personalized spacey random walk to efficiently and effectively attain the expected stationary distribution among nodes. Then we propose a generalized scalable framework to leverage the heterogeneous personalized spacey random walk to learn embeddings for multiple types of nodes in an HIN guided by a meta-path, a meta-graph, and a meta-schema respectively. We conduct extensive experiments in several heterogeneous networks and demonstrate that our methods substantially outperform the existing state-of-the-art network embedding algorithms.","author":["Yu He","Yangqiu Song","Jianxin Li","Cheng Ji","Jian Peng","Hao Peng"],"issue":["CIKM '19: Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2019","Pages   639\u2013648","https://doi.org/10.1145/3357384.3358061"],"date":"03 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"Austin R.

It enables trading the quality of results for efficiency improvement in terms of delay, power, and energy consumption under user-provided tolerable quality degradation. Approximate accelerators have been proposed to expedite frequently executing code sections of error-resilient applications while meeting a defined quality level. However, these accelerators may produce unacceptable errors at run time if the input data changes or dynamic adjustments are made for a defined output quality constraint. State-of-the-art approaches in approximate computing address this issue by correctly re-computing those accelerator invocations that produce unacceptable errors; this is achieved by using the host processor or an alternate exact accelerator, which is activated on-demand. Nevertheless, such approaches can nullify the benefits of approximate computing, especially when input data variations are high at run time and errors due to approximations are above a tolerable threshold. As a robust and general solution to this problem, we propose ECAx, a novel methodology to explore low-overhead error correction in approximate accelerators by selectively correcting most significant errors, in terms of their magnitude, without losing the gains of approximations. We particularly consider the case of approximate accelerators built with approximate functional units such as approximate adders. Our novel methodology reduces the required exact re-computations on the host processor, achieving up to 20% performance gain compared to state-of-the-art approaches.","author":["Jorge Castro-God\u00ednez","Muhammad Shafique","J\u00f6rg Henkel"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 18","Issue 5s","October 2019","Article No.: 48","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/3358179"],"date":"07 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Muhammad Kamran Ayub, Osman Hasan, and Muhammad Shafique. 2017.

This calls for the design of compact, energy efficient NN models in silicon. In this article, we present a scalable application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design of an energy-efficient Long Short-Term Memory (<underline>LS</underline>TM) <underline>a</underline>ccelerator, named ELSA, which is suitable for energy-constrained devices. It includes several architectural innovations to achieve small area and high energy efficiency. To reduce the area and power consumption of the overall design, the compute-intensive units of ELSA employ approximate multiplications and still achieve high performance and accuracy. The performance is further improved through efficient synchronization of the elastic pipeline stages to maximize the utilization. The article also includes a performance model of ELSA, as a function of the hidden nodes and timesteps, permitting its use for the evaluation of any LSTM application. ELSA was implemented in register transfer level (RTL) and was synthesized and placed and routed in 65nm technology. Its functionality is demonstrated for language modeling\u2014a common application of LSTM. ELSA is compared against a baseline implementation of an LSTM accelerator with standard functional units and without any of the architectural innovations of ELSA. The article demonstrates that ELSA can achieve significant improvements in power, area, and energy-efficiency when compared to the baseline design and several ASIC implementations reported in the literature, making it suitable for use in embedded systems and real-time applications.","author":["Elham Azari","Sarma Vrudhula"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 19","Issue 1","February 2020","Article No.: 3","pp   1\u201321","https://doi.org/10.1145/3366634"],"date":"07 February 2020","ref":[{"text":"Jorge Albericio, Alberto Delm\u00e1s, Patrick Judd, Sayeh Sharify, Gerard O\u2019Leary, Roman Genov, and Andreas Moshovos. 2017.

Spatial and temporal blocking have been proposed to overcome the memory-bound nature of this type of computation by moving memory pressure from external memory to on-chip memory on GPUs. However, correctly implementing those optimizations while considering the complexity of the architecture and memory hierarchy of GPUs to achieve high performance is difficult. We propose AN5D, an automated stencil framework which is capable of automatically transforming and optimizing stencil patterns in a given C source code, and generating corresponding CUDA code. Parameter tuning in our framework is guided by our performance model. Our novel optimization strategy reduces shared memory and register pressure in comparison to existing implementations, allowing performance scaling up to a temporal blocking degree of 10. We achieve the highest performance reported so far for all evaluated stencil benchmarks on the state-of-the-art Tesla V100 GPU.","author":["Kazuaki Matsumura","Hamid Reza Zohouri","Mohamed Wahib","Toshio Endo","Satoshi Matsuoka"],"issue":["CGO 2020: Proceedings of the 18th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization","February 2020","Pages   199\u2013211","https://doi.org/10.1145/3368826.3377904"],"date":"22 February 2020"},{"_id":"10.1145/3369875","doi":"10.1145/3369875","title":"What Are Links in Linked Open Data? A Characterization and Evaluation of Links between Knowledge Graphs on the Web","abstract":"Linked Open Data promises to provide guiding principles to publish interlinked knowledge graphs on the Web in the form of findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable datasets. We argue that while as such, Linked Data may be viewed as a basis for instantiating the FAIR principles, there are still a number of open issues that cause significant data quality issues even when knowledge graphs are published as Linked Data. First, to define boundaries of single coherent knowledge graphs within Linked Data, a principled notion of what a dataset is, or, respectively, what links within and between datasets are, has been missing. Second, we argue that to enable FAIR knowledge graphs, Linked Data misses standardised findability and accessability mechanism via a single entry link. To address the first issue, we (i) propose a rigorous definition of a naming authority for a Linked Data dataset, (ii) define different link types for data in Linked datasets, (iii) provide an empirical analysis of linkage among the datasets of the Linked Open Data cloud, and (iv) analyse the dereferenceability of those links. We base our analyses and link computations on a scalable mechanism implemented on top of the HDT format, which allows us to analyse quantity and quality of different link types at scale.","author":["Armin Haller","Javier D.

However, lightweight operations limit acceleration potential by GPU due to their memory bounded nature and their parallel mechanisms that are not friendly to SIMD. This calls for more specific accelerators. In this paper, we propose an FPGA-based overlay processor with a corresponding compilation flow for general LW-CNN accelerations, called Light-OPU. Software-hardware co-designed Light-OPU reformulates and decomposes lightweight operations for efficient acceleration. Moreover, our instruction architecture considers sharing of major computation engine between LW operations and conventional convolution operations. This improves the run-time resource efficiency and overall power efficiency. Finally, Light-OPU is software programmable, since loading of compiled codes and kernel weights completes switch of targeted network without FPGA reconfiguration. Our experiments on seven major LW-CNNs show that Light-OPU achieves 5.5x better latency and 3.0x higher power efficiency on average compared with edge GPU NVIDIA Jetson TX2. Furthermore, Light-OPU has 1.3x to 8.4x better power efficiency compared with previous customized FPGA accelerators. To the best of our knowledge, Light-OPU is the first in-depth study on FPGA-based general processor for LW-CNNs acceleration with high performance and power efficiency, which is evaluated using all major LW-CNNs including the newly released MobileNetV3.","author":["Yunxuan Yu","Tiandong Zhao","Kun Wang","Lei He"],"issue":["FPGA '20: Proceedings of the 2020 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2020","Pages   122\u2013132","https://doi.org/10.1145/3373087.3375311"],"date":"23 February 2020","ref":[{"text":"Lin Bai, Yiming Zhao, and Xinming Huang. 2018.

Two compressive measurement modes were investigated. One was based on subsampling of the original measurements. The other was based on coded aperture camera. It is important to emphasize that conventional trackers require the compressive measurements be reconstructed first before any tracking and classification processing steps begin. The reconstruction is time-consuming and may also lose information. Our proposed approach directly uses compressive measurements and a deep learning tracker known as You Only Look Once (YOLO), which is fast and can track multiple objects simultaneously, was used to track objects. The detected objects are then recognized using another deep learning model called residual network (ResNet). Extensive experiments using infrared videos from long distances were conducted. Results show that the proposed approach performs much better than conventional trackers, which failed to deal with compressive measurements. Instead, ResNet classifier performs better than the built-in classifier in YOLO.","author":["Chiman Kwan"],"issue":["ICVISP 2019: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Vision, Image and Signal Processing","August 2019","Article No.: 10","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3387168.3387188"],"date":"25 May 2020","ref":[{"text":"Berg, A.: Detection and Tracking in Thermal Infrared Imagery.

This paper describes distributed training of DNN on computational storage devices (CSD), which are NAND flash-based, high-capacity data storage with internal processing engines. A CSD-based distributed architecture incorporates the advantages of federated learning in terms of performance scalability, resiliency, and data privacy by eliminating the unnecessary data movement between the storage device and the host processor. The paper also describes Stannis, a DNN training framework that improves on the shortcomings of existing distributed training frameworks by dynamically tuning the training hyperparameters in heterogeneous systems to maintain the maximum overall processing speed in term of processed images per second and energy efficiency. Experimental results on image classification training benchmarks show up to 3.1x improvement in performance and 2.45x reduction in energy consumption when using Stannis plus CSD compare to the generic systems.","author":["Ali HeydariGorji","Siavash Rezaei","Mahdi Torabzadehkashi","Hossein Bobarshad","Vladimir Alves","Pai H.

In this article, we focus on exploring the heterogeneous edges for network representation learning. By considering each relationship as a view that depicts a specific type of proximity between nodes, we propose a multi-stage non-negative matrix factorization (MNMF) model, committed to utilizing abundant information in multiple views to learn robust network representations. In fact, most existing network embedding methods are closely related to implicitly factorizing the complex proximity matrix. However, the approximation error is usually quite large, since a single low-rank matrix is insufficient to capture the original information. Through a multi-stage matrix factorization process motivated by gradient boosting, our MNMF model achieves lower approximation error. Meanwhile, the multi-stage structure of MNMF gives the feasibility of designing two kinds of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) manners to preserve network information better. The united NMF aims to preserve the consensus information between different views, and the independent NMF aims to preserve unique information of each view. Concrete experimental results on realistic datasets indicate that our model outperforms three types of baselines in practical applications.","author":["Hong Huang","Yu Song","Fanghua Ye","Xing Xie","Xuanhua Shi","Hai Jin"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data","Volume 15","Issue 1","January 2021","Article No.: 5","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/3415157"],"date":"07 December 2020","ref":[{"text":"Ivana Balazevic, Carl Allen, and Timothy Hospedales. 2019.

However, these advantages are achieved through highly specialized designs. The high degree of specialization leads to accelerators with narrow functionality and designs adhering to a rigid execution flow. For multi-tenant systems this limits the scope of applicability of FPGA-based accelerators, because, first, supporting a single operation is unlikely to have any significant impact on the overall performance of the system, and, second, serving multiple users satisfactorily is difficult due to simplistic scheduling policies enforced when using the accelerator. Standard operating system and database management system features that would help address these limitations, such as context-switching, preemptive scheduling, and thread migration are practically non-existent in current FPGA accelerator efforts.In this work, we propose PipeArch, an open-source project1 for developing FPGA-based accelerators that combine the high efficiency of specialized hardware designs with the generality and functionality known from conventional CPU threads. PipeArch provides programmability and extensibility in the accelerator without losing the advantages of SIMD-parallelism and deep pipelining. PipeArch supports context-switching and thread migration, thereby enabling for the first time new capabilities such as preemptive scheduling in FPGA accelerators within a high-performance data processing setting. We have used PipeArch to implement a variety of machine learning methods for generalized linear model training and recommender systems showing empirically their advantages over a high-end CPU and even over fully specialized FPGA designs.","author":["Kaan Kara","Gustavo Alonso"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 14","Issue 1","January 2021","Article No.: 3","pp   1\u201328","https://doi.org/10.1145/3418465"],"date":"05 November 2020","ref":[{"text":"[n.d.].

To address these limitations, we propose a fuzzy attention-based DenseNet-BiLSTM Chinese image captioning method in this article. In the proposed method, we first improve the densely connected network to extract features of the image at different scales and to enhance the model\u2019s ability to capture the weak features. At the same time, a bidirectional LSTM is used as the decoder to enhance the use of context information. The introduction of an improved fuzzy attention mechanism effectively improves the problem of correspondence between image features and contextual information. We conduct experiments on the AI Challenger dataset to evaluate the performance of the model. The results show that compared with other models, our proposed model achieves higher scores in objective quantitative evaluation indicators, including BLEU\\(\\), BLEU\\(\\), METEOR, ROUGEl, and CIDEr.

It provides non-write-through file caching on both client and server machines. A simple cache consistency mechanism permits files to be shared by multiple clients without danger of stale data. In order to allow the file cache to occupy as much memory as possible, the file system of each machine negotiates with the virtual memory system over physical memory usage and changes the size of the file cache dynamically. Benchmark programs indicate that client caches allow diskless Sprite workstations to perform within O-12 percent of workstations with disks. In addition, client caching reduces server loading by 50 percent and network traffic by 90 percent.","author":["Michael N. Nelson","Brent B. Welch","John K.

Several designs are proposed and used to classify existing sequential object oriented libraries. The classification is based on the way that matrices and matrix operations are represented. OOLALA's representation of matrices is capable of dealing with certain matrix operations that, although mathematically valid, are not handled correctly by existing libraries. OOLALA also enables implementations of matrix calculations at various abstraction levels ranging from the relatively low-level abstraction of a Fortran BLAS-like implementation to higher-level abstractions that hide many implementation details. OOLALA addresses a wide range of numerical linear algebra functionality while the reviewed object oriented libraries concen trate on parts of such functionality. We include some preliminary performance results for a Java implementation of OOLALA.","author":["Mikel Luj\u00e1n","T. L. Freeman","John R.

For these applications, the memory allocator is often a bottleneck that severely limits program performance and scalability on multiprocessor systems. Previous allocators suffer from problems that include poor performance and scalability, and heap organizations that introduce false sharing. Worse, many allocators exhibit a dramatic increase in memory consumption when confronted with a producer-consumer pattern of object allocation and freeing. This increase in memory consumption can range from a factor of P (the number of processors) to unbounded memory consumption.This paper introduces Hoard, a fast, highly scalable allocator that largely avoids false sharing and is memory efficient. Hoard is the first allocator to simultaneously solve the above problems. Hoard combines one global heap and per-processor heaps with a novel discipline that provably bounds memory consumption and has very low synchronization costs in the common case. Our results on eleven programs demonstrate that Hoard yields low average fragmentation and improves overall program performance over the standard Solaris allocator by up to a factor of 60 on 14 processors, and up to a factor of 18 over the next best allocator we tested.","author":["Emery D.

In this language,\nexternal tools like compilers and linkers are invoked by function calls. Because some function calls are extremely expensive, it is obviously important to reuse the results of previous function calls whenever possible. Caching a function call requires the language interpreter to record all values on which the function call depends. For optimal caching, it is important to record precise dependencies that are both dynamic and fine-grained. The paper sketches how we compute such dependencies, describes the implementation of an efficient function cache, and evaluates our implementation's performance.","author":["Allan Heydon","Roy Levin","Yuan Yu"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 35","Issue 5","May 2000","pp   311\u2013320","https://doi.org/10.1145/358438.349341"],"date":"01 May 2000","ref":[{"text":"Martin Abadi, Butler Lampson, and Jean-Jacques Levy.

It is concluded that at least minimally effective techniques have been devised for answering questions from natural language subsets in small scale experimental systems and that a useful paradigm has evolved to guide research efforts in the field. Current approaches to semantic analysis and logical inference are seen to be effective beginnings but of questionable generality with respect either to subtle aspects of meaning or to applications over large subsets of English. Generalizing from current small-scale experiments to language-processing systems based on dictionaries with thousands of entries\u2014with correspondingly large grammars and semantic systems\u2014may entail a new order of complexity and require the invention and development of entirely different approaches to semantic analysis and question answering.","author":["Robert F.

We are investigating whether it benefits users to have sets of thumbnails arranged according to their mutual similarity, so images that are alike are placed together. There are, of course, many possible definitions of \u201csimilarity\u201d: so far we have explored measurements based on low-level visual features, and on the textual captions assigned to the images. Here we describe two experiments, both involving designers as the participants, examining whether similarity-based arrangements of the candidate images are helpful for a picture selection task. Firstly, the two types of similarity-based arrangement were informally compared.  Then, an  arrangement based on visual similarity was more formally compared with a control of a random arrangement. We believe this work should be of interest to anyone designing a system that involves presenting sets of images to users.","author":["Kerry Rodden","Wojciech Basalaj","David Sinclair","Kenneth Wood"],"issue":["CHI '01: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","March 2001","Pages   190\u2013197","https://doi.org/10.1145/365024.365097"],"date":"01 March 2001","ref":[{"text":"Armitage, L.H., and Enser, P.G.B.

An implementation based on the IKOS VStation emulator validates these architectural claims on real designs.","author":["Murali Kudlugi","Soha Hassoun","Charles Selvidge","Duaine Pryor"],"issue":["DAC '01: Proceedings of the 38th annual Design Automation Conference","June 2001","Pages   623\u2013628","https://doi.org/10.1145/378239.379036"],"date":"22 June 2001","ref":[{"text":"\"PCI Local Bus Specification, Revision 2.1\".

Memory is a particularly important target for efforts to improve energy efficiency. Memory technology is becoming available that offers power management features such as the ability to put individual chips in any one of several different power modes. In this paper we explore the interaction of page placement with static and dynamic hardware policies to exploit these emerging hardware features. In particular, we consider page allocation policies that can be employed by an informed operating system to complement the hardware power management strategies. We perform experiments using two complementary simulation environments: a trace-driven simulator with workload traces that are representative of mobile computing and an execution-driven simulator with a detailed processor/memory model and a more memory-intensive set of benchmarks (SPEC2000). Our results make a compelling case for a cooperative hardware/software approach for exploiting power-aware memory, with down to as little as 45% of the Energy&bull; Delay for the best static policy and 1% to 20% of the Energy&bull; Delay for a traditional full-power memory.","author":["Alvin R.

Here A is assumed to be symmetric, and B symmetric positive definite. A combination of block Cholesky and block Householder transformations are used to reduce the problem to a symmetric banded eigenproblem whose eigenvalues can be computed in central memory. Inverse iteration is applied to the banded matrix to compute selected eigenvectors, which are then transformed back to eigenvectors of the original problem. This method is especially suitable for the solution of large eigenproblems arising in quantum physics, using a vector supercomputer with fast secondary storage device such as the Cray X-MP with SSD. Some numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the new implementation.","author":["Roger G. Grimes","Horst D.

Consisting of a class library and a simulation kernel, the language is an attempt at standardization of a C/C++ design methodology, and is supported by the Open SystemC Initiative (OSCI), a consortium of a wide range of system houses, semiconductor companies, Intellectual property (IP) providers, embedded software developers, and design automation tool vendors. The advantages of SystemC include the establishment of a common design environment consisting of C++ libraries, models and tools, thereby setting up a foundation for hardware-software co-design; the ability to exchange IP easily and efficiently; and the ability to reuse test benches across different levels of modeling abstraction. We outline the features of SystemC that make it an attractive language for design specification, verification, and synthesis at different levels of abstraction, with particular emphasis on the new features included in SystemC 2.0 that support system-level design.","author":["Preeti Ranjan Panda"],"issue":["ISSS '01: Proceedings of the 14th international symposium on Systems synthesis","September 2001","Pages   75\u201380","https://doi.org/10.1145/500001.500018"],"date":"30 September 2001","ref":[{"text":"The Open SystemC Initiative. http://www.systemc.org.","order":1},{"text":"SystemC 1.0 user's guide. http://www.systemc.org, 2000.","order":2},{"text":"Functional specification for SystemC 2.0. http://www.systemc.org, Jan. 2001.","order":3},{"text":"D.

In the research community the dominant approach to this problem is based on machine learning techniques: a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by learning, from a set of preclassified documents, the characteristics of the categories. The advantages of this approach over the knowledge engineering approach (consisting in the manual definition of a classifier by domain experts) are a very good effectiveness, considerable savings in terms of expert labor power, and straightforward portability to different domains. This survey discusses the main approaches to text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm. We will discuss in detail issues pertaining to three different problems, namely, document representation, classifier construction, and classifier evaluation.","author":["Fabrizio Sebastiani"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 34","Issue 1","March 2002","pp   1\u201347","https://doi.org/10.1145/505282.505283"],"date":"01 March 2002","ref":[{"text":"AMATI,G.AND CRESTANI, F. 1999.

The research question is whether metadata elements and values can be automatically generated from the content of educational resources, and correctly assigned to mathematics and science educational materials. Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques were implemented to automatically assign values of the GEMgenerate metadata element set tofor learning resources provided by the Gateway for Education (GEM), a service that offers web access to a wide range of educational materials. In a user study, education professionals evaluated the metadata assigned to learning resources by either automatic tagging or manual assignment. Results show minimal difference in the eyes of the evaluators between automatically generated metadata and manually assigned metadata.","author":["Elizabeth D.

Conventional technology-independent transformations target standard cells and are unable to optimize circuits with constraints and goals specific to FPGA architectures. This article describes an FPGA-specific logic synthesis approach, which unites multilevel logic transformation, decomposition, and optimization techniques into a single synthesis framework. This system performs network transformation, decomposition, and optimization at an early stage to generate a network that can be directly mapped onto FPGAs. Our techniques are built upon a BDD-based logic decomposition system. With this system, both AND-OR decompositions and AND-XOR decompositions can be identified, resulting in large area savings for synthesized XOR-intensive circuits. To induce good decompositions, a maximum fanout free cone (MFFC) -based partial clustering and collapsing technique is used. This step is followed by an area-minimizing variable partitioning heuristic that decomposes collapsed nodes into LUT-feasible subfunctions. As a postprocessing step, a performance-driven resynthesis phase is performed to alleviate increased delay caused by excessive logic sharing. We compare the quality of results obtained using our techniques with those of academic (BoolMap, SIS) and industry (Altera Quartus) FPGA synthesis tools. Experimental results indicate that the circuits generated by our techniques are not only smaller, but are also significantly faster than those synthesized by conventional FPGA synthesis tools. Furthermore, the computation times required by our techniques are significantly smaller than those of previous techniques.","author":["Navin Vemuri","Priyank Kalla","Russell Tessier"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 7","Issue 4","October 2002","pp   501\u2013525","https://doi.org/10.1145/605440.605442"],"date":"01 October 2002","ref":[{"text":"Ashenhurst, R.

We then show that even if the domains of the NODE COVER and DIRECTED HAMILTONIAN PATH problems are restricted to planar graphs, the two problems remain NP-complete, and that these and other graph problems remain NP-complete even when their domains are restricted to graphs with low node degrees.

Unlike iterative algorithms, such as the seminaive and logarithmic algorithms, the termination of our algorithms does not depend on the length of paths in the underlying graph (hence the name direct algorithms). Besides reachability computations, the proposed algorithms can also be used for solving path problems. We discuss issues related to the efficient implementation of these algorithms, and present experimental results that show the direct algorithms perform uniformly better than the iterative algorithms. A side benefit of this work is that we have proposed a new methodology for evaluating the performance of recursive queries.","author":["Rakesh Agrawal","Shaul Dar","H. V.

We design FPGA circuits and logic fabrics using configurable dual-Vdd and develop the corresponding CAD flow to leverage such circuits and logic fabrics. We then carry out a highly quantitative study using area, delay and power models obtained from detailed circuit design and SPICE simulation in 100nm technology. Compared to single-Vdd FPGAs with optimized Vdd level for the same target clock frequency, configurable dual-Vdd FPGAs with full and partial supply programmability for logic blocks reduce logic power by 35.46% and 28.62% respectively and reduce total FPGA power by 14.29% and 9.04% respectively.

Traditional automated techniques for finding errors in concurrent programs, such as model checking, explore all possible thread interleavings. Since the number of thread interleavings increases exponentially with the number of threads, such analyses have high computational complexity. In this paper, we present a novel analysis technique for concurrent programs that avoids this exponential complexity. Our analysis transforms a concurrent program into a sequential program that simulates the execution of a large subset of the behaviors of the concurrent program. The sequential program is then analyzed by a tool that only needs to understand the semantics of sequential execution. Our technique never reports false errors but may miss errors. We have implemented the technique in KISS, an automated checker for multithreaded C programs, and obtained promising initial results by using KISS to detect race conditions in Windows device drivers.","author":["Shaz Qadeer","Dinghao Wu"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 39","Issue 6","May 2004","pp   14\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/996893.996845"],"date":"09 June 2004","ref":[{"text":"A.

When these data sources model a dynamically changing world (e.g., people's contact information changes over time, restaurants open and go out of business), sources often provide out-of-date data. Errors can also creep into data when sources are updated often. Given out-of-date and erroneous data provided by different, possibly dependent, sources, it is challenging for data integration systems to provide the true values. Straightforward ways to resolve such inconsistencies (e.g., voting) may lead to noisy results, often with detrimental consequences.In this paper, we study the problem of finding true values and determining the copying relationship between sources, when the update history of the sources is known. We model the quality of sources over time by their coverage, exactness and freshness. Based on these measures, we conduct a probabilistic analysis. First, we develop a Hidden Markov Model that decides whether a source is a copier of another source and identifies the specific moments at which it copies. Second, we develop a Bayesian model that aggregates information from the sources to decide the true value for a data item, and the evolution of the true values over time. Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic data show high accuracy and scalability of our techniques.","author":["Xin Luna Dong","Laure Berti-Equille","Divesh Srivastava"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 2","Issue 1","August 2009","pp   562\u2013573","https://doi.org/10.14778/1687627.1687691"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"L.

Recommendation is an important information exploration paradigm that retrieves interesting items for users based on their profiles and past activities. Single user recommendation has received significant attention in the past due to its extensive use in Amazon and Netflix. How to recommend to a group of users who may or may not share similar tastes, however, is still an open problem. The need for group recommendation arises in many scenarios: a movie for friends to watch together, a travel destination for a family to spend a holiday break, and a good restaurant for colleagues to have a working lunch. Intuitively, items that are ideal for recommendation to a group may be quite different from those for individual members. In this paper, we analyze the desiderata of group recommendation and propose a formal semantics that accounts for both item relevance to a group and disagreements among group members. We design and implement algorithms for efficiently computing group recommendations. We evaluate our group recommendation method through a comprehensive user study conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk and demonstrate that incorporating disagreements is critical to the effectiveness of group recommendation. We further evaluate the efficiency and scalability of our algorithms on the MovieLens data set with 10M ratings.","author":["Sihem Amer-Yahia","Senjuti Basu Roy","Ashish Chawlat","Gautam Das","Cong Yu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 2","Issue 1","August 2009","pp   754\u2013765","https://doi.org/10.14778/1687627.1687713"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"G.

Among these, a pattern match query is more flexible compared to a subgraph search and more informative compared to a shortest-path or reachability query. In this paper, we address pattern match problems over a large data graph G. Specifically, given a pattern graph (i.e., query Q), we want to find all matches (in G) that have the similar connections as those in Q. In order to reduce the search space significantly, we first transform the vertices into points in a vector space via graph embedding techniques, coverting a pattern match query into a distance-based multi-way join problem over the converted vector space. We also propose several pruning strategies and a join order selection method to process join processing efficiently. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms existing ones by orders of magnitude.","author":["Lei Zou","Lei Chen","M.

Moreover, it requires bijective functions, which are often too restrictive to characterize patterns in emerging applications. We propose a class of graph patterns, in which an edge denotes the connectivity in a data graph within a predefined number of hops. In addition, we define matching based on a notion of bounded simulation, an extension of graph simulation. We show that with this revision, graph pattern matching can be performed in cubic-time, by providing such an algorithm. We also develop algorithms for incrementally finding matches when data graphs are updated, with performance guarantees for dag patterns. We experimentally verify that these algorithms scale well, and that the revised notion of graph pattern matching allows us to identify communities commonly found in real-world networks.","author":["Wenfei Fan","Jianzhong Li","Shuai Ma","Nan Tang","Yinghui Wu","Yunpeng Wu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   264\u2013275","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920878"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"S.

The number of cores on a chip grows exponentially, following Moore's Law, allowing for an ever-increasing number of transactions to execute in parallel. As the number of concurrently-executing transactions increases, contended critical sections become scalability burdens. In typical transaction processing systems the centralized lock manager is often the first contended component and scalability bottleneck.In this paper, we identify the conventional thread-to-transaction assignment policy as the primary cause of contention. Then, we design DORA, a system that decomposes each transaction to smaller actions and assigns actions to threads based on which data each action is about to access. DORA's design allows each thread to mostly access thread-local data structures, minimizing interaction with the contention-prone centralized lock manager. Built on top of a conventional storage engine, DORA maintains all the ACID properties. Evaluation of a prototype implementation of DORA on a multicore system demonstrates that DORA attains up to 4.8x higher throughput than a state-of-the-art storage engine when running a variety of synthetic and real-world OLTP workloads.","author":["Ippokratis Pandis","Ryan Johnson","Nikos Hardavellas","Anastasia Ailamaki"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   928\u2013939","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920959"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"Anon, et al. \"A measure of transaction processing power.\" Datamation, 1985.","doi":"10.5555/13900.18159","order":1},{"text":"E.

However, writes, especially small random writes, on flash disks are inherently much slower than reads because of the erase-before-write mechanism.To address this asymmetry of read-write speeds in tree indexing on the flash disk, we propose FD-tree, a tree index designed with the logarithmic method and fractional cascading techniques. With the logarithmic method, an FD-tree consists of the head tree -- a small B+-tree on the top, and a few levels of sorted runs of increasing sizes at the bottom. This design is write-optimized for the flash disk; in particular, an index search will potentially go through more levels or visit more nodes, but random writes are limited to a small area -- the head tree, and are subsequently transformed into sequential ones through merging into the lower runs. With the fractional cascading technique, we store pointers, called fences, in lower level runs to speed up the search. Given an FD-tree of n entries, we analytically show that it performs an update in O(logB n) sequential I/Os and completes a search in O(logB n) random I/Os, where B is the flash page size. We evaluate FD-tree in comparison with representative B+-tree variants under a variety of workloads on three commodity flash SSDs. Our results show that FD-tree has a similar search performance to the standard B+-tree, and a similar update performance to the write-optimized B+-tree variant. As a result, FD-tree dominates the other B+-tree index variants on the overall performance on flash disks as well as on magnetic disks.","author":["Yinan Li","Bingsheng He","Robin Jun Yang","Qiong Luo","Ke Yi"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   1195\u20131206","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920990"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"D.

However, standard concurrency control methods used today do not scale to the high transaction rates achievable by such systems. In this paper we introduce two efficient concurrency control methods specifically designed for main-memory databases. Both use multiversioning to isolate read-only transactions from updates but differ in how atomicity is ensured: one is optimistic and one is pessimistic. To avoid expensive context switching, transactions never block during normal processing but they may have to wait before commit to ensure correct serialization ordering. We also implemented a main-memory optimized version of single-version locking. Experimental results show that while single-version locking works well when transactions are short and contention is low performance degrades under more demanding conditions. The multiversion schemes have higher overhead but are much less sensitive to hotspots and the presence of long-running transactions.","author":["Per-\u00c5ke Larson","Spyros Blanas","Cristian Diaconu","Craig Freedman","Jignesh M.

The shift from reads to writes in web applications has also been accelerating in recent years. Write-ahead-logging is a common approach for providing recovery capability while improving performance in most storage systems. However, the separation of log and application data incurs write overheads observed in write-heavy environments and hence adversely affects the write throughput and recovery time in the system.In this paper, we introduce LogBase -- a scalable log-structured database system that adopts log-only storage for removing the write bottleneck and supporting fast system recovery. It is designed to be dynamically deployed on commodity clusters to take advantage of elastic scaling property of cloud environments. LogBase provides in-memory multiversion indexes for supporting efficient access to data maintained in the log. LogBase also supports transactions that bundle read and write operations spanning across multiple records. We implemented the proposed system and compared it with HBase and a disk-based log-structured record-oriented system modeled after RAMCloud. The experimental results show that LogBase is able to provide sustained write throughput, efficient data access out of the cache, and effective system recovery.","author":["Hoang Tam Vo","Sheng Wang","Divyakant Agrawal","Gang Chen","Beng Chin Ooi"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 5","Issue 10","June 2012","pp   1004\u20131015","https://doi.org/10.14778/2336664.2336673"],"date":"01 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"Hbase. http://hbase.apache.org.","order":1},{"text":"Zookeeper. http://zookeeper.apache.org.","order":2},{"text":"J.

A less-explored topic is how those data, dominated by application logs, are collected and structured to begin with. In this paper, we present Twitter's production logging infrastructure and its evolution from application-specific logging to a unified \"client events\" log format, where messages are captured in common, well-formatted, flexible Thrift messages. Since most analytics tasks consider the user session as the basic unit of analysis, we pre-materialize \"session sequences\", which are compact summaries that can answer a large class of common queries quickly. The development of this infrastructure has streamlined log collection and data analysis, thereby improving our ability to rapidly experiment and iterate on various aspects of the service.","author":["George Lee","Jimmy Lin","Chuang Liu","Andrew Lorek","Dmitriy Ryaboy"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 5","Issue 12","August 2012","pp   1771\u20131780","https://doi.org/10.14778/2367502.2367516"],"date":"01 August 2012","ref":[{"text":"A.

We first identify a set of desirable properties of an efficient Pregel algorithm, such as linear space, communication and computation cost per iteration, and logarithmic number of iterations. We define such an algorithm as a practical Pregel algorithm (PPA). We then propose PPAs for computing connected components (CCs), biconnected components (BCCs) and strongly connected components (SCCs). The PPAs for computing BCCs and SCCs use the PPAs of many fundamental graph problems as building blocks, which are of interest by themselves.

Managing, storing, and recreating these dataset versions is a non-trivial task. The fundamental challenge here is the storage-recreation trade-off: the more storage we use, the faster it is to recreate or retrieve versions, while the less storage we use, the slower it is to recreate or retrieve versions. Despite the fundamental nature of this problem, there has been a surprisingly little amount of work on it. In this paper, we study this trade-off in a principled manner: we formulate six problems under various settings, trading off these quantities in various ways, demonstrate that most of the problems are intractable, and propose a suite of inexpensive heuristics drawing from techniques in delay-constrained scheduling, and spanning tree literature, to solve these problems. We have built a prototype version management system, that aims to serve as a foundation to our DataHub system for facilitating collaborative data science. We demonstrate, via extensive experiments, that our proposed heuristics provide efficient solutions in practical dataset versioning scenarios.","author":["Souvik Bhattacherjee","Amit Chavan","Silu Huang","Amol Deshpande","Aditya Parameswaran"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 12","August 2015","pp   1346\u20131357","https://doi.org/10.14778/2824032.2824035"],"date":"01 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"http://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/tree/Documentation/technical/pack-heuristics.txt.","order":1},{"text":"http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/189776.","order":2},{"text":"http://edmonds-alg.sourceforge.net/.","order":3},{"text":"http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/notes/fsfs.","order":4},{"text":"http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.diskspace.fsfspacking.","order":5},{"text":"http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/notes/fsfs-improvements.txt.","order":6},{"text":"http://www.xmailserver.org/xdiff-lib.html.","order":7},{"text":"http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/notes/skip-deltas.","order":8},{"text":"https://git-annex.branchable.com/.","order":9},{"text":"http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/git-bigfiles.","order":10},{"text":"J.

These applications require real-time high-throughput video processing. This can be attained via a collaborative processing model between the edge and the cloud---called an Edge-Cloud model. To this end, many approaches were proposed to optimize the latency and bandwidth consumption of Edge-Cloud video processing, especially for Neural Networks (NN)-based methods. In this demonstration. We investigate the efficiency of these NN techniques, how they can be combined, and whether combining them leads to better performance. Our demonstration invites participants to experiment with the various NN techniques, combine them, and observe how the underlying NN changes with different techniques and how these changes affect accuracy, latency and bandwidth consumption.","author":["Philipp M.

Although tremendous progress has been made in the Semantic Web community for achieving high performance data management on a single node, current solutions that allow the data to be partitioned across multiple machines are highly inefficient. In this paper, we introduce a scalable RDF data management system that is up to three orders of magnitude more efficient than popular multi-node RDF data management systems. In so doing, we introduce techniques for (1) leveraging state-of-the-art single node RDF-store technology (2) partitioning the data across nodes in a manner that helps accelerate query processing through locality optimizations and (3) decomposing SPARQL queries into high performance fragments that take advantage of how data is partitioned in a cluster.","author":["Jiewen Huang","Daniel J.

An ideal system would not use a single fixed strategy, but would <i>adapt</i> to the circumstances at hand. To do so, a system must be able to identify dialogue properties that suggest adaptation. This paper focuses on identifying situations where the speech recognizer is performing poorly. We adopt a machine learning approach to learn rules from a dialogue corpus for identifying these situations. Our results show a significant improvement over the baseline and illustrate that both lower-level acoustic features and higher-level dialogue features can affect the performance of the learning algorithm.","author":["Diane J.

Since the output of the taggers is noisy, there is a question of which newly labelled examples to add to the training set. We investigate selecting examples by directly maximising tagger agreement on unlabelled data, a method which has been theoretically and empirically motivated in the co-training literature. Our results show that agreement-based co-training can significantly improve tagging performance for small seed datasets. Further results show that this form of co-training considerably outperforms self-training. However, we find that simply re-training on all the newly labelled data can, in some cases, yield comparable results to agreement-based co-training, with only a fraction of the computational cost.","author":["Stephen Clark","James R.

The system, designed for large vocabulary natural language tasks, makes use of phonetic Hidden Markov models (HMM) and incorporates acoustic, phonetic, and linguistic sources of knowledge to achieve high recognition performance. We describe the various components of this system. We also present our strategy for achieving real time recognition on the PC. Using a 486-based PC with a 29K-based add-on board, the recognizer has been timed at 1.1 times real time.","author":["Paul Bamberg","Yen-lu Chow","Laurence Gillick","Robert Roth","Dean Sturtevant"],"issue":["HLT '90: Proceedings of the workshop on Speech and Natural Language","June 1990","Pages   78\u201381","https://doi.org/10.3115/116580.116610"],"date":"24 June 1990","ref":[{"text":"F.
