Although there is an algorithm that can find an optimal solution in polynomial time for the minimal-area FPGA technology mapping problem without gate duplication, its time complexity can grow exponentially with the number of inputs of the lookup-tables. This article proposes an algorithm with approximate to the area-optimal solution and lower time complexity. The time complexity of this algorithm is proven theoretically to be bounded by O(n3), where n is the total number of gates in the given circuit. It is shown that except for some cases the proposed algorithm can find an optimal solution of a given problem. We have combined the proposed algorithm with the existing postprocessing procedures which are used to find the gates that can be duplicated on a set of benchmark examples. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.","author":["Chi-Chou Kao","Yen-Tai Lai"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 10","Issue 1","January 2005","pp   168\u2013186","https://doi.org/10.1145/1044111.1044121"],"date":"01 January 2005","ref":[{"text":"Chowdhary, A. and Hayes, J.

In this paper, we first develop an accurate FPGA power model and then design novel Vdd-programmable interconnect switches with minimum number of configuration SRAM cells. Applying our power model to placed and routed benchmark circuits, we evaluate Vdd-programmable FPGA architecture using the new switches. The best architecture in our study uses Vdd-programmable logic blocks and Vdd-gateable interconnects. Compared to the baseline architecture similar to the leading commercial architecture, the best architecture reduces the minimal energy-delay product by 44.14% with 48% area overhead and 3% SRAM cell increase. Our evaluation results also show that LUT size 4 always gives the lowest energy consumption while LUT size 7 always leads to the highest performance for all evaluated architectures.","author":["Yan Lin","Fei Li","Lei He"],"issue":["FPGA '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/SIGDA 13th international symposium on Field-programmable gate arrays","February 2005","Pages   199\u2013207","https://doi.org/10.1145/1046192.1046218"],"date":"20 February 2005","ref":[{"text":"E.

Although several attempts have been made to improve disk array energy management, the existing solutions either provide little energy savings or significantly degrade performance for data center workloads.Our solution, Hibernator, is a disk array energy management system that provides improved energy savings while meeting performance goals. Hibernator combines a number of techniques to achieve this: the use of disks that can spin at different speeds, a coarse-grained approach for dynamically deciding which disks should spin at which speeds, efficient ways to migrate the right data to an appropriate-speed disk automatically, and automatic performance boosts if there is a risk that performance goals might not be met due to disk energy management.In this paper, we describe the Hibernator design, and present evaluations of it using both trace-driven simulations and a hybrid system comprised of a real database server (IBM DB2) and an emulated storage server with multi-speed disks. Our file-system and on-line transaction processing (OLTP) simulation results show that Hibernator can provide up to 65% energy savings while continuing to satisfy performance goals (6.5--26 times better than previous solutions). Our OLTP emulated system results show that Hibernator can save more energy (29%) than previous solutions, while still providing an OLTP transaction rate comparable to a RAID5 array with no energy management.","author":["Qingbo Zhu","Zhifeng Chen","Lin Tan","Yuanyuan Zhou","Kimberly Keeton","John Wilkes"],"issue":["ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","Volume 39","Issue 5","December 2005","pp   177\u2013190","https://doi.org/10.1145/1095809.1095828"],"date":"20 October 2005","ref":[{"text":"ILOG CPLEX 7.0 documentation home page. http://www.ise.ufl.edu/ilog/cplex70/.","order":1},{"text":"Panel computer hard disk drive precautions. http://www.pro-face.com/support/technical/00apr3.htm.","order":2},{"text":"Symmetrix 3000 and 5000 Enterprise Storage Systems product description guide. http://www.emc.com/, 1999.","order":3},{"text":"Dell PowerEdge 6650 executive summary. http://www.tpc.org/results/individual_results/Dell/dell_6650_010603_es.pdf, Mar. 2003.","order":4},{"text":"HP announces \"smart\" cooling solution for data centers. http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2003/030304b.html, March 4 2003.","order":5},{"text":"HP Integrity RX5670 Cluster 64P Executive Summary. http://www.tpc.org/results/individual_results/HP/HP20Integrity20rx5670\\20Cluster\\2064P_ES.pdf, Dec. 2003.","order":6},{"text":"D.

While spatial locality existing in the access stream increases SDRAM row hit rate, it also increases row conflicts. Mapping of the physical address bits into SDRAM column, row, bank and rank index impacts system performance significantly. A novel address mapping scheme, called bit-reversal, is described and experimentally compared against known methods. The bit-reversal address mapping increases SDRAM row hit rate from 43% to 66% by distributing conflicting memory accesses over independent SDRAM banks. Bit-reversal address mapping reduces the average memory access latency by 26%-29% over other methods, resulting in a 11.7%-13.5% reduction of total execution time. The configuration space of bit-reversal address mapping is explored. Finally, limited studies examining the impact of address mapping techniques in conjunction with SDRAM controller policy and virtual paging illustrate that mapping is better suited to virtual memory free embedded systems than desktop workstations incorporating paging mechanisms.","author":["Jun Shao","Brian T.

Instead of overwriting existing blocks, NILFS appends consistent sets of modified or newly created blocks continuously into segmented disk regions. This writing method allows NILFS to achieve faster recovery time and higher write performance. The address of the block that is written to changes for each write, which makes it difficult to apply modern file system technologies such as B-tree structures. To permit such writing on the Linux kernel basis, NILFS has its own write mechanism that handles data and meta data as one unit and allows them to be relocated. This paper presents the design and implementation of NILFS focussing on the write mechanism.","author":["Ryusuke Konishi","Yoshiji Amagai","Koji Sato","Hisashi Hifumi","Seiji Kihara","Satoshi Moriai"],"issue":["ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","Volume 40","Issue 3","July 2006","pp   102\u2013107","https://doi.org/10.1145/1151374.1151375"],"date":"01 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"JFS for Linux. http://jfs.sourceforge.net/.]]","order":1},{"text":"Project XFS Linux. http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/.]]","order":2},{"text":"ReiserFS. http://www.namesys.com/.]]","order":3},{"text":"R.

Floorplanning or block-level placement offers excellent potential for thermal optimization through better heat spreading between the blocks, but these optimizations can also impact the throughput of a microarchitecture, measured in terms of the number of instructions per cycle (IPC). In nanometer technologies, global buses can have multicycle delays that depend on the positions of the blocks, and it is important for a floorplanner to be microarchitecturally-aware to be sure that thermal and IPC considerations are appropriately balanced. This paper proposes a methodology for thermally-aware microarchitecture floorplanning. The approach models the interactions between the IPC and the temperature distribution, and incorporates both factors in the floorplanning cost function. Our approach uses transient modeling and optimizes both the peak and the average temperatures, and employs a design of experiments (DOE) based strategy, which effectively captures the huge exponential search space with a small number of cycle-accurate simulations. A comparison with a technique based on previous work indicates that the proposed approach results in good reductions both in the average and the peak temperatures for a range of SPEC benchmarks.","author":["Vidyasagar Nookala","David J.

As technology has improved, reconfigurable hardware has become a viable platform to provide application acceleration, even for floating-point-intensive scientific applications. Now, reconfigurable computers---computers with general purpose microprocessors, reconfigurable hardware, memory, and high performance interconnect---are emerging as platforms that allow complete applications to be partitioned into parts that execute in software and parts that are accelerated in hardware. In this paper, we study molecular dynamics simulation. Specifically, we study the use of the smooth particle mesh Ewald technique in a molecular dynamics simulation program that takes advantage of the hardware acceleration capabilities of a reconfigurable computer. We demonstrate a 2.7-2.9xspeed-up over the corresponding software-only simulation program. Along the way, we note design issues and techniques related to the use of reconfigurable computers for scientific computing in general.","author":["Ronald Scrofano","Viktor K.

By bringing together a group of researchers spanning the areas of computer science, physics, and the mathematical sciences, the workshop aimed to improve communication across these scientific disciplines, enable interdisciplinary cross-fertilization, identify commonalities in the different approaches, promote synergy where it exists, and utilize the richness that results from exploring similar problems from multiple perspectives.This report describes the findings of the workshop, outlines a set of relevant open research problems identified by participants, and concludes with recommendations that can benefit all scientific communities interested in Internet topology research.","author":["Dmitri Krioukov","kc claffy","Marina Fomenkov","Fan Chung","Alessandro Vespignani","Walter Willinger"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 37","Issue 1","January 2007","pp   69\u201373","https://doi.org/10.1145/1198255.1198267"],"date":"22 January 2007","ref":[{"text":"C.

It provides general implementations of the classical statistical tests for RNGs, as well as several others tests proposed in the literature, and some original ones. Predefined tests suites for sequences of uniform random numbers over the interval (0, 1) and for bit sequences are available. Tools are also offered to perform systematic studies of the interaction between a specific test and the structure of the point sets produced by a given family of RNGs. That is, for a given kind of test and a given class of RNGs, to determine how large should be the sample size of the test, as a function of the generator's period length, before the generator starts to fail the test systematically. Finally, the library provides various types of generators implemented in generic form, as well as many specific generators proposed in the literature or found in widely used software. The tests can be applied to instances of the generators predefined in the library, or to user-defined generators, or to streams of random numbers produced by any kind of device or stored in files. Besides introducing TestU01, the article provides a survey and a classification of statistical tests for RNGs. It also applies batteries of tests to a long list of widely used RNGs.","author":["Pierre L'Ecuyer","Richard Simard"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software","Volume 33","Issue 4","August 2007","Article No.: 22","pp   1\u201340","https://doi.org/10.1145/1268776.1268777"],"date":"15 August 2007","ref":[{"text":"Agarwal, R.

Partial use of benchmark suites by researchers, due to simulation time constraints, compiler difficulties, or library or system call issues is likely to happen; but a random subset can lead to misleading results. This paper analyzes the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks using performance counter based experimentation from several state of the art systems, and uses statistical techniques such as principal component analysis and clustering to draw inferences on the similarity of the benchmarks and the redundancy in the suite and arrive at meaningful subsets.The SPEC CPU2006 benchmark suite contains several programs from areas such as artificial intelligence and includes none from the electronic design automation (EDA) application area. Hence there is a concern on the application balance in the suite. An analysis from the perspective of fundamental program characteristics shows that the included programs offer characteristics broader than the EDA programs' space. A subset of 6 integer programs and 8 floating point programs can yield most of the information from the entire suite.","author":["Aashish Phansalkar","Ajay Joshi","Lizy K.

Compiler frameworks have also been developed that can transform sequential stencil codes for optimization of data locality and parallelism. However, loop skewing is typically required in order to tile stencil codes along the time dimension, resulting in load imbalance in pipelined parallel execution of the tiles. In this paper, we develop an approach for automatic parallelization of stencil codes, that explicitly addresses the issue of load-balanced execution of tiles. Experimental results are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.","author":["Sriram Krishnamoorthy","Muthu Baskaran","Uday Bondhugula","J.

The next query is chosen according to the principle of maximal disagreement. The algorithm is studied for two toy models: the high-low game and perceptron learning of another perceptron. As the number of queries goes to infinity, the committee algorithm yields asymptotically finite information gain. This leads to generalization error that decreases exponentially with the number of examples. This in marked contrast to learning from randomly chosen inputs, for which the information gain approaches zero and the generalization error decreases with a relatively slow inverse power law. We suggest that asymptotically finite information gain may be an important characteristic of good query algorithms.","author":["H. S. Seung","M. Opper","H.

These models took off in the eighties and early nineties alongside object-oriented models. Their influence gradually died out with the emergence of other database models, in particular geographical, spatial, semistructured, and XML. Recently, the need to manage information with graph-like nature has reestablished the relevance of this area.

The Amazon.com platform, which provides services for many web sites worldwide, is implemented on top of an infrastructure of tens of thousands of servers and network components located in many datacenters around the world. At this scale, small and large components fail continuously and the way persistent state is managed in the face of these failures drives the reliability and scalability of the software systems.This paper presents the design and implementation of Dynamo, a highly available key-value storage system that some of Amazon's core services use to provide an \"always-on\" experience. To achieve this level of availability, Dynamo sacrifices consistency under certain failure scenarios. It makes extensive use of object versioning and application-assisted conflict resolution in a manner that provides a novel interface for developers to use.","author":["Giuseppe DeCandia","Deniz Hastorun","Madan Jampani","Gunavardhan Kakulapati","Avinash Lakshman","Alex Pilchin","Swaminathan Sivasubramanian","Peter Vosshall","Werner Vogels"],"issue":["ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","Volume 41","Issue 6","December 2007","pp   205\u2013220","https://doi.org/10.1145/1323293.1294281"],"date":"14 October 2007","ref":[{"text":"Adya, A., Bolosky, W.

It forms a basis to interpret the TF-IDF term weights as making relevance decisions. It simulates the local relevance decision-making for every location of a document, and combines all of these \u201clocal\u201d relevance decisions as the \u201cdocument-wide\u201d relevance decision for the document. The significance of interpreting TF-IDF in this way is the potential to: (1) establish a unifying perspective about information retrieval as relevance decision-making; and (2) develop advanced TF-IDF-related term weights for future elaborate retrieval models. Our novel retrieval model is simplified to a basic ranking formula that directly corresponds to the TF-IDF term weights. In general, we show that the term-frequency factor of the ranking formula can be rendered into different term-frequency factors of existing retrieval systems. In the basic ranking formula, the remaining quantity - log p(r\u00af|t \u2208 d) is interpreted as the probability of randomly picking a nonrelevant usage (denoted by r\u00af) of term t. Mathematically, we show that this quantity can be approximated by the inverse document-frequency (IDF). Empirically, we show that this quantity is related to IDF, using four reference TREC ad hoc retrieval data collections.","author":["Ho Chung Wu","Robert Wing Pong Luk","Kam Fai Wong","Kui Lam Kwok"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 26","Issue 3","June 2008","Article No.: 13","pp   1\u201337","https://doi.org/10.1145/1361684.1361686"],"date":"20 June 2008","ref":[{"text":"Aizawa, A. 2003.

While DVS is suitable for addressing workloads with uniformly high temperatures, for nonuniform workloads, performance loss occurs because of the slowdown of the cooler thread. To address this, we propose and evaluate DTM mechanisms that exploit the steering-based thread management mechanisms inherent in a clustered SMT architecture. We show that in contrast to DVS, which operates globally, our techniques are more effective at controlling temperature for nonuniform workloads. Furthermore, we devise a DTM technique that combines steering and DVS to achieve consistently good performance across all workloads.","author":["Jonathan A. Winter","David H.

In the core of dynamic thermal management schemes lies accurate reading of on-die temperatures. Therefore, careful planning and embedding of thermal monitoring mechanisms into high-performance systems becomes crucial. In this paper, we propose three techniques to create sensor infrastructures for monitoring the maximum temperature on a multicore system. Initially, we extend a nonuniform sensor placement methodology proposed in the literature to handle chip multiprocessors (CMPs) and show its limitations. We then analyze a grid-based approach where the sensors are placed on a static grid covering each core and show that the sensor readings can differ from the actual maximum core temperature by as much as 12.6\u00b0C when using 16 sensors per core. Also, as large as 10.6% of the thermal emergencies are not captured using the same number of sensors. Based on this observation, we first develop an interpolation scheme, which estimates the maximum core temperature through interpolation of the readings collected at the static grid points. We show that the interpolation scheme improves the measurement accuracy and emergency coverage compared to grid-based placement when using the same number of sensors. Second, we present a dynamic scheme where only a subset of the sensor readings is collected to predict the maximum temperature of each core. Our results indicate that, we can reduce the number of active sensors by as much as 50%, while maintaining similar measurement accuracy and emergency coverage compared to the case where the entire sensor set on the grid is sampled at all times.","author":["Jieyi Long","Seda Ogrenci Memik","Gokhan Memik","Rajarshi Mukherjee"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 5","Issue 2","August 2008","Article No.: 9","pp   1\u201333","https://doi.org/10.1145/1400112.1400114"],"date":"03 September 2008","ref":[{"text":"Binkert, N.

Progressive photon mapping is a multi-pass algorithm where the first pass is ray tracing followed by any number of photon tracing passes. Each photon tracing pass results in an increasingly accurate global illumination solution that can be visualized in order to provide progressive feedback. Progressive photon mapping uses a new radiance estimate that converges to the correct radiance value as more photons are used. It is not necessary to store the full photon map, and unlike standard photon mapping it possible to compute a global illumination solution with any desired accuracy using a limited amount of memory. Compared with existing Monte Carlo ray tracing methods progressive photon mapping provides an efficient and robust alternative in the presence of complex light transport such as caustics and in particular reflections of caustics.","author":["Toshiya Hachisuka","Shinji Ogaki","Henrik Wann Jensen"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 27","Issue 5","December 2008","Article No.: 130","pp   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/1409060.1409083"],"date":"01 December 2008","ref":[{"text":"Christensen, P.

Recognizing the problem as a learning task in the early 1990's, the machine learning community has developed the field of meta-learning, focused on learning about learning algorithm performance on classification problems. But there has been only limited generalization of these ideas beyond classification, and many related attempts have been made in other disciplines (such as AI and operations research) to tackle the algorithm selection problem in different ways, introducing different terminology, and overlooking the similarities of approaches. In this sense, there is much to be gained from a greater awareness of developments in meta-learning, and how these ideas can be generalized to learn about the behaviors of other (nonlearning) algorithms. In this article we present a unified framework for considering the algorithm selection problem as a learning problem, and use this framework to tie together the crossdisciplinary developments in tackling the algorithm selection problem. We discuss the generalization of meta-learning concepts to algorithms focused on tasks including sorting, forecasting, constraint satisfaction, and optimization, and the extension of these ideas to bioinformatics, cryptography, and other fields.","author":["Kate A.

However, little quantitative information is available about the extent of the problem or about the impact that it has on information retrieval systems. We report on an analysis of lexical ambiguity in information retrieval test collections and on experiments to determine the utility of word meanings for separating relevant from nonrelevant documents. The experiments show that there is considerable ambiguity even in a specialized database. Word senses provide a significant separation between relevant and nonrelevant documents, but several factors contribute to determining whether disambiguation will make an improvement in performance. For example, resolving lexical ambiguity was found to have little impact on retrieval effectiveness for documents that have many words in common with the query. Other uses of word sense disambiguation in an information retrieval context are discussed.","author":["Robert Krovetz","W.

Much of the previous work on the nested relational model has concentrated on defining the data structures and query language for the model. The work done on integrity constraints in nested relations has mainly focused on characterizing subclasses of nested relations and defining normal forms for nested relations with certain desirable properties.In this paper we define the semantics of nested relations, which may contain null values, in terms of integrity constraints, called null extended data dependencies, which extend functional dependencies and join dependencies encountered in flat relational database theory. We formalize incomplete information in nested relations by allowing only one unmarked generic null value, whose semantics we do not further specify. The motivation for the choice of a generic null is our desire to investigate only fundamental semantics which are common to all unmarked null types. This lead us to define a preorder on nested relations, which allows us to measure the relative information content of nested relations. We also define a procedure, called the extended chase procedure, for testing satisfaction of null extended data dependencies and for making inferences by using these null extended data dependencies. The extended chase procedure is shown to generalize the classical chase procedure, which is of major importance in flat relational database theory. As a consequence of our approach we are able to capture the novel notion of losslessness in nested relations, called herein null extended lossless decomposition. Finally, we show that the semantics of nested relations are a natural extension of the semantics of flat relations.","author":["Mark Levene","George Loizou"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Database Systems","Volume 18","Issue 3","Sept. 1993","pp   414\u2013459","https://doi.org/10.1145/155271.155275"],"date":"01 September 1993","ref":[{"text":"ABITEBOUL, S., AND BIDOIT, N.

Temporal memory streaming replays previously observed miss sequences to eliminate long chains of dependent misses. Spatial memory streaming predicts repetitive data layout patterns within fixed-size memory regions. Because each technique targets a different subset of misses, their effectiveness varies across workloads and each leaves a significant fraction of misses unpredicted.In this paper, we propose Spatio-Temporal Memory Streaming (STeMS) to exploit the synergy between spatial and temporal streaming. We observe that the order of spatial accesses repeats both within and across regions. STeMS records and replays the temporal sequence of region accesses and uses spatial relationships within each region to dynamically reconstruct a predicted total miss order. Using trace-driven and cycle-accurate simulation across a suite of commercial workloads, we demonstrate that with similar implementation complexity as temporal streaming, STeMS achieves equal or higher coverage than spatial or temporal memory streaming alone, and improves performance by 31%, 3%, and 18% over stride, spatial, and temporal prediction, respectively.","author":["Stephen Somogyi","Thomas F.

Of course, the scripts and thus the tree structure evolve over time, causing wrappers to break repeatedly, and resulting in a high cost of maintaining wrappers. In this paper, we explore a novel approach: we use temporal snapshots of web pages to develop a tree-edit model of HTML, and use this model to improve wrapper construction. We view the changes to the tree structure as suppositions of a series of edit operations: deleting nodes, inserting nodes and substituting labels of nodes. The tree structures evolve by choosing these edit operations stochastically. Our model is attractive in that the probability that a source tree has evolved into a target tree can be estimated efficiently--in quadratic time in the size of the trees--making it a potentially useful tool for a variety of tree-evolution problems. We give an algorithm to learn the probabilistic model from training examples consisting of pairs of trees, and apply this algorithm to collections of web-page snapshots to derive HTML-specific tree edit models. Finally, we describe a novel wrapper-construction framework that takes the tree-edit model into account, and compare the quality of resulting wrappers to that of traditional wrappers on synthetic and real HTML document examples.","author":["Nilesh Dalvi","Philip Bohannon","Fei Sha"],"issue":["SIGMOD '09: Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data","June 2009","Pages   335\u2013348","https://doi.org/10.1145/1559845.1559882"],"date":"29 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"Mari Abe and Masahiro Hori.

In most existing work, the top-ranked documents from an initial search are assumed to be relevant and used for PRF. One problem with this approach is that one or more of the top retrieved documents may be non-relevant, which can introduce noise into the feedback process. Besides, existing methods generally do not take into account the significantly different types of queries that are often entered into an IR system. Intuitively, Wikipedia can be seen as a large, manually edited document collection which could be exploited to improve document retrieval effectiveness within PRF. It is not obvious how we might best utilize information from Wikipedia in PRF, and to date, the potential of Wikipedia for this task has been largely unexplored. In our work, we present a systematic exploration of the utilization of Wikipedia in PRF for query dependent expansion. Specifically, we classify TREC topics into three categories based on Wikipedia: 1) entity queries, 2) ambiguous queries, and 3) broader queries. We propose and study the effectiveness of three methods for expansion term selection, each modeling the Wikipedia based pseudo-relevance information from a different perspective. We incorporate the expansion terms into the original query and use language modeling IR to evaluate these methods. Experiments on four TREC test collections, including the large web collection GOV2, show that retrieval performance of each type of query can be improved. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed method out-performs the baseline relevance model in terms of precision and robustness.","author":["Yang Xu","Gareth J.F.

The method operates by joint use of seam carving and image scaling. The principle behind our method is the use of a bidirectional similarity function of image Euclidean distance (IMED), while cooperating with a dominant color descriptor (DCD) similarity and seam energy variation. The function is suitable for the quantitative evaluation of the resizing result and the determination of the best seam carving number. Different from the previous simplex-mode approaches, our method takes the advantages of both discrete and continuous methods. The technique is useful in image resizing for both reduction/retargeting and enlarging. We also show that this approach can be extended to indirect image resizing.","author":["Weiming Dong","Ning Zhou","Jean-Claude Paul","Xiaopeng Zhang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 28","Issue 5","December 2009","pp   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/1618452.1618471"],"date":"01 December 2009","ref":[{"text":"Avidan, S., and Shamir, A. 2007.

In conventional design practice, the nMOS transistor within each memory cell is sized to be large enough to carry a current larger than the worst-case MTJ write current threshold, leading to an increasing storage density penalty as the technology scales down. To mitigate such variability-induced storage density penalty, this paper presents a smaller-than-worst-case transistor sizing approach with the underlying theme of jointly considering memory cell transistor sizing and defect tolerance. Its effectiveness is demonstrated using 256Mb STT MRAM design at 45nm node as a test vehicle. Results show that, under a normalized write current threshold deviation of 20%, the overall memory die size can be reduced by more than 20% compared with the conventional worst-case transistor sizing design practice.","author":["Wei Xu","Yiran Chen","Xiaobin Wang","Tong Zhang"],"issue":["DAC '09: Proceedings of the 46th Annual Design Automation Conference","July 2009","Pages   87\u201390","https://doi.org/10.1145/1629911.1629936"],"date":"26 July 2009","ref":[{"text":". http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/cacti/.","order":1},{"text":". http://www.eas.asu.edu/~ptm/.","order":2},{"text":"Y.

We propose a novel superblock-based FTL scheme, which combines a set of adjacent logical blocks into a superblock. In the proposed Superblock FTL, superblocks are mapped at coarse granularity, while pages inside the superblock are mapped freely at fine granularity to any location in several physical blocks. To reduce extra storage and flash memory operations, the fine-grain mapping information is stored in the spare area of NAND flash memory. This hybrid address translation scheme has the flexibility provided by fine-grain address translation, while reducing the memory overhead to the level of coarse-grain address translation. Our experimental results show that the proposed FTL scheme significantly outperforms previous block-mapped FTL schemes with roughly the same memory overhead.","author":["Dawoon Jung","Jeong-UK Kang","Heeseung Jo","Jin-Soo Kim","Joonwon Lee"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 9","Issue 4","March 2010","Article No.: 40","pp   1\u201341","https://doi.org/10.1145/1721695.1721706"],"date":"06 April 2010","ref":[{"text":"Ban, A. 1995.

We use TAL and Hoare logic to achieve highly automated, static verification of the safety of a new operating system called Verve. Our techniques and tools mechanically verify the safety of every assembly language instruction in the operating system, run-time system, drivers, and applications (in fact, every part of the system software except the boot loader). Verve consists of a \"Nucleus\" that provides primitive access to hardware and memory, a kernel that builds services on top of the Nucleus, and applications that run on top of the kernel. The Nucleus, written in verified assembly language, implements allocation, garbage collection, multiple stacks, interrupt handling, and device access. The kernel, written in C# and compiled to TAL, builds higher-level services, such as preemptive threads, on top of the Nucleus. A TAL checker verifies the safety of the kernel and applications. A Hoare-style verifier with an automated theorem prover verifies both the safety and correctness of the Nucleus. Verve is, to the best of our knowledge, the first operating system mechanically verified to guarantee both type and memory safety. More generally, Verve's approach demonstrates a practical way to mix high-level typed code with low-level untyped code in a verifiably safe manner.","author":["Jean Yang","Chris Hawblitzel"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 45","Issue 6","June 2010","pp   99\u2013110","https://doi.org/10.1145/1809028.1806610"],"date":"05 June 2010","ref":[{"text":"G.

To keep dynamic power constant across process generations, traditional MOSFET scaling theory prescribes reducing supply and threshold voltages in proportion to device dimensions, a practice that induces an exponential increase in subthreshold leakage. As a result, leakage power has become comparable to dynamic power in current-generation processes, and will soon exceed it in magnitude if voltages are scaled down any further. Beyond this inflection point, multicore processors will not be able to afford keeping more than a small fraction of all cores active at any given moment. Multicore scaling will soon hit a power wall. This paper presents resistive computation, a new technique that aims at avoiding the power wall by migrating most of the functionality of a modern microprocessor from CMOS to spin-torque transfer magnetoresistive RAM (STT-MRAM)---a CMOS-compatible, leakage-resistant, non-volatile resistive memory technology. By implementing much of the on-chip storage and combinational logic using leakage-resistant, scalable RAM blocks and lookup tables, and by carefully re-architecting the pipeline, an STT-MRAM based implementation of an eight-core Sun Niagara-like CMT processor reduces chip-wide power dissipation by 1.7\u00d7 and leakage power by 2.1\u00d7 at the 32nm technology node, while maintaining 93% of the system throughput of a CMOS-based design.","author":["Xiaochen Guo","Engin Ipek","Tolga Soyata"],"issue":["ISCA '10: Proceedings of the 37th annual international symposium on Computer architecture","June 2010","Pages   371\u2013382","https://doi.org/10.1145/1815961.1816012"],"date":"19 June 2010","ref":[{"text":"V.

The scalability of PCM is enhanced by the property that PCM devices can store multiple bits per cell. While such Multi-Level Cell (MLC) devices can offer high density, this benefit comes at the expense of increased read latency, which can cause significant performance degradation. This paper proposes Morphable Memory System (MMS), a robust architecture for efficiently incorporating MLC PCM devices in main memory. MMS is based on observation that memory requirement varies between workloads, and systems are typically over-provisioned in terms of memory capacity. So, during a phase of low memory usage, some of the MLC devices can be operated at fewer bits per cell to obtain lower latency. When the workload requires full memory capacity, these devices can be restored to high density MLC operation to have full main-memory capacity. We provide the runtime monitors, the hardware-OS interface, and the detailed mechanism for implementing MMS. Our evaluations on an 8-core 8GB MLC PCM-based system show that MMS provides, on average, low latency access for 95% of all memory requests, thereby improving overall system performance by 40%.","author":["Moinuddin K.

The OptiX engine builds on the key observation that most ray tracing algorithms can be implemented using a small set of programmable operations. Consequently, the core of OptiX is a domain-specific just-in-time compiler that generates custom ray tracing kernels by combining user-supplied programs for ray generation, material shading, object intersection, and scene traversal. This enables the implementation of a highly diverse set of ray tracing-based algorithms and applications, including interactive rendering, offline rendering, collision detection systems, artificial intelligence queries, and scientific simulations such as sound propagation. OptiX achieves high performance through a compact object model and application of several ray tracing-specific compiler optimizations. For ease of use it exposes a single-ray programming model with full support for recursion and a dynamic dispatch mechanism similar to virtual function calls.","author":["Steven G.

The CamCube project explores the design of a shipping container sized data center with the goal of building an easier platform on which to build these applications. CamCube replaces the traditional switch-based network with a 3D torus topology, with each server directly connected to six other servers. As in other proposals, e.g. DCell and BCube, multi-hop routing in CamCube requires servers to participate in packet forwarding. To date, as in existing data centers, these approaches have all provided a single routing protocol for the applications.In this paper we explore if allowing applications to implement their own routing services is advantageous, and if we can support it efficiently. This is based on the observation that, due to the flexibility offered by the CamCube API, many applications implemented their own routing protocol in order to achieve specific application-level characteristics, such as trading off higher-latency for better path convergence. Using large-scale simulations we demonstrate the benefits and network-level impact of running multiple routing protocols. We demonstrate that applications are more efficient and do not generate additional control traffic overhead. This motivates us to design an extended routing service allowing easy implementation of application-specific routing protocols on CamCube. Finally, we demonstrate that the additional performance overhead incurred when using the extended routing service on a prototype CamCube is very low.","author":["Hussam Abu-Libdeh","Paolo Costa","Antony Rowstron","Greg O'Shea","Austin Donnelly"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 40","Issue 4","October 2010","pp   51\u201362","https://doi.org/10.1145/1851275.1851191"],"date":"30 August 2010","ref":[{"text":"N.

In this paper, we present a programmable accelerator for this workload domain. To architect the accelerator, we profile five representative workloads, and find that their computationally intensive portions can be formulated as matrix or vector operations generating large amounts of intermediate data, which are then reduced by a secondary operation such as array ranking, finding max/min and aggregation. The proposed accelerator, called MAPLE, has hundreds of simple processing elements (PEs) laid out in a two-dimensional grid, with two key features. First, it uses in-memory processing where on-chip memory blocks perform the secondary reduction operations. By doing so, the intermediate data are dynamically processed and never stored or sent off-chip. Second, MAPLE uses banked off-chip memory, and organizes its PEs into independent groups each with its own off-chip memory bank. These two features together allow MAPLE to scale its performance with data size. This paper describes the MAPLE architecture, explores its design space with a simulator, and illustrates how to automatically map application kernels to the hardware. We also implement a 512-PE FPGA prototype of MAPLE and find that it is 1.5-10x faster than a 2.5 GHz quad-core Xeon processor despite running at a modest 125 MHz.","author":["Srihari Cadambi","Abhinandan Majumdar","Michela Becchi","Srimat Chakradhar","Hans Peter Graf"],"issue":["PACT '10: Proceedings of the 19th international conference on Parallel architectures and compilation techniques","September 2010","Pages   273\u2013284","https://doi.org/10.1145/1854273.1854309"],"date":"11 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"}}Mei, T., Hua, X., Yang, L., Li, S., \"VideoSense: towards effective online video advertising,\" Proc. 15th International Conference on Multimedia 2007, pp 1075--1084.","doi":"10.1145/1291233.1291467","order":1},{"text":"}}Datta, R., et al.,\"Image retrieval: Ideas, influences, and trends of the new age,\" ACM Comput.

However, the slow speed of persistent storage (i.e., disk) has restricted their design and limited their performance. Fast, byte-addressable, non-volatile technologies, such as phase change memory, will remove this constraint and allow programmers to build high-performance, persistent data structures in non-volatile storage that is almost as fast as DRAM. Creating these data structures requires a system that is lightweight enough to expose the performance of the underlying memories but also ensures safety in the presence of application and system failures by avoiding familiar bugs such as dangling pointers, multiple free()s, and locking errors. In addition, the system must prevent new types of hard-to-find pointer safety bugs that only arise with persistent objects. These bugs are especially dangerous since any corruption they cause will be permanent.We have implemented a lightweight, high-performance persistent object system called NV-heaps that provides transactional semantics while preventing these errors and providing a model for persistence that is easy to use and reason about. We implement search trees, hash tables, sparse graphs, and arrays using NV-heaps, BerkeleyDB, and Stasis. Our results show that NV-heap performance scales with thread count and that data structures implemented using NV-heaps out-perform BerkeleyDB and Stasis implementations by 32x and 244x, respectively, by avoiding the operating system and minimizing other software overheads. We also quantify the cost of enforcing the safety guarantees that NV-heaps provide and measure the costs of NV-heap primitive operations.","author":["Joel Coburn","Adrian M.

Unfortunately, general-purpose programming models available today can yield high performance but are too low-level to be accessible to the average programmer. We propose leveraging domain-specific languages (DSLs) to map high-level application code to heterogeneous devices. To demonstrate the potential of this approach we present OptiML, a DSL for machine learning. OptiML programs are implicitly parallel and can achieve high performance on heterogeneous hardware with no modification required to the source code. For such a DSL-based approach to be tractable at large scales, better tools are required for DSL authors to simplify language creation and parallelization. To address this concern, we introduce Delite, a system designed specifically for DSLs that is both a framework for creating an implicitly parallel DSL as well as a dynamic runtime providing automated targeting to heterogeneous parallel hardware. We show that OptiML running on Delite achieves single-threaded, parallel, and GPU performance superior to explicitly parallelized MATLAB code in nearly all cases.","author":["Hassan Chafi","Arvind K.

Due to complex design of the memory and compute subsystems on GPUs, the performance of FFT kernels over the range of possible input parameters can vary widely. We generate several variants for each component of the FFT kernel that, for different cases, are likely to perform well. Our auto-tuner composes variants to generate kernels and selects the best ones. We present heuristics to prune the search space and profile only a small fraction of all possible kernels. We compose optimized kernels to improve the performance of larger FFT computations. We implement the system using the NVIDIA CUDA API and compare its performance to the state-of-the-art FFT libraries. On a range of NVIDIA GPUs and input sizes, our auto-tuned FFTs outperform the NVIDIA CUFFT 3.0 library by up to 38x and deliver up to 3x higher performance compared to a manually-tuned FFT.","author":["Yuri Dotsenko","Sara S.

This paper presents a design methodology to efficiently and automatically implement memory accesses in High-Level Synthesis. In particular, the approach starts from a behavioral specification (in pure C language) and a set of design constraints, such as the memory addresses where some of the data are stored. The methodology classifies which variables can be internally or externally allocated to the different modules to generate the proper architecture, fully supporting a wide range of C constructs, such as pointer arithmetic, function calls and array accesses. Moreover it allows to parallelize the accesses when the memory address is known at compile time, resulting in an efficient execution of the specification.","author":["Christian Pilato","Fabrizio Ferrandi","Donatella Sciuto"],"issue":["CODES+ISSS '11: Proceedings of the seventh IEEE/ACM/IFIP international conference on Hardware/software codesign and system synthesis","October 2011","Pages   49\u201358","https://doi.org/10.1145/2039370.2039381"],"date":"09 October 2011","ref":[{"text":"GCC - GNU Compiler Collection. http://gcc.gnu.org.","order":1},{"text":"Mentor ModelSim SE 6.6d User Guide. http://www.mentor.com.","order":2},{"text":"Xilinx ISE Design Suite 12.3 User Guide. http://www.xilinx.com.","order":3},{"text":"Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA. http://www.xilinx.com/products/virtex5/.","order":4},{"text":"A.

RAMCloud scatters backup data across hundreds or thousands of disks, and it harnesses hundreds of servers in parallel to reconstruct lost data. The system uses a log-structured approach for all its data, in DRAM as well as on disk: this provides high performance both during normal operation and during recovery. RAMCloud employs randomized techniques to manage the system in a scalable and decentralized fashion. In a 60-node cluster, RAMCloud recovers 35 GB of data from a failed server in 1.6 seconds. Our measurements suggest that the approach will scale to recover larger memory sizes (64 GB or more) in less time with larger clusters.","author":["Diego Ongaro","Stephen M.

Within this paper, we outline the basic characteristics of the SAP HANA database, emphasizing the distinctive features that differentiate the SAP HANA database from other classical relational database management systems. On the technical side, the SAP HANA database consists of multiple data processing engines with a distributed query processing environment to provide the full spectrum of data processing -- from classical relational data supporting both row- and column-oriented physical representations in a hybrid engine, to graph and text processing for semi- and unstructured data management within the same system.From a more application-oriented perspective, we outline the specific support provided by the SAP HANA database of multiple domain-specific languages with a built-in set of natively implemented business functions. SQL -- as the lingua franca for relational database systems -- can no longer be considered to meet all requirements of modern applications, which demand the tight interaction with the data management layer. Therefore, the SAP HANA database permits the exchange of application semantics with the underlying data management platform that can be exploited to increase query expressiveness and to reduce the number of individual application-to-database round trips.","author":["Franz F\u00e4rber","Sang Kyun Cha","J\u00fcrgen Primsch","Christof Bornh\u00f6vd","Stefan Sigg","Wolfgang Lehner"],"issue":["ACM SIGMOD Record","Volume 40","Issue 4","December 2011","pp   45\u201351","https://doi.org/10.1145/2094114.2094126"],"date":"11 January 2012","ref":[{"text":"P.

However, energy efficiency is necessary but not sufficient for sustainability, which demands reduced usage of energy from fossil fuels. This paper investigates the feasibility of powering internet-scale systems using (nearly) entirely renewable energy. We perform a trace-based study to evaluate three issues related to achieving this goal: the impact of geographical load balancing, the role of storage, and the optimal mix of renewables. Our results highlight that geographical load balancing can significantly reduce the required capacity of renewable energy by using the energy more efficiently with \"follow the renewables\" routing. Further, our results show that small-scale storage can be useful, especially in combination with geographical load balancing, and that an optimal mix of renewables includes significantly more wind than photovoltaic solar.","author":["Zhenhua Liu","Minghong Lin","Adam Wierman","Steven H.

Unfortunately, raytracing in the current mobile environment is difficult because of inadequate computing power, memory bandwidth, and flexibility in mobile GPUs. In this work, we present a novel mobile GPU architecture called the SGRT (Samsung reconfigurable GPU based on RayTracing) by enhancing our previous works with the following features: 1) a fast compact hardware engine that accelerates a traversal and intersection operation, 2) a flexible reconfigurable processor that supports software ray generation and shading, and 3) a parallelization framework that achieves scalable performance. Unlike our previous work, the current architecture is designed for both static and dynamic scenes with a smaller area. Experimental results show that the SGRT can be a versatile graphics solution, as it supports compatible performance compared to desktop GPU raytracers. To the best of our knowledge, the SGRT is the first mobile GPU based on full Whitted raytracing.","author":["Won-Jong Lee","Shi-Hwa Lee","Jae-Ho Nah","Jin-Woo Kim","Youngsam Shin","Jaedon Lee","Seok-Yoon Jung"],"issue":["SIGGRAPH '12: ACM SIGGRAPH 2012 Talks","August 2012","Article No.: 2","Pages   1","https://doi.org/10.1145/2343045.2343048"],"date":"05 August 2012","ref":[{"text":"Nah, J.-H., et al. 2011.

Unfortunately, while many other general purpose applications do exhibit the required streaming behavior, they also possess unfavorable data layout and poor computation-to-communication ratios that penalize any straight-forward execution on the GPU. In this paper we describe an efficient and scalable code generation framework that can map general purpose streaming applications onto a multi-GPU system. This framework spans the entire core and memory hierarchy exposed by the multi-GPU system. Several key features in our framework ensure the scalability required by complex streaming applications. First, we propose an efficient stream graph partitioning algorithm that partitions the complex application to achieve the best performance under a given shared memory constraint. Next, the resulting partitions are mapped to multiple GPUs using an efficient architecture-driven strategy. The mapping balances the workload while considering the communication overhead.

These functions differ vastly in their requirements for hardware resources (e.g., CPU cycles and memory bandwidth). Thus, depending on the functions they go through, different flows can consume different amounts of a middlebox's resources. While there is much literature on weighted fair sharing of link bandwidth to isolate flows, it is unclear how to schedule multiple resources in a middlebox to achieve similar guarantees. In this paper, we analyze several natural packet scheduling algorithms for multiple resources and show that they have undesirable properties. We propose a new algorithm, Dominant Resource Fair Queuing (DRFQ), that retains the attractive properties that fair sharing provides for one resource. In doing so, we generalize the concept of virtual time in classical fair queuing to multi-resource settings. The resulting algorithm is also applicable in other contexts where several resources need to be multiplexed in the time domain.","author":["Ali Ghodsi","Vyas Sekar","Matei Zaharia","Ion Stoica"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 42","Issue 4","October 2012","pp   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2377677.2377679"],"date":"13 August 2012","ref":[{"text":"Crossbeam network consolidation. http: //www.crossbeam.com/why-crossbeam/consolidation/, June 2012.","order":1},{"text":"F5 Networks products. http://www.f5.com/products/big-ip/, June 2012.","order":2},{"text":"Intel perf. counter mon. http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-performance-counter-monitor/, June 2012.","order":3},{"text":"M57 network traffic traces. https://domex.nps.edu/corp/scenarios/2009-m57/net/, Feb. 2012.","order":4},{"text":"Palo alto networks. http://www.paloaltonetworks.com/, June 2012.","order":5},{"text":"Vyatta Software Middlebox. http://www.vyatta.com, June 2012.","order":6},{"text":"D.

The goal is to derive clinically meaningful distance metric to measure the similarity between patients represented by their key clinical indicators. How to incorporate physician feedback with regard to the retrieval results? How to interactively update the underlying similarity measure based on the feedback? Moreover, often different physicians have different understandings of patient similarity based on their patient cohorts. The distance metric learned for each individual physician often leads to a limited view of the true underlying distance metric. How to integrate the individual distance metrics from each physician into a globally consistent unif ed metric?We describe a suite of supervised metric learning approaches that answer the above questions. In particular, we present Locally Supervised Metric Learning (LSML) to learn a generalized Mahalanobis distance that is tailored toward physician feedback. Then we describe the interactive metric learning (iMet) method that can incrementally update an existing metric based on physician feedback in an online fashion. To combine multiple similarity measures from multiple physicians, we present Composite Distance Integration (Comdi) method. In this approach we f rst construct discriminative neighborhoods from each individual metrics, then combine them into a single optimal distance metric. Finally, we present a clinical decision support prototype system powered by the proposed patient similarity methods, and evaluate the proposed methods using real EHR data against several baselines.","author":["Jimeng Sun","Fei Wang","Jianying Hu","Shahram Edabollahi"],"issue":["ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter","Volume 14","Issue 1","June 2012","pp   16\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/2408736.2408740"],"date":"10 December 2012","ref":[{"text":"C.

Approximate program transformations (for example, task skipping and loop perforation) exploit this freedom to produce computations that can execute at a variety of points in an underlying accuracy versus performance trade-off space. One potential concern is that these transformations may change the semantics of the program and therefore cause the program to crash, perform an illegal operation, or otherwise violate its integrity. We investigate how verifying integrity properties -- key correctness properties that the transformed computation must respect -- can enable the safe application of approximate program transformations.

This paper formally demonstrates an optimal way to reduce energy via voltage over-scaling at the cost of errors due to timing starvation in addition. We identify a fundamental trade-off between error frequency and error magnitude in a timing-starved adder. We introduce a formal model to prove that for signal processing applications using a quadratic signal-to-noise ratio error measure, reducing bit-wise error frequency is sub-optimal. Instead, energy-optimal approximate addition requires limiting maximum error magnitude. Intriguingly, due to possible error patterns, this is achieved by reducing carry chains significantly below what is allowed by the timing budget for a large fraction of sum bits, using an aligned, fixed internal-carry structure for higher significance bits. We further demonstrate that remaining approximation error is reduced by realization of conditional bounding (CB) logic for lower significance bits. A key contribution is the formalization of an approximate CB logic synthesis problem that produces a rich space of Pareto-optimal adders with a range of quality-energy tradeoffs. We show how CB logic can be customized to result in over-and under-estimating approximate adders, and how a dithering adder that mixes them produces zero-centered error distributions, and, in accumulation, a reduced-variance error. We demonstrate synthesized approximate adders with energy up to 60% smaller than that of a conventional timing-starved adder, where a 30% reduction is due to the superior synthesis of inexact CB logic. When used in a larger system implementing an image-processing algorithm, energy savings of 40% are possible.","author":["Jin Miao","Ku He","Andreas Gerstlauer","Michael Orshansky"],"issue":["ICCAD '12: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2012","Pages   728\u2013735","https://doi.org/10.1145/2429384.2429542"],"date":"05 November 2012","ref":[{"text":"V.

This is evident from the numerous research results published recently in major journals and conferences in the area of handwriting recognition. Features and classifications techniques utilized in recent research work have diversified noticeably compared to the past. Moreover, more efforts have been diverted, in last few years, to construct different databases for Arabic handwriting recognition. This article provides a comprehensive survey of recent developments in Arabic handwriting recognition. The article starts with a summary of the characteristics of Arabic text, followed by a general model for an Arabic text recognition system. Then the used databases for Arabic text recognition are discussed. Research works on preprocessing phase, like text representation, baseline detection, line, word, character, and subcharacter segmentation algorithms, are presented. Different feature extraction techniques used in Arabic handwriting recognition are identified and discussed. Different classification approaches, like HMM, ANN, SVM, k-NN, syntactical methods, etc., are discussed in the context of Arabic handwriting recognition. Works on Arabic lexicon construction and spell checking are presented in the postprocessing phase. Several summary tables of published research work are provided for used Arabic text databases and reported results on Arabic character, word, numerals, and text recognition. These tables summarize the features, classifiers, data, and reported recognition accuracy for each technique. Finally, we discuss some future research directions in Arabic handwriting recognition.","author":["Mohammad Tanvir Parvez","Sabri A.

As a result, widely used open-source cluster resource managers (e.g. SLURM and TORQUE) have recently been extended with GPU support capabilities. These systems, however, provide simple scheduling mechanisms that often result in resource underutilization and, thereby, in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a runtime system that can be integrated with existing cluster resource managers to enable a more efficient use of heterogeneous clusters with GPUs. Differently from previous work, we focus on multi-process GPU applications including synchronization (for example, hybrid MPI-CUDA applications). We discuss the limitations and inefficiencies of existing scheduling and resource sharing schemes in the presence of synchronization. We show that preemption is an effective mechanism to allow efficient scheduling of hybrid MPI-CUDA applications. We validate our runtime on a variety of benchmark programs with different computation and communication patterns.","author":["Kittisak Sajjapongse","Xiang Wang","Michela Becchi"],"issue":["HPDC '13: Proceedings of the 22nd international symposium on High-performance parallel and distributed computing","June 2013","Pages   179\u2013190","https://doi.org/10.1145/2462902.2462911"],"date":"17 June 2013","ref":[{"text":"M.

Memristor technology revitalized neuromorphic computing system design by efficiently executing the analog Matrix-Vector multiplication on the memristor-based crossbar (MBC) structure. However, programming the MBC to the target state can be very challenging due to the difficulty to real-time monitor the memristor state during the training. In this work, we quantitatively analyzed the sensitivity of the MBC programming to the process variations and input signal noise. We then proposed a noise-eliminating training method on top of a new crossbar structure to minimize the noise accumulation during the MBC training and improve the trained system performance, i.e., the pattern recall rate. A digital-assisted initialization step for MBC training is also introduced to reduce the training failure rate as well as the training time. Experimental results show that our noise-eliminating training method can improve the pattern recall rate. For the tested patterns with 128 x 128 pixels our technique can reduce the MBC training time by 12.6% ~ 14.1% for the same pattern recognition rate, or improve the pattern recall rate by 18.7% ~ 36.2% for the same training time.","author":["Beiye Liu","Miao Hu","Hai Li","Zhi-Hong Mao","Yiran Chen","Tingwen Huang","Wei Zhang"],"issue":["DAC '13: Proceedings of the 50th Annual Design Automation Conference","May 2013","Article No.: 7","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2463209.2488741"],"date":"29 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"H.

STT-MRAM features fast read and write times, small cell sizes of 6F2 and potentially even smaller, and compatibility with existing DRAM and SRAM architecture with relatively small associated cost added. STT-MRAM is essentially a magnetic multilayer resistive element cell that is fabricated as an additional metal layer on top of conventional CMOS access transistors. In this review we give an overview of the existing STT-MRAM technologies currently in research and development across the world, as well as some specific discussion of results obtained at Grandis and with our foundry partners. We will show that in-plane STT-MRAM technology, particularly the DMTJ design, is a mature technology that meets all conventional requirements for an STT-MRAM cell to be a nonvolatile solution matching DRAM and/or SRAM drive circuitry. Exciting recent developments in perpendicular STT-MRAM also indicate that this type of STT-MRAM technology may reach maturity faster than expected, allowing even smaller cell size and product introduction at smaller nodes.","author":["Dmytro Apalkov","Alexey Khvalkovskiy","Steven Watts","Vladimir Nikitin","Xueti Tang","Daniel Lottis","Kiseok Moon","Xiao Luo","Eugene Chen","Adrian Ong","Alexander Driskill-Smith","Mohamad Krounbi"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 9","Issue 2","May 2013","Article No.: 13","pp   1\u201335","https://doi.org/10.1145/2463585.2463589"],"date":"29 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"Abraham, D., Trouilloud, P., and Worledge, D. 2006.

Beyond energy, the growing number of faults steers accelerator research towards fault-tolerant accelerators. In this article, we investigate a fault-tolerant and energy-efficient accelerator for signal processing applications. We depart from traditional designs by introducing an accelerator which relies on unary coding, a concept which is well adapted to the continuous real-world inputs of signal processing applications. Unary coding enables a number of atypical micro-architecture choices which bring down area cost and energy; moreover, unary coding provides graceful output degradation as the amount of transient faults increases. We introduce a configurable hybrid digital/analog micro-architecture capable of implementing a broad set of signal processing applications based on these concepts, together with a back-end optimizer which takes advantage of the special nature of these applications. For a set of five signal applications, we explore the different design tradeoffs and obtain an accelerator with an area cost of 1.63mm2. On average, this accelerator requires only 2.3% of the energy of an Atom-like core to implement similar tasks. We then evaluate the accelerator resilience to transient faults, and its ability to trade accuracy for energy savings.","author":["Bilel Belhadj","Antoine Joubert","Zheng Li","Rodolphe H\u00e9liot","Olivier Temam"],"issue":["ISCA '13: Proceedings of the 40th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2013","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2485922.2485923"],"date":"23 June 2013","ref":[{"text":"\"TMS320C6000 CPU and instruction set reference guide,\" Texas Instruments, Tech.

In log-block-based FTLs, a few physical blocks called log blocks are used to hold all page updates from a large amount of data blocks. Frequent page updates in log blocks introduce big overhead so log blocks become the system bottleneck.To address this problem, this paper presents a block-level log-block management scheme called BLog (Block-level Log-Block Management). In BLog, with the block level management, the update pages of a data block can be collected together and put into the same log block as much as possible; therefore, we can effectively reduce the associativities of log blocks so as to reduce the garbage collection overhead. We also propose a novel partial merge operation called reduced-order merge by which we can effectively postpone the garbage collection of log blocks so as to maximally utilize valid pages and reduce unnecessary erase operations in log blocks. Based on BLog, we design an FTL called BLogFTL for MLC NAND flash. We conduct experiments on a mixture of real-world and synthetic traces. The experimental results show that our scheme outperforms the previous log-block-based FTLs for MLC NAND flash.","author":["Yong Guan","Guohui Wang","Yi Wang","Renhai Chen","Zili Shao"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 48","Issue 5","May 2013","pp   111\u2013120","https://doi.org/10.1145/2499369.2465560"],"date":"20 June 2013","ref":[{"text":"OLTP trace from umass trace repository. http://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Storage/Storage}.","order":1},{"text":"Samsung Electronics.

One common practice employed by developers without an advanced background in numerical analysis is using the highest available precision. While more robust, this can degrade program performance significantly. In this paper we present Precimonious, a dynamic program analysis tool to assist developers in tuning the precision of floating-point programs. Precimonious performs a search on the types of the floating-point program variables trying to lower their precision subject to accuracy constraints and performance goals. Our tool recommends a type instantiation that uses lower precision while producing an accurate enough answer without causing exceptions. We evaluate Precimonious on several widely used functions from the GNU Scientific Library, two NAS Parallel Benchmarks, and three other numerical programs. For most of the programs analyzed, Precimonious reduces precision, which results in performance improvements as high as 41%.","author":["Cindy Rubio-Gonz\u00e1lez","Cuong Nguyen","Hong Diep Nguyen","James Demmel","William Kahan","Koushik Sen","David H.

Consequently, Bitcoin has the unintuitive property that while the ownership of money is implicitly anonymous, its flow is globally visible. In this paper we explore this unique characteristic further, using heuristic clustering to group Bitcoin wallets based on evidence of shared authority, and then using re-identification attacks (i.e., empirical purchasing of goods and services) to classify the operators of those clusters. From this analysis, we characterize longitudinal changes in the Bitcoin market, the stresses these changes are placing on the system, and the challenges for those seeking to use Bitcoin for criminal or fraudulent purposes at scale.","author":["Sarah Meiklejohn","Marjori Pomarole","Grant Jordan","Kirill Levchenko","Damon McCoy","Geoffrey M.

However, most probabilistic first-order logics are not efficient enough for realistically-sized instances of these tasks. One key problem is that queries are typically answered by \"grounding\" the query---i.e., mapping it to a propositional representation, and then performing propositional inference---and with a large database of facts, groundings can be very large, making inference and learning computationally expensive. Here we present a first-order probabilistic language which is well-suited to approximate \"local\" grounding: in particular, every query $Q$ can be approximately grounded with a small graph. The language is an extension of stochastic logic programs where inference is performed by a variant of personalized PageRank. Experimentally, we show that the approach performs well on an entity resolution task, a classification task, and a joint inference task; that the cost of inference is independent of database size; and that speedup in learning is possible by multi-threading.","author":["William Yang Wang","Kathryn Mazaitis","William W.

However, emerging fast, byte-addressable, non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies (e.g., phase-change memories, spin-transfer torque MRAMs, and the memristor) present very different performance characteristics, so blithely applying existing algorithms can lead to disappointing performance. This paper presents a novel storage primitive, called editable atomic writes (EAW), that enables sophisticated, highly-optimized WAL schemes in fast NVM-based storage systems. EAWs allow applications to safely access and modify log contents rather than treating the log as an append-only, write-only data structure, and we demonstrate that this can make implementating complex transactions simpler and more efficient. We use EAWs to build MARS, a WAL scheme that provides the same as features ARIES [26] (a widely-used WAL system for databases) but avoids making disk-centric implementation decisions. We have implemented EAWs and MARS in a next-generation SSD to demonstrate that the overhead of EAWs is minimal compared to normal writes, and that they provide large speedups for transactional updates to hash tables, B+trees, and large graphs. In addition, MARS outperforms ARIES by up to 3.7 x while reducing software complexity.","author":["Joel Coburn","Trevor Bunker","Meir Schwarz","Rajesh Gupta","Steven Swanson"],"issue":["SOSP '13: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","November 2013","Pages   197\u2013212","https://doi.org/10.1145/2517349.2522724"],"date":"03 November 2013","ref":[{"text":"R.

It offers the high throughput of batch processors, the low latency of stream processors, and the ability to perform iterative and incremental computations. Although existing systems offer some of these features, applications that require all three have relied on multiple platforms, at the expense of efficiency, maintainability, and simplicity. Naiad resolves the complexities of combining these features in one framework. A new computational model, timely dataflow, underlies Naiad and captures opportunities for parallelism across a wide class of algorithms. This model enriches dataflow computation with timestamps that represent logical points in the computation and provide the basis for an efficient, lightweight coordination mechanism. We show that many powerful high-level programming models can be built on Naiad's low-level primitives, enabling such diverse tasks as streaming data analysis, iterative machine learning, and interactive graph mining. Naiad outperforms specialized systems in their target application domains, and its unique features enable the development of new high-performance applications.","author":["Derek G.

However, conventional frameworks for distributed graph processing, such as Pregel, use non-traditional programming models that are well-suited for parallelism and scalability but inconvenient for implementing non-trivial graph algorithms. In this paper, we use Green-Marl, a Domain-Specific Language for graph analysis, to intuitively describe graph algorithms and extend its compiler to generate equivalent Pregel implementations. Using the semantic information captured by Green-Marl, the compiler applies a set of transformation rules that convert imperative graph algorithms into Pregel's programming model. Our experiments show that the Pregel programs generated by the Green-Marl compiler perform similarly to manually coded Pregel implementations of the same algorithms. The compiler is even able to generate a Pregel implementation of a complicated graph algorithm for which a manual Pregel implementation is very challenging.","author":["Sungpack Hong","Semih Salihoglu","Jennifer Widom","Kunle Olukotun"],"issue":["CGO '14: Proceedings of Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization","February 2014","Pages   208\u2013218","https://doi.org/10.1145/2544137.2544162"],"date":"15 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"http://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki.","order":1},{"text":"Apache Giraph Project. http://giraph.apache.org.","order":2},{"text":"The laboratory for web algorithmics. http://law.dsi.unimi.it/datasets.php.","order":3},{"text":"D.

It comprises ION cells with unique properties which facilitate sensory processing and motor-learning skills. Various simulation models of ION-cell networks have been written in an attempt to unravel their mysteries. However, simulations become rapidly intractable when biophysically plausible models and meaningful network sizes (>=100 cells) are modeled. To overcome this problem, in this work we port a highly detailed ION cell network model, originally coded in Matlab, onto an FPGA chip. It was first converted to ANSI C code and extensively profiled. It was, then, translated to HLS C code for the Xilinx Vivado toolflow and various algorithmic and arithmetic optimizations were applied. The design was implemented in a Virtex 7 (XC7VX485T) device and can simulate a 96-cell network at real-time speed, yielding a speedup of x700 compared to the original Matlab code and x12.5 compared to the reference C implementation running on a Intel Xeon 2.66GHz machine with 20GB RAM. For a 1,056-cell network (non-real-time), an FPGA speedup of x45 against the C code can be achieved, demonstrating the design's usefulness in accelerating neuroscience research. Limited by the available on-chip memory, the FPGA can maximally support a 14,400-cell network (non-real-time) with online parameter configurability for cell state and network size. The maximum throughput of the FPGA ION-network accelerator can reach 2.13 GFLOPS.","author":["Georgios Smaragdos","Sebastian Isaza","Martijn F. van Eijk","Ioannis Sourdis","Christos Strydis"],"issue":["FPGA '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM/SIGDA international symposium on Field-programmable gate arrays","February 2014","Pages   89\u201398","https://doi.org/10.1145/2554688.2554790"],"date":"26 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"P.

Combining automatic and crowdsourced techniques, we detect users trying to quit smoking and analyze tweet and network data from a sample of 653 individuals over a two-year window of quitting. Guided by theory and practice, we derive behavioral, social, and emotional measures to compare users who abstain and relapse. We also examine the cessation process, demonstrating that Twitter can help chronicle how some people go about quitting. Among other results, we show that those who fail in their smoking cessation are far heavier posters and use relatively less positive language, while those who succeed are more social in both network ties and in directed communication. We conclude with insights on how intelligent intervention systems can harness these signals to provide tailored behavior change support.","author":["Elizabeth L.

This study examined how presumed robot communication style in such situations of human-robot co-location affects human perceptions of a group of robots. Results suggest that communication style of robots did not affect perceptions of robots, but further studies should use different techniques to manipulate supposed communication style.","author":["Marlena R.

Our goal is to compute a subspace that captures the covariance of A as much as possible, classically known as principal component analysis (PCA). We assume that each row of A has \u21132 norm bounded by one, and the privacy guarantee is defined with respect to addition or removal of any single row. We show that the well-known, but misnamed, randomized response algorithm, with properly tuned parameters, provides nearly optimal additive quality gap compared to the best possible singular subspace of A. We further show that when ATA has a large eigenvalue gap -- a reason often cited for PCA -- the quality improves significantly. Optimality (up to logarithmic factors) is proved using techniques inspired by the recent work of Bun, Ullman, and Vadhan on applying Tardos's fingerprinting codes to the construction of hard instances for private mechanisms for 1-way marginal queries. Along the way we define a list culling game which may be of independent interest. By combining the randomized response mechanism with the well-known following the perturbed leader algorithm of Kalai and Vempala we obtain a private online algorithm with nearly optimal regret. The regret of our algorithm even outperforms all the previously known online non-private algorithms of this type.

This improves the classical O(n3)-time algorithms by Horn [1973] and Bruno et al. [1974b].For the unweighted case, the bound can be improved even further. We give a simple divide-and-conquer algorithm that runs in O(\u221anmlog n) time, improving two previous O(nm)-time algorithms by Abraham [2003] and Harvey et al. [2003, 2006]. We also extend this algorithm to solve the Balanced Edge Cover problem in O(\u221anmlog n) time, improving the previous O(nm)-time algorithm by Harada et al. [2008].","author":["Jittat Fakcharoenphol","Bundit Laekhanukit","Danupon Nanongkai"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Algorithms","Volume 10","Issue 3","June 2014","Article No.: 14","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/2601071"],"date":"01 May 2014","ref":[{"text":"David Abraham. 2003.

However, autotuners themselves are rarely portable between projects, for a number of reasons: using a domain-informed search space representation is critical to achieving good results; search spaces can be intractably large and require advanced machine learning techniques; and the landscape of search spaces can vary greatly between different problems, sometimes requiring domain specific search techniques to explore efficiently. This paper introduces OpenTuner, a new open source framework for building domain-specific multi-objective program autotuners. OpenTuner supports fully-customizable configuration representations, an extensible technique representation to allow for domain-specific techniques, and an easy to use interface for communicating with the program to be autotuned. A key capability inside OpenTuner is the use of ensembles of disparate search techniques simultaneously; techniques that perform well will dynamically be allocated a larger proportion of tests. We demonstrate the efficacy and generality of OpenTuner by building autotuners for 7 distinct projects and 16 total benchmarks, showing speedups over prior techniques of these projects of up to 2.8x with little programmer effort.","author":["Jason Ansel","Shoaib Kamil","Kalyan Veeramachaneni","Jonathan Ragan-Kelley","Jeffrey Bosboom","Una-May O'Reilly","Saman Amarasinghe"],"issue":["PACT '14: Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on Parallel architectures and compilation","August 2014","Pages   303\u2013316","https://doi.org/10.1145/2628071.2628092"],"date":"24 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"F.

These laws define a distribution-free convergence property of means to expectations uniformly over classes of random variables. Classes of real-valued functions enjoying such a property are also known as uniform Glivenko-Cantelli classes. In this paper, we prove, through a generalization of Sauer's lemma that may be interesting in its own right, a new characterization of uniform Glivenko-Cantelli classes. Our characterization yields Dudley, Gine\u00b4, and Zinn's previous characterization as a corollary. Furthermore, it is the first based on a Gine\u00b4, and Zinn's previous characterization as a corollary. Furthermore, it is the first based on a simple combinatorial quantity generalizing the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension. We apply this result to obtain the weakest combinatorial condition known to imply PAC learnability in the statistical regression (or \u201cagnostic\u201d) framework. Furthermore, we find a characterization of learnability in the probabilistic concept model, solving an open problem posed by Kearns and Schapire. These results show that the accuracy parameter plays a crucial role in determining the effective complexity of the learner's hypothesis class.","author":["Noga Alon","Shai Ben-David","Nicol\u00f2 Cesa-Bianchi","David Haussler"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 44","Issue 4","July 1997","pp   615\u2013631","https://doi.org/10.1145/263867.263927"],"date":"01 July 1997","ref":[{"text":"ALON, N., AND MILMAN, V. 1983.

However, building commodity MRAM by reusing DRAM designs is not straightforward. The existing memory interfaces are incompatible with MRAM small page size, and they fail to leverage MRAM unique properties, causing unnecessary performance and energy overhead. In this article, we propose four techniques to enable and optimize an LPDDRx-compatible MRAM solution: ComboAS to solve the pin incompatibility; DynLat to avoid unnecessary access latencies; and EarlyPA and BufW to further improve performance by exploiting the MRAM unique features of non-destructive read and independent write path. Combining all these techniques together, we boost the MRAM performance by 17% and provide a DRAM-compatible MRAM solution consuming 21% less energy.","author":["Jue Wang","Xiangyu Dong","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 11","Issue 4","January 2015","Article No.: 36","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/2667105"],"date":"08 December 2014","ref":[{"text":"J.

This work addresses the problem of automated memory partitioning for such architectures, taking into account potentially parallel data accesses to physically independent banks. Targeted at affine static control parts (SCoPs), the technique relies on the Z-polyhedral model for program analysis and adopts a partitioning scheme based on integer lattices. The approach enables the definition of a solution space including previous works as particular cases. The problem of minimizing the total amount of memory required across the partitioned banks, referred to as storage minimization throughout the article, is tackled by an optimal approach yielding asymptotically zero memory waste or, as an alternative, an efficient approach ensuring arbitrarily small waste. The article also presents a prototype toolchain and a detailed step-by-step case study demonstrating the impact of the proposed technique along with extensive comparisons with alternative approaches in the literature.","author":["Alessandro Cilardo","Luca Gallo"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 11","Issue 4","January 2015","Article No.: 45","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2675359"],"date":"09 January 2015","ref":[{"text":"Christophe Alias, Alain Darte, and Alexandru Plesco. 2013.

One recently prominent example is cache probing attacks, which rely on timing channels created by caches. We introduce a hardware design language, SecVerilog, which makes it possible to statically analyze information flow at the hardware level. With SecVerilog, systems can be built with verifiable control of timing channels and other information channels. SecVerilog is Verilog, extended with expressive type annotations that enable precise reasoning about information flow. It also comes with rigorous formal assurance: we prove that SecVerilog enforces timing-sensitive noninterference and thus ensures secure information flow. By building a secure MIPS processor and its caches, we demonstrate that SecVerilog makes it possible to build complex hardware designs with verified security, yet with low overhead in time, space, and HW designer effort.","author":["Danfeng Zhang","Yao Wang","G.

Creating metadata is challenging not only because one must recognize the artifact; the description must then be encoded into natural language. Language behaviors are influenced by many social factors, particularly when we are asked to describe other people. We consider labels for images of people generated via the ESP Game. While ESP has been shown to produce relevant labels, critics claim they are obvious and stereotypical. Based on theories of linguistic biases, we examine whether there are systematic differences in the ways players describe images of men versus women. Our first analysis considers images of people generally, and reveals a tendency for women to be described with subjective adjectives. A second analysis compares images depicting men and women within each of six occupational roles. Images of women receive more labels related to appearance, whereas those depicting men receive more occupation-related labels. Our work exposes the presence of gender-based stereotypes through linguistic biases, illustrates the forms in which they manifest, and raises important implications for those who design systems or train algorithms using data produced via GWAP.","author":["Jahna Otterbacher"],"issue":["CHI '15: Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","April 2015","Pages   1955\u20131964","https://doi.org/10.1145/2702123.2702151"],"date":"18 April 2015","ref":[{"text":"Baker, P. and Potts, A. \"Why do white people have thin lips?\" Google and the perpetuation of stereotypes via auto-complete search forms.

In this paper, we present the results of studies in which we characterize the gender bias present in image search results for a variety of occupations. We experimentally evaluate the effects of bias in image search results on the images people choose to represent those careers and on people's perceptions of the prevalence of men and women in each occupation. We find evidence for both stereotype exaggeration and systematic underrepresentation of women in search results. We also find that people rate search results higher when they are consistent with stereotypes for a career, and shifting the representation of gender in image search results can shift people's perceptions about real-world distributions. We also discuss tensions between desires for high-quality results and broader societal goals for equality of representation in this space.","author":["Matthew Kay","Cynthia Matuszek","Sean A.

Sample preprocessing, which includes dilution and mixing of reagents, plays an important role in the preparation of assays. The automation of sample preparation on a digital microfluidic platform often mandates the execution of a mixing algorithm, which determines a sequence of droplet mix-split steps (usually represented as a mixing graph). However, the overall cost and performance of on-chip mixture preparation not only depends on the mixing graph but also on the resource allocation and scheduling strategy, for instance, the placement of boundary reservoirs or dispensers, mixer modules, storage units, and physical design of droplet-routing pathways. In this article, we first present a new mixing algorithm based on a number-partitioning technique that determines a layout-aware mixing tree corresponding to a given target ratio of a number of fluids. The mixing graph produced by the proposed method can be implemented on a chip with a fewer number of crossovers among droplet-routing paths as well as with a reduced reservoir-to-mixer transportation distance. Second, we propose a routing-aware resource-allocation scheme that can be used to improve the performance of a given mixing algorithm on a chip layout. The design methodology is evaluated on various test cases to demonstrate its effectiveness in mixture preparation with the help of two representative mixing algorithms. Simulation results show that on average, the proposed scheme can reduce the number of crossovers among droplet-routing paths by 89.7% when used in conjunction with the new mixing algorithm, and by 75.4% when an earlier algorithm [Thies et al. 2008] is used.","author":["Sudip Roy","Partha P.

However, their level of adoption and utilization in commercial environments depends on the level of content accounting and accountability they offer. Content accounting refers to any information that a content distributor needs to track relating to the delivery of content to its intended consumers. In contrast, content accountability refers to the willingness of the communicating infrastructure to produce accurate and verifiable information about the content distribution process. This article surveys existing and proposed future content delivery architectures detailing their methodologies for providing efficient low-cost content distribution, content accounting, and accountability across trustworthy and untrustworthy infrastructures. We use two methods to help identify the drawbacks and merits of these architectures. The first is a taxonomy for accounting information based on our analysis of logging information gathered from the surveyed systems. The second is a generic model for content distribution based on a synthesis of desirable elements from the surveyed architectures. These methods help highlight key architectural elements required for efficient low-cost content distribution. Finally, we identify outstanding challenges related to establishing accountability in accounting information produced for content distributed across trusted and untrusted infrastructures.","author":["Diarmuid \u00d3 Coile\u00e1in","Donal O'mahony"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 47","Issue 4","July 2015","Article No.: 59","pp   1\u201335","https://doi.org/10.1145/2723701"],"date":"11 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"Brian Adamson, Carsten Bormann, Mark Handley, and Joe Macker. 2009.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning framework for video classification, which is able to model static spatial information, short-term motion, as well as long-term temporal clues in the videos. Specifically, the spatial and the short-term motion features are extracted separately by two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). These two types of CNN-based features are then combined in a regularized feature fusion network for classification, which is able to learn and utilize feature relationships for improved performance. In addition, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks are applied on top of the two features to further model longer-term temporal clues. The main contribution of this work is the hybrid learning framework that can model several important aspects of the video data. We also show that (1) combining the spatial and the short-term motion features in the regularized fusion network is better than direct classification and fusion using the CNN with a softmax layer, and (2) the sequence-based LSTM is highly complementary to the traditional classification strategy without considering the temporal frame orders. Extensive experiments are conducted on two popular and challenging benchmarks, the UCF-101 Human Actions and the Columbia Consumer Videos (CCV). On both benchmarks, our framework achieves very competitive performance: 91.3% on the UCF-101 and 83.5% on the CCV.","author":["Zuxuan Wu","Xi Wang","Yu-Gang Jiang","Hao Ye","Xiangyang Xue"],"issue":["MM '15: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2015","Pages   461\u2013470","https://doi.org/10.1145/2733373.2806222"],"date":"13 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"R.

At the core of MAS is a heterogeneous entity graph comprised of six types of entities that model the scholarly activities: field of study, author, institution, paper, venue, and event. In addition to obtaining these entities from the publisher feeds as in the previous effort, we in this version include data mining results from the Web index and an in-house knowledge base from Bing, a major commercial search engine. As a result of the Bing integration, the new MAS graph sees significant increase in size, with fresh information streaming in automatically following their discoveries by the search engine. In addition, the rich entity relations included in the knowledge base provide additional signals to disambiguate and enrich the entities within and beyond the academic domain. The number of papers indexed by MAS, for instance, has grown from low tens of millions to 83 million while maintaining an above 95% accuracy based on test data sets derived from academic activities at Microsoft Research. Based on the data set, we demonstrate two scenarios in this work: a knowledge driven, highly interactive dialog that seamlessly combines reactive search and proactive suggestion experience, and a proactive heterogeneous entity recommendation.","author":["Arnab Sinha","Zhihong Shen","Yang Song","Hao Ma","Darrin Eide","Bo-June (Paul) Hsu","Kuansan Wang"],"issue":["WWW '15 Companion: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web","May 2015","Pages   243\u2013246","https://doi.org/10.1145/2740908.2742839"],"date":"18 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"Google inclusion guidelines.

Existing graph-parallel systems usually use a \"one size fits all\" design that uniformly processes all vertices, which either suffer from notable load imbalance and high contention for high-degree vertices (e.g., Pregel and GraphLab), or incur high communication cost and memory consumption even for low-degree vertices (e.g., PowerGraph and GraphX). In this paper, we argue that skewed distribution in natural graphs also calls for differentiated processing on high-degree and low-degree vertices. We then introduce PowerLyra, a new graph computation engine that embraces the best of both worlds of existing graph-parallel systems, by dynamically applying different computation and partitioning strategies for different vertices. PowerLyra further provides an efficient hybrid graph partitioning algorithm (hybrid-cut) that combines edge-cut and vertex-cut with heuristics. Based on PowerLyra, we design locality-conscious data layout optimization to improve cache locality of graph accesses during communication. PowerLyra is implemented as a separate computation engine of PowerGraph, and can seamlessly support various graph algorithms. A detailed evaluation on two clusters using graph-analytics and MLDM (machine learning and data mining) applications show that PowerLyra outperforms PowerGraph by up to 5.53X (from 1.24X) and 3.26X (from 1.49X) for real-world and synthetic graphs accordingly, and is much faster than other systems like GraphX and Giraph, yet with much less memory consumption. A porting of hybrid-cut to GraphX further confirms the efficiency and generality of PowerLyra.","author":["Rong Chen","Jiaxin Shi","Yanzhe Chen","Haibo Chen"],"issue":["EuroSys '15: Proceedings of the Tenth European Conference on Computer Systems","April 2015","Article No.: 1","Pages   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/2741948.2741970"],"date":"17 April 2015","ref":[{"text":"The 9th dimacs implementation challenge - shortest paths. http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/challenge9/.","order":1},{"text":"The Apache Giraph Project. http://giraph.apache.org/.","order":2},{"text":"The Apache Hama Project. http://hama.apache.org/.","order":3},{"text":"Laboratory for web algorithmics. http://law.di.unimi.it/.","order":4},{"text":"Large-scale parallel collaborative filtering for the netflix prize.

To cope with this issue, Fine-Grained Refresh (FGR) is recently proposed to eliminate unnecessary refresh operations caused by minor weak cells. Even JEDEC's DDR4 DRAM specification announces the support of FGR to make DRAM refresh more scalable. Unfortunately, we observe that the effectiveness of FGR is greatly confined by the procedure of refresh-oblivious device integration because all memory devices within a module have to be controlled and refreshed in a lockstep way after the step of assembly. In this work, we firstly propose to intelligently integrate the \"compatible\" devices through a pre-assembly testing and retention-aware matching method. Second, we reuse the reconfiguration structure from yield-oriented remapping mechanism in memory chips and propose Microfix to create a balanced distribution of retention time in memory banks through fine-grained row-address tuning. With this optimization architecture, RADAR, we can eliminate the refresh overhead of produced memory modules by 28% on average.","author":["Ying Wang","Yinhe Han","Cheng Wang","Huawei Li","Xiaowei Li"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 19","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744897"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"A.

We examine the basic principles of redundant quantum encoding, required to protect quantum bits from errors generated from both imprecise control and environmental interactions. The novelty of this work consists in the presentation of fault-tolerance principles from a classical distributed computing perspective, as this enables a more straightforward introduction without sacrificing generality.

The possibility of hardware Trojans and/or design backdoors hiding in the IP cores has raised security concerns. As existing functional testing methods fall short in detecting unspecified (often malicious) logic, formal methods have emerged as an alternative for validation of trustworthiness of IP cores. Toward this direction, we discuss two main categories of formal methods used in hardware trust evaluation: theorem proving and equivalence checking. Specifically, proof-carrying hardware (PCH) and its applications are introduced in detail, in which we demonstrate the use of theorem proving methods for providing high-level protection of IP cores. We also outline the use of symbolic algebra in equivalence checking, to ensure that the hardware implementation is equivalent to its design specification, thus leaving little space for malicious logic insertion.","author":["Xiaolong Guo","Raj Gautam Dutta","Yier Jin","Farimah Farahmandi","Prabhat Mishra"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 145","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2747939"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"D.

Therefore, new technologies and computer architectures are under focused development to reduce the power consumption and interconnection delay. Magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) nanopillar with the advantages of non-volatility, fast switching speed, and high density promises new designs and architectures to significantly alleviate the power and delay issues. This paper presents new logic-in-memory designs of the basic logic gates based on MTJs, including INV, (N)AND, (N)OR and XOR. The MTJ sharing and timing demultiplexing techniques are used in the proposed non-volatile logic gates to greatly reduce the write power. The simulation results show that the write power of the proposed non-volatile logic gates is as low as 285fJ/bit. The basic logic gates can finish the read operation in less than 160ps with 4.35fJ read energy. Moreover, the proposed non-volatile logic gates may be reconfigured after fabrication, which makes the designs more flexible and robust.","author":["Kejie Huang","Rong Zhao","Yong Lian"],"issue":["NANOARCH '14: Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","July 2014","Pages   31\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/2770287.2770295"],"date":"08 July 2014","ref":[{"text":"J.

We show how to address these issues in practice while retaining soundness. We design and implement a new gradual type system, prototyped for expediency as a 'Safe' compilation mode for TypeScript. Our compiler achieves soundness by enforcing stricter static checks and embedding residual runtime checks in compiled code. It emits plain JavaScript that runs on stock virtual machines. Our main theorem is a simulation that ensures that the checks introduced by Safe TypeScript (1) catch any dynamic type error, and (2) do not alter the semantics of type-safe TypeScript code.Safe TypeScript is carefully designed to minimize the performance overhead of runtime checks. At its core, we rely on two new ideas: differential subtyping, a new form of coercive subtyping that computes the minimum amount of runtime type information that must be added to each object; and an erasure modality, which we use to safely and selectively erase type information. This allows us to scale our design to full-fledged TypeScript, including arrays, maps, classes, inheritance, overloading, and generic types.We validate the usability and performance of Safe TypeScript empirically by type-checking and compiling around 120,000 lines of existing TypeScript source code. Although runtime checks can be expensive, the end-to-end overhead is small for code bases that already have type annotations. For instance, we bootstrap the Safe TypeScript compiler (90,000 lines including the base TypeScript compiler): we measure a 15% runtime overhead for type safety, and also uncover programming errors as type safety violations. We conclude that, at least during development and testing, subjecting JavaScript/TypeScript programs to safe gradual typing adds significant value to source type annotations at a modest cost.","author":["Aseem Rastogi","Nikhil Swamy","C\u00e9dric Fournet","Gavin Bierman","Panagiotis Vekris"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 50","Issue 1","January 2015","pp   167\u2013180","https://doi.org/10.1145/2775051.2676971"],"date":"14 January 2015","ref":[{"text":"M.

To support separate compilation and to enable linking of results from different verified compilers, it is important to develop a compositional notion of compiler correctness that is modular (preserved under linking), transitive (supports multi-pass compilation), and flexible (applicable to compilers that use different intermediate languages or employ non-standard program transformations). In this paper, building on prior work of Hur et al., we develop a novel approach to compositional compiler verification based on parametric inter-language simulations (PILS). PILS are modular: they enable compiler verification in a manner that supports separate compilation. PILS are transitive: we use them to verify Pilsner, a simple (but non-trivial) multi-pass optimizing compiler (programmed in Coq) from an ML-like source language S to an assembly-like target language T, going through a CPS-based intermediate language. Pilsner is the first multi-pass compiler for a higher-order imperative language to be compositionally verified. Lastly, PILS are flexible: we use them to additionally verify (1) Zwickel, a direct non-optimizing compiler for S, and (2) a hand-coded self-modifying T module, proven correct w.r.t. an S-level specification. The output of Zwickel and the self-modifying T module can then be safely linked together with the output of Pilsner. All together, this has been a significant undertaking, involving several person-years of work and over 55,000 lines of Coq.","author":["Georg Neis","Chung-Kil Hur","Jan-Oliver Kaiser","Craig McLaughlin","Derek Dreyer","Viktor Vafeiadis"],"issue":["ICFP 2015: Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming","August 2015","Pages   166\u2013178","https://doi.org/10.1145/2784731.2784764"],"date":"29 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"Appendix and Coq development. http://plv.mpi-sws.org/pils.","order":1},{"text":"A.

Prior research mostly focuses on the construction of knowledge bases, while how to use them in information retrieval is still an open problem. This paper presents a simple and effective method of using one such knowledge base, Freebase, to improve query expansion, a classic and widely studied information retrieval task. It investigates two methods of identifying the entities associated with a query, and two methods of using those entities to perform query expansion. A supervised model combines information derived from Freebase descriptions and categories to select terms that are effective for query expansion. Experiments on the ClueWeb09 dataset with TREC Web Track queries demonstrate that these methods are almost 30% more effective than strong, state-of-the-art query expansion algorithms. In addition to improving average performance, some of these methods have better win/loss ratios than baseline algorithms, with 50% fewer queries damaged.","author":["Chenyan Xiong","Jamie Callan"],"issue":["ICTIR '15: Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on The Theory of Information Retrieval","September 2015","Pages   111\u2013120","https://doi.org/10.1145/2808194.2809446"],"date":"27 September 2015","ref":[{"text":"FACC1 Annotation on ClueWeb09. http://lemurproject.org/clueweb09/FACC1/.

To sustain its correct operation in spite of its ever-increasing use, Bitcoin implements a number of necessary optimizations and scalability measures. These measures limit the amount of information broadcast in the system to the minimum necessary. In this paper, we show that current scalability measures adopted by Bitcoin come at odds with the security of the system. More specifically, we show that an adversary can exploit these measures in order to effectively delay the propagation of transactions and blocks to specific nodes for a considerable amount of time---without causing a network partitioning in the system. Notice that this attack alters the information received by Bitcoin nodes, and modifies their views of the ledger state. Namely, we show that this allows the adversary to considerably increase its mining advantage in the network, and to double-spend transactions in spite of the current countermeasures adopted by Bitcoin. Based on our results, we propose a number of countermeasures in order to enhance the security of Bitcoin without deteriorating its scalability.","author":["Arthur Gervais","Hubert Ritzdorf","Ghassan O.

It co-evolves with both human belief and behavior. When studying culture, Cultural Mapping is a crucial tool to visualize different aspects of culture (e.g., religions and languages) from the perspectives of indigenous and local people. Existing cultural mapping approaches usually rely on large-scale survey data with respect to human beliefs, such as moral values. However, such a data collection method not only incurs a significant cost of both human resources and time, but also fails to capture human behavior, which massively reflects cultural information. In addition, it is practically difficult to collect large-scale human behavior data. Fortunately, with the recent boom in Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), a considerable number of users report their activities in LBSNs in a participatory manner, which provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to study large-scale user behavioral data. In this article, we propose a participatory cultural mapping approach based on collective behavior in LBSNs. First, we collect the participatory sensed user behavioral data from LBSNs. Second, since only local users are eligible for cultural mapping, we propose a progressive \u201chome\u201d location identification method to filter out ineligible users. Third, by extracting three key cultural features from daily activity, mobility, and linguistic perspectives, respectively, we propose a cultural clustering method to discover cultural clusters. Finally, we visualize the cultural clusters on the world map. Based on a real-world LBSN dataset, we experimentally validate our approach by conducting both qualitative and quantitative analysis on the generated cultural maps. The results show that our approach can subtly capture cultural features and generate representative cultural maps that correspond well with traditional cultural maps based on survey data.","author":["Dingqi Yang","Daqing Zhang","Bingqing Qu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology","Volume 7","Issue 3","April 2016","Article No.: 30","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/2814575"],"date":"22 January 2016","ref":[{"text":"Yong-Yeol Ahn, Sebastian E.

The success of the software is largely dependent on how well the users' requirements have been understood and converted into appropriate functionalities in the software. Typically, the users convey their requirements in natural language statements that initially appear easy to state. However, being stated in natural language, the statement of requirements often tends to suffer from misinterpretations and imprecise inferences. As a result, the requirements specified thus, may lead to ambiguities in the software specifications. One can indeed find numerous approaches that deal with ensuring precise requirement specifications. Naturally, an obvious approach to deal with ambiguities in natural language software specifications is to eliminate ambiguities altogether i.e. to use formal specifications. However, the formal methods have been observed to be cost-effective largely for the development of mission-critical software. Due to the technical sophistication required, these are yet to be accepted in the mainstream. Hence, the other alternative is to let the ambiguities exist in the natural language requirements but deal with the same using proven techniques viz. using approaches based on machine learning, knowledge and ontology to resolve them. One can indeed find numerous automated and semi-automated tools to resolve specific types of natural language software requirement ambiguities. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no published literature that attempts to compare and contrast the prevalent approaches to deal with ambiguities in natural language software requirements. Hence, in this paper, we attempt to survey and analyze the prevalent approaches that attempt to resolve ambiguities in natural language software requirements. We focus on presenting a state-of-the-art survey of the currently available tools for ambiguity resolution. The objective of this paper is to disseminate, dissect and analyze the research work published in the area, identify metrics for a comparative evaluation and eventually do the same. At the end, we identify open research issues with an aim to spark new interests and developments in this field.","author":["Unnati S. Shah","Devesh C.

Although this integration has programmability and performance benefits, it may also have serious security and fault isolation implications, especially when accelerators are designed by third parties. Unchecked, accelerators could make incorrect memory accesses, causing information leaks, data corruption, or crashes not only for processes running on the accelerator, but for the rest of the system as well. Unfortunately, current security solutions are insufficient for providing memory protection from tightly integrated untrusted accelerators. We propose Border Control, a sandboxing mechanism which guarantees that the memory access permissions in the page table are respected by accelerators, regardless of design errors or malicious intent. Our hardware implementation of Border Control provides safety against improper memory accesses with a space overhead of only 0.006% of system physical memory per accelerator.

Even for networks of modest size, it is often difficult to evaluate all pairwise possibilities for links in a meaningful way. Furthermore, even though link prediction is closely related to missing value estimation problems, such as collaborative filtering, it is often difficult to use sophisticated models such as latent factor methods because of their computational complexity over very large networks. Due to this computational complexity, most known link prediction methods are designed for evaluating the link propensity over a specified subset of links, rather than for performing a global search over the entire networks. In practice, however, it is essential to perform an exhaustive search over the entire networks. In this paper, we propose an ensemble enabled approach to scaling up link prediction, which is able to decompose traditional link prediction problems into subproblems of smaller size. These subproblems are each solved with the use of latent factor models, which can be effectively implemented over networks of modest size. Furthermore, the ensemble enabled approach has several advantages in terms of performance. We show the advantage of using ensemble-based latent factor models with experiments on very large networks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.","author":["Liang Duan","Charu Aggarwal","Shuai Ma","Renjun Hu","Jinpeng Huai"],"issue":["WSDM '16: Proceedings of the Ninth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2016","Pages   367\u2013376","https://doi.org/10.1145/2835776.2835815"],"date":"08 February 2016","ref":[{"text":"L.

Often, the matrices involved have structure such as symmetric or triangular, which reduces the operations count needed to perform the computation. For example, dense linear systems of equations are solved by first converting to triangular form and optimization problems may yield matrices with any kind of structure. The well-known BLAS (basic linear algebra subroutine) interface provides a small set of structured matrix computations, chosen to serve a certain set of higher level functions (LAPACK). However, if a user encounters a computation or structure that is not supported, she loses the benefits of the structure and chooses a generic library. In this paper, we address this problem by providing a compiler that translates a given basic linear algebra computation on structured matrices into optimized C code, optionally vectorized with intrinsics. Our work combines prior work on the Spiral-like LGen compiler with techniques from polyhedral compilation to mathematically capture matrix structures. In the paper we consider upper/lower triangular and symmetric matrices but the approach is extensible to a much larger set including blocked structures. We run experiments on a modern Intel platform against the Intel MKL library and a baseline implementation showing competitive performance results for both BLAS and non-BLAS functionalities.","author":["Daniele G.

Recent research progress in Magnetic Tunneling Junction (MTJ) devices has developed Multi-Level Cell (MLC) STT-RAM to further enhance cell density. To avoid the write disturbance in MLC strategy, data stored in the soft bit must be restored back immediately after the hard bit switching is completed. However, frequent restores are not only unnecessary, but also introduce a significant energy consumption overhead. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Overwrite Scheme (AOS) which alleviates restoration overhead by intentionally overwriting selected soft bits based on RRD (Read Reuse Distance). Our experimental results show 54.6% reduction in soft bit restoration, delivering 10.8% decrease in overall energy consumption. Moreover, AOS promotes MLC to be a preferable L2 design alternative in terms of energy, area and latency product.","author":["Xunchao Chen","Navid Khoshavi","Jian Zhou","Dan Huang","Ronald F.

For instance, classic secure hardware does not allow to optimize common execution patterns, share resources, or provide deep introspection. We provide brief descriptions of three recently-exposed hardware vulnerabilities along with extensive references for background and to learn more about these areas. Specifically, we first discuss the Rowhammer problem in modern DRAM chips, which enables attackers to circumvent memory isolation, and other potential vulnerabilities due to aggressive memory technology scaling. We next describe hardware Trojans implemented below the gate level, which can resist most detection techniques, and other manufacturing vulnerabilities in security primitives. Finally, we explain side channels that can achieve very large information leakage capacities, and various potential defenses against them. We conclude by noting that the intersection of hardware design and security attacks and countermeasures will continue to present a rich area for research and development for many years to come.","author":["Wayne Burleson","Onur Mutlu","Mohit Tiwari"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 145","Pages   1\u20135","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2905022"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"RowHammer Discussion Group. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rowhammer-discuss.","order":1},{"text":"RowHammer on Twitter. https://twitter.com/search?q=rowhammer&src=typd.","order":2},{"text":"B.

First, we develop an efficient block algorithm for approximating an RRQR factorization, employing a windowed version of the commonly used Golub pivoting strategy, aided by incremental condition estimation. Second, we develop efficiently implementable variants of guaranteed reliable RRQR algorithms for triangular matrices originally suggested by Chandrasekaran and Ipsen and by Pan and Tang. We suggest algorithmic improvements with respect to condition estimation, termination criteria, and Givens updating. By combining the block algorithm with one of the triangular postprocessing steps, we arrive at an efficient and reliable algorithm for computing an RRQR factorization  of a dense matrix. Experimental results on IBM RS/6000 SGI R8000 platforms  show that this approach performs up to three times faster that the less reliable QR factorization with column pivoting as it is currently implemented in LAPACK, and comes within 15% of the performance of the LAPACK block algorithm for computing a QR factorization without any column exchanges. Thus, we expect this routine to be useful in may circumstances where numerical rank deficiency cannot be ruled out, but currently has been ignored because of the computational cost of dealing with it.","author":["Christian H.

The algorithm implements a recursive procedure that involves simple integer operations and quickly converges to the set of points that make the Hilbert curve. The algorithm is elegant, short, and considerably easier to implement than previous recursive and nonrecursive algorithms and can be efficiently implemented in all programming languages that have integer operations and allow recursion. The fundamental Hilbert shape (a line joining the four corners of a square) is represented by two variables with values of either 0 or 1. This coding technique could be successfully applied to the generation of other regular space-filling curves, such as the Peano curve.","author":["Greg Breinholt","Christoph Schierz"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software","Volume 24","Issue 2","June 1998","pp   184\u2013189","https://doi.org/10.1145/290200.290219"],"date":"01 June 1998","ref":[{"text":"ABEND, K., HARLEY, T.

Switching off the less-frequently accessed blocks is an efficient way to reduce the stand-by power, provided that the information stored in these blocks can be restored. Non-volatile memories (NVMs) are integrated into SRAM cells to perform the required store and restore functions. Among various types of NVMs, memristors (a.k.a. RRAM) have several advantages including their small device size, low voltage operation, high speed, and CMOS-compatible fabrication process. In this article, we propose a new 8T1R RRAM-based non-volatile SRAM (NV-SRAM) which adds non-volatility to the SRAM with minimum impact on the Write and Read operations. Simulation at cell-level and array-level have confirmed that the new design performs Read and Write operations at a compatible delay, energy and noise margin as the conventional 6T SRAM, and it is among the best of all reported RRAM-based NV-SRAM designs to our knowledge. In addition, since our 8T1R design uses only one RRAM device per cell, the energy required for storing/restoring the SRAM data to/from the RRAM is significantly reduced by 60%/70% compared to the lowest storing/restoring energy of the previously proposed RRAM-based NV-SRAM designs.","author":["Amr M.S.

In this paper, we aim to incorporate the energy dimension as a design parameter in the higher-level hierarchy of DNN training and execution to optimize for the energy resources and constraints. We use energy characterization to bound the network size in accordance to the pertinent physical resources. An automated customization methodology is proposed to adaptively conform the DNN configurations to the underlying hardware characteristics while minimally affecting the inference accuracy. The key to our approach is a new context and resource aware projection of data to a lower-dimensional embedding by which learning the correlation between data samples requires significantly smaller number of neurons. We leverage the performance gain achieved as a result of the data projection to enable the training of different DNN architectures which can be aggregated together to further boost the inference accuracy. Accompanying APIs are provided to facilitate rapid prototyping of an arbitrary DNN application customized to the underlying platform. Proof-of-concept evaluations for deployment of different visual, audio, and smart-sensing benchmarks demonstrate up to 100-fold energy improvement compared to the prior-art DL solutions.","author":["Bita Darvish Rouhani","Azalia Mirhoseini","Farinaz Koushanfar"],"issue":["ISLPED '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","August 2016","Pages   112\u2013117","https://doi.org/10.1145/2934583.2934599"],"date":"08 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"Y.

However, STT-MRAMs suffer from poor reliability due to shared read and write paths. Additionally, conflicting requirements for data retention and writeability (both related to the energy barrier height of the storage device) makes design more challenging. Furthermore, the energy barrier height depends on the geometry of the storage. Any variations in the geometry of the storage device lead to variations in the energy barrier height. In order to address the poor reliability of STT-MRAMs, usage of Error Correcting Codes (ECC) has been proposed. Unlike traditional CMOS memory technologies, ECC is expected to correct both soft and hard errors in STT-MRAMs. To achieve acceptable yield with low write power, stronger ECC is required, resulting in increased number of encoded bits and degraded memory capacity. In this article, we propose Failure-aware ECC (FaECC), which masks permanent faults while maintaining the same correction capability for soft errors without increased number of encoded bits. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of process variations on run-time reliability of STT-MRAMs. In order to analyze the effectiveness of our methodology, we developed a cross-layer simulation framework that consists of device, circuit and array level analysis of STT-MRAM memory arrays. Our results show that using FaECC relaxes the requirements on the energy barrier height, which reduces the write energy and results in smaller access transistor size and memory array area.","author":["Zoha Pajouhi","Xuanyao Fong","Anand Raghunathan","Kaushik Roy"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 13","Issue 2","March 2017","Article No.: 20","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/2934685"],"date":"19 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"D.

This includes research papers, movies with associated plot summaries, news articles, blog posts, etc. Recommendation approaches based on latent factor models can be extended naturally to leverage text by employing an explicit mapping from text to factors. This enables recommendations for new, unseen content, and may generalize better, since the factors for all items are produced by a compactly-parametrized model. Previous work has used topic models or averages of word embeddings for this mapping. In this paper we present a method leveraging deep recurrent neural networks to encode the text sequence into a latent vector, specifically gated recurrent units (GRUs) trained end-to-end on the collaborative filtering task. For the task of scientific paper recommendation, this yields models with significantly higher accuracy. In cold-start scenarios, we beat the previous state-of-the-art, all of which ignore word order. Performance is further improved by multi-task learning, where the text encoder network is trained for a combination of content recommendation and item metadata prediction. This regularizes the collaborative filtering model, ameliorating the problem of sparsity of the observed rating matrix.","author":["Trapit Bansal","David Belanger","Andrew McCallum"],"issue":["RecSys '16: Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems","September 2016","Pages   107\u2013114","https://doi.org/10.1145/2959100.2959180"],"date":"07 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"Ido Guy, Naama Zwerdling, Inbal Ronen, David Carmel, and Erel Uziel.

Conventional deep neural networks (DNNs) are fully-connected multi-layer networks with hundreds or thousands of neurons in each layer. Such a network requires a very large weight memory to store the connectivity between neurons. In this paper, we propose a hardware-centric methodology to design low power neural networks with significantly smaller memory footprint and computation resource requirements. We achieve this by judiciously dropping connections in large blocks of weights. The corresponding technique, termed coarse-grain sparsification (CGS), introduces hardware-aware sparsity during the DNN training, which leads to efficient weight memory compression and significant computation reduction during classification without losing accuracy. We apply the proposed approach to DNN design for keyword detection and speech recognition. When the two DNNs are trained with 75% of the weights dropped and classified with 5-6 bit weight precision, the weight memory requirement is reduced by 95% compared to their fully-connected counterparts with double precision, while maintaining similar performance in keyword detection accuracy, word error rate, and sentence error rate. To validate this technique in real hardware, a time-multiplexed architecture using a shared multiply and accumulate (MAC) engine was implemented in 65nm and 40nm low power (LP) CMOS. In 40nm at 0.6V, the keyword detection network consumes 7\u03bcW and the speech recognition network consumes 103\u03bcW, making this technique highly suitable for mobile and wearable devices.","author":["Deepak Kadetotad","Sairam Arunachalam","Chaitali Chakrabarti","Jae-sun Seo"],"issue":["ICCAD '16: Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2016","Article No.: 78","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967028"],"date":"07 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"D.

However, previous studies have rarely utilized this valuable information to generate embeddings of vertices.

When developing HLS tools, tests are desirable to ensure their function, reliability and performance. When modifications are applied to a tool, Non-Regression Test (NRT) asserts that the changes have intended effect while Regression Test (RT) verifies that the tool still performs correctly without unwanted behaviour. The work presented in this paper is focused on a method to automatically perform Non-Regression Test in HLS tool developments, although it can also be used as a Regression Testing technique. This method relies on a framework which allows HLS tool developers to verify the circuits generated from the tool directly on FPGA, instead of using simulations. The verification flow is automatic, so that knowing the details of the system is unnecessary for developers. The framework has been tested successfully over several applications from HLS benchmark and it gives more promising results than its simulation counterpart.","author":["Arief Wicaksana","Adrien Prost-Boucle","Olivier Muller","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rousseau","Arif Sasongko"],"issue":["RSP '16: Proceedings of the 27th International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping: Shortening the Path from Specification to Prototype","October 2016","Pages   41\u201347","https://doi.org/10.1145/2990299.2990307"],"date":"01 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"Altera SoCs: When Architecture Matters.","order":1},{"text":"J.

We fill this void with FlexRAN, a flexible and programmable SD-RAN platform that separates the RAN control and data planes through a new, custom-tailored southbound API. Aided by virtualized control functions and control delegation features, FlexRAN provides a flexible control plane designed with support for real-time RAN control applications, flexibility to realize various degrees of coordination among RAN infrastructure entities, and programmability to adapt control over time and easier evolution to the future following SDN/NFV principles. We implement FlexRAN as an extension to a modified version of the OpenAirInterface LTE platform, with evaluation results indicating the feasibility of using FlexRAN under the stringent time constraints posed by the RAN. To demonstrate the effectiveness of FlexRAN as an SD-RAN platform and highlight its applicability for a diverse set of use cases, we present three network services deployed over FlexRAN focusing on interference management, mobile edge computing and RAN sharing.","author":["Xenofon Foukas","Navid Nikaein","Mohamed M.

Network data mining has a large number of applications in many disciplines including protein-protein interaction networks, social networks, transportation networks, and telecommunication networks. Different empirical studies have shown that it is possible to predict new relationships between elements attending to the topology of the network and the properties of its elements. The problem of predicting new relationships in networks is called link prediction. Link prediction aims to infer the behavior of the network link formation process by predicting missed or future relationships based on currently observed connections. It has become an attractive area of study since it allows us to predict how networks will evolve. In this survey, we will review the general-purpose techniques at the heart of the link prediction problem, which can be complemented by domain-specific heuristic methods in practice.","author":["V\u00edctor Mart\u00ednez","Fernando Berzal","Juan-Carlos Cubero"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 49","Issue 4","February 2017","Article No.: 69","pp   1\u201333","https://doi.org/10.1145/3012704"],"date":"20 December 2016","ref":[{"text":"Lada A.

A major challenge for this task is to be able to accurately detect entities in new languages with limited labeled resources. In this paper we present an accurate and lightweight, multilingual named entity recognition (NER) and linking (NEL) system. The contributions of this paper are three-fold: 1) Lightweight named entity recognition with competitive accuracy; 2) Candidate entity retrieval that uses search click-log data and entity embeddings to achieve high precision with a low memory footprint; and 3) efficient entity disambiguation. Our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on TAC KBP 2013 multilingual data and on English AIDA CONLL data.","author":["Aasish Pappu","Roi Blanco","Yashar Mehdad","Amanda Stent","Kapil Thadani"],"issue":["WSDM '17: Proceedings of the Tenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2017","Pages   365\u2013374","https://doi.org/10.1145/3018661.3018724"],"date":"02 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"R.

This has triggered the development of DL frameworks like Caffe, Torch, TensorFlow, and CNTK. However, most DL frameworks have been limited to a single node. In order to scale out DL frameworks and bring HPC capabilities to the DL arena, we propose, S-Caffe; a scalable and distributed Caffe adaptation for modern multi-GPU clusters. With an in-depth analysis of new requirements brought forward by the DL frameworks and limitations of current communication runtimes, we present a co-design of the Caffe framework and the MVAPICH2-GDR MPI runtime. Using the co-design methodology, we modify Caffe's workflow to maximize the overlap of computation and communication with multi-stage data propagation and gradient aggregation schemes. We bring DL-Awareness to the MPI runtime by proposing a hierarchical reduction design that benefits from CUDA-Aware features and provides up to a massive 133x speedup over OpenMPI and 2.6x speedup over MVAPICH2 for 160 GPUs. S-Caffe successfully scales up to 160 K-80 GPUs for GoogLeNet (ImageNet) with a speedup of 2.5x over 32 GPUs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that scales up to 160 GPUs. Furthermore, even for single node training, S-Caffe shows an improvement of 14\\% and 9\\% over Nvidia's optimized Caffe for 8 and 16 GPUs, respectively. In addition, S-Caffe achieves up to 1395 samples per second for the AlexNet model, which is comparable to the performance of Microsoft CNTK.","author":["Ammar Ahmad Awan","Khaled Hamidouche","Jahanzeb Maqbool Hashmi","Dhabaleswar K.

Sampling of MRI data on Cartesian grids allows efficient computation of the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform for image reconstruction using the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) algorithm. Though the use of Cartesian trajectories simplifies the IFFT computation, non-Cartesian trajectories have been shown to provide better image resolution with lower scan times. To improve the processing time of MRI image reconstruction for these optimized non-Cartesian trajectories using a Non-uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NuFFT) algorithm, dedicated accelerators are required. We present an FPGA-based MRI solution to implement NuFFT for image reconstruction. The solution is based on the design of an efficient custom accelerator on FPGA using OpenCL, and covers all the phases necessary to reconstruct an image with high accuracy, starting from raw scan data. The architecture can be easily extendable to tackle 3D imaging, and k-space properties have been analyzed to reduce the number of samples processed, achieving satisfactory reconstruction accuracy while positively impacting processing time. Our solution achieves a marked improvement over previously published FPGA- and CPU-based implementations and, due to its scalability, it is suitable for the image sizes common in MRI acquisitions.","author":["Emanuele Pezzotti","Alex Iacobucci","Gregory Nash","Umer Cheema","Paolo Vinella","Rashid Ansari"],"issue":["FPGA '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2017","Pages   293","https://doi.org/10.1145/3020078.3021793"],"date":"22 February 2017"},{"_id":"10.1145/3037697.3037714","title":"DudeTM: Building Durable Transactions with Decoupling for Persistent Memory","abstract":"Emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) offers non-volatility, byte-addressability and fast access at the same time. To make the best use of these properties, it has been shown by empirical evidence that programs should access NVM directly through CPU load and store instructions, so that the overhead of a traditional file system or database can be avoided. Thus, durable transactions become a common choice of applications for accessing persistent memory data in a crash consistent manner. However, existing durable transaction systems employ either undo logging, which requires a fence for every memory write, or redo logging, which requires intercepting all memory reads within transactions. This paper presents DUDETM, a crash-consistent durable transaction system that avoids the drawbacks of both undo logging and redo logging. DUDETM uses shadow DRAM to decouple the execution of a durable transaction into three fully asynchronous steps. The advantage is that only minimal fences and no memory read instrumentation are required. This design also enables an out-of-the-box transactional memory (TM) to be used as an independent component in our system. The evaluation results show that DUDETM adds durability to a TM system with only 7.4 ~ 24.6% throughput degradation. Compared to the existing durable transaction systems, DUDETM provides 1.7times to 4.4times higher throughput. Moreover, DUDETM can be implemented with existing hardware TMs with minor hardware modifications, leading to a further 1.7times speedup.","author":["Mengxing Liu","Mingxing Zhang","Kang Chen","Xuehai Qian","Yongwei Wu","Weimin Zheng","Jinglei Ren"],"issue":["ASPLOS '17: Proceedings of the Twenty-Second International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","April 2017","Pages   329\u2013343","https://doi.org/10.1145/3037697.3037714"],"date":"04 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"Akinaga, H., and Shima, H.

Some applications, such as tracking, can use sensed acceleration and rate of rotation to calculate displacement based on physical system models. Other applications, such as activity recognition, extract manually designed features from sensor inputs for classification. Such applications face two challenges. On one hand, on-device sensor measurements are noisy. For many mobile applications, it is hard to find a distribution that exactly describes the noise in practice. Unfortunately, calculating target quantities based on physical system and noise models is only as accurate as the noise assumptions. Similarly, in classification applications, although manually designed features have proven to be effective, it is not always straightforward to find the most robust features to accommodate diverse sensor noise patterns and heterogeneous user behaviors. To this end, we propose DeepSense, a deep learning framework that directly addresses the aforementioned noise and feature customization challenges in a unified manner. DeepSense integrates convolutional and recurrent neural networks to exploit local interactions among similar mobile sensors, merge local interactions of different sensory modalities into global interactions, and extract temporal relationships to model signal dynamics. DeepSense thus provides a general signal estimation and classification framework that accommodates a wide range of applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepSense using three representative and challenging tasks: car tracking with motion sensors, heterogeneous human activity recognition, and user identification with biometric motion analysis. DeepSense significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for all three tasks. In addition, we show that DeepSense is feasible to implement on smartphones and embedded devices thanks to its moderate energy consumption and low latency.","author":["Shuochao Yao","Shaohan Hu","Yiran Zhao","Aston Zhang","Tarek Abdelzaher"],"issue":["WWW '17: Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web","April 2017","Pages   351\u2013360","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052577"],"date":"03 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"Intel edison compute module. http://www.intel. com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/ edison/sb/edison-module_HG_331189.pdf .","order":1},{"text":"Qualcomm snapdragon 800 processor. https://www.qualcomm.com/products/ snapdragon/processors/800.","order":2},{"text":"W.

Unfortunately, all known algorithms tend to break down in high dimensional spaces because of the inherent sparsity of the points. In such high dimensional spaces not all dimensions may be relevant to a given cluster. One way of handling this is to pick the closely correlated dimensions and find clusters in the corresponding subspace. Traditional feature selection algorithms attempt to achieve this. The weakness of this approach is that in typical high dimensional data mining applications different sets of points may cluster better for different subsets of dimensions. The number of dimensions in each such cluster-specific subspace may also vary. Hence, it may be impossible to find a single small subset of dimensions for all the clusters. We therefore discuss a generalization of the clustering problem, referred to as the projected clustering problem, in which the subsets of dimensions selected are specific to the clusters themselves. We develop an algorithmic framework for solving the projected clustering problem, and test its performance on synthetic data.","author":["Charu C. Aggarwal","Joel L. Wolf","Philip S.

The cloud has displayed a disruptive and growing impact on everyday computing tasks. However, facilitating the orchestration of cloud resources to build such cloud services and applications is yet to unleash its entire magnitude of power. Accordingly, it is paramount to devise a unified and comprehensive analysis framework to accelerate fundamental understanding of cloud resource orchestration in terms of concepts, paradigms, languages, models, and tools. This framework is essential to empower effective research, comprehension, comparison, and selection of cloud resource orchestration models, languages, platforms, and tools. This article provides such a comprehensive framework while analyzing the relevant state of the art in cloud resource orchestration from a novel and holistic viewpoint.","author":["Denis Weerasiri","Moshe Chai Barukh","Boualem Benatallah","Quan Z.

GPUs are the dominant computing platform for research efforts and are also gaining popularity as a deployment platform for applications such as autonomous vehicles. As a result, GPU vendors such as NVIDIA have spent enormous effort to write special-purpose NN libraries. On other hardware targets, especially mobile GPUs, such vendor libraries are not generally available. Thus, the development of portable, open, high-performance, energy-efficient GPU code for NN operations would enable broader deployment of NN-based algorithms. A root problem is that high efficiency GPU programming suffers from high complexity, low productivity, and low portability. To address this, this work presents a framework to enable productive, high-efficiency GPU programming for NN computations across hardware platforms and programming models. In particular, the framework provides specific support for metaprogramming and autotuning of operations over ND-Arrays. To show the correctness and value of our framework and approach, we implement a selection of NN operations, covering the core operations needed for deploying three common image-processing neural networks. We target three different hardware platforms: NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm GPUs. On NVIDIA GPUs, we show both portability between OpenCL and CUDA as well competitive performance compared to the vendor library. On Qualcomm GPUs, we show that our framework enables productive development of target-specific optimizations, and achieves reasonable absolute performance. Finally, On AMD GPUs, we show initial results that indicate our framework can yield reasonable performance on a new platform with minimal effort.","author":["Matthew W.

Aggressive supply voltage reduction requires a thorough understanding of the effect voltage scaling has on DRAM access latency and DRAM reliability.

However, scaling these accelerators for higher performance with increasingly larger NNs exacerbates the cost and energy overheads of their memory systems, including the on-chip SRAM buffers and the off-chip DRAM channels.This paper presents the hardware architecture and software scheduling and partitioning techniques for TETRIS, a scalable NN accelerator using 3D memory. First, we show that the high throughput and low energy characteristics of 3D memory allow us to rebalance the NN accelerator design, using more area for processing elements and less area for SRAM buffers. Second, we move portions of the NN computations close to the DRAM banks to decrease bandwidth pressure and increase performance and energy efficiency. Third, we show that despite the use of small SRAM buffers, the presence of 3D memory simplifies dataflow scheduling for NN computations. We present an analytical scheduling scheme that matches the efficiency of schedules derived through exhaustive search. Finally, we develop a hybrid partitioning scheme that parallelizes the NN computations over multiple accelerators. Overall, we show that TETRIS improves mthe performance by 4.1x and reduces the energy by 1.5x over NN accelerators with conventional, low-power DRAM memory systems.","author":["Mingyu Gao","Jing Pu","Xuan Yang","Mark Horowitz","Christos Kozyrakis"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 45","Issue 1","March 2017","pp   751\u2013764","https://doi.org/10.1145/3093337.3037702"],"date":"04 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"M.

Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) offer ample spatial parallelism, which is then exposed to the compiler. The first problem that a DMFB compiler must solve is resource-constrained scheduling, which is NP-complete. If the compiler is applied off-line, then long-running algorithms that produce solutions of high quality, such as iterative improvement or branch-and-bound search, can be applied; in an online context, where a biochemical reaction is to be executed as soon as it is specified by the programmer, heuristics that sacrifice solution quality to attain a fast runtime are used. This article describes in detail the algorithms and heuristics that have been proposed for resource-constrained scheduling, focusing on several recent contributions: path scheduling and force-directed list scheduling. It also discusses shortcomings and limitations of existing optimal scheduling problem formulations based on Integer Linear Programming and presents an updated formulation that addresses these issues. The algorithms are compared and evaluated on an extensive benchmark suite of biochemical assays used for applications, such as in vitro diagnostics, protein crystallization, and automated sample preparation.","author":["Kenneth O'neal","Daniel Grissom","Philip Brisk"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 14","Issue 1","March 2018","Article No.: 7","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/3093930"],"date":"14 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Mirela Alistar and Paul Pop. 2015.

This property persuades researchers to share computational models across languages and benefit from high-quality models to boost existing low-performance counterparts. In this article, we follow a similar idea, whereby we develop statistical and neural machine translation (MT) engines that are trained on one language pair but are used to translate another language. First we train a reliable model for a high-resource language, and then we exploit cross-lingual similarities and adapt the model to work for a close language with almost zero resources. We chose Turkish (Tr) and Azeri or Azerbaijani (Az) as the proposed pair in our experiments. Azeri suffers from lack of resources as there is almost no bilingual corpus for this language. Via our techniques, we are able to train an engine for the Az \u2192 English (En) direction, which is able to outperform all other existing models.","author":["Peyman Passban","Qun Liu","Andy Way"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing","Volume 16","Issue 4","September 2017","Article No.: 29","pp   1\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/3099556"],"date":"08 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"Eleftherios Avramidis and Philipp Koehn. 2008.

However, to keep up with future Internet architectural trends the wider area of future Internet paradigms, there is a pressing need to support edge/fog computing environments, where cloud functionality is available more proximate to where the data is generated and needs processing. With this goal in mind, we propose Named Function as a Service (NFaaS), a framework that extends the Named Data Networking architecture to support in-network function execution. In contrast to existing works, NFaaSbuilds on very lightweight VMs and allows for dynamic execution of custom code. Functions can be downloaded and run by any node in the network. Functions can move between nodes according to user demand, making resolution of moving functions a first-class challenge. NFaaSincludes a Kernel Store component, which is responsible not only for storing functions, but also for making decisions on which functions to run locally. NFaaSincludes a routing protocol and a number of forwarding strategies to deploy and dynamically migrate functions within the network. We validate our design through extensive simulations, which show that delay-sensitive functions are deployed closer to the edge, while less delay-sensitive ones closer to the core.","author":["Micha\u0142 Kr\u00f3l","Ioannis Psaras"],"issue":["ICN '17: Proceedings of the 4th ACM Conference on Information-Centric Networking","September 2017","Pages   134\u2013144","https://doi.org/10.1145/3125719.3125727"],"date":"26 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"J.

The central ingredient in this approach is a statistical model of how a user might distill or \"translate\" a given document into a query. To assess the relevance of a document to a user's query, we estimate the probability that the query would have been generated as a translation of the document, and factor in the user's general preferences in the form of a prior distribution over documents. We propose a simple, well motivated model of the document-to-query translation process, and describe an algorithm for learning the parameters of this model in an unsupervised manner from a collection of documents. As we show, one can view this approach as a generalization and justification of the \"language modeling\" strategy recently proposed by Ponte and Croft. In a series of experiments on TREC data, a simple translation-based retrieval system performs well in comparison to conventional retrieval techniques. This prototype system only begins to tap the full potential of translation-based retrieval.","author":["Adam Berger","John Lafferty"],"issue":["ACM SIGIR Forum","Volume 51","Issue 2","July 2017","pp   219\u2013226","https://doi.org/10.1145/3130348.3130371"],"date":"02 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

The construction of knowledge graphs in the past decades facilitates many applications, such as link prediction, web search analysis, question answering, and so on. Knowledge graph embedding aims to represent entities and relations in a large-scale knowledge graph as elements in a continuous vector space. Existing methods, for example, TransE, TransH, and TransR, learn the embedding representation by defining a global margin-based loss function over the data. However, the loss function is determined during experiments whose parameters are examined among a closed set of candidates. Moreover, embeddings over two knowledge graphs with different entities and relations share the same set of candidates, ignoring the locality of both graphs. This leads to the limited performance of embedding related applications. In this article, a locally adaptive translation method for knowledge graph embedding, called TransA, is proposed to find the loss function by adaptively determining its margin over different knowledge graphs. Then the convergence of TransA is verified from the aspect of its uniform stability. To make the embedding methods up-to-date when new vertices and edges are added into the knowledge graph, the incremental algorithm for TransA, called iTransA, is proposed by adaptively adjusting the optimal margin over time. Experiments on four benchmark data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to the state-of-the-art ones.","author":["Yantao Jia","Yuanzhuo Wang","Xiaolong Jin","Hailun Lin","Xueqi Cheng"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on the Web","Volume 12","Issue 2","June 2018","Article No.: 8","pp   1\u201333","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132733"],"date":"22 December 2017","ref":[{"text":"Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville, and Pierre Vincent. 2013.

Fully realizing this potential requires fundamental changes in how system software manages, protects, and provides access to data that resides in NVMM. We address these needs by describing an NVMM-optimized file system called NOVA-Fortis that is both fast and resilient in the face of corruption due to media errors and software bugs. We identify and propose solutions for the unique challenges in adding fault tolerance to an NVMM file system, adapt state-of-the-art reliability techniques to an NVMM file system, and quantify the performance and storage overheads of these techniques. We find that NOVA-Fortis' reliability features consume 14.8% of the storage for redundancy and reduce application-level performance by between 2% and 38% compared to the same file system with the features removed. NOVA-Fortis outperforms DAX-aware file systems without reliability features by 1.5x on average. It outperforms reliable, block-based file systems running on NVMM by 3x on average.","author":["Jian Xu","Lu Zhang","Amirsaman Memaripour","Akshatha Gangadharaiah","Amit Borase","Tamires Brito Da Silva","Steven Swanson","Andy Rudoff"],"issue":["SOSP '17: Proceedings of the 26th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","October 2017","Pages   478\u2013496","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132747.3132761"],"date":"14 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Jens Axboe. 2017.

Its location signature has been observed to be temporally stable and spatially discernible for localization purposes. This survey examines and analyzes the recent challenges and advances in geomagnetism-based indoor localization using smartphones. We first study smartphone-based geomagnetism measurements. We then review recent efforts in database construction and computation reduction, followed by state-of-the-art schemes in localizing the target. For each category, we identify practical deployment challenges and compare related studies. Finally, we summarize future directions and provide a guideline for new researchers in this field.","author":["Suining He","Kang G.

The two models have their respective advantages and limitations due to different loss functions. Here, we shed light on how to combine the two models to learn more discriminative pedestrian descriptors. Specifically, we propose a Siamese network that simultaneously computes the identification loss and verification loss. Given a pair of training images, the network predicts the identities of the two input images and whether they belong to the same identity. Our network learns a discriminative embedding and a similarity measurement at the same time, thus taking full usage of the re-ID annotations. Our method can be easily applied on different pretrained networks. Albeit simple, the learned embedding improves the state-of-the-art performance on two public person re-ID benchmarks. Further, we show that our architecture can also be applied to image retrieval.

To date, what makes a robot appear human-like has been driven by designers\u00bb and researchers\u00bb intuitions, because a systematic understanding of the range, variety, and relationships among constituent features of anthropomorphic robots is lacking. To fill this gap, we introduce the ABOT (Anthropomorphic roBOT) Database---a collection of 200 images of real-world robots with one or more human-like appearance features (http://www.abotdatabase.info). Harnessing this database, Study 1 uncovered four distinct appearance dimensions (i.e., bundles of features) that characterize a wide spectrum of anthropomorphic robots and Study 2 identified the dimensions and specific features that were most predictive of robots\u00bb perceived human-likeness. With data from both studies, we then created an online estimation tool to help researchers predict how human-like a new robot will be perceived given the presence of various appearance features. The present research sheds new light on what makes a robot look human, and makes publicly accessible a powerful new tool for future research on robots\u00bb human-likeness.","author":["Elizabeth Phillips","Xuan Zhao","Daniel Ullman","Bertram F.

Current architectures perform poorly for these workloads, as existing prefetching techniques cannot capture the memory access patterns; these applications end up heavily memory-bound as a result. Although a number of techniques exist to explicitly configure a prefetcher with traversal patterns, gaining significant speedups, they do not generalise beyond their target data structures. Instead, we propose an event-triggered programmable prefetcher combining the flexibility of a general-purpose computational unit with an event-based programming model, along with compiler techniques to automatically generate events from the original source code with annotations. This allows more complex fetching decisions to be made, without needing to stall when intermediate results are required. Using our programmable prefetching system, combined with small prefetch kernels extracted from applications, we achieve an average 3.0x speedup in simulation for a variety of graph, database and HPC workloads.","author":["Sam Ainsworth","Timothy M.

In the research community, there is an ongoing debate about the best way to architect such query compilers. This is perceived to be a difficult task, requiring techniques fundamentally different from traditional interpreted query execution.   We aim to contribute to this discussion by drawing attention to an old but underappreciated idea known as Futamura projections, which fundamentally link interpreters and compilers. Guided by this idea, we demonstrate that efficient query compilation can actually be very simple, using techniques that are no more difficult than writing a query interpreter in a high-level language. Moreover, we demonstrate how intricate compilation patterns that were previously used to justify multiple compiler passes can be realized in one single, straightforward, generation pass. Key examples are injection of specialized index structures, data representation changes such as string dictionaries, and various kinds of code motion to reduce the amount of work on the critical path.  We present LB2: a high-level query compiler developed in this style that performs on par with, and sometimes beats, the best compiled query engines on the standard TPC-H benchmark.","author":["Ruby Y.

Smart contracts are like classes that can be called by client applications outside the blockchain. Therefore it is possible to develop blockchain-oriented software (BOS) that implements part of the business logic in the blockchain by using smart contracts. Currently, there is no design standard to model BOS. Since modeling is an important part of designing a software, developers may struggle to plan their BOS. In this paper, we show three complementary modeling approaches based on well-known software engineering models and apply them to a BOS example. Our goal is to start the discussion on specialized blockchain modeling notations.","author":["Henrique Rocha","St\u00e9phane Ducasse"],"issue":["WETSEB '18: Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Emerging Trends in Software Engineering for Blockchain","May 2018","Pages   52\u201357","https://doi.org/10.1145/3194113.3194123"],"date":"27 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"Karthikeyan Bhargavan, Antoine Delignat-Lavaud, C\u00e9dric Fournet, Anitha Gollamudi, Georges Gonthier, Nadim Kobeissi, Natalia Kulatova, Aseem Rastogi, Thomas Sibut-Pinote, Nikhil Swamy, and Santiago Zanella-B\u00e9guelin. 2016.

Modern network typologies, such as convolutional neural networks, can be very deep and impose considerable complexity that is often not feasible in resource bound, real-time systems. Processing of these networks requires high levels of parallelization, maximizing data throughput, and support for different network types, while minimizing power and resource consumption. In response to these requirements, in this paper, we present a low power FPGA based neural network accelerator named SCALENet: a SCalable Low power AccELerator for real-time deep neural Networks. Key features include optimization for power with coarse and fine grain scheduler, implementation flexibility with hardware only or hardware/software co-design, and acceleration for both fully connected and convolutional layers. The experimental results evaluate SCALENet against two different neural network applications: image processing, and biomedical seizure detection. The image processing networks, implemented on SCALENet, trained on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets with eight different networks, are implemented on an Arty A7 and Zedboard#8482; FPGA platforms. The highest improvement came with the Inception network on an ImageNet dataset with a throughput of 22x and decrease in energy consumption of 13x compared to the ARM processor implementation. We then implement SCALENet for time series EEG seizure detection using both a Direct Convolution and FFT Convolution method to show its design versatility with a 99.7% reduction in execution time and a 97.9% improvement in energy consumption compared to the ARM. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to achieve parity with or exceed the energy efficiency of NVIDIA GPUs when evaluated against Jetson TK1 with embedded GPU System on Chip (SoC) and with a 4x power savings in a power envelope of 2.07 Watts.","author":["Colin Shea","Adam Page","Tinoosh Mohsenin"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '18: Proceedings of the 2018 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2018","Pages   129\u2013134","https://doi.org/10.1145/3194554.3194601"],"date":"30 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"T.

Designing deep neural network architectures for multitask learning is a challenge: There are many ways to tie the tasks together, and the design choices matter. The size and complexity of this problem exceeds human design ability, making it a compelling domain for evolutionary optimization. Using the existing state of the art soft ordering architecture as the starting point, methods for evolving the modules of this architecture and for evolving the overall topology or routing between modules are evaluated in this paper. A synergetic approach of evolving custom routings with evolved, shared modules for each task is found to be very powerful, significantly improving the state of the art in the Omniglot multitask, multialphabet character recognition domain. This result demonstrates how evolution can be instrumental in advancing deep neural network and complex system design in general.","author":["Jason Liang","Elliot Meyerson","Risto Miikkulainen"],"issue":["GECCO '18: Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference","July 2018","Pages   466\u2013473","https://doi.org/10.1145/3205455.3205489"],"date":"02 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"A.

The systems presented can support any number of concurrent processes which perform searching, insertion, deletion, and rotation (reorganization) on the tree, but allow any process to lock only a constant number of nodes at any time. Also, in the systems, searches are essentially never blocked. The concurrency control techniques introduced in the paper include the use of special nodes and pointers to redirect searches, and the use of copies of sections of the tree to introduce many changes simultaneously and therefore avoid unpredictable interleaving.

Measurements collection in dense urban deployments is however complex and expensive, and the post-processing required to make predictions is highly non-trivial, given the intricate spatio-temporal variability of mobile traffic due to user mobility. To overcome these challenges, in this paper we harness the exceptional feature extraction abilities of deep learning and propose a Spatio-Temporal neural Network (STN) architecture purposely designed for precise network-wide mobile traffic forecasting. We present a mechanism that fine tunes the STN and enables its operation with only limited ground truth observations. We then introduce a Double STN technique (D-STN), which uniquely combines the STN predictions with historical statistics, thereby making faithful long-term mobile traffic projections. Experiments we conduct with real-world mobile traffic data sets, collected over 60 days in both urban and rural areas, demonstrate that the proposed (D-)STN schemes perform up to 10-hour long predictions with remarkable accuracy, irrespective of the time of day when they are triggered. Specifically, our solutions achieve up to 61% smaller prediction errors as compared to widely used forecasting approaches, while operating with up to 600 times shorter measurement intervals.","author":["Chaoyun Zhang","Paul Patras"],"issue":["Mobihoc '18: Proceedings of the Eighteenth ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing","June 2018","Pages   231\u2013240","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209582.3209606"],"date":"26 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi et al. 2015.

To this end, many recommender systems optimize models with pairwise ranking objectives, such as the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR). Using matrix Factorization (MF) - the most widely used model in recommendation - as a demonstration, we show that optimizing it with BPR leads to a recommender model that is not robust. In particular, we find that the resultant model is highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on its model parameters, which implies the possibly large error in generalization. To enhance the robustness of a recommender model and thus improve its generalization performance, we propose a new optimization framework, namely Adversarial Personalized Ranking (APR). In short, our APR enhances the pairwise ranking method BPR by performing adversarial training. It can be interpreted as playing a minimax game, where the minimization of the BPR objective function meanwhile defends an adversary, which adds adversarial perturbations on model parameters to maximize the BPR objective function. To illustrate how it works, we implement APR on MF by adding adversarial perturbations on the embedding vectors of users and items. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of APR - by optimizing MF with APR, it outperforms BPR with a relative improvement of 11.2% on average and achieves state-of-the-art performance for item recommendation.

BARNET not only provides identification of tagged objects but also can serve as a 'device-free' activity recognition system. BARNET's key innovation is the concept of backscatter channel state information (BCSI) which can be measured via systematic multiphase probing of the backscatter tag-to-tag channel using innovative processing on the passive tags. So far such measurements were only possible using active radio receivers that consume much higher power. Changes in BCSI provide signatures for different activities in the environment that can be learned using suitable machine learning tools. We develop the BARNET tag architecture which shows that an ASIC implementation can run on harvested RF power. We develop a printed circuit board (PCB) prototype using discrete components to evaluate activity recognition performance. We show that the prototype can recognize human daily activities with an average error around 6%. Overall, BARNET uses passive tags to achieve the same level of performance as systems that use powered, active radios.","author":["Jihoon Ryoo","Yasha Karimi","Akshay Athalye","Milutin Stana\u0107evi\u0107","Samir R.

In this paper the complexity and performance of algorithms which construct such colorings are investigated. For a graph G, let \u03c7(G) denote the minimum possible number of colors required to color G and, for any graph coloring algorithm A, let A(G) denote the number of colors used by A when applied to G. Since the graph coloring problem is known to be \u201cNP-complete,\u201d it is considered unlikely that any efficient algorithm can guarantee A(G) = \u03c7(G) for all input graphs. In this paper it is proved that even coming close to khgr;(G) with a fast algorithm is hard. Specifically, it is shown that if for some constant r < 2 and constant d there exists a polynomial-time algorithm A which guarantees A(G) \u2264 r\u00b7\u03c7(G) + d, then there also exists a polynomial-time algorithm A which guarantees A(G) = \u03c7(G).","author":["M.

However, making these methods practical and scalable to web-scale recommendation tasks with billions of items and hundreds of millions of users remains an unsolved challenge. Here we describe a large-scale deep recommendation engine that we developed and deployed at Pinterest. We develop a data-efficient Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) algorithm, which combines efficient random walks and graph convolutions to generate embeddings of nodes (i.e., items) that incorporate both graph structure as well as node feature information. Compared to prior GCN approaches, we develop a novel method based on highly efficient random walks to structure the convolutions and design a novel training strategy that relies on harder-and-harder training examples to improve robustness and convergence of the model. We also develop an efficient MapReduce model inference algorithm to generate embeddings using a trained model. Overall, we can train on and embed graphs that are four orders of magnitude larger than typical GCN implementations. We show how GCN embeddings can be used to make high-quality recommendations in various settings at Pinterest, which has a massive underlying graph with 3 billion nodes representing pins and boards, and 17 billion edges. According to offline metrics, user studies, as well as A/B tests, our approach generates higher-quality recommendations than comparable deep learning based systems. To our knowledge, this is by far the largest application of deep graph embeddings to date and paves the way for a new generation of web-scale recommender systems based on graph convolutional architectures.","author":["Rex Ying","Ruining He","Kaifeng Chen","Pong Eksombatchai","William L.

Network embedding is to learn low-dimensional representations for nodes in a network. A popular kind of existing methods, such as DeepWalk, Node2Vec, and LINE, learn node representations by pushing positive context node to the anchor node while pushing negative context nodes away from it in the low-dimensional vector space. When sampling the negative context nodes, they usually employ a predefined sampling distribution based on the node popularity. However, this sampling distribution often fails to capture the real informativeness of each node and cannot reflect the training state. To address these important problems, in this paper, we propose a novel self-paced network embedding method. Specifically, our method can adaptively capture the informativeness of each node based on the current training state, and sample negative context nodes in terms of their informativeness. The proposed self-paced sampling strategy can gradually select difficult negative context nodes with training process going on to learn better node representations. Moreover, to better capture the node informativeness for learning node representations, we extend our method to the generative adversarial network framework, which has the larger capacity to discover node informativeness. The extensive experiments have been conducted on the benchmark network datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.","author":["Hongchang Gao","Heng Huang"],"issue":["KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2018","Pages   1406\u20131415","https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3220041"],"date":"19 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mart'\u0131n Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, et almbox. . {n. d.}.

However, high directivity also results in frequent misalignment of beams due to small-scale/micro-mobility of user equipment (UE), such as shakes and rotations, leading to the spontaneous degradation of SNR level and waste of communications time for the beam searching procedure. In this paper, we make the initial steps to investigate the behavior of terahertz band link characteristics subject to the small-scale mobility of UE. We show that the optimal antenna directivity angle leading to the highest, on average, capacity heavily depends on the micro-mobility pattern of the UE. Further investigations in this area will contribute to the design of robust and high-performance communication systems in the terahertz band.","author":["Vitaly Petrov","Dmitri Moltchanov","Yevgeni Koucheryavy","Josep M.

To address the safety issues in autonomous driving systems, a recent set of testing techniques have been designed to automatically generate artificial driving scenes to enrich test suite, e.g., generating new input images transformed from the original ones. However, these techniques are insufficient due to two limitations: first, many such synthetic images often lack diversity of driving scenes, and hence compromise the resulting efficacy and reliability. Second, for machine-learning-based systems, a mismatch between training and application domain can dramatically degrade system accuracy, such that it is necessary to validate inputs for improving system robustness.   In this paper, we propose DeepRoad, an unsupervised DNN-based framework for automatically testing the consistency of DNN-based autonomous driving systems and online validation. First, DeepRoad automatically synthesizes large amounts of diverse driving scenes without using image transformation rules (e.g. scale, shear and rotation). In particular, DeepRoad is able to produce driving scenes with various weather conditions (including those with rather extreme conditions) by applying Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) along with the corresponding real-world weather scenes. Second, DeepRoad utilizes metamorphic testing techniques to check the consistency of such systems using synthetic images. Third, DeepRoad validates input images for DNN-based systems by measuring the distance of the input and training images using their VGGNet features. We implement DeepRoad to test three well-recognized DNN-based autonomous driving systems in Udacity self-driving car challenge. The experimental results demonstrate that DeepRoad can detect thousands of inconsistent behaviors for these systems, and effectively validate input images to potentially enhance the system robustness as well.","author":["Mengshi Zhang","Yuqun Zhang","Lingming Zhang","Cong Liu","Sarfraz Khurshid"],"issue":["ASE 2018: Proceedings of the 33rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automated Software Engineering","September 2018","Pages   132\u2013142","https://doi.org/10.1145/3238147.3238187"],"date":"03 September 2018","ref":[{"text":"Paul Ammann and Jeff Offutt. 2016.

As a binary memory unit for distributed deployment, memristive voltage divider (MVD) exhibits promising features and characteristics, e.g. reduced energy consumption, enhanced endurance and read-while-write capability. In this work we investigate programming schemes for writing multiple levels into MVD. We explore traditional memristor programming methods namely write pulse amplitude, write pulse duration and current limited write pulse as well as feedback-based write mechanism enabled by the MVD's read-while-write feature. Based on this analysis we then a) classify the presented schemes with respect to the number of achievable levels and energy consumption. b) give design insights into composing circuits with multi-level MVD.","author":["Tobias Lieske","Mehrdad Biglari","Dietmar Fey"],"issue":["MEMSYS '18: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Memory Systems","October 2018","Pages   259\u2013268","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240302.3240430"],"date":"01 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Christoph Baeumer, Christoph Schmitz, Amr HH Ramadan, Hongchu Du, Katharina Skaja, Vitaliy Feyer, Philipp M\u00fcller, Benedikt Arndt, Chun-Lin Jia, Joachim Mayer, et al. 2015.

To bridge the gap between fast DNN construction in software (e.g., Caffe, TensorFlow) and slow hardware implementation, we propose DNNBuilder for building high-performance DNN hardware accelerators on FPGAs automatically. Novel techniques are developed to meet the throughput and latency requirements for both cloud- and edge-devices. A number of novel techniques including high-quality RTL neural network components, a fine-grained layer-based pipeline architecture, and a column-based cache scheme are developed to boost throughput, reduce latency, and save FPGA on-chip memory. To address the limited resource challenge, we design an automatic design space exploration tool to generate optimized parallelism guidelines by considering external memory access bandwidth, data reuse behaviors, FPGA resource availability, and DNN complexity. DNNBuilder is demonstrated on four DNNs (Alexnet, ZF, VGG16, and YOLO) on two FPGAs (XC7Z045 and KU115) corresponding to the edge- and cloud-computing, respectively. The fine-grained layer-based pipeline architecture and the column-based cache scheme contribute to 7.7x and 43x reduction of the latency and BRAM utilization compared to conventional designs. We achieve the best performance (up to 5.15x faster) and efficiency (up to 5.88x more efficient) compared to published FPGA-based classification-oriented DNN accelerators for both edge and cloud computing cases. We reach 4218 GOPS for running object detection DNN which is the highest throughput reported to the best of our knowledge. DNNBuilder can provide millisecond-scale real-time performance for processing HD video input and deliver higher efficiency (up to 4.35x) than the GPU-based solutions.","author":["Xiaofan Zhang","Junsong Wang","Chao Zhu","Yonghua Lin","Jinjun Xiong","Wen-mei Hwu","Deming Chen"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 56","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240801"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"J.

However, one of the common limitations found in these tools is that they cannot find a design point with large speedup for applications with variable loop bounds. The reason is that loops with variable loop bounds cannot be efficiently parallelized or pipelined with simple insertion of HLS directives. Also, making highly accurate prediction of cycles and resource consumption on the entire design space becomes a challenging task because of the inaccuracy of the HLS tool cycle prediction and the wide design space. In this paper we present an HLS-based FPGA optimization and DSE framework that produces a high-performance design even in the presence of variable loop bounds. We propose code transformations that increase the utilization of the compute resources for variable loops, including several computation patterns with loop-carried dependency such as floating-point reduction and prefix sum. In order to rapidly perform DSE with high accuracy, we describe a resource and cycle estimation model constructed from the information obtained from the actual HLS synthesis. Experiments on applications with variable loop bounds in Polybench benchmarks with Vivado HLS show that our framework improves the baseline implementation by 75X on average and outperforms current state-of-the-art DSE frameworks.","author":["Young-kyu Choi","Jason Cong"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 103","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240815"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"Amazon. 2018.

It has captured significant attention of academia, industries, and government bodies. Now, it has emerged as the backbone of modern economy by offering subscription-based services anytime, anywhere following a pay-as-you-go model. This has instigated (1) shorter establishment times for start-ups, (2) creation of scalable global enterprise applications, (3) better cost-to-value associativity for scientific and high-performance computing applications, and (4) different invocation/execution models for pervasive and ubiquitous applications. The recent technological developments and paradigms such as serverless computing, software-defined networking, Internet of Things, and processing at network edge are creating new opportunities for Cloud computing. However, they are also posing several new challenges and creating the need for new approaches and research strategies, as well as the re-evaluation of the models that were developed to address issues such as scalability, elasticity, reliability, security, sustainability, and application models. The proposed manifesto addresses them by identifying the major open challenges in Cloud computing, emerging trends, and impact areas. It then offers research directions for the next decade, thus helping in the realisation of Future Generation Cloud Computing.","author":["Rajkumar Buyya","Satish Narayana Srirama","Giuliano Casale","Rodrigo Calheiros","Yogesh Simmhan","Blesson Varghese","Erol Gelenbe","Bahman Javadi","Luis Miguel Vaquero","Marco A.

However, owing to privacy concerns, vision-based fall detection cannot be applied in such a scenario. In this poster, we propose ToiFall, a prototype for syncope detection in toilet environments. ToiFall collects Channel State Information (CSI) of commodity Wi-Fi devices. Different human movements form various textures on CSI images, and such textures can be used for feature extraction and classification. Experimental results show an accuracy of over 98% for fall detection with satisfying reliability.","author":["Ziqi Wang","Zhihao Gu","Junwei Yin","Zhe Chen","Yuedong Xu"],"issue":["UbiComp '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM International Joint Conference and 2018 International Symposium on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and Wearable Computers","October 2018","Pages   287\u2013290","https://doi.org/10.1145/3267305.3267650"],"date":"08 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Wenchang Cao, Xinhua Liu, and Fangmin Li, \"Robust device-free fall detection using fine-grained Wi-Fi signatures.\", Proc. of IEEE IAEAC, 2017: 1404--1408.","order":1},{"text":"Chih-Chung Chang, and Chih-Jen Lin, \"LIBSVM: a library for support vector machines.\", ACM TIST, 2011, 2(3): 27.","doi":"10.1145/1961189.1961199","order":2},{"text":"Jen-Yin Chang, Kuan-Ying Lee, Yu-Lin Wei, Kate Ching-Ju Lin, Winston Hsu, \"We Can 'See' You via Wi-Fi - WiFi Action Recognition via Vision-based Methods.\", arXiv preprint arXiv: 1608.05461 (2016).","order":3},{"text":"Daniel Halperin, et al., \"Tool release: Gathering 802.11n traces with channel state information.\" ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, 2011, 41(1): 53.","doi":"10.1145/1925861.1925870","order":4},{"text":"Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, et al., \"Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition.\", Proceedings of the IEEE CVPR, 2016: 770--778.","order":5},{"text":"Joji Inamasu, Kazuhiro Tomiyasu and Satoru Miyatake, et al., \"Clinical characteristics of stroke occurring in the toilet: Are older adults more vulnerable?.\", Geriatrics &amp; Gerontology International, 2018, 18(2): 250--255.","order":6},{"text":"Yuxi Wang, Kaishun Wu, and Lionel M.

This paper considers the knowledge graph as the source of side information. To address the limitations of existing embedding-based and path-based methods for knowledge-graph-aware recommendation, we propose RippleNet, an end-to-end framework that naturally incorporates the knowledge graph into recommender systems. Similar to actual ripples propagating on the water, RippleNet stimulates the propagation of user preferences over the set of knowledge entities by automatically and iteratively extending a user's potential interests along links in the knowledge graph. The multiple \"ripples\" activated by a user's historically clicked items are thus superposed to form the preference distribution of the user with respect to a candidate item, which could be used for predicting the final clicking probability. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that RippleNet achieves substantial gains in a variety of scenarios, including movie, book and news recommendation, over several state-of-the-art baselines.","author":["Hongwei Wang","Fuzheng Zhang","Jialin Wang","Miao Zhao","Wenjie Li","Xing Xie","Minyi Guo"],"issue":["CIKM '18: Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2018","Pages   417\u2013426","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271739"],"date":"17 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

We start by summarizing the fundamental deep techniques related to multimedia analytics, especially in the visual domain, and then review representative high-level tasks powered by recent advances. Moreover, the performance review of popular benchmarks gives a pathway to technology advancement and helps identify both milestone works and future directions.","author":["Wei Zhang","Ting Yao","Shiai Zhu","Abdulmotaleb El Saddik"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications","Volume 15","Issue 1s","January 2019","Article No.: 2","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/3279952"],"date":"24 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Peter Anderson, Basura Fernando, Mark Johnson, and Stephen Gould. 2016.

We make use the Convolutional Neural Network method to identify the hand gesture in a real time Android mobile application. For training the image dataset, we make use of MobileNet algorithm that have satisfied us with good result, on top of a Machine Learning Framework, TensorFlow. The percentage of success has been influenced by the image reference size and the optimizer algorithm.

Despite their success, there is a dearth of theoretical explorations of GCNN models such as their generalization properties. In this paper, we take a first step towards developing a deeper theoretical understanding of GCNN models by analyzing the stability of single-layer GCNN models and deriving their generalization guarantees in a semi-supervised graph learning setting. In particular, we show that the algorithmic stability of a GCNN model depends upon the largest absolute eigenvalue of its graph convolution filter. Moreover, to ensure the uniform stability needed to provide strong generalization guarantees, the largest absolute eigenvalue must be independent of the graph size. Our results shed new insights on the design of new & improved graph convolution filters with guaranteed algorithmic stability. We evaluate the generalization gap and stability on various real-world graph datasets and show that the empirical results indeed support our theoretical findings. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study stability bounds on graph learning in a semi-supervised setting and derive generalization bounds for GCNN models.","author":["Saurabh Verma","Zhi-Li Zhang"],"issue":["KDD '19: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2019","Pages   1539\u20131548","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292500.3330956"],"date":"25 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"Shivani Agarwal and Partha Niyogi. 2005.

Similar to traditional software, DNNs could exhibit incorrect behaviors, caused by hidden defects, leading to severe accidents and losses. In this paper, we propose DeepHunter, a coverage-guided fuzz testing framework for detecting potential defects of general-purpose DNNs. To this end, we first propose a metamorphic mutation strategy to generate new semantically preserved tests, and leverage multiple extensible coverage criteria as feedback to guide the test generation. We further propose a seed selection strategy that combines both diversity-based and recency-based seed selection. We implement and incorporate 5 existing testing criteria and 4 seed selection strategies in DeepHunter. Large-scale experiments demonstrate that (1) our metamorphic mutation strategy is useful to generate new valid tests with the same semantics as the original seed, by up to a 98% validity ratio; (2) the diversity-based seed selection generally weighs more than recency-based seed selection in boosting the coverage and in detecting defects; (3) DeepHunter outperforms the state of the arts by coverage as well as the quantity and diversity of defects identified; (4) guided by corner-region based criteria, DeepHunter is useful to capture defects during the DNN quantization for platform migration.","author":["Xiaofei Xie","Lei Ma","Felix Juefei-Xu","Minhui Xue","Hongxu Chen","Yang Liu","Jianjun Zhao","Bo Li","Jianxiong Yin","Simon See"],"issue":["ISSTA 2019: Proceedings of the 28th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis","July 2019","Pages   146\u2013157","https://doi.org/10.1145/3293882.3330579"],"date":"10 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"2018. libFuzzer.

The target is to simultaneously reduce the model storage size and accelerate the computation, with minor effect on accuracy. Two important categories of DNN model compression techniques are weight pruning and weight quantization. The former leverages the redundancy in the number of weights, whereas the latter leverages the redundancy in bit representation of weights. These two sources of redundancy can be combined, thereby leading to a higher degree of DNN model compression. However, a systematic framework of joint weight pruning and quantization of DNNs is lacking, thereby limiting the available model compression ratio. Moreover, the computation reduction, energy efficiency improvement, and hardware performance overhead need to be accounted besides simply model size reduction, and the hardware performance overhead resulted from weight pruning method needs to be taken into consideration. To address these limitations, we present ADMM-NN, the first algorithm-hardware co-optimization framework of DNNs using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), a powerful technique to solve non-convex optimization problems with possibly combinatorial constraints. The first part of ADMM-NN is a systematic, joint framework of DNN weight pruning and quantization using ADMM. It can be understood as a smart regularization technique with regularization target dynamically updated in each ADMM iteration, thereby resulting in higher performance in model compression than the state-of-the-art. The second part is hardware-aware DNN optimizations to facilitate hardware-level implementations. We perform ADMM-based weight pruning and quantization considering (i) the computation reduction and energy efficiency improvement, and (ii) the hardware performance overhead due to irregular sparsity. The first requirement prioritizes the convolutional layer compression over fully-connected layers, while the latter requires a concept of the break-even pruning ratio, defined as the minimum pruning ratio of a specific layer that results in no hardware performance degradation. Without accuracy loss, ADMM-NN achieves 85\u00d7 and 24\u00d7 pruning on LeNet-5 and AlexNet models, respectively, --- significantly higher than the state-of-the-art. The improvements become more significant when focusing on computation reduction. Combining weight pruning and quantization, we achieve 1,910\u00d7 and 231\u00d7 reductions in overall model size on these two benchmarks, when focusing on data storage. Highly promising results are also observed on other representative DNNs such as VGGNet and ResNet-50.

We identify a unique challenge that arises in MANNs due to soft reads and writes to the differentiable memory, each of which requires access to all the memory locations. This characteristic of MANN workloads severely limits the performance of MANNs on CPUs, GPUs, and classical neural network accelerators. We present the first effort to design a hardware architecture that improves the efficiency of MANNs. Leveraging the intrinsic ability of resistive crossbars to efficiently realize in-memory computations, we propose X-MANN, a memory-centric crossbar-based architecture that is specialized to match the compute characteristics observed in MANNs. We design a transposable crossbar processing unit that can efficiently perform the different computational kernels of MANNs. To improve performance of soft writes in X-MANN, we propose an incremental write mechanism that leverages the characteristics of soft write operations. We develop an architectural simulator for X-MANN that utilizes array-level timing and power models of resistive crossbars calibrated from SPICE simulations. Across a suite of MANN benchmarks, X-MANN achieves 23.7\u00d7-45.7\u00d7 speedup and 75.1\u00d7-267.1\u00d7 reduction in energy over state-of-the-art GPU implementations.","author":["Ashish Ranjan","Shubham Jain","Jacob R.

The genesis of serverless computing can be traced back to the fundamental need of enabling a programmer to singularly focus on writing application code in a high-level language and isolating all facets of system management (for example, but not limited to, instance selection, scaling, deployment, logging, monitoring, fault tolerance and so on). This is particularly critical in light of today's, increasingly tightening, time-to-market constraints. Currently, serverless computing is supported by leading public cloud vendors, such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Cloud Functions and others. While this is an important step in the right direction, there are many challenges going forward. For instance, but not limited to, how to enable support for dynamic optimization, how to extend support for stateful computation, how to efficiently bin-pack applications, how to support hardware heterogeneity (this will be key especially in light of the emergence of hardware accelerators for deep learning workloads). Inspired by Picasso's Le Taureau, in the tutorial proposed herein, we shall deconstruct evolution of serverless --- the overarching intent being to facilitate better understanding of the serverless landscape. This, we hope, would help push the innovation frontier on both fronts, the paradigm itself and the applications built atop of it.","author":["Anurag Khandelwal","Arun Kejariwal","Karthikeyan Ramasamy"],"issue":["SIGMOD '20: Proceedings of the 2020 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","June 2020","Pages   2641\u20132650","https://doi.org/10.1145/3318464.3383130"],"date":"11 June 2020","ref":[{"text":"C.

Most previous studies have focused on mining HUIs in transactional databases and did not consider the spatiotemporal characteristics of items. In this study, a more flexible model of spatial HUIs (SHUIs) that exist in spatiotemporal databases is proposed. In a spatiotemporal database (STD), an itemset is said to be an SHUI if its utility is not less than a user-specified minimum utility and the distance between any two of its items is not more than a user-specified maximum distance. Identifying SHUIs is very challenging because the generated itemsets do not satisfy the anti-monotonic property. In this study, we present two novel pruning techniques for reducing computational costs. Moreover, a fast single scan algorithm is presented for effectively evaluating all SHUIs in a STD. Furthermore, two case studies are presented, in which the proposed model is used to identify useful information in traffic congestion data and air pollution data.","author":["R.

People have reported misbehavior of computer vision models, including offensive prediction results and lower performance for underrepresented groups. Current computer vision models are typically developed using datasets consisting of manually annotated images or videos; the data and label distributions in these datasets are critical to the models' behavior. In this paper, we examine ImageNet, a large-scale ontology of images that has spurred the development of many modern computer vision methods. We consider three key factors within the person subtree of ImageNet that may lead to problematic behavior in downstream computer vision technology: (1) the stagnant concept vocabulary of WordNet, (2) the attempt at exhaustive illustration of all categories with images, and (3) the inequality of representation in the images within concepts. We seek to illuminate the root causes of these concerns and take the first steps to mitigate them constructively.","author":["Kaiyu Yang","Klint Qinami","Li Fei-Fei","Jia Deng","Olga Russakovsky"],"issue":["FAT* '20: Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","January 2020","Pages   547\u2013558","https://doi.org/10.1145/3351095.3375709"],"date":"27 January 2020","ref":[{"text":"U.S. House. 101st Congress, 2nd Session. 101 H.R. 2273. 1990.

However, the existing scheduling mechanisms of serverless platforms fall short in catering to the unique characteristics of such applications: burstiness, short and variable execution times, statelessness and use of a single core. Specifically, the existing mechanisms fall short in meeting the requirements generated due to the combined effect of these characteristics: scheduling at a scale of millions of function invocations per second while achieving predictable performance. In this paper, we argue for a cluster-level centralized and core-granular scheduler for serverless functions. By maintaining a global view of the cluster resources, the centralized approach eliminates queue imbalances while the core granularity reduces interference; together these properties enable reduced performance variability. We expect such a scheduler to increase the adoption of serverless computing platforms by various latency and throughput sensitive applications.","author":["Kostis Kaffes","Neeraja J.

Entity alignment is the key step towards knowledge graph integration from multiple sources. It aims to identify entities across different knowledge graphs that refer to the same real world entity. However, current entity alignment systems overlook the sparsity of different knowledge graphs and can not align multi-type entities by one single model. In this paper, we present a Collective Graph neural network for Multi-type entity Alignment, called CG-MuAlign. Different from previous work, CG-MuAlign jointly aligns multiple types of entities, collectively leverages the neighborhood information and generalizes to unlabeled entity types. Specifically, we propose novel collective aggregation function tailored for this task, that (1) relieves the incompleteness of knowledge graphs via both cross-graph and self attentions, (2) scales up efficiently with mini-batch training paradigm and effective neighborhood sampling strategy. We conduct experiments on real world knowledge graphs with millions of entities and observe the superior performance beyond existing methods. In addition, the running time of our approach is much less than the current state-of-the-art deep learning methods.","author":["Qi Zhu","Hao Wei","Bunyamin Sisman","Da Zheng","Christos Faloutsos","Xin Luna Dong","Jiawei Han"],"issue":["WWW '20: Proceedings of The Web Conference 2020","April 2020","Pages   2241\u20132252","https://doi.org/10.1145/3366423.3380289"],"date":"20 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"Rami Al-Rfou, Bryan Perozzi, and Dustin Zelle. 2019.

In this article, we extend our previous work to prove that our HD circuit is scalable, tolerant to memristor model variability, and tolerant to device-to-device variation. We showed that the operation of our circuit under non-ideal fabrication conditions changes slightly, decreasing the correct classification rates for the MNIST handwritten digits dataset by <1%. Our circuit\u2019s operation is independent of the memristor model used, as long as the model allows a reverse current. Because we leverage in-memory parallel computing, our circuit is n\u00d7 faster than other HD circuits, where n is the number of HDs to be computed, and it consumes \u2248100\u00d7 \u2212 1,000\u00d7 less power compared to other memristive and CMOS HD circuits. Used in a full HD Associative Content Addressable Memory (ACAM), the proposed HD circuit consumes only 2.2% of the total system power.

The computational capability of traditional hardware platforms cannot accommodate the growth of model complexity. Among recent technologies to accelerate DNN, resistive memory (ReRAM)-based processing-in-memory (PIM) emerged as a promising solution for DNN inference due to its high efficiency for matrix-based computation. We face two major technical challenges in extending the use of ReRAM-based accelerators for training: (1) full-precision data is essential in back-propagation; (2) the need to support both feed-forward and back-propagation aggravates the data-movement burden. We propose a heterogeneous architecture named as 3D-ReG, which leverages full-precision GPU to ensure training accuracy and low-overhead 3D integration to provide low-cost data movements. Moreover, we introduce conservative and aggressive task-mapping schemes, which partition the computation phases in different ways to balance execution efficiency and training accuracy. We evaluate 3D-ReG implemented with two 3D integration technologies, through-silicon vias (TSVs) and monolithic inter-tier vias (MIVs), and compare them with GPU-only and PIM-only counterparts. Various GPU-only platforms using two main-memory technologies (DRAM, ReRAM) and three interconnect technologies (2D, TSV, MIV) are evaluated as well. Experimental results show that 3D-ReG can achieve on average 5.64\u00d7 training speedup and 3.56\u00d7 higher energy efficiency compared with the GPU with DRAM as main memory, at the cost of 0.05%\u20133.39% accuracy drop. We define a new metric, gain-loss ratio (GLR), which quantitatively evaluates the capability of a DNN training hardware in terms of the model accuracy and hardware efficiency. The results of our comparison show that the aggressive task-mapping scheme on MIV-based 3D-ReG outperforms the other methods.","author":["Bing Li","Janardhan Rao Doppa","Partha Pratim Pande","Krishnendu Chakrabarty","Joe X.

Either they adopt a generic reusable architecture to support different DNN networks but leave some performance and efficiency on the table because of the sacrifice of design specificity. Or they apply a layer-wise tailor-made architecture to optimize layer-specific demands for computation and resources but loose the scalability of adaptation to a wide range of DNN networks. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a novel FPGA-based DNN accelerator design paradigm and its automation tool, called DNNExplorer, to enable fast exploration of various accelerator designs under the proposed paradigm and deliver optimized accelerator architectures for existing and emerging DNN networks. Three key techniques are essential for DNNExplorer's improved performance, better specificity, and scalability, including (1) a unique accelerator design paradigm with both high-dimensional design space support and fine-grained adjustability, (2) a dynamic design space to accommodate different combinations of DNN workloads and targeted FPGAs, and (3) a design space exploration (DSE) engine to generate optimized accelerator architectures following the proposed paradigm by simultaneously considering both FPGAs' computation and memory resources and DNN networks' layer-wise characteristics and overall complexity. Experimental results show that, for the same FPGAs, accelerators generated by DNNExplorer can deliver up to 4.2x higher performances (GOP/s) than the state-of-the-art layer-wise pipelined solutions generated by DNNBuilder [1] for VGG-like DNN with 38 CONV layers. Compared to accelerators with generic reusable computation units, DNNExplorer achieves up to 2.0x and 4.4x DSP efficiency improvement than a recently published accelerator design from academia (HybridDNN [2]) and a commercial DNN accelerator IP (Xilinx DPU [3]), respectively.","author":["Xiaofan Zhang","Hanchen Ye","Junsong Wang","Yonghua Lin","Jinjun Xiong","Wen-mei Hwu","Deming Chen"],"issue":["ICCAD '20: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2020","Article No.: 61","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/3400302.3415609"],"date":"02 November 2020","ref":[{"text":"Xiaofan Zhang et al.

Transformer is also computationally and memory intensive and demands for a hardware acceleration solution. Although researchers have successfully applied ReRAM-based Processing-in-Memory (PIM) to accelerate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the unique computation process of the scaled dot-product attention in Transformer makes it difficult to directly apply these designs. Besides, how to handle intermediate results in Matrix-matrix Multiplication (MatMul) and how to design a pipeline at a finer granularity of Transformer remain unsolved. In this work, we propose ReTransformer - a ReRAM-based PIM architecture for Transformer acceleration. ReTransformer can not only accelerate the scaled dot-product attention of Transformer using ReRAM-based PIM but also eliminate some data dependency by avoiding writing the intermediate results using the proposed matrix decomposition technique. Moreover, we propose a new sub-matrix pipeline design for multi-head self-attention. Experimental results show that compared to GPU and Pipelayer, ReTransformer improves computing efficiency by 23.21\u00d7 and 3.25\u00d7, respectively. The corresponding overall power is reduced by 1086\u00d7 and 2.82\u00d7, respectively.","author":["Xiaoxuan Yang","Bonan Yan","Hai Li","Yiran Chen"],"issue":["ICCAD '20: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2020","Article No.: 92","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/3400302.3415640"],"date":"02 November 2020","ref":[{"text":"Karim Ahmed, Nitish Shirish Keskar, and Richard Socher. 2017.

With the growing heterogeneity and complexity of computer systems (CPU cores and accelerators, etc.), efficiently integrating emerging memories into existing systems poses new challenges and requires detailed evaluation in a realistic computing environment. In this article, we propose MEG, an open source, configurable, cycle-exact, and RISC-V-based full-system emulation infrastructure using FPGA and HBM. MEG provides a highly modular hardware design and includes a bootable Linux image for a realistic software flow, so that users can perform cross-layer software-hardware co-optimization in a full-system environment. To improve the observability and debuggability of the system, MEG also provides a flexible performance monitoring scheme to guide the performance optimization. The proposed MEG infrastructure can potentially benefit broad communities across computer architecture, system software, and application software. Leveraging MEG, we present two cross-layer system optimizations as illustrative cases to demonstrate the usability of MEG. In the first case study, we present a reconfigurable memory controller to improve the address mapping of standard memory controller. This reconfigurable memory controller along with its OS support allows us to optimize the address mapping scheme to fully exploit the massive parallelism provided by the emerging three-dimensional (3D) memories. In the second case study, we present a lightweight IOMMU design to tackle the unique challenges brought by 3D memory in providing virtual memory support for near-memory accelerators. We provide a prototype implementation of MEG on a Xilinx VU37P FPGA and demonstrate its capability, fidelity, and flexibility on real-world benchmark applications. We hope MEG fills a gap in the space of publicly available FPGA-based full-system emulation infrastructures, specifically targeting memory systems, and inspires further collaborative software/hardware innovations.","author":["Jialiang Zhang","Yue Zha","Nicholas Beckwith","Bangya Liu","Jing Li"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 13","Issue 4","October 2020","Article No.: 19","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/3409114"],"date":"30 September 2020","ref":[{"text":"Jiyoung Kim, Augustin J.

This paper proposes Last-Touch Predictors (LTPs) that learn and predict the \u201clast touch\u201d to a memory block by one processor before the block is accessed and subsequently invalidated by another. By predicting a last-touch and (self-)invalidating the block in advance, an LTP hides the invalidation time, significantly reducing the coherence overhead. The key behind accurate last-touch prediction is trace-based correlation, associating a last-touch with the sequence of instructions (i.e., a trace) touching the block from a coherence miss until the block is invalidated. Correlating instructions enables an LTP to identify a last-touch to a memory block uniquely throughout an application's execution.In this paper, we use results from running shared-memory applications on a simulated DSM to evaluate LTPs. The results indicate that: (1) our base case LTP design, maintaining trace signatures on a per-block basis, substantially improves prediction accuracy over previous self-invalidation schemes to an average of 79%; (2) our alternative LTP design, maintaining a global trace signature table, reduces storage overhead but only achieves an average accuracy of 58%; (3) last-touch prediction based on a single instruction only achieves an average accuracy of 41% due to instruction reuse within and across computation; and (4) LTP enables selective, accurate, and timely self-invalidation in DSM, speeding up program execution on average by 11%.","author":["An-Chow Lai","Babak Falsafi"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 28","Issue 2","May 2000","pp   139\u2013148","https://doi.org/10.1145/342001.339669"],"date":"01 May 2000","ref":[{"text":"H.

In a simplified form, this information is stored in a tree of \u201crays\u201d extending from the viewer to the first surface encountered and from there to other surfaces and to the light sources. A visible surface algorithm creates this tree for each pixel of the display and passes it to the shader. The shader then traverses the tree to determine the intensity of the light received by the viewer. Consideration of all of these factors allows the shader to accurately simulate true reflection, shadows, and refraction, as well as the effects simulated by conventional shaders. Anti-aliasing is included as an integral part of the visibility calculations.

As a consequence, many new evolutionary-based approaches and variations of existing techniques have recently been published in the technical literature. The purpose of this paper is to summarize and organize the information on these current approaches, emphasizing the importance of analyzing the operations research techniques in which most of them are based, in an attempt to motivate researchers to look into these mathematical programming approaches for new ways of exploiting the search capabilities of evolutionary algorithms. Furthermore, a summary of the main algorithms behind these approaches is provided, together with a brief criticism that includes their advantages and disadvantages, degree of applicability, and some known applications. Finally, further trends in this area and some possible paths for further research are also addressed.","author":["Carlos A.

By using an extension of traditional structure information, or a geometric hierarchy, five significant improvements to current techniques are possible. First, the range of complexity of an environment is greatly increased while the visible complexity of any given scene is kept within a fixed upper limit. Second, a meaningful way is provided to vary the amount of detail presented in a scene. Third, \u201cclipping\u201d becomes a very fast logarithmic search for the resolvable parts of the environment within the field of view. Fourth, frame to frame coherence and clipping define a graphical \u201cworking set,\u201d or fraction of the total structure that should be present in primary store for immediate access by the visible surface algorithm. Finally, the geometric structure suggests a recursive descent, visible surface algorithm in which the computation time potentially grows linearly with the visible complexity of the scene.","author":["James H.

A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information.Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.","author":["E. F.

This speculation proved justified when Peter Shor described a polynomial time quantum algorithm for factoring intergers.In quantum systems, the computational space increases exponentially with the size of the system, which enables exponential parallelism. This parallelism could lead to exponentially faster quantum algorithms than possible classically. The catch is that accessing the results, which requires measurement, proves tricky and requires new nontraditional programming techniques.The aim of this paper is to guide computer  scientists through the barriers that separate quantum computing from conventional computing. We introduce basic principles of quantum mechanics to explain where the power of quantum computers comes from and why it is difficult to harness. We describe quantum cryptography, teleportation, and dense coding. Various approaches to exploiting the power of quantum parallelism are explained.

An exciting new storage technology based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) is poised to fill a large portion of this performance gap, significantly reduce system power consumption, and enable many new applications. This paper explores the system-level implications of integrating MEMS-based storage into the memory hierarchy. Results show that standalone MEMS-based storage reduces I/O stall times by 4-74X over disks and improves overall application runtimes by 1.9-4.4X. When used as on-board caches for disks, MEMS-based storage improves I/O response time by up to 3.5X. Further, the energy consumption of MEMS-based storage is 10-54X less than that of state-of-the-art low-power disk drives. The combination of the high-level physical characteristics of MEMS-based storage (small footprints, high shock tolerance) and the ability to directly integrate MEMS-based storage with processing leads to such new applications as portable gigabit storage systems and ubiquitous active storage nodes.","author":["Steven W.

Two-level branch predictors have been shown to achieve high prediction accuracy. It has also been shown that branch interference is a major contributor to the number of branches mispredicted by two-level predictors.This paper presents a new method to reduce the interference problem called agree prediction, which reduces the chance that two branches aliasing the same PHT entry will interfere negatively. We evaluate the performance of this scheme using full traces (both user and supervisor) of the SPECint95 benchmarks. The result is a reduction in the misprediction rate of gcc ranging from 8.62% with a 64K-entry PHT up to 33.3% with a 1K-entry PHT.","author":["Eric Sprangle","Robert S.

Given a workload for System R (consisting of a set of SQL statements and their execution frequencies), DBDSGN suggests physical configurations for efficient performance. Each configuration consists of a set of indices and an ordering for each table. Workload statements are evaluated only for atomic configurations of indices, which have only one index per table. Costs for any configuration can be obtained from those of the atomic configurations. DBDSGN uses information supplied by the System R optimizer both to determine which columns might be worth indexing and to obtain estimates of the cost of executing statements in different configurations. The tool finds efficient solutions to the index-selection problem; if we assume the cost estimates supplied by the optimizer are the actual execution costs, it finds the optimal solution. Optionally, heuristics can be used to reduce execution time. The approach taken by DBDSGN in solving the index-selection problem for multiple-table statements significantly reduces the complexity of the problem. DBDSGN's principles were used in the Relational Design Tool (RDT), an IBM product based on DBDSGN, which performs design for SQL/DS, a relational system based on System R. System R actually uses DBDSGN's suggested solutions as the tool expects because cost estimates and other necessary information can be obtained from System R using a new SQL statement, the EXPLAIN statement. This illustrates how a system can export a model of its internal assumptions and behavior so that other systems (such as tools) can share this model.","author":["S. Finkelstein","M. Schkolnick","P.

This problem deviates from the well-known file allocation problem in several aspects. First, the objects to be allocated are not known a priori; second, these objects are accessed by schedules that contain transmissions between objects to produce the result. A model that makes it possible to compare the cost of allocations is presented; the cost can be computed for different cost functions and for processing schedules produced by arbitrary query processing algorithms.For minimizing the total transmission cost, a method is proposed to determine the fragments to be allocated from the relations in the conceptual schema and the queries and updates executed by the users.For the same cost function, the complexity of the data allocation problem is investigated. Methods for obtaining optimal and heuristic solutions under various ways of computing the cost of an allocation are presented and compared.Two different approaches to the allocation management problem are presented and their merits are discussed.","author":["Peter M.

The analysis uses only the steady-state average values of the variables. The solution to the model is given by a cubic, which has exactly one valid root for the range of parametric values that is of interest. The model's predictions agree well with simulation results for transactions that require up to twenty locks. The model separates data contention from resource contention, thus facilitating an analysis of their separate effects and their interaction. It shows that systems with a particular form of nonuniform access, or with shared locks, are equivalent to systems with uniform access and only exclusive locks.Blocking due to conflicts is found to impose an upper bound on transaction throughput; this fact leads to a rule of thumb on how much data contention should be permitted in a system. Throughput can exceed this bound if a transaction is restarted whenever it encounters a conflict, provided restart costs and resource contention are low. It can also be exceeded by making transactions predeclare their locks. Raising the multiprogramming level to increase throughput also raises the number of restarts per  completion. Transactions should minimize their lock requests, because data contention is proportional to the square of the number of requests. The choice of how much data to lock at a time depends on which part of a general granularity curve the system sees.","author":["Y. C. Tay","Nathan Goodman","R.

The volume of choices that need to be made is massive, and many choices have unforeseen interactions. Storage system design is tedious and complicated to do by hand, usually leading to solutions that are grossly over-provisioned, substantially under-performing or, in the worst case, both.To solve the configuration nightmare, we present minerva: a suite of tools for designing storage systems automatically. Minerva uses declarative specifications of application requirements and device capabilities; constraint-based formulations of the various sub-problems; and optimization techniques to explore the search space of possible solutions.This paper also explores and evaluates the design decisions that went into Minerva, using specialized micro- and macro-benchmarks. We show that Minerva can successfully handle a workload with substantial complexity (a decision-support database benchmark). Minerva created a 16-disk design in only a few minutes that achieved the same performance as a 30-disk system manually designed by human experts. Of equal importance, Minerva was able to predict the resulting system's performance before it was built.","author":["Guillermo A. Alvarez","Elizabeth Borowsky","Susie Go","Theodore H.

The model takes into account the vulnerability of the information to a security breach and the potential loss should such a breach occur. It is shown that for a given potential loss, a firm should not necessarily focus its investments on information sets with the highest vulnerability. Since extremely vulnerable information sets may be inordinately expensive to protect, a firm may be better off concentrating its efforts on information sets with midrange vulnerabilities. The analysis further suggests that to maximize the expected benefit from investment to protect information, a firm should spend only a small fraction of the expected loss due to a security breach.","author":["Lawrence A.

Applying SLM techniques like trigram language models to Chinese is challenging because (1) there is no standard definition of words in Chinese; (2) word boundaries are not marked by spaces; and (3) there is a dearth of training data. Our unified approach automatically and consistently gathers a high-quality training data set from the Web, creates a high-quality lexicon, segments the training data using this lexicon, and compresses the language model, all by using the maximum likelihood principle, which is consistent with trigram model training. We show that each of the methods leads to improvements over standard SLM, and that the combined method yields the best pinyin conversion result reported.","author":["Jianfeng Gao","Joshua Goodman","Mingjing Li","Kai-Fu Lee"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing","Volume 1","Issue 1","March 2002","pp   3\u201333","https://doi.org/10.1145/595576.595578"],"date":"01 March 2002","ref":[{"text":"BERTON, A., FETTER P., AND REGEL-BRIETZMANN, P. 1996.

This article presents an approach for automated abstraction that allows designers to \"zoom out\" on class diagrams to investigate and reason about their bigger picture. The approach is based on a large number of abstraction rules that individually are not very powerful, but when used together, can abstract complex class structures quickly. This article presents those abstraction rules and an algorithm for applying them. The technique was validated on over a dozen models where it was shown to be well suited for model understanding, consistency checking, and reverse engineering.","author":["Alexander Egyed"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology","Volume 11","Issue 4","October 2002","pp   449\u2013491","https://doi.org/10.1145/606612.606616"],"date":"01 October 2002","ref":[{"text":"Abi-Antoun, M., Ho, J., and Kwan, J. 1999.

E-mail and news articles are two natural examples of such streams, each characterized by topics that appear, grow in intensity for a period of time, and then fade away. The published literature in a particular research field can be seen to exhibit similar phenomena over a much longer time scale. Underlying much of the text mining work in this area is the following intuitive premise --- that the appearance of a topic in a document stream is signaled by a \"burst of activity,\" with certain features rising sharply in frequency as the topic emerges.The goal of the present work is to develop a formal approach for modeling such \"bursts,\" in such a way that they can be robustly and efficiently identified, and can provide an organizational framework for analyzing the underlying content. The approach is based on modeling the stream using an infinite-state automaton, in which bursts appear naturally as state transitions; in some ways, it can be viewed as drawing an analogy with models from queueing theory for bursty network traffic. The resulting algorithms are highly efficient, and yield a nested representation of the set of bursts that imposes a hierarchical structure on the overall stream. Experiments with e-mail and research paper archives suggest that the resulting structures have a natural meaning in terms of the content that gave rise to them.","author":["Jon Kleinberg"],"issue":["KDD '02: Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","July 2002","Pages   91\u2013101","https://doi.org/10.1145/775047.775061"],"date":"23 July 2002","ref":[{"text":"R.

Such circuits are of interest in quantum computing, optical computing, nanotechnology and low-power CMOS design. Synthesis approaches are not well developed for reversible circuits even for small numbers of inputs and outputs.In this paper, a transformation based algorithm for the synthesis of such a reversible circuit in terms of n \u00d7 n Toffoli gates is presented. Initially, a circuit is constructed by a single pass through the specification with minimal look-ahead and no back-tracking. Reduction rules are then applied by simple template matching. The method produces near-optimal results for 3-input circuits and also produces very good results for larger problems.","author":["D. Michael Miller","Dmitri Maslov","Gerhard W.

Our goal is to synthesize a complete, visually plausible and coherent image. The visible parts of the image serve as a training set to infer the unknown parts. Our method iteratively approximates the unknown regions and composites adaptive image fragments into the image. Values of an inverse matte are used to compute a confidence map and a level set that direct an incremental traversal within the unknown area from high to low confidence. In each step, guided by a fast smooth approximation, an image fragment is selected from the most similar and frequent examples. As the selected fragments are composited, their likelihood increases along with the mean confidence of the image, until reaching a complete image. We demonstrate our method by completion of photographs and paintings.","author":["Iddo Drori","Daniel Cohen-Or","Hezy Yeshurun"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 22","Issue 3","July 2003","pp   303\u2013312","https://doi.org/10.1145/882262.882267"],"date":"01 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"ASHIKHMIN, M. 2001.

We introduce a fast inside-outside test to check whether surfels lie within the bounds of another surfel-bounded solid. This enables us to add, subtract and intersect complex solids at interactive rates. Our algorithm is fast both in displaying and constructing the new geometry resulting from the boolean operation.We present a resampling operator to solve problems resulting from sharp edges in the resulting solid. The operator resamples the surfels intersecting with the surface of the other solid. This enables us to represent the sharp edges with great detail.We believe our algorithm to be an ideal tool for interactive editing of free-form solids.","author":["Bart Adams","Philip Dutr\u00e9"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 22","Issue 3","July 2003","pp   651\u2013656","https://doi.org/10.1145/882262.882320"],"date":"01 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"ADAMS, B., AND DUTR\u00c9, P. 2003.

Those capabilities have been very limited because the resources on such devices are extremely scarce; small amounts of memory, little bandwidth, little chip area dedicated for special purposes, and limited power consumption. The small display resolutions present a further challenge; the angle subtended by a pixel is relatively large, and therefore reasonably high quality rendering is needed to generate high fidelity images.To increase the mobile rendering capabilities, we propose a new hardware architecture for rasterizing textured triangles. Our architecture focuses on saving memory bandwidth, since an external memory access typically is one of the most energy-consuming operations, and because mobile phones need to use as little power as possible. Therefore, our system includes three new key innovations: I) an inexpensive multisampling scheme that gives relatively high quality at the same cost of previous inexpensive schemes, II) a texture minification system, including texture compression, which gives quality relatively close to trilinear mipmapping at the cost of 1.33 32-bit memory accesses on average, III) a scanline-based culling scheme that avoids a significant amount of z-buffer reads, and that only requires one context. Software simulations show that these three innovations together significantly reduce the memory bandwidth, and thus also the power consumption.","author":["Tomas Akenine-M\u00f6ller","Jacob Str\u00f6m"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 22","Issue 3","July 2003","pp   801\u2013808","https://doi.org/10.1145/882262.882348"],"date":"01 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"AKENINE-M\u00d6ller, T., AND HAINES, E. 2002.

Positive semantic orientation indicates praise (e.g., \"honest\", \"intrepid\") and negative semantic orientation indicates criticism (e.g., \"disturbing\", \"superfluous\"). Semantic orientation varies in both direction (positive or negative) and degree (mild to strong). An automated system for measuring semantic orientation would have application in text classification, text filtering, tracking opinions in online discussions, analysis of survey responses, and automated chat systems (chatbots). This article introduces a method for inferring the semantic orientation of a word from its statistical association with a set of positive and negative paradigm words. Two instances of this approach are evaluated, based on two different statistical measures of word association: pointwise mutual information (PMI) and latent semantic analysis (LSA). The method is experimentally tested with 3,596 words (including adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) that have been manually labeled positive (1,614 words) and negative (1,982 words). The method attains an accuracy of 82.8% on the full test set, but the accuracy rises above 95% when the algorithm is allowed to abstain from classifying mild words.","author":["Peter D.

Critical to the 802.11 MAC operation, is the handoff function which occurs when a mobile node moves its association from one access point to another. In this paper, we present an empirical study of this handoff process at the link layer, with a detailed breakup of the latency into various components. In particular, we show that a MAC layer function - probe is the primary contributor to the overall handoff latency. In our study, we observe that the latency is significant enough to affect the quality of service for many applications (or network connections). Further we find variations in the latency from one hand-off to another as well as with APs and STAs used from different vendors. Finally, we discuss optimizations on the probe phase which can potentially reduce the probe latency by as much as 98% (and a minimum of 12% in our experiments). Based on the study, we draw some guidelines for future handoff schemes.","author":["Arunesh Mishra","Minho Shin","William Arbaugh"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 33","Issue 2","April 2003","pp   93\u2013102","https://doi.org/10.1145/956981.956990"],"date":"01 April 2003","ref":[{"text":"Host AP driver for Intersil Prism Cards.

We present a technique for using solid-state storage as a caching layer between RAM and hard disks in database management systems. By caching data that is accessed frequently, disk I/O is reduced. For random I/O, the potential performance gains are particularly significant. Our system continuously monitors the disk access patterns to identify hot regions of the disk. Temperature statistics are maintained at the granularity of an extent, i.e., 32 pages, and are kept current through an aging mechanism. Unlike prior caching methods, once the SSD is populated with pages from warm regions cold pages are not admitted into the cache, leading to low levels of cache pollution. Simulations based on DB2 I/O traces, and a prototype implementation within DB2 both show substantial performance improvements.","author":["Mustafa Canim","George A.

The classical iterator style query processing technique is very simple and exible, but shows poor performance on modern CPUs due to lack of locality and frequent instruction mispredictions. Several techniques like batch oriented processing or vectorized tuple processing have been proposed in the past to improve this situation, but even these techniques are frequently out-performed by hand-written execution plans.In this work we present a novel compilation strategy that translates a query into compact and efficient machine code using the LLVM compiler framework. By aiming at good code and data locality and predictable branch layout the resulting code frequently rivals the performance of hand-written C++ code. We integrated these techniques into the HyPer main memory database system and show that this results in excellent query performance while requiring only modest compilation time.","author":["Thomas Neumann"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 4","Issue 9","June 2011","pp   539\u2013550","https://doi.org/10.14778/2002938.2002940"],"date":"01 June 2011","ref":[{"text":"P.

In addition, existing monitoring-based storage management by access pattern detections has difficulties to handle workloads that are highly dynamic and concurrent. To achieve high performance by best utilizing heterogeneous storage devices, we have designed and implemented a heterogeneity-aware software framework for DBMS storage management called hStorage-DB, where semantic information that is critical for storage I/O is identified and passed to the storage manager. According to the collected semantic information, requests are classified into different types. Each type is assigned a proper QoS policy supported by the underlying storage system, so that every request will be served with a suitable storage device. With hStorage-DB, we can well utilize semantic information that cannot be detected through data access monitoring but is particularly important for a hybrid storage system. To show the effectiveness of hStorage-DB, we have implemented a system prototype that consists of an I/O request classification enabled DBMS, and a hybrid storage system that is organized into a two-level caching hierarchy. Our performance evaluation shows that hStorage-DB can automatically make proper decisions for data allocation in different storage devices and make substantial performance improvements in a cost-efficient way.","author":["Tian Luo","Rubao Lee","Michael Mesnier","Feng Chen","Xiaodong Zhang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 5","Issue 10","June 2012","pp   1076\u20131087","https://doi.org/10.14778/2336664.2336679"],"date":"01 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIM.","order":1},{"text":"http://www.tpc.org/tpch.","order":2},{"text":"Mustafa Canim, Bishwaranjan Bhattacharjee, George A.

The I/O characteristics of Flash memories have significant impact on database systems and many algorithms and approaches taking advantage of those have been proposed recently. Nonetheless on system level Flash storage devices are still treated as HDD compatible block devices, black boxes and fast HDD replacements. This backwards compatibility (both software and hardware) masks the native behaviour, incurs significant complexity and decreases I/O performance, making it non-robust and unpredictable. Database systems have a long tradition of operating directly on RAW storage natively, utilising the physical characteristics of storage media to improve performance.In this paper we demonstrate an approach called NoFTL that goes a step further. We show that allowing for native Flash access and integrating parts of the FTL functionality into the database system yields significant performance increase and simplification of the I/O stack. We created a real-time data-driven Flash emulator and integrated it accordingly into Shore-MT. We demonstrate a performance improvement of up to 3.7\u00d7 compared to Shore-MT on RAW block-device Flash storage under various TPC workloads.","author":["Sergej Hardock","Ilia Petrov","Robert Gottstein","Alejandro Buchmann"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 12","August 2013","pp   1278\u20131281","https://doi.org/10.14778/2536274.2536295"],"date":"01 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"Going beyond ssd: The fusionio software defined flash memory approach, 2013. www.fusionio.com/white-papers/beyond-ssd/.","order":1},{"text":"Noftl demo preview. http://dblab.reutlingen-university.de/tl_ files/downloads/demo_noftl.mp4, 2013.","order":2},{"text":"Shoremt storage engine. http://diaswww.epfl.ch/shore-mt/, 2013.","order":3},{"text":"N.

SCM is byte-addressable and exhibits latencies similar to those of DRAM, while being non-volatile. Hence, SCM could replace both main memory and storage, enabling a novel single-level database architecture without the traditional I/O bottleneck. Fail-safe persistent SCM allocation can be considered conditio sine qua non for enabling this novel architecture paradigm for database management systems. In this paper we present PAllocator, a fail-safe persistent SCM allocator whose design emphasizes high concurrency and capacity scalability. Contrary to previous works, PAllocator thoroughly addresses the important challenge of persistent memory fragmentation by implementing an efficient defragmentation algorithm. We show that PAllocator outperforms state-of-the-art persistent allocators by up to one order of magnitude, both in operation throughput and recovery time, and enables up to 2.39x higher operation throughput on a persistent B-Tree.","author":["Ismail Oukid","Daniel Booss","Adrien Lespinasse","Wolfgang Lehner","Thomas Willhalm","Gr\u00e9goire Gomes"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 11","August 2017","pp   1166\u20131177","https://doi.org/10.14778/3137628.3137629"],"date":"01 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer Manuals. http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-isa-extensions.","order":1},{"text":"NVML Library. http://pmem.io/nvml/.","order":2},{"text":"J.

Most of the existing enterprise relational data management systems such as SAP HANA have their internal architecture based on the inherent assumption that memory is volatile and base their persistence on explicit handling of block-oriented storage devices. In this paper, we present the early adoption of Non-Volatile Memory within the SAP HANA Database, from the architectural and technical angles. We discuss our architectural choices, dive deeper into a few challenges of the NVRAM integration and their solutions, and share our experimental results. As we present our solutions for the NVRAM integration, we also give, as a basis, a detailed description of the relevant HANA internals.","author":["Mihnea Andrei","Christian Lemke","G\u00fcnter Radestock","Robert Schulze","Carsten Thiel","Rolando Blanco","Akanksha Meghlan","Muhammad Sharique","Sebastian Seifert","Surendra Vishnoi","Daniel Booss","Thomas Peh","Ivan Schreter","Werner Thesing","Mehul Wagle","Thomas Willhalm"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 12","August 2017","pp   1754\u20131765","https://doi.org/10.14778/3137765.3137780"],"date":"01 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Apalkov, D. et al.

Systems widely use in-memory caching as one of their primary techniques to speed up data analytics. However, caches in data analytics systems cannot rely on simple caching policies and a fixed data layout to achieve good performance. Different datasets and workloads require different layouts and policies to achieve optimal performance.This paper presents ReCache, a cache-based performance accelerator that is reactive to the cost and heterogeneity of diverse raw data formats. Using timing measurements of caching operations and selection operators in a query plan, ReCache accounts for the widely varying costs of reading, parsing, and caching data in nested and tabular formats. Combining these measurements with information about frequently accessed data fields in the workload, ReCache automatically decides whether a nested or relational column-oriented layout would lead to better query performance. Furthermore, ReCache keeps track of commonly utilized operators to make informed cache admission and eviction decisions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our caching techniques decrease caching overhead for individual queries by an average of 59%. Furthermore, over the entire workload, ReCache reduces execution time by 19-75% compared to existing techniques.","author":["Tahir Azim","Manos Karpathiotakis","Anastasia Ailamaki"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 3","November 2017","pp   324\u2013337","https://doi.org/10.14778/3157794.3157801"],"date":"01 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"The LLVM compiler infrastructure. http://llvm.org.

We take Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as an example, and the key questions that everyone will ask every day are: how does Coronavirus spread? where are the high-risk areas? where have confirmed cases around me? Interactive data analytics, which allows general users to easily monitor and explore such events, plays a key role. However, some emerging cases, such as COVID-19, bring many new challenges: (C1) New information may come with different formats: basic structured data such as confirmed/suspected/serious/death/recovered cases, unstructured data from newspapers for travel history of confirmed cases, and so on. (C2) Discovering new insights: data visualization is widely used for storytelling; however, the challenge here is how to automatically find \"interesting stories\", which might be different from day to day. We propose DeepTrack, a system that monitors spatio-temporal data, using the case of COVID-19. For (C1), we describe (a) how we integrate and clean data from different sources by existing modules. For (C2), we discuss (b) how to build new modules for ad-hoc data sources and requirements, (c) what are the basic (or static) charts used; and (d) how to generate recommended (or dynamic) charts that are based on new incoming data. The attendees can use DeepTrack to interactively explore various COVID-19 cases.","author":["Yuyu Luo","Wenbo Li","Tianyu Zhao","Xiang Yu","Lixi Zhang","Guoliang Li","Nan Tang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 13","Issue 12","August 2020","pp   2841\u20132844","https://doi.org/10.14778/3415478.3415489"],"date":"01 August 2020","ref":[{"text":"E.

We review CMU's ongoing research in the use of acoustical pre-processing to achieve robust speech recognition, and we present the results of the first evaluation of preprocessing in the context of the DARPA standard ATIS domain for spoken language systems. We also describe and compare the effectiveness of three complementary methods of signal processing for robust speech recognition: acoustical pre-processing, microphone array processing, and the use of physiologically-motivated models of peripheral signal processing. Recognition error rates are presented using these three approaches in isolation and in combination with each other for the speaker-independent continuous alphanumeric census speech recognition task.","author":["Richard M.

Although a number of semi-supervised methods have been proposed, their effectiveness on NLP tasks is not always clear. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that employs a learning paradigm which we call structural learning. The idea is to find \"what good classifiers are like\" by learning from thousands of automatically generated auxiliary classification problems on unlabeled data. By doing so, the common predictive structure shared by the multiple classification problems can be discovered, which can then be used to improve performance on the target problem. The method produces performance higher than the previous best results on CoNLL'00 syntactic chunking and CoNLL'03 named entity chunking (English and German).","author":["Rie Kubota Ando","Tong Zhang"],"issue":["ACL '05: Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics","June 2005","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.3115/1219840.1219841"],"date":"25 June 2005","ref":[{"text":"Rie Kubota Ando and Tong Zhang. 2004.

This task represents an interesting twist on standard multi-class text categorization because there are several different degrees of similarity between class labels; for example, \"three stars\" is intuitively closer to \"four stars\" than to \"one star\".We first evaluate human performance at the task. Then, we apply a meta-algorithm, based on a metric labeling formulation of the problem, that alters a given n-ary classifier's output in an explicit attempt to ensure that similar items receive similar labels. We show that the meta-algorithm can provide significant improvements over both multi-class and regression versions of SVMs when we employ a novel similarity measure appropriate to the problem.","author":["Bo Pang","Lillian Lee"],"issue":["ACL '05: Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics","June 2005","Pages   115\u2013124","https://doi.org/10.3115/1219840.1219855"],"date":"25 June 2005","ref":[{"text":"Atkeson, Christopher G., Andrew W.

Unlike previous local reordering models that emphasize the reordering of adjacent phrase pairs (Till-mann and Zhang, 2005), our model explicitly models the reordering of long distances by directly estimating the parameters from the phrase alignments of bilingual training sentences. In principle, the global phrase reordering model is conditioned on the source and target phrases that are currently being translated, and the previously translated source and target phrases. To cope with sparseness, we use N-best phrase alignments and bilingual phrase clustering, and investigate a variety of combinations of conditioning factors. Through experiments, we show, that the global reordering model significantly improves the translation accuracy of a standard Japanese-English translation task.","author":["Masaaki Nagata","Kuniko Saito","Kazuhide Yamamoto","Kazuteru Ohashi"],"issue":["ACL-44: Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics and the 44th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics","July 2006","Pages   713\u2013720","https://doi.org/10.3115/1220175.1220265"],"date":"17 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"Matthias Eck and Chiori Hori. 2005.

While previous work assumed the effects of word co-occurrence statistics to be constant over a window of several hundred words, we show that their influence is nonstationary on a much smaller time scale. Empirical data drawn from English and Japanese text, as well as conversational speech, reveals that the \"attraction\" between words decays exponentially, while stylistic and syntactic contraints create a \"repulsion\" between words that discourages close co-occurrence. We show that these characteristics are well described by simple mixture models based on two-stage exponential distributions which can be trained using the EM algorithm.

Next, we show how this complementatry behavior can be used to our advantage.

These methods work best when their training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. For many NLP tasks, however, we are confronted with new domains in which labeled data is scarce or non-existent. In such cases, we seek to adapt existing models from a resource-rich source domain to a resource-poor target domain. We introduce structural correspondence learning to automatically induce correspondences among features from different domains. We test our technique on part of speech tagging and show performance gains for varying amounts of source and target training data, as well as improvements in target domain parsing accuracy using our improved tagger.","author":["John Blitzer","Ryan McDonald","Fernando Pereira"],"issue":["EMNLP '06: Proceedings of the 2006 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing","July 2006","Pages   120\u2013128"],"date":"22 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"R.

We investigate an alternative paradigm that does not require labeled corpora, avoiding the domain dependence of ACE-style algorithms, and allowing the use of corpora of any size. Our experiments use Freebase, a large semantic database of several thousand relations, to provide distant supervision. For each pair of entities that appears in some Freebase relation, we find all sentences containing those entities in a large unlabeled corpus and extract textual features to train a relation classifier. Our algorithm combines the advantages of supervised IE (combining 400,000 noisy pattern features in a probabilistic classifier) and unsupervised IE (extracting large numbers of relations from large corpora of any domain). Our model is able to extract 10,000 instances of 102 relations at a precision of 67.6%. We also analyze feature performance, showing that syntactic parse features are particularly helpful for relations that are ambiguous or lexically distant in their expression.","author":["Mike Mintz","Steven Bills","Rion Snow","Dan Jurafsky"],"issue":["ACL '09: Proceedings of the Joint Conference of the 47th Annual Meeting of the ACL and the 4th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing of the AFNLP: Volume 2 - Volume 2","August 2009","Pages   1003\u20131011"],"date":"02 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"Eugene Agichtein and Luis Gravano. 2000.
