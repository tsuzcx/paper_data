[{"_id":"10.1145/1007568.1007594","title":"Fast computation of database operations using graphics processors","abstract":"We present new algorithms for performing fast computation of several common database operations on commodity graphics processors. Specifically, we consider operations such as conjunctive selections, aggregations, and semi-linear queries, which are essential computational components of typical database, data warehousing, and data mining applications. While graphics processing units (GPUs) have been designed for fast display of geometric primitives, we utilize the inherent pipelining and parallelism, single instruction and multiple data (SIMD) capabilities, and vector processing functionality of GPUs, for evaluating boolean predicate combinations and semi-linear queries on attributes and executing database operations efficiently. Our algorithms take into account some of the limitations of the programming model of current GPUs and perform no data rearrangements. Our algorithms have been implemented on a programmable GPU (e.g. NVIDIA's GeForce FX 5900) and applied to databases consisting of up to a million records. We have compared their performance with an optimized implementation of CPU-based algorithms. Our experiments indicate that the graphics processor available on commodity computer systems is an effective co-processor for performing database operations.","author":["Naga K.

Embedded systems, which account for a wide range of products from the electronics, semiconductor, telecommunications, and networking industries, face some of the most demanding security concerns---on the one hand, they are often highly resource constrained, while on the other hand, they frequently need to operate in physically insecure environments.Security has been the subject of intensive research in the context of general-purpose computing and communications systems. However, security is often misconstrued by embedded system designers as the addition of features, such as specific cryptographic algorithms and security protocols, to the system. In reality, it is a new dimension that designers should consider throughout the design process, along with other metrics such as cost, performance, and power.The challenges unique to embedded systems require new approaches to security covering all aspects of embedded system design from architecture to implementation. Security processing, which refers to the computations that must be performed in a system for the purpose of security, can easily overwhelm the computational capabilities of processors in both low- and high-end embedded systems. This challenge, which we refer to as the \"security processing gap,\" is compounded by increases in the amounts of data manipulated and the data rates that need to be achieved. Equally daunting is the \"battery gap\" in battery-powered embedded systems, which is caused by the disparity between rapidly increasing energy requirements for secure operation and slow improvements in battery technology. The final challenge is the \"assurance gap,\" which relates to the gap between functional security measures (e.g., security services, protocols, and their constituent cryptographic algorithms) and actual secure implementations. This paper provides an introduction to the challenges involved in secure embedded system design, discusses recent advances in addressing them, and identifies opportunities for future research.","author":["Srivaths Ravi","Anand Raghunathan","Paul Kocher","Sunil Hattangady"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 3","Issue 3","August 2004","pp   461\u2013491","https://doi.org/10.1145/1015047.1015049"],"date":"01 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"AES Algorithm (Rijndael) Information.

The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) can be used to find the \"best\" such approximation. However, it takes time polynomial in m, n which is prohibitive for some modern applications. In this article, we develop an algorithm that is qualitatively faster, provided we may sample the entries of the matrix in accordance with a natural probability distribution. In many applications, such sampling can be done efficiently. Our main result is a randomized algorithm to find the description of a matrix D* of rank at most k so that holds with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4 (where |\u00b7|F is the Frobenius norm). The algorithm takes time polynomial in k,1/\u03f5, log(1/\u03b4) only and is independent of m and n. In particular, this implies that in constant time, it can be determined if a given matrix of arbitrary size has a good low-rank approximation.","author":["Alan Frieze","Ravi Kannan","Santosh Vempala"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 51","Issue 6","November 2004","pp   1025\u20131041","https://doi.org/10.1145/1039488.1039494"],"date":"01 November 2004","ref":[{"text":"Achlioptas, D., and McSherry, F. 2001.

For cost reasons, the usage of conventional dynamic RAM (SDRAM) is preferred. However, SDRAM access optimization is a complex task, especially if multistream access with different QoS requirements is involved. In [8], a multi-stream DDR-SDRAM controller IP covering combinations of low latency requirements for processor cache access, hard realtime constraints for periodic video signals and hard real-time bursty accesses for video coprocessors was described. To handle these contradictory QoS requirements at high system performance, a combination of a 2-stage scheduling algorithm and static priorities were used. This paper describes an additional flow control which enhances the overall performance. Experiments with an FPGA based high-end video platform demonstrate the superiority of this architecture.","author":["Sven Heithecker","Rolf Ernst"],"issue":["DAC '05: Proceedings of the 42nd annual Design Automation Conference","June 2005","Pages   575\u2013578","https://doi.org/10.1145/1065579.1065729"],"date":"13 June 2005","ref":[{"text":"http://microlib.org.","order":1},{"text":"http://www.discreet.com.","order":2},{"text":"http://www.flexfilm.org.","order":3},{"text":"http://www.ida.ing.tu-bs.de: svenh/.","order":4},{"text":"http://www.quantel.com.","order":5},{"text":"http://www.thomsonbroadcast.com.","order":6},{"text":"AHN, J.

The system is intended to support real-time speech-based user interfaces as part of an effort to bring Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to underdeveloped regions of the world.Our system architecture exploits a shared infrastructure model. The computationally intensive task of speech model training and retraining is performed offline by shared servers, while the actual recognition of speech is conducted on low-cost hand-held devices using custom hardware.The recognizer is extremely flexible and can support multiple languages or dialects with speaker-independent recognition. Dynamic loading of speech models is used for changing language grammar and retraining, while reprogramming is used to support evolution of recognition algorithms. The focus on small sets of words (at one time) reduces the complexity, cost and power consumption. We design the speech decoder, the central component of the recognizer, and we validate it via a prototype FPGA implementation. We then use ASIC synthesis to estimate power and size for the design.Our evaluations demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement in power compared with optimized recognition software running on a low-power embedded general-purpose processor of the same technology and of similar capabilities. The synthesis also estimates the area of the design to be about 2.5mm2, showing potential for lower cost. In designing and testing our recognizer we use datasets in both English and Tamil languages.","author":["Sergiu Nedevschi","Rabin K. Patra","Eric A.

One task involves answering queries with a few examples. The other involves learning models for semantic concepts, also with a few examples. In our view these two tasks are identical with the only differentiation being the number of examples that are available for training. Once we adopt this unified view, we then apply identical techniques for solving both problems and evaluate the performance using the NIST TRECVID benchmark evaluation data [15]. We propose a combination hypothesis of two complementary classes of techniques, a nearest neighbor model using only positive examples and a discriminative support vector machine model using both positive and negative examples. In case of queries, where negative examples are rarely provided to seed the search, we create pseudo-negative samples. We then combine the ranked lists generated by evaluating the test database using both methods, to create a final ranked list of retrieved multimedia items. We evaluate this approach for rare concept and query topic modeling using the NIST TRECVID video corpus.In both tasks we find that applying the combination hypothesis across both modeling techniques and a variety of features results in enhanced performance over any of the baseline models, as well as in improved robustness with respect to training examples and visual features. In particular, we observe an improvement of 6% for rare concept detection and 17% for the search task.","author":["Apostol (Paul) Natsev","Milind R.

Although several algorithms have been proposed for mixed-sized placements, most of them primarily focus on the global placement aspect. In this paper we propose a three-step approach, named XDP, for mixed-size detailed placement. First, a combination of constraint graph and linear programming is used to legalize macros. Then, an enhanced greedy method is used to legalize the standard cells. Finally, a sliding-window-based cell swapping is applied to further reduce wirelength. The impact of individual techniques is analyzed and quantified. Experiments show that when applied to the set of global placement results generated by APlace [1], XDP can produce wirelength comparable to the native detailed placement of APlace, and 3% shorter wirelength compared to Fengshui 5.0 [2]. When applied to the set of global placements generated by mPL6 [3], XDP is the only detailed placement that successfully produces legal placement for all the examples, while APlace and Fengshui fail for 4/9 and 1/3 of the examples. For cases where legal placements can be compared, the wirelength produced by XDP is shorter by 3% on average compared to APlace and Fengshui. Furthermore, XDP displays a higher robustness than the other tools by covering a broader spectrum of examples by different global placement tools.","author":["Jason Cong","Min Xie"],"issue":["ASP-DAC '06: Proceedings of the 2006 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2006","Pages   188\u2013194","https://doi.org/10.1145/1118299.1118353"],"date":"24 January 2006","ref":[{"text":"A.

Synthesis from these specifications without bitwidth analysis may introduce wasted resources. Furthermore, conventional high-level synthesis techniques usually focus on uniform-width resources, thus they cannot obtain the full resource savings even with bitwidth information. This work develops a bitwidth-aware synthesis flow, including bitwidth analysis, scheduling and binding, and register allocation and binding, to exploit the multi-bitwidth nature of operations and variables for area-efficient designs. We also develop lower bound estimation to evaluate the efficiency of our proposed solutions for register allocation and binding. The flow is implemented in the MCAS synthesis system [11]. Experimental results show that our proposed bitwidth-aware synthesis flow reduces area by 36% and wire-length by 52% on average compared to the uniform-width MCAS flow, while achieving the same performance.","author":["Jason Cong","Yiping Fan","Guoling Han","Yizhou Lin","Junjuan Xu","Zhiru Zhang","Xu Cheng"],"issue":["ASP-DAC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2005","Pages   856\u2013861","https://doi.org/10.1145/1120725.1121055"],"date":"18 January 2005","ref":[{"text":"Altera Web Site, http://www.altera.com.","order":1},{"text":"SpecC Web Site, http://www.ics.uci.edu/~specc.","order":2},{"text":"SystemC Web Site, http://www.systeme.org.","order":3},{"text":"\"The National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors: Technology Needs,\" Semiconductor Industry Association, 1997.","order":4},{"text":"V.

These circuits are all directly derived from real industrial ASIC designs and represent today's mixed-size physical design constraints in terms of size and complexity. Compared to ISPD 2005 placement benchmarks, ISPD 2006 suite has more movable macros and the wider range of design utilizations. The ISPD 2006 Placement Contest is being held with these new benchmarks. This year, a more sophisticated scoring function will be deployed to measure the quality of placement solutions. The metric function takes into account HPWL (half-perimeter-bounding-box-wirelength), runtime and density target constraints. The purpose of adding runtime to the scoring function is to gently encourage faster placement performance. The purpose of the density target constraint is to encourage more routable placements. Further, this also allows more space for buffering, gate sizing and other synthesis transformations that might happen after the placement. Thus, this year's contest forces the placers to become more realistic than last year's, which focused solely on wirelength minimization. A total ten academic placement tools participated in the contest and the final results will be announced during this talk.","author":["Gi-Joon Nam"],"issue":["ISPD '06: Proceedings of the 2006 international symposium on Physical design","April 2006","Pages   167","https://doi.org/10.1145/1123008.1123042"],"date":"09 April 2006"},{"_id":"10.1145/1132973.1132979","doi":"10.1145/1132973.1132979","title":"Algorithm 851: CG_DESCENT, a conjugate gradient method with guaranteed descent","abstract":"Recently, a new nonlinear conjugate gradient scheme was developed which satisfies the descent condition gTkdk \u2264 \u22127/8 \u2016gk\u20162 and which is globally convergent whenever the line search fulfills the Wolfe conditions.

Operations on disjoint vector elements are not supported directly and require explicit data reorganization manipulations. Computations on non-contiguous and especially interleaved data appear in important applications, which can greatly benefit from SIMD instructions once the data is reorganized properly. Vectorizing such computations efficiently is therefore an ambitious challenge for both programmers and vectorizing compilers. We demonstrate an automatic compilation scheme that supports effective vectorization in the presence of interleaved data with constant strides that are powers of 2, facilitating data reorganization. We demonstrate how our vectorization scheme applies to dominant SIMD architectures, and present experimental results on a wide range of key kernels, showing speedups in execution time up to 3.7 for interleaving levels (stride) as high as 8.","author":["Dorit Nuzman","Ira Rosen","Ayal Zaks"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 41","Issue 6","June 2006","pp   132\u2013143","https://doi.org/10.1145/1133255.1133997"],"date":"11 June 2006","ref":[{"text":"R.

However, when dealing with highly skewed datasets, Precision-Recall (PR) curves give a more informative picture of an algorithm's performance. We show that a deep connection exists between ROC space and PR space, such that a curve dominates in ROC space if and only if it dominates in PR space. A corollary is the notion of an achievable PR curve, which has properties much like the convex hull in ROC space; we show an efficient algorithm for computing this curve. Finally, we also note differences in the two types of curves are significant for algorithm design. For example, in PR space it is incorrect to linearly interpolate between points. Furthermore, algorithms that optimize the area under the ROC curve are not guaranteed to optimize the area under the PR curve.","author":["Jesse Davis","Mark Goadrich"],"issue":["ICML '06: Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on Machine learning","June 2006","Pages   233\u2013240","https://doi.org/10.1145/1143844.1143874"],"date":"25 June 2006","ref":[{"text":"Bockhorst, J., & Craven, M.

However, nanofabrication techniques are not yet mature, making implementation of such circuits, at least on a large scale, in the near future infeasible. However, if photo-lithography could be used to implement circuits using these nanodevices, then hybrid nano/CMOS chips could be fabricated and the benefits of nanotechnology could be utilized immediately. A startup company, called Nantero, has developed and implemented a non-volatile nanotube random-access memory (NRAM) using photo-lithography that is considerably faster and denser than DRAM, has much lower power consumption than DRAM or flash, has similar speed to SRAM and is highly resistant to environmental forces (temperature, magnetism). In this paper, we propose a novel high performance reconfigurable architecture, called NATURE, that utilizes CMOS logic and NRAMs. Use of the highly-dense NRAMs allows large on-chip configuration storage, enabling fine-grain run-time reconfiguration and temporal logic folding of a circuit before being mapped to the architecture. This can significantly increase the logic density of NATURE (by over an order of magnitude for larger circuits) while remaining competitive in performance. Compared to traditional reconfigurable architectures, NATURE also allows the designer the flexibility to adjust the level of logic folding in order to improve performance or perform area-performance trade-offs. Experimental results establish its efficacy and give comparisons with today's mainstream FPGA technology which does not allow logic folding.","author":["Wei Zhang","Niraj K.

By implementing the new model into SPICE for an industrial 90nm technology, key insights are obtained for the development of robust design solutions: (1) the most effective techniques to mitigate the NBTI degradation are VDD tuning, PMOS sizing, and reducing the duty cycle; (2) an optimal VDD exists to minimize the degradation of circuit performance; (3) tuning gate length or the switching frequency has little impact on the NBTI effect; (4) a new switching scenario is identified for worst case timing analysis during NBTI stress.","author":["Rakesh Vattikonda","Wenping Wang","Yu Cao"],"issue":["DAC '06: Proceedings of the 43rd annual Design Automation Conference","July 2006","Pages   1047\u20131052","https://doi.org/10.1145/1146909.1147172"],"date":"24 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, 2005.","order":1},{"text":"N.

This problem, clustering aggregation, appears naturally in various contexts. For example, clustering categorical data is an instance of the clustering aggregation problem; each categorical attribute can be viewed as a clustering of the input rows where rows are grouped together if they take the same value on that attribute. Clustering aggregation can also be used as a metaclustering method to improve the robustness of clustering by combining the output of multiple algorithms. Furthermore, the problem formulation does not require a priori information about the number of clusters; it is naturally determined by the optimization function.In this article, we give a formal statement of the clustering aggregation problem, and we propose a number of algorithms. Our algorithms make use of the connection between clustering aggregation and the problem of correlation clustering. Although the problems we consider are NP-hard, for several of our methods, we provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of the solutions. Our work provides the best deterministic approximation algorithm for the variation of the correlation clustering problem we consider. We also show how sampling can be used to scale the algorithms for large datasets. We give an extensive empirical evaluation demonstrating the usefulness of the problem and of the solutions.","author":["Aristides Gionis","Heikki Mannila","Panayiotis Tsaparas"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data","Volume 1","Issue 1","March 2007","pp   4\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.1145/1217299.1217303"],"date":"01 March 2007","ref":[{"text":"Ailon, N., Charikar, M., and Newman, A. 2005.

That is, the noise magnitude is determined not only by the function we want to release, but also bythe database itself. One of the challenges is to ensure that the noise magnitude does not leak information about the database. To address that, we calibrate the noise magnitude to the smoothsensitivity of f on the database x --- a measure of variabilityof f in the neighborhood of the instance x. The new frameworkgreatly expands the applicability of output perturbation, a technique for protecting individuals' privacy by adding a smallamount of random noise to the released statistics. To our knowledge, this is the first formal analysis of the effect of instance-basednoise in the context of data privacy. Our framework raises many interesting algorithmic questions. Namely,to apply the framework one must compute or approximate the smoothsensitivity of f on x. We show how to do this efficiently for several different functions, including the median and the cost ofthe minimum spanning tree. We also give a generic procedure based on sampling that allows one to release f(x) accurately on manydatabases x. This procedure is applicable even when no efficient algorithm for approximating smooth sensitivity of f is known orwhen f is given as a black box. We illustrate the procedure by applying it to k-SED (k-means) clustering and learning mixtures of Gaussians.","author":["Kobbi Nissim","Sofya Raskhodnikova","Adam Smith"],"issue":["STOC '07: Proceedings of the thirty-ninth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing","June 2007","Pages   75\u201384","https://doi.org/10.1145/1250790.1250803"],"date":"11 June 2007","ref":[{"text":"N.R.

They are appropriate for many usage scenarios, but there are scenarios that require system virtualization with high degrees of both isolation and efficiency. Examples include HPC clusters, the Grid, hosting centers, and PlanetLab. We present an alternative to hypervisors that is better suited to such scenarios. The approach is a synthesis of prior work on resource containers and security containers applied to general-purpose, time-shared operating systems. Examples of such container-based systems include Solaris 10, Virtuozzo for Linux, and Linux-VServer. As a representative instance of container-based systems, this paper describes the design and implementation of Linux-VServer. In addition, it contrasts the architecture of Linux-VServer with current generations of Xen, and shows how Linux-VServer provides comparable support for isolation and superior system efficiency.","author":["Stephen Soltesz","Herbert P\u00f6tzl","Marc E.

Although transient faults do not permanently damage the hardware, they may corrupt computations by altering stored values and signal transfers. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for provably safe and reliable computing in the presence of transient hardware faults. In our scheme, software computations are replicated to provide redundancy while special instructions compare the independently computed results to detect errors before writing critical data. In stark contrast to any previous efforts in this area, we have analyzed our fault tolerance scheme from a formal, theoretical perspective. To be specific, first, we provide an operational semantics for our assembly language, which includes a precise formal definition of our fault model. Second, we develop an assembly-level type system designed to detect reliability problems in compiled code. Third, we provide a formal specification for program fault tolerance under the given fault model and prove that all well-typed programs are indeed fault tolerant. In addition to the formal analysis, we evaluate our detection scheme and show that it only takes 34% longer to execute than the unreliable version.","author":["Frances Perry","Lester Mackey","George A.

Most previous approaches have ignored important issues, such as the role of features and the importance of modeling term dependencies. In this paper, we propose a robust query expansion technique based onthe Markov random field model for information retrieval. The technique, called latent concept expansion, provides a mechanism for modeling term dependencies during expansion. Furthermore, the use of arbitrary features within the model provides a powerful framework for going beyond simple term occurrence features that are implicitly used by most other expansion techniques. We evaluate our technique against relevance models, a state-of-the-art language modeling query expansion technique. Our model demonstrates consistent and significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness across several TREC data sets. We also describe how our technique can be used to generate meaningful multi-term concepts for tasks such as query suggestion/reformulation.","author":["Donald Metzler","W.

Communities are intuitively characterized as \"unusually densely knit\" subsets of a social network. This notion becomes more problematic if the social interactions change over time. Aggregating social networks over time can radically misrepresent the existing and changing community structure. Instead, we propose an optimization-based approach for modeling dynamic community structure. We prove that finding the most explanatory community structure is NP-hard and APX-hard, and propose algorithms based on dynamic programming, exhaustive search, maximum matching, and greedy heuristics. We demonstrate empirically that the heuristics trace developments of community structure accurately for several synthetic and real-world examples.","author":["Chayant Tantipathananandh","Tanya Berger-Wolf","David Kempe"],"issue":["KDD '07: Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2007","Pages   717\u2013726","https://doi.org/10.1145/1281192.1281269"],"date":"12 August 2007","ref":[{"text":"J.

NFTL is a widely used block based flash translation layer designed to manage NAND flash memories. NFTL is designed to achieve fast write times at the expense of slower read times. While traditionally, it is assumed that the read traffic to secondary storage is insignificant, as reads are cached, we show that this need not be true for NAND flash based storage due to garbage collection and reclamation processes. In this work, we present two independent techniques that extend NFTL and improve the read throughput in particular. The techniques presented add a minimal amount of RAM overhead to a flash controller, while providing, on an average, a 22.9% improvement in page read times and a 2.6% improvements in page write times on a set of file system and rigorous synthetic benchmarks. The techniques presented are well suited for flash controllers that are typically space constrained and have minimal processing power.","author":["Siddharth Choudhuri","Tony Givargis"],"issue":["CODES+ISSS '07: Proceedings of the 5th IEEE/ACM international conference on Hardware/software codesign and system synthesis","September 2007","Pages   257\u2013262","https://doi.org/10.1145/1289816.1289878"],"date":"30 September 2007","ref":[{"text":"Samsung 16M x 8 bit NAND flash memory, K9F2808U0B. http://www.samsung.com, 2006.","order":1},{"text":"Toshiba 128 MBIT CMOS NAND EEPROM TC58DVM72A1FT00. http://www.toshiba.com, 2006.","order":2},{"text":"A.

PTMs provide a concise description of both normal and faulty behavior, and are well-suited to reliability and error susceptibility calculations. A few simple composition rules based on connectivity can be used to recursively build larger PTMs (representing entire logic circuits) from smaller gate PTMs. PTMs for gates in series are combined using matrix multiplication, and PTMs for gates in parallel are combined using the tensor product operation. PTMs can accurately calculate joint output probabilities in the presence of reconvergent fanout and inseparable joint input distributions. To improve computational efficiency, we encode PTMs as algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs). We also develop equivalent ADD algorithms for newly defined matrix operations such as eliminate_variables and eliminate_redundant_variables, which aid in the numerical computation of circuit PTMs. We use PTMs to evaluate circuit reliability and derive polynomial approximations for circuit error probabilities in terms of gate error probabilities. PTMs can also analyze the effects of logic and electrical masking on error mitigation. We show that ignoring logic masking can overestimate errors by an order of magnitude. We incorporate electrical masking by computing error attenuation probabilities, based on analytical models, into an extended PTM framework for reliability computation. We further define a susceptibility measure to identify gates whose errors are not well masked. We show that hardening a few gates can significantly improve circuit reliability.","author":["Smita Krishnaswamy","George F. Viamontes","Igor L. Markov","John P.

From a practical point of view, a good example of such structures would be so-called network communities. Earlier studies have introduced various formulations as well as methods for the problem of identifying or extracting communities. While each of them has pros and cons as far as the effectiveness and efficiency are concerned, almost none of them has explicitly dealt with the potential relationship between the global topological property of a network and the local property of individual nodes. In order to study this problem, this paper presents a new algorithm, called ICS, which aims to discover natural network communities by inferring from the local information of nodes inherently hidden in networks based on a new centrality, that is, clustering centrality, which is a generalization of eigenvector centrality. As compared with existing methods, our method runs efficiently with a good clustering performance. Additionally, it is insensitive to its built-in parameters and prior knowledge.","author":["Bo Yang","Jiming Liu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on the Web","Volume 2","Issue 1","February 2008","Article No.: 9","pp   1\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/1326561.1326570"],"date":"03 March 2008","ref":[{"text":"Bonacich, P.

Unfortunately, writing correct concurrent programs is difficult. Addressing this challenge requires advances in multiple directions, including concurrency bug detection, concurrent program testing, concurrent programming model design, etc. Designing effective techniques in all these directions will significantly benefit from a deep understanding of real world concurrency bug characteristics.This paper provides the first (to the best of our knowledge) comprehensive real world concurrency bug characteristic study. Specifically, we have carefully examined concurrency bug patterns, manifestation, and fix strategies of 105 randomly selected real world concurrency bugs from 4 representative server and client open-source applications (MySQL, Apache, Mozilla and OpenOffice). Our study reveals several interesting findings and provides useful guidance for concurrency bug detection, testing, and concurrent programming language design.Some of our findings are as follows: (1) Around one third of the examined non-deadlock concurrency bugs are caused by violation to programmers' order intentions, which may not be easily expressed via synchronization primitives like locks and transactional memories; (2) Around 34% of the examined non-deadlock concurrency bugs involve multiple variables, which are not well addressed by existing bug detection tools; (3) About 92% of the examined concurrency bugs canbe reliably triggered by enforcing certain orders among no more than 4 memory accesses. This indicates that testing concurrent programs can target at exploring possible orders among every small groups of memory accesses, instead of among all memory accesses; (4) About 73% of the examinednon-deadlock concurrency bugs were not fixed by simply adding or changing locks, and many of the fixes were not correct at the first try, indicating the difficulty of reasoning concurrent execution by programmers.","author":["Shan Lu","Soyeon Park","Eunsoo Seo","Yuanyuan Zhou"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 43","Issue 3","March 2008","pp   329\u2013339","https://doi.org/10.1145/1353536.1346323"],"date":"01 March 2008","ref":[{"text":"A.-R.

Larrabee uses multiple in-order x86 CPU cores that are augmented by a wide vector processor unit, as well as some fixed function logic blocks. This provides dramatically higher performance per watt and per unit of area than out-of-order CPUs on highly parallel workloads. It also greatly increases the flexibility and programmability of the architecture as compared to standard GPUs. A coherent on-die 2nd level cache allows efficient inter-processor communication and high-bandwidth local data access by CPU cores. Task scheduling is performed entirely with software in Larrabee, rather than in fixed function logic. The customizable software graphics rendering pipeline for this architecture uses binning in order to reduce required memory bandwidth, minimize lock contention, and increase opportunities for parallelism relative to standard GPUs. The Larrabee native programming model supports a variety of highly parallel applications that use irregular data structures. Performance analysis on those applications demonstrates Larrabee's potential for a broad range of parallel computation.","author":["Larry Seiler","Doug Carmean","Eric Sprangle","Tom Forsyth","Michael Abrash","Pradeep Dubey","Stephen Junkins","Adam Lake","Jeremy Sugerman","Robert Cavin","Roger Espasa","Ed Grochowski","Toni Juan","Pat Hanrahan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 27","Issue 3","August 2008","pp   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/1360612.1360617"],"date":"01 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"Akenine-M\u00f6ller, T., Haines, E. 2002.","doi":"10.5555/553838","order":1},{"text":"Aila, T., Laine, S. 2004.

We choose one set of product related and one set of process related software metrics and use them for classifying Java files of the Eclipse project as defective respective defect-free. Classification models are built using three common machine learners: logistic regression, Na\u00efve Bayes, and decision trees. To allow different costs for prediction errors we perform cost-sensitive classification, which proves to be very successful: >75% percentage of correctly classified files, a recall of >80%, and a false positive rate <30%. Results indicate that for the Eclipse data, process metrics are more efficient defect predictors than code metrics.","author":["Raimund Moser","Witold Pedrycz","Giancarlo Succi"],"issue":["ICSE '08: Proceedings of the 30th international conference on Software engineering","May 2008","Pages   181\u2013190","https://doi.org/10.1145/1368088.1368114"],"date":"10 May 2008","ref":[{"text":"Basili, V.

In this paper, we design a custom cross-layer framework that enables (i) implementation of multiple and previously unimplemented rate adaptation mechanisms, (ii) experimental evaluation and comparison of rate adaptation protocols on controlled, repeatable channels as well as residential urban and downtown vehicular and non-mobile environments in which we accurately measure channel conditions with 100-\u03bcs granularity, and (iii) comparison of performance on a per-packet basis with the ideal modulation rate obtained via exhaustive experimental search. Our evaluation reveals that SNR-triggered protocols are susceptible to overselection from the ideal rate when the coherence time is low (a scenario that we show occurs in practice even in a nonmobile topology), and that \"in-situ\" training can produce large gains to overcome this sensitivity. Another key finding is that a mechanism effective in differentiating between collision and fading losses for hidden terminals has severely imbalanced throughput sharing when competing links are even slightly heterogeneous. In general, we find trained SNR-based protocols outperform loss-based protocols in terms of the ability to track vehicular clients, accuracy within outdoor environments, and balanced sharing with heterogeneous links (even with physical layer capture).","author":["Joseph Camp","Edward Knightly"],"issue":["MobiCom '08: Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking","September 2008","Pages   315\u2013326","https://doi.org/10.1145/1409944.1409981"],"date":"14 September 2008","ref":[{"text":"Technical report on RF channel characterization and system deployment modeling.

Storage uses a significant fraction of the power budget and there are no widely deployed power-saving solutions for enterprise storage systems. The traditional view is that enterprise workloads make spinning disks down ineffective because idle periods are too short. We analyzed block-level traces from 36 volumes in an enterprise data center for one week and concluded that significant idle periods exist, and that they can be further increased by modifying the read/write patterns using write off-loading. Write off-loading allows write requests on spun-down disks to be temporarily redirected to persistent storage elsewhere in the data center.The key challenge is doing this transparently and efficiently at the block level, without sacrificing consistency or failure resilience. We describe our write off-loading design and implementation that achieves these goals. We evaluate it by replaying portions of our traces on a rack-based testbed. Results show that just spinning disks down when idle saves 28--36% of energy, and write off-loading further increases the savings to 45--60%.","author":["Dushyanth Narayanan","Austin Donnelly","Antony Rowstron"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 4","Issue 3","November 2008","Article No.: 10","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/1416944.1416949"],"date":"24 November 2008","ref":[{"text":"Anderson, T.

In a multiprogrammed computing system, there is a considerable burden on secondary storage, resulting both from constant traffic in and out of main memory (core memory), and from the large number of permanent files that may be in residence.

During battery discharge, the battery voltage decreases, until a certain cutoff value is reached, marking the end of battery life. The amount of discharge capacity and energy delivered by the battery during its life depends not only on the battery characteristics, but also on the load conditions. A different system design may result in a different battery current (load) profile over time, leading to a different battery voltage profile over time. This article presents an analytical model that relates the battery voltage to the battery current, thus facilitating system design optimizations with respect to the battery performance. It captures well-known nonlinear phenomena of capacity loss at high discharge rates, charge recovery, and capacity fading. The proposed model has been validated against measurements taken on Li-ion batteries.

PUF-based security approaches have numerous comparative strengths with respect to traditional cryptography-based techniques, including resilience against physical and side channel attacks and suitability for lightweight protocols. However, classical delay-based PUF structures have a number of drawbacks including susceptibility to guessing, reverse engineering, and emulation attacks, as well as sensitivity to operational and environmental variations.To address these limitations, we have developed a new set of techniques for FPGA-based PUF design and implementation. We demonstrate how reconfigurability can be exploited to eliminate the stated PUF limitations. We also show how FPGA-based PUFs can be used for privacy protection. Furthermore, reconfigurability enables the introduction of new techniques for PUF testing. The effectiveness of all the proposed techniques is validated using extensive implementations, simulations, and statistical analysis.","author":["Mehrdad Majzoobi","Farinaz Koushanfar","Miodrag Potkonjak"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 2","Issue 1","March 2009","Article No.: 5","pp   1\u201333","https://doi.org/10.1145/1502781.1502786"],"date":"01 March 2009","ref":[{"text":"Alkabani, Y.

Their main shortcoming is limited throughput when simulating large multiprocessor systems with hundreds or thousands of processors or when instrumentation is introduced. We propose the ProtoFlex simulation architecture, which uses FPGAs to accelerate full-system multiprocessor simulation and to facilitate high-performance instrumentation. Prior FPGA approaches that prototype a complete system in hardware are either too complex when scaling to large-scale configurations or require significant effort to provide full-system support. In contrast, ProtoFlex virtualizes the execution of many logical processors onto a consolidated number of multiple-context execution engines on the FPGA. Through virtualization, the number of engines can be judiciously scaled, as needed, to deliver on necessary simulation performance at a large savings in complexity. Further, to achieve low-complexity full-system support, a hybrid simulation technique called transplanting allows implementing in the FPGA only the frequently encountered behaviors, while a software simulator preserves the abstraction of a complete system.We have created a first instance of the ProtoFlex simulation architecture, which is an FPGA-based, full-system functional simulator for a 16-way UltraSPARC III symmetric multiprocessor server, hosted on a single Xilinx Virtex-II XCV2P70 FPGA. On average, the simulator achieves a 38x speedup (and as high as 49\u00d7) over comparable software simulation across a suite of applications, including OLTP on a commercial database server. We also demonstrate the advantages of minimal-overhead FPGA-accelerated instrumentation through a CMP cache simulation technique that runs orders-of-magnitude faster than software.","author":["Eric S.

The goal is to retrieve services that match the user's requirements. With the growing number of services in the repositories and the challenges of quickly finding the right ones, the need for clustering related services becomes evident to enhance search engine results with a list of similar services for each hit. In this article, a statistical clustering approach is presented that enhances an existing distributed vector space search engine for Web services with the possibility of dynamically calculating clusters of similar services for each hit in the list found by the search engine. The focus is laid on a very efficient and scalable clustering implementation that can handle very large service repositories. The evaluation with a large service repository demonstrates the feasibility and performance of the approach.","author":["Christian Platzer","Florian Rosenberg","Schahram Dustdar"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Internet Technology","Volume 9","Issue 3","July 2009","Article No.: 11","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/1552291.1552294"],"date":"30 July 2009","ref":[{"text":"Abramowicz, W., Haniewicz, K., Kaczmarek, M., and Zyskowski, D. 2007.

Hypercubic topologies facilitate such operations while each node only needs to connect to a small number of other nodes. In contrast to static communication networks, peer-to-peer networks allow nodes to adapt their neighbor set over time in order to react to join and leave events and failures. This paper shows how to maintain such networks in a robust manner. Concretely, we present a distributed and self-stabilizing algorithm that constructs a (variant of the) skip graph in polylogarithmic time from any initial state in which the overlay network is still weakly connected. This is an exponential improvement compared to previously known self-stabilizing algorithms for overlay networks. In addition, individual joins and leaves are handled locally and require little work.","author":["Riko Jacob","Andrea Richa","Christian Scheideler","Stefan Schmid","Hanjo T\u00e4ubig"],"issue":["PODC '09: Proceedings of the 28th ACM symposium on Principles of distributed computing","August 2009","Pages   131\u2013140","https://doi.org/10.1145/1582716.1582741"],"date":"10 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"Y.

At the core of the BCube architecture is its server-centric network structure, where servers with multiple network ports connect to multiple layers of COTS (commodity off-the-shelf) mini-switches. Servers act as not only end hosts, but also relay nodes for each other. BCube supports various bandwidth-intensive applications by speeding-up one-to-one, one-to-several, and one-to-all traffic patterns, and by providing high network capacity for all-to-all traffic.BCube exhibits graceful performance degradation as the server and/or switch failure rate increases. This property is of special importance for shipping-container data centers, since once the container is sealed and operational, it becomes very difficult to repair or replace its components.Our implementation experiences show that BCube can be seamlessly integrated with the TCP/IP protocol stack and BCube packet forwarding can be efficiently implemented in both hardware and software. Experiments in our testbed demonstrate that BCube is fault tolerant and load balancing and it significantly accelerates representative bandwidth-intensive applications.","author":["Chuanxiong Guo","Guohan Lu","Dan Li","Haitao Wu","Xuan Zhang","Yunfeng Shi","Chen Tian","Yongguang Zhang","Songwu Lu"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 39","Issue 4","October 2009","pp   63\u201374","https://doi.org/10.1145/1594977.1592577"],"date":"16 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"M.

More specifically, we demonstrate that each processor design can be authenticated by requiring a checksum incorporating internals of complex micro-architectural mechanisms to be computed within a time limit; this checksum is different for each processor model and only authentic secure hardware can obtain the checksum fast enough. This new authentication approach provides attractive solutions to privacy, scaling, and security issues of traditional approaches that otherwise rely only on certificates. Architectural simulations and an RTL implementation show that the proposed approach is viable with very low hardware overheads.","author":["Daniel Y. Deng","Andrew H. Chan","G.

In evolutionary clustering, a good clustering result should fit the current data well, while simultaneously not deviate too dramatically from the recent history. To fulfill this dual purpose, a measure of temporal smoothness is integrated in the overall measure of clustering quality. In this article, we propose two frameworks that incorporate temporal smoothness in evolutionary spectral clustering. For both frameworks, we start with intuitions gained from the well-known k-means clustering problem, and then propose and solve corresponding cost functions for the evolutionary spectral clustering problems. Our solutions to the evolutionary spectral clustering problems provide more stable and consistent clustering results that are less sensitive to short-term noises while at the same time are adaptive to long-term cluster drifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methods provide the optimal solutions to the relaxed versions of the corresponding evolutionary k-means clustering problems. Performance experiments over a number of real and synthetic data sets illustrate our evolutionary spectral clustering methods provide more robust clustering results that are not sensitive to noise and can adapt to data drifts.","author":["Yun Chi","Xiaodan Song","Dengyong Zhou","Koji Hino","Belle L.

Several application domains offer the opportunity to tradeoff quality of service/solution (QoS) for improvements in performance and reduction in energy consumption. Programmers sometimes take advantage of such opportunities, albeit in an ad-hoc manner and often without providing any QoS guarantees. We propose a system called Green that provides a simple and flexible framework that allows programmers to take advantage of such approximation opportunities in a systematic manner while providing statistical QoS guarantees. Green enables programmers to approximate expensive functions and loops and operates in two phases. In the calibration phase, it builds a model of the QoS loss produced by the approximation. This model is used in the operational phase to make approximation decisions based on the QoS constraints specified by the programmer. The operational phase also includes an adaptation function that occasionally monitors the runtime behavior and changes the approximation decisions and QoS model to provide strong statistical QoS guarantees. To evaluate the effectiveness of Green, we implemented our system and language extensions using the Phoenix compiler framework. Our experiments using benchmarks from domains such as graphics, machine learning, signal processing, and finance, and an in-production, real-world web search engine, indicate that Green can produce significant improvements in performance and energy consumption with small and controlled QoS degradation.","author":["Woongki Baek","Trishul M.

The commonly used LRU replacement policy always predicts a near-immediate re-reference interval on cache hits and misses. Applications that exhibit a distant re-reference interval perform badly under LRU. Such applications usually have a working-set larger than the cache or have frequent bursts of references to non-temporal data (called scans). To improve the performance of such workloads, this paper proposes cache replacement using Re-reference Interval Prediction (RRIP). We propose Static RRIP (SRRIP) that is scan-resistant and Dynamic RRIP (DRRIP) that is both scan-resistant and thrash-resistant. Both RRIP policies require only 2-bits per cache block and easily integrate into existing LRU approximations found in modern processors. Our evaluations using PC games, multimedia, server and SPEC CPU2006 workloads on a single-core processor with a 2MB last-level cache (LLC) show that both SRRIP and DRRIP outperform LRU replacement on the throughput metric by an average of 4% and 10% respectively. Our evaluations with over 1000 multi-programmed workloads on a 4-core CMP with an 8MB shared LLC show that SRRIP and DRRIP outperform LRU replacement on the throughput metric by an average of 7% and 9% respectively. We also show that RRIP outperforms LFU, the state-of the art scan-resistant replacement algorithm to-date. For the cache configurations under study, RRIP requires 2X less hardware than LRU and 2.5X less hardware than LFU.","author":["Aamer Jaleel","Kevin B. Theobald","Simon C.

PacketShader exploits the massively-parallel processing power of GPU to address the CPU bottleneck in current software routers. Combined with our high-performance packet I/O engine, PacketShader outperforms existing software routers by more than a factor of four, forwarding 64B IPv4 packets at 39 Gbps on a single commodity PC. We have implemented IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding, OpenFlow switching, and IPsec tunneling to demonstrate the flexibility and performance advantage of PacketShader. The evaluation results show that GPU brings significantly higher throughput over the CPU-only implementation, confirming the effectiveness of GPU for computation and memory-intensive operations in packet processing.","author":["Sangjin Han","Keon Jang","KyoungSoo Park","Sue Moon"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 40","Issue 4","October 2010","pp   195\u2013206","https://doi.org/10.1145/1851275.1851207"],"date":"30 August 2010","ref":[{"text":"AMD Fusion. http://fusion.amd.com.","order":1},{"text":"Cavium Networks OCTEON II processors. http://www.caviumnetworks.com/OCTEON_II_MIPS64.html.","order":2},{"text":"Check Point IP Security Appliances. http://www.checkpoint.com/products/ip-appliances/index.html.","order":3},{"text":"Cisco QuantumFlow Processors. http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/routers/ps9343/solution_over%view_c22--448936.html.","order":4},{"text":"General Purpose computation on GPUs. http://www.gpgpu.org.","order":5},{"text":"GNU Zebra project. http://www.zebra.org.","order":6},{"text":"NVIDIA CUDA GPU Computing Discussion Forum. http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=104243.","order":7},{"text":"NVIDIA Fermi Architecture. http://www.nvidia.com/object/fermi_architecture.html.","order":8},{"text":"OpenFlow Reference System. http://www.openflowswitch.org/wp/downloads/.","order":9},{"text":"OpenFlow Switch Specification, Version 0.8.9. http://www.openflowswitch.org/documents/openflow-spec-v0.8.9.pdf.","order":10},{"text":"Quagga project. http://www.quagga.net.","order":11},{"text":"Receive-Side Scaling Enhancements in Windows Server 2008. http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/network/ndis_rss.mspx.","order":12},{"text":"The OpenFlow Switch Consortium. http://www.openflowswitch.org.","order":13},{"text":"University of Oregon RouteViews project. http://www.routeviews.org/.","order":14},{"text":"R.

It requires no external measurement equipment. We also describe PowerTutor, a component power management and activity state introspection based tool that uses the model generated by PowerBooter for online power estimation. PowerBooter is intended to make it quick and easy for application developers and end users to generate power models for new smartphone variants, which each have different power consumption properties and therefore require different power models. PowerTutor is intended to ease the design and selection of power efficient software for embedded systems. Combined, PowerBooter and PowerTutor have the goal of opening power modeling and analysis for more smartphone variants and their users.","author":["Lide Zhang","Birjodh Tiwana","Zhiyun Qian","Zhaoguang Wang","Robert P.

New advancements in technology enable caches to be built from other technologies, such as Embedded DRAM (EDRAM), Magnetic RAM (MRAM), and Phase-change RAM (PRAM), in both 2D chips or 3D stacked chips. Caches fabricated in these technologies offer dramatically different power-performance characteristics when compared with SRAM-based caches, particularly in the areas of access latency, cell density, and overall power consumption. In this article, we propose to take advantage of the best characteristics that each technology has to offer through the use of Hybrid Cache Architecture (HCA) designs.We discuss and evaluate two types of hybrid cache architectures: intercache-Level HCA (LHCA), in which the levels in a cache hierarchy can be made of disparate memory technologies; and intracache-level or cache-Region-based HCA (RHCA), where a single level of cache can be partitioned into multiple regions, each of a different memory technology. We have studied a number of different HCA architectures and explored the potential of hardware support for intracache data movement and power consumption management within HCA caches. Utilizing a full-system simulator that has been validated against real hardware, we demonstrate that an LHCA design can provide a geometric mean 6% IPC improvement over a baseline 3-level SRAM cache design under the same area constraint across a collection of 30 workloads. A more aggressive RHCA-based design provides 10% IPC improvement over the baseline. A 2-layer 3D cache stack (3DHCA) of high density memory technology within the same chip footprint gives 16% IPC improvement over the baseline. We also achieve up to a 72% reduction in power consumption over a baseline SRAM-only design. Energy-delay and thermal evaluation for 3DHCA are also presented. In addition to the fast-slow region based RHCA, we further evaluate read-write region based RHCA designs.","author":["Xiaoxia Wu","Jian Li","Lixin Zhang","Evan Speight","Ram Rajamony","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 7","Issue 3","December 2010","Article No.: 15","pp   1\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/1880037.1880040"],"date":"30 December 2010","ref":[{"text":"Ababei, C., Feng, Y., Goplen, B., Mogal, H., Zhang, T., Bazargan, K., and Sapatnekar, S.

Full multipliers are the core of floating-point multipliers. Truncated multipliers, trading resources for a well-controlled accuracy degradation, are useful building blocks in situations where a full multiplier is not needed.This work studies the automated generation of such multipliers using the embedded multipliers and adders present in the DSP blocks of current FPGAs. The optimization of such multipliers is expressed as a tiling problem, where a tile represents a hardware multiplier, and super-tiles represent combinations of several hardware multipliers and adders, making efficient use of the DSP internal resources. This tiling technique is shown to adapt to full or truncated multipliers. It addresses arbitrary precisions including single, double but also the quadruple precision introduced by the IEEE-754-2008 standard and currently unsupported by processor hardware.

Because computations often require more data from cache per floating-point operation than a machine can deliver and because operations are pipelined, idle computational cycles are common when scientific applications are executed. To overcome these bottlenecks, programmers have learned to use a coding style that ensures a better balance between memory references and floating-point operations. In our view, this is a step in the wrong direction because it makes programs more machine-specific. A programmer should not be required to write a new program version for each new machine; instead, the task of specializing a program to a target machine should be left to the compiler.But is our view practical? Can a sophisticated optimizing compiler obviate the need for the myriad of programming tricks that have found their way into practice to improve the performance of the memory hierarchy? In this paper we attempt to answer that question. To do so, we develop and evaluate techniques that automatically restructure program loops to achieve high performance on specific target architectures. These methods attempt to balance computation and memory accesses and seek to eliminate or reduce pipeline interlock. To do this, they estimate statically the balance between memory operations and floating-point operations for each loop in a particular program and use these estimates to determine whether to apply various loop transformations.Experiments with our automatic techniques show that integer-factor speedups are possible on kernels. Additionally, the estimate of the balance between memory operations and computation, and the application of the estimate are very accurate\u2014experiments reveal little difference between the balance achieved by our automatic system that is made possible by hand optimization.","author":["Steve Carr","Ken Kennedy"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems","Volume 16","Issue 6","Nov. 1994","pp   1768\u20131810","https://doi.org/10.1145/197320.197366"],"date":"01 November 1994","ref":[{"text":"AIKEN, A.

Our problem is to verify the robustness of a function P that is coded as an imperative program, and can use diverse data types and features such as branches and loops. Our approach to the problem soundly decomposes it into two subproblems: (a) verifying that the smallest possible perturbations to the inputs of P do not change the corresponding outputs significantly, even if control now flows along a different control path; and (b) verifying the robustness of the computation along each control-flow path of P. To solve the former subproblem, we build on an existing method for verifying that a program encodes a continuous function [5]. The latter is solved using a static analysis that bounds the magnitude of the slope of any function computed by a control flow path of P. The outcome is a sound program analysis for robustness that uses proof obligations which do not refer to epsilon-changes and can often be fully automated using off-the-shelf SMT-solvers. We identify three application domains for our analysis. First, our analysis can be used to guarantee the predictable execution of embedded control software, whose inputs come from physical sources and can suffer from error and uncertainty. A guarantee of robustness ensures that the system does not react disproportionately to such uncertainty. Second, our analysis is directly applicable to approximate computation, and can be used to provide foundations for a recently-proposed program approximation scheme called {loop perforation}. A third application is in database privacy: proofs of robustness of queries are essential to differential privacy, the most popular notion of privacy for statistical databases.","author":["Swarat Chaudhuri","Sumit Gulwani","Roberto Lublinerman","Sara Navidpour"],"issue":["ESEC/FSE '11: Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGSOFT symposium and the 13th European conference on Foundations of software engineering","September 2011","Pages   102\u2013112","https://doi.org/10.1145/2025113.2025131"],"date":"09 September 2011","ref":[{"text":"L.

To utilize this bandwidth requires different flows take different paths, which poses a challenge. In short, a single-path transport seems ill-suited to such networks.We propose using Multipath TCP as a replacement for TCP in such data centers, as it can effectively and seamlessly use available bandwidth, giving improved throughput and better fairness on many topologies. We investigate what causes these benefits, teasing apart the contribution of each of the mechanisms used by MPTCP.Using MPTCP lets us rethink data center networks, with a different mindset as to the relationship between transport protocols, rout- ing and topology. MPTCP enables topologies that single path TCP cannot utilize. As a proof-of-concept, we present a dual-homed variant of the FatTree topology. With MPTCP, this outperforms FatTree for a wide range of workloads, but costs the same.In existing data centers, MPTCP is readily deployable leveraging widely deployed technologies such as ECMP. We have run MPTCP on Amazon EC2 and found that it outperforms TCP by a factor of three when there is path diversity. But the biggest benefits will come when data centers are designed for multipath transports.","author":["Costin Raiciu","Sebastien Barre","Christopher Pluntke","Adam Greenhalgh","Damon Wischik","Mark Handley"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 41","Issue 4","August 2011","pp   266\u2013277","https://doi.org/10.1145/2043164.2018467"],"date":"15 August 2011","ref":[{"text":"M.

Gaze has been shown to matter for a number of aspects of communication and dialogue, especially for managing the flow of the dialogue and participant attention, for deictic referencing, and for the communication of attitude. When developing embodied conversational agents (ECAs) and talking heads, modeling and delivering accurate gaze targets is crucial. Traditionally, systems communicating through talking heads have been displayed to the human conversant using 2D displays, such as flat monitors. This approach introduces severe limitations for an accurate communication of gaze since 2D displays are associated with several powerful effects and illusions, most importantly the Mona Lisa gaze effect, where the gaze of the projected head appears to follow the observer regardless of viewing angle. We describe the Mona Lisa gaze effect and its consequences in the interaction loop, and propose a new approach for displaying talking heads using a 3D projection surface (a physical model of a human head) as an alternative to the traditional flat surface projection. We investigate and compare the accuracy of the perception of gaze direction and the Mona Lisa gaze effect in 2D and 3D projection surfaces in a five subject gaze perception experiment. The experiment confirms that a 3D projection surface completely eliminates the Mona Lisa gaze effect and delivers very accurate gaze direction that is independent of the observer's viewing angle. Based on the data collected in this experiment, we rephrase the formulation of the Mona Lisa gaze effect. The data, when reinterpreted, confirms the predictions of the new model for both 2D and 3D projection surfaces. Finally, we discuss the requirements on different spatially interactive systems in terms of gaze direction, and propose new applications and experiments for interaction in a human-ECA and a human-robot settings made possible by this technology.","author":["Samer Al Moubayed","Jens Edlund","Jonas Beskow"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems","Volume 1","Issue 2","January 2012","Article No.: 11","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2070719.2070724"],"date":"13 January 2012","ref":[{"text":"Abele, A. 1986.

Even after implementing these various features, the base logic layer still contains significant unutilized space, providing an opportunity to add more functionality to the memory stack. One seemingly obvious approach is to add a cache to the base layer, which can potentially provide faster memory access while reducing the number of slow and power-hungry row buffer activations and closings. However, once the details of the internal DRAM buses are properly modeled, along with the timing constraints imposed by modern DRAM technologies, a conventional cache only provides a modest performance benefit. This work proposes a \"file-managed\" row buffer cache (FM-RB$) approach inspired by traditional register allocation and peep-hole optimization ideas from compiler design. By explicitly managing the allocation and deallocation of the row buffer \"registers,\" the FM-RB$ can deliver performance benefits beyond a conventional cache approach.","author":["Gabriel H.

Low-latency and high-IOPS solid-state drives (SSDs) cache data in front of high-capacity disks. However, most existing SSDs are designed to be a drop-in disk replacement, and hence are mismatched for use as a cache. This paper describes FlashTier, a system architecture built upon solid-state cache (SSC), a flash device with an interface designed for caching. Management software at the operating system block layer directs caching. The FlashTier design addresses three limitations of using traditional SSDs for caching. First, FlashTier provides a unified logical address space to reduce the cost of cache block management within both the OS and the SSD. Second, FlashTier provides cache consistency guarantees allowing the cached data to be used following a crash. Finally, FlashTier leverages cache behavior to silently evict data blocks during garbage collection to improve performance of the SSC. We have implemented an SSC simulator and a cache manager in Linux. In trace-based experiments, we show that FlashTier reduces address translation space by 60% and silent eviction improves performance by up to 167%. Furthermore, FlashTier can recover from the crash of a 100GB cache in only 2.4 seconds.","author":["Mohit Saxena","Michael M.

The algorithms of this framework are efficient, robust, and scale well to both very large networks and very large sessions. The framework has been prototyped in wb, a distributed whiteboard application, and has been extensively tested on a global scale with sessions ranging from a few to more than 1000 participants. The paper describes the principles that have guided our design, including the IP multicast group delivery model, an end-to-end, receiver-based model of reliability, and the application level framing protocol model. As with unicast communications, the performance of a reliable multicast delivery algorithm depends on the underlying topology and operational environment. We investigate that dependence via analysis and simulation, and demonstrate an adaptive algorithm that uses the results of previous loss recovery events to adapt the control parameters used for future loss recovery.

Extracting this performance often entails programming in disparate languages and models, making it hard for a programmer to work equally well on all aspects of an application. Further, relatively little attention is paid to co-execution---the problem of orchestrating program execution using multiple distinct computational elements that work seamlessly together. We present Liquid Metal, a comprehensive compiler and runtime system for a new programming language called Lime. Our work enables the use of a single language for programming heterogeneous computing platforms, and the seamless co-execution of the resultant programs on CPUs and accelerators that include GPUs and FPGAs. We have developed a number of Lime applications, and successfully compiled some of these for co-execution on various GPU and FPGA enabled architectures. Our experience so far leads us to believe the Liquid Metal approach is promising and can make the computational power of heterogeneous architectures more easily accessible to mainstream programmers.","author":["Joshua Auerbach","David F.

In the design of memory-based wear leveling approaches, a major challenge is how to efficiently determine the appropriate memory pages for allocation or swapping. In this paper, we present an efficient wear-leveling design that is compatible with existing virtual memory management. Two implementations, namely, bucket-based and array-based wear leveling, with nearly zero search cost are proposed to tradeoff time and space complexity. The results of experiments conducted based on popular benchmarks to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed design are very encouraging.","author":["Chi-Hao Chen","Pi-Cheng Hsiu","Tei-Wei Kuo","Chia-Lin Yang","Cheng-Yuan Michael Wang"],"issue":["DAC '12: Proceedings of the 49th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2012","Pages   453\u2013458","https://doi.org/10.1145/2228360.2228439"],"date":"03 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"L.-P.

In this paper we describe Green-Marl, a domain-specific language (DSL) whose high level language constructs allow developers to describe their graph analysis algorithms intuitively, but expose the data-level parallelism inherent in the algorithms. We also present our Green-Marl compiler which translates high-level algorithmic description written in Green-Marl into an efficient C++ implementation by exploiting this exposed data-level parallelism. Furthermore, our Green-Marl compiler applies a set of optimizations that take advantage of the high-level semantic knowledge encoded in the Green-Marl DSL. We demonstrate that graph analysis algorithms can be written very intuitively with Green-Marl through some examples, and our experimental results show that the compiler-generated implementation out of such descriptions performs as well as or better than highly-tuned hand-coded implementations.","author":["Sungpack Hong","Hassan Chafi","Edic Sedlar","Kunle Olukotun"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 47","Issue 4","April 2012","pp   349\u2013362","https://doi.org/10.1145/2248487.2151013"],"date":"03 March 2012","ref":[{"text":"Green-marl lanaguage specification. http://ppl.stanford.edu/main/green_marl.html.","order":1},{"text":"Pagerank c+ implementation. http://code.grnet.gr/projects/pagerank.","order":2},{"text":"Strongly connected component (kosaraju) java implementation. http://www.keithschwarz.com/interesting/.","order":3},{"text":"V.

These transformed programs have the ability to trade accuracy of their results for increased performance by dynamically and nondeterministically modifying variables that control their execution.We call such transformed programs relaxed programs because they have been extended with additional nondeterminism to relax their semantics and enable greater flexibility in their execution.We present language constructs for developing and specifying relaxed programs. We also present proof rules for reasoning about properties [28] which the program must satisfy to be acceptable. Our proof rules work with two kinds of acceptability properties: acceptability properties [28], which characterize desired relationships between the values of variables in the original and relaxed programs, and unary acceptability properties, which involve values only from a single (original or relaxed) program. The proof rules support a staged reasoning approach in which the majority of the reasoning effort works with the original program. Exploiting the common structure that the original and relaxed programs share, relational reasoning transfers reasoning effort from the original program to prove properties of the relaxed program.We have formalized the dynamic semantics of our target programming language and the proof rules in Coq and verified that the proof rules are sound with respect to the dynamic semantics. Our Coq implementation enables developers to obtain fully machine-checked verifications of their relaxed programs.","author":["Michael Carbin","Deokhwan Kim","Sasa Misailovic","Martin C.

The Softshell model is intuitive and more flexible than the kernel-based adaption of the stream processing model, which is currently the dominant model for general purpose GPU computation. Using the Softshell model, algorithms with a relatively low local degree of parallelism can execute efficiently on massively parallel architectures. Softshell has the following distinct advantages: (1) work can be dynamically issued directly on the device, eliminating the need for synchronization with an external source, i.e., the CPU; (2) its three-tier dynamic scheduler supports arbitrary scheduling strategies, including dynamic priorities and real-time scheduling; and (3) the user can influence, pause, and cancel work already submitted for parallel execution. The Softshell processing model thus brings capabilities to GPU architectures that were previously only known from operating-system designs and reserved for CPU programming. As a proof of our claims, we present a publicly available implementation of the Softshell processing model realized on top of CUDA. The benchmarks of this implementation demonstrate that our processing model is easy to use and also performs substantially better than the state-of-the-art kernel-based processing model for problems that have been difficult to parallelize in the past.","author":["Markus Steinberger","Bernhard Kainz","Bernhard Kerbl","Stefan Hauswiesner","Michael Kenzel","Dieter Schmalstieg"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 31","Issue 6","November 2012","Article No.: 161","pp   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/2366145.2366180"],"date":"01 November 2012","ref":[{"text":"Advanced Micro Devices. 2011.","order":1},{"text":"Agullo, E., Augonnet, C., Dongarra, J., Ltaief, H., Namyst, R., Thibault, S., and Tomov, S. 2010.

To gain valuable business insight and competitive advantage, businesses demand the capability of performing real-time analytics on such data. This, however, involves expensive query operations that are very time consuming on traditional CPUs. Additionally, in traditional database management systems (DBMS), the CPU resources are dedicated to mission-critical transactional workloads. Offloading expensive analytics query operations to a co-processor can allow efficient execution of analytics workloads in parallel with transactional workloads. In this paper, we present a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based acceleration engine for database operations in analytics queries. The proposed solution provides a mechanism for a DBMS to seamlessly harness the FPGA compute power without requiring any changes in the application or the existing data layout. Using a software-programmed query control block, the accelerator can be tailored to execute different queries without reconfiguration. Our prototype is implemented in a PCIe-attached FPGA system and is integrated into a commercial DBMS platform. The results demonstrate up to 94% CPU savings on real customer data compared to the baseline software cost with up to an order of magnitude speedup in the offloaded computations and up to 6.2x improvement in end-to-end performance.","author":["Bharat Sukhwani","Hong Min","Mathew Thoennes","Parijat Dube","Balakrishna Iyer","Bernard Brezzo","Donna Dillenberger","Sameh Asaad"],"issue":["PACT '12: Proceedings of the 21st international conference on Parallel architectures and compilation techniques","September 2012","Pages   411\u2013420","https://doi.org/10.1145/2370816.2370874"],"date":"19 September 2012","ref":[{"text":"http://www.teradata.com/","order":1},{"text":"Krueger, J., et. al. \"Fast Updates on Read Optimized Databases Using MultiCore CPUs\" Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, Vol. 5, No. 1, August 2012.","doi":"10.14778/2047485.2047491","order":2},{"text":"Low, B., Ooi, B., and Wong, C., \"Exploration on Scalability of Database Bulk Insertion with Multi-threading\" Int.

When the input graph cannot fit in main memory, triangle listing requires random disk accesses that can incur prohibitively huge I/O cost. Some streaming, semistreaming, and sampling algorithms have been proposed but these are approximation algorithms. We propose an I/O-efficient algorithm for triangle listing. Our algorithm is exact and avoids random disk access. Our results show that our algorithm is scalable and outperforms the state-of-the-art in-memory and local triangle estimation algorithms.","author":["Shumo Chu","James Cheng"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data","Volume 6","Issue 4","December 2012","Article No.: 17","pp   1\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/2382577.2382581"],"date":"18 December 2012","ref":[{"text":"Abou-Rjeili, A. and Karypis, G. 2006.

Two packages, developed in the mid 1990s, still enjoy regular use: ScaLAPACK and PLAPACK. With the advent of many-core architectures, which may very well take the shape of distributed memory architectures within a single processor, these packages must be revisited since the traditional MPI-based approaches will likely need to be extended. Thus, this is a good time to review lessons learned since the introduction of these two packages and to propose a simple yet effective alternative. Preliminary performance results show the new solution achieves competitive, if not superior, performance on large clusters.","author":["Jack Poulson","Bryan Marker","Robert A. van de Geijn","Jeff R.

At microarchitectural level, McPAT includes models for the fundamental components of a complete chip multiprocessor, including in-order and out-of-order processor cores, networks-on-chip, shared caches, and integrated system components such as memory controllers and Ethernet controllers. At circuit level, McPAT supports detailed modeling of critical-path timing, area, and power. At technology level, McPAT models timing, area, and power for the device types forecast in the ITRS roadmap. McPAT has a flexible XML interface to facilitate its use with many performance simulators.Combined with a performance simulator, McPAT enables architects to accurately quantify the cost of new ideas and assess trade-offs of different architectures using new metrics such as Energy-Delay-Area2 Product (EDA2P) and Energy-Delay-Area Product (EDAP). This article explores the interconnect options of future manycore processors by varying the degree of clustering over generations of process technologies. Clustering will bring interesting trade-offs between area and performance because the interconnects needed to group cores into clusters incur area overhead, but many applications can make good use of them due to synergies from cache sharing. Combining power, area, and timing results of McPAT with performance simulation of PARSEC benchmarks for manycore designs at the 22nm technology shows that 8-core clustering gives the best energy-delay product, whereas when die area is taken into account, 4-core clustering gives the best EDA2P and EDAP.","author":["Sheng Li","Jung Ho Ahn","Richard D.

This problem is especially acute in storage area network (SAN) environments where complex hardware and software layers (distributed file systems, block severs, network stacks, etc.) lie between applications and remote data. These layers can add hundreds of microseconds to requests, obscuring the performance of both flash memory and faster, emerging non-volatile memory technologies. We describe QuickSAN, a SAN prototype that eliminates most software overheads and significantly reduces hardware overheads in SANs. QuickSAN integrates a network adapter into SSDs, so the SSDs can communicate directly with one another to service storage accesses as quickly as possible. QuickSAN can also give applications direct access to both local and remote data without operating system intervention, further reducing software costs. Our evaluation of QuickSAN demonstrates remote access latencies of 20 \u03bcs for 4 KB requests, bandwidth improvements of as much as 163x for small accesses compared with an equivalent iSCSI implementation, and 2.3-3.0x application level speedup for distributed sorting. We also show that QuickSAN improves energy efficiency by up to 96% and that QuickSAN's networking connectivity allows for improved cluster-level energy efficiency under varying load.","author":["Adrian M.

Control software programs the forwarding plane (e.g., switches and routers) using an open interface, such as OpenFlow. This paper aims to overcomes two limitations in current switching chips and the OpenFlow protocol: i) current hardware switches are quite rigid, allowing ``Match-Action'' processing on only a fixed set of fields, and ii) the OpenFlow specification only defines a limited repertoire of packet processing actions. We propose the RMT (reconfigurable match tables) model, a new RISC-inspired pipelined architecture for switching chips, and we identify the essential minimal set of action primitives to specify how headers are processed in hardware. RMT allows the forwarding plane to be changed in the field without modifying hardware. As in OpenFlow, the programmer can specify multiple match tables of arbitrary width and depth, subject only to an overall resource limit, with each table configurable for matching on arbitrary fields. However, RMT allows the programmer to modify all header fields much more comprehensively than in OpenFlow. Our paper describes the design of a 64 port by 10 Gb/s switch chip implementing the RMT model. Our concrete design demonstrates, contrary to concerns within the community, that flexible OpenFlow hardware switch implementations are feasible at almost no additional cost or power.","author":["Pat Bosshart","Glen Gibb","Hun-Seok Kim","George Varghese","Nick McKeown","Martin Izzard","Fernando Mujica","Mark Horowitz"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '13: Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM 2013 conference on SIGCOMM","August 2013","Pages   99\u2013110","https://doi.org/10.1145/2486001.2486011"],"date":"27 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"P.

Many real applications in various fields require efficient and effective management of large-scale graph structured data. Although distributed graph engines such as GBase and Pregel handle billion-scale graphs, the user needs to be skilled at managing and tuning a distributed system in a cluster, which is a nontrivial job for the ordinary user. Furthermore, these distributed systems need many machines in a cluster in order to provide reasonable performance. In order to address this problem, a disk-based parallel graph engine called Graph-Chi, has been recently proposed. Although Graph-Chi significantly outperforms all representative (disk-based) distributed graph engines, we observe that Graph-Chi still has serious performance problems for many important types of graph queries due to 1) limited parallelism and 2) separate steps for I/O processing and CPU processing. In this paper, we propose a general, disk-based graph engine called TurboGraph to process billion-scale graphs very efficiently by using modern hardware on a single PC. TurboGraph is the first truly parallel graph engine that exploits 1) full parallelism including multi-core parallelism and FlashSSD IO parallelism and 2) full overlap of CPU processing and I/O processing as much as possible. Specifically, we propose a novel parallel execution model, called pin-and-slide. TurboGraph also provides engine-level operators such as BFS which are implemented under the pin-and-slide model. Extensive experimental results with large real datasets show that TurboGraph consistently and significantly outperforms Graph-Chi by up to four orders of magnitude! Our implementation of TurboGraph is available at ``http://wshan.net/turbograph}\" as executable files.","author":["Wook-Shin Han","Sangyeon Lee","Kyungyeol Park","Jeong-Hoon Lee","Min-Soo Kim","Jinha Kim","Hwanjo Yu"],"issue":["KDD '13: Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2013","Pages   77\u201385","https://doi.org/10.1145/2487575.2487581"],"date":"11 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"Yahoo webscope. yahoo! altavista web page hyperlink connectivity graph. http://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com.","order":1},{"text":"L.

However, with growing levels of integration, the traditional NoCs suffer from high latency and energy dissipation in on-chip data transfer due to conventional multihop metal/dielectric-based interconnects. Three-dimensional integration, on-chip photonics, RF, and wireless links have been proposed as radical low-power and low-latency alternatives to the conventional planar wire-based designs. Wireless NoCs with Carbon NanoTube (CNT) antennas are shown to outperform traditional wire-based NoCs significantly in achievable data rate and energy dissipation. However, such emerging and transformative technologies will be prone to high levels of failures due to various issues related to manufacturing challenges and integration. On the other hand, several naturally occurring complex networks such as colonies of microbes and the World Wide Web are known to be inherently robust against high rates of failures and harsh environments. This article advocates adoption of such complex network-based architectures to minimize the effect of wireless link failures on the performance of the NoC. Through cycle-accurate simulations it is shown that the wireless NoC architectures inspired by natural complex networks perform better than their conventional wired counterparts even in the presence of high degrees of link failures. We demonstrate the robustness of the proposed wireless NoC architecture by incorporating both uniform and application-specific traffic patterns.","author":["Paul Wettin","Anuroop Vidapalapati","Amlan Gangul","Partha Pratim Pande"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 9","Issue 3","September 2013","Article No.: 24","pp   1\u201319","https://doi.org/10.1145/2491676"],"date":"08 October 2013","ref":[{"text":"Albert, R. and Barabasi, A.-L. 2002.

However, emerging nonvolatile memory technologies (sometimes referred to as storage class memory (SCM)), are poised to revolutionize storage systems. The SCM devices can be attached directly to the memory bus and offer fast, fine-grained access to persistent storage.In this article, we propose a new file system---SCMFS, which is specially designed for Storage Class Memory. SCMFS is implemented on the virtual address space and utilizes the existing memory management module of the operating system to help mange the file system space. As a result, we largely simplified the file system operations of SCMFS, which allowed us a better exploration of performance gain from SCM. We have implemented a prototype in Linux and evaluated its performance through multiple benchmarks. The experimental results show that SCMFS outperforms other memory resident file systems, tmpfs, ramfs and ext2 on ramdisk, and achieves about 70% of memory bandwidth for file read/write operations.","author":["Xiaojian Wu","Sheng Qiu","A.

Existing DRAM cache designs fall into one of two categories --- block-based and page-based. The former organize data in conventional blocks (e.g., 64B), ensuring low off-chip bandwidth utilization, but co-locate tags and data in the stacked DRAM, incurring high lookup latency. Furthermore, such designs suffer from low hit ratios due to poor temporal locality. In contrast, page-based caches, which manage data at larger granularity (e.g., 4KB pages), allow for reduced tag array overhead and fast lookup, and leverage high spatial locality at the cost of moving large amounts of data on and off the chip.This paper introduces Footprint Cache, an efficient die-stacked DRAM cache design for server processors. Footprint Cache allocates data at the granularity of pages, but identifies and fetches only those blocks within a page that will be touched during the page's residency in the cache --- i.e., the page's footprint. In doing so, Footprint Cache eliminates the excessive off-chip traffic associated with page-based designs, while preserving their high hit ratio, small tag array overhead, and low lookup latency. Cycle-accurate simulation results of a 16-core server with up to 512MB Footprint Cache indicate a 57% performance improvement over a baseline chip without a die-stacked cache. Compared to a state-of-the-art block-based design, our design improves performance by 13% while reducing dynamic energy of stacked DRAM by 24%.","author":["Djordje Jevdjic","Stavros Volos","Babak Falsafi"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 41","Issue 3","June 2013","pp   404\u2013415","https://doi.org/10.1145/2508148.2485957"],"date":"23 June 2013","ref":[{"text":"J.

Loss of accuracy is not permissible in all computing domains, but there are a growing number of data-intensive domains where the output of programs need not be perfectly correct to provide useful results or even noticeable differences to the end user. These soft domains include multimedia processing, machine learning, and data mining/analysis. An important challenge with approximate computing is transparency to insulate both software and hardware developers from the time, cost, and difficulty of using approximation. This paper proposes a software-only system, Paraprox, for realizing transparent approximation of data-parallel programs that operates on commodity hardware systems. Paraprox starts with a data-parallel kernel implemented using OpenCL or CUDA and creates a parameterized approximate kernel that is tuned at runtime to maximize performance subject to a target output quality (TOQ) that is supplied by the user. Approximate kernels are created by recognizing common computation idioms found in data-parallel programs (e.g., Map, Scatter/Gather, Reduction, Scan, Stencil, and Partition) and substituting approximate implementations in their place. Across a set of 13 soft data-parallel applications with at most 10% quality degradation, Paraprox yields an average performance gain of 2.7x on a NVIDIA GTX 560 GPU and 2.5x on an Intel Core i7 quad-core processor compared to accurate execution on each platform.","author":["Mehrzad Samadi","Davoud Anoushe Jamshidi","Janghaeng Lee","Scott Mahlke"],"issue":["ASPLOS '14: Proceedings of the 19th international conference on Architectural support for programming languages and operating systems","February 2014","Pages   35\u201350","https://doi.org/10.1145/2541940.2541948"],"date":"24 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"The credit card equation, 2013. http://faculty.bennington.edu/~jzimba/CreditCardEquation Derivation.pdf.","order":1},{"text":"A.

While provenance models have been extensively discussed in recent years, little attention has been given to the efficient implementation of provenance-enabled queries inside data stores. This paper introduces TripleProv: a new system extending a native RDF store to efficiently handle such queries. TripleProv implements two different storage models to physically co-locate lineage and instance data, and for each of them implements algorithms for tracing provenance at two granularity levels. In the following, we present the overall architecture of our system, its different lineage storage models, and the various query execution strategies we have implemented to efficiently answer provenance-enabled queries. In addition, we present the results of a comprehensive empirical evaluation of our system over two different datasets and workloads.","author":["Marcin Wylot","Philippe Cudre-Mauroux","Paul Groth"],"issue":["WWW '14: Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World wide web","April 2014","Pages   455\u2013466","https://doi.org/10.1145/2566486.2568014"],"date":"07 April 2014","ref":[{"text":"J.

In this work, we propose an unsupervised tri-clustering framework, which analyzes both user-level and tweet-level sentiments through co-clustering of a tripartite graph. A compelling feature of the proposed framework is that the quality of sentiment clustering of tweets, users, and features can be mutually improved by joint clustering. We further investigate the evolution of user-level sentiments and latent feature vectors in an online framework and devise an efficient online algorithm to sequentially update the clustering of tweets, users and features with newly arrived data. The online framework not only provides better quality of both dynamic user-level and tweet-level sentiment analysis, but also improves the computational and storage efficiency. We verified the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches on the November 2012 California ballot Twitter data.","author":["Linhong Zhu","Aram Galstyan","James Cheng","Kristina Lerman"],"issue":["SIGMOD '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","June 2014","Pages   1531\u20131542","https://doi.org/10.1145/2588555.2593682"],"date":"18 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"S.

However, such load/store accessible Persistent Memory (PM) has implications on system design, both hardware and software. In this paper, we explore system software support to enable low-overhead PM access by new and legacy applications. To this end, we implement PMFS, a light-weight POSIX file system that exploits PM's byte-addressability to avoid overheads of block-oriented storage and enable direct PM access by applications (with memory-mapped I/O). PMFS exploits the processor's paging and memory ordering features for optimizations such as fine-grained logging (for consistency) and transparent large page support (for faster memory-mapped I/O). To provide strong consistency guarantees, PMFS requires only a simple hardware primitive that provides software enforceable guarantees of durability and ordering of stores to PM. Finally, PMFS uses the processor's existing features to protect PM from stray writes, thereby improving reliability. Using a hardware emulator, we evaluate PMFS's performance with several workloads over a range of PM performance characteristics. PMFS shows significant (up to an order of magnitude) gains over traditional file systems (such as ext4) on a RAMDISK-like PM block device, demonstrating the benefits of optimizing system software for PM.","author":["Subramanya R.

In particular, 3D IC is a good candidate to address the design issues in conventional analog/digital mixed-signal IC designs. In this work, we focus on modeling and analyzing the impacts of through silicon vias (TSVs) on mixed-signal ICs. Based on the analysis, a set of design methodologies for 3D mixed-signal ICs are proposed. The design methodologies are verified with a case study, in which a 12-bit successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC) is re-designed by partitioning it into three stacked layers for 3D integration. The experimental results show that, compared to the traditional 2D counterpart, our 3D SAR ADC with optimized TSV placement can achieve significant area and power reduction, and performance improvement. Specifically, due to the isolation of substrate noise disturbance in our 3D design, the signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR) is improved from 68.74 dB to 74.12 dB.","author":["Wulong Liu","Guoqing Chen","Xue Han","Yu Wang","Yuan Xie","Huazhong Yang"],"issue":["DAC '14: Proceedings of the 51st Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2014","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2593069.2593122"],"date":"01 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"Y.

To increase the scale even further, we need to explore automatic methods for constructing knowledge bases. Previous approaches have primarily focused on text-based extraction, which can be very noisy. Here we introduce Knowledge Vault, a Web-scale probabilistic knowledge base that combines extractions from Web content (obtained via analysis of text, tabular data, page structure, and human annotations) with prior knowledge derived from existing knowledge repositories. We employ supervised machine learning methods for fusing these distinct information sources. The Knowledge Vault is substantially bigger than any previously published structured knowledge repository, and features a probabilistic inference system that computes calibrated probabilities of fact correctness. We report the results of multiple studies that explore the relative utility of the different information sources and extraction methods.","author":["Xin Dong","Evgeniy Gabrilovich","Geremy Heitz","Wilko Horn","Ni Lao","Kevin Murphy","Thomas Strohmann","Shaohua Sun","Wei Zhang"],"issue":["KDD '14: Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2014","Pages   601\u2013610","https://doi.org/10.1145/2623330.2623623"],"date":"24 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"AKBC-WEKEX.

However, like other real HTMs, such as IBM's Blue Gene/Q, Haswell's RTM is best-effort, meaning it provides no transactional forward progress guarantees. Because of this, a software fallback system must be used in conjunction with Haswell's RTM to ensure transactional programs execute to completion. To complicate matters, Haswell does not provide escape actions. Without escape actions, non-transactional instructions cannot be executed within the context of a hardware transaction, thereby restricting the ways in which a software fallback can interact with the HTM. As such, the challenge of creating a scalable hybrid TM (HyTM) that uses Haswell's RTM and a software TM (STM) fallback is exacerbated. In this paper, we present Invyswell, a novel HyTM that exploits the benefits and manages the limitations of Haswell's RTM. After describing Invyswell's design, we show that it outperforms NOrec, a state-of-the-art STM, by 35%, Hybrid NOrec, NOrec's hybrid implementation, by 18%, and Haswell's hardware-only lock elision by 25% across all STAMP benchmarks.","author":["Irina Calciu","Justin Gottschlich","Tatiana Shpeisman","Gilles Pokam","Maurice Herlihy"],"issue":["PACT '14: Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on Parallel architectures and compilation","August 2014","Pages   187\u2013200","https://doi.org/10.1145/2628071.2628086"],"date":"24 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"A.-R.

These features include low power, high density, and better scalability. However, there are also two drawbacks in MLC PCM, namely, limited write endurance and expensive write operation, that need to be overcome in order to practically adopt MLC PCM as main memory. In MLC PCM, two different types of write operations with very diverse data retention time are allowed. The first type maintains data for years, but takes longer time to write and hurts the endurance. The second type maintains data for a short period, but takes shorter time to write and hurts the endurance less. By observing that many data written to main memory are temporary and do not need to last long during the execution of a program, in this paper, we propose novel task scheduling and write operation selection algorithms to improve MLC PCM endurance and program efficiency. An Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation is first proposed to obtain optimal results. Since ILP takes exponential time to solve, we also propose a Multi-Write Mode Aware Scheduling (MMAS) heuristic to achieve near-optimal solution in polynomial time. The experimental results show that the proposed techniques can greatly improve the lifetime of MLC PCM as well as the efficiency of the program.","author":["Chen Pan","Mimi Xie","Jingtong Hu","Yiran Chen","Chengmo Yang"],"issue":["CODES '14: Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis","October 2014","Article No.: 33","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2656075.2656076"],"date":"12 October 2014","ref":[{"text":"http://www.eecs.umich.edu/mibench/.","order":1},{"text":"http://euler.slu.edu/~fritts/mediabench/.","order":2},{"text":"http://gcc.gnu.org/.","order":3},{"text":"http://www.lindo.com/.","order":4},{"text":"M.

On the other hand, the wireless Network-on-Chip (WiNoC) architecture has emerged as an energy-efficient and high bandwidth communication backbone for massively integrated multicore platforms. It becomes therefore possible to exploit the small-world effects induced by the wireless links of a WiNoC to achieve efficient inter-VFI data exchanges. In this work, we demonstrate that WiNoCs can provide better latency and energy profiles compared to traditional mesh-like architecture for VFI-partitioned multicore designs. The performance gains and energy efficiency are achieved due to the low-power wireless shortcuts in conjunction with the small-world architecture. Indeed, our experimental results show energy improvements as large as 40% for multithreaded application benchmarks.","author":["Ryan Kim","Guangshuo Liu","Paul Wettin","Radu Marculescu","Diana Marculescu","Partha Pratim Pande"],"issue":["CASES '14: Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Compilers, Architecture and Synthesis for Embedded Systems","October 2014","Article No.: 3","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/2656106.2656120"],"date":"12 October 2014","ref":[{"text":"S.

We improve previous definitions in order to tolerate adversaries that learn whether or not clients accept the result of a delegated computation. In this strong model, we construct a scheme for arbitrary computations and highly efficient schemes for delegation of various classes of functions, such as linear combinations, high-degree univariate polynomials, and multivariate quadratic polynomials. Notably, the latter class includes many useful statistics. Using our solution, a client can store a large encrypted dataset on a server, query statistics over this data, and receive encrypted results that can be efficiently verified and decrypted.  As a key contribution for the efficiency of our schemes, we develop a novel homomorphic hashing technique that allows us to efficiently authenticate computations, at the same cost as if the data were in the clear, avoiding a $10^4$ overhead which would occur with a naive approach. We support our theoretical constructions with extensive implementation tests that show the practical feasibility of our schemes.","author":["Dario Fiore","Rosario Gennaro","Valerio Pastro"],"issue":["CCS '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","November 2014","Pages   844\u2013855","https://doi.org/10.1145/2660267.2660366"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"B.

This text representation results in a very high dimensionality of feature space and frequently suffers from surface mismatching. Short texts make these issues even more serious, due to their shortness and sparsity. In this paper, we propose using ``Bag-of-Concepts'' in short text representation, aiming to avoid the surface mismatching and handle the synonym and polysemy problem. Based on ``Bag-of-Concepts,'' a novel framework is proposed for lightweight short text classification applications. By leveraging a large taxonomy knowledgebase, it learns a concept model for each category, and conceptualizes a short text to a set of relevant concepts. A concept-based similarity mechanism is presented to classify the given short text to the most similar category. One advantage of this mechanism is that it facilitates short text ranking after classification, which is needed in many applications, such as query or ad recommendation. We demonstrate the usage of our proposed framework through a real online application: Channel-based Query Recommendation. Experiments show that our framework can map queries to channels with a high degree of precision (avg. precision=90.3%), which is critical for recommendation applications.","author":["Fang Wang","Zhongyuan Wang","Zhoujun Li","Ji-Rong Wen"],"issue":["CIKM '14: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2014","Pages   1069\u20131078","https://doi.org/10.1145/2661829.2662067"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"C.

However, further scaling PCM cell in deep sub-micron regime results in significant thermal based write disturbance (WD). Naively allocating large inter-cell space increases cell size from 4F2 ideal to 12F2. While a recent work mitigates WD along word-lines through disturbance resilient data encoding, it is ineffective for WD along bit-lines, which is more severe due to widely adopted $\\mu$Trench structure in constructing PCM cell arrays. Without mitigating WD along bit-lines, a PCM cell still has 8F2, which is 100% larger than the ideal. In this paper, we propose SD-PCM for achieving reliable write operations in super dense PCM. In particular, we focus on mitigating WD along bit-lines such that we can construct super dense PCM chips with 4F2 cell size, i.e., the minimal for diode-switch based PCM. Based on simple verification-n-correction (VnC), we propose LazyCorrection and PreRead to effectively reduce VnC overhead and minimize cascading verification during write. We further propose (n:m)-Alloc for achieving good tradeoff between VnC overhead minimization and memory capacity loss. Our experimental results show that, comparing to a WD-free low density PCM, SD-PCM achieves 80% capacity improvement in cell arrays while incurring around 0-10% performance degradation when using different (n:m) allocators.","author":["Rujia Wang","Lei Jiang","Youtao Zhang","Jun Yang"],"issue":["ASPLOS '15: Proceedings of the Twentieth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2015","Pages   19\u201331","https://doi.org/10.1145/2694344.2694352"],"date":"14 March 2015","ref":[{"text":"Pin tool. https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pintool.","order":1},{"text":"Spec2006 benchmarks. http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/.","order":2},{"text":"Stream benchmark. http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/.","order":3},{"text":"S.

While IoT provides us many valuable benefits, IoT also exposes us to many different types of security threats in our daily life. Before the advent of IoT, most security threats were just related to information leakage and the loss of service. With IoT, security threats have become closely related to our non-virtual lives and they can directly influence physical security risk. The Internet of Things consists of various platforms and devices with different capabilities, and each system will need security solutions depending on its characteristics. There is a demand for security solutions that are able to support multi-profile platforms and provide equivalent security levels for various device interactions. In addition, user privacy will become more important in the IoT environment because a lot of personal information will be delivered and shared among connected things. Therefore, we need mechanisms to protect personal data and monitor their flow from things to the cloud.

Current datacenter networks inherit the principles that went into the design of the Internet, where packet transmission and path selection decisions are distributed among the endpoints and routers. Instead, we propose that each sender should delegate control---to a centralized arbiter---of when each packet should be transmitted and what path it should follow.This paper describes Fastpass, a datacenter network architecture built using this principle. Fastpass incorporates two fast algorithms: the first determines the time at which each packet should be transmitted, while the second determines the path to use for that packet. In addition, Fastpass uses an efficient protocol between the endpoints and the arbiter and an arbiter replication strategy for fault-tolerant failover. We deployed and evaluated Fastpass in a portion of Facebook's datacenter network. Our results show that Fastpass achieves high throughput comparable to current networks at a 240x reduction is queue lengths (4.35 Mbytes reducing to 18 Kbytes), achieves much fairer and consistent flow throughputs than the baseline TCP (5200x reduction in the standard deviation of per-flow throughput with five concurrent connections), scalability from 1 to 8 cores in the arbiter implementation with the ability to schedule 2.21 Terabits/s of traffic in software on eight cores, and a 2.5x reduction in the number of TCP retransmissions in a latency-sensitive service at Facebook.","author":["Jonathan Perry","Amy Ousterhout","Hari Balakrishnan","Devavrat Shah","Hans Fugal"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 44","Issue 4","October 2014","pp   307\u2013318","https://doi.org/10.1145/2740070.2626309"],"date":"17 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"Packet processing on intel architecture. http://www.intel.com/go/dpdk.","order":1},{"text":"Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual.

In this paper, we show how tunneling field effect transistors (TFETs) can be utilized to enhance the performance of CNNs. Specifically, power consumption of TFET-based CNNs can be significantly lower when compared to MOSFET-based CNNs due to improved voltage controlled current sources (VCCSs) - an important component in CNN systems. We demonstrate that CNNs can benefit from low power conventional linear VCCSs implemented via TFETs. We also show that TFETs can be useful to realize non-linear VCCSs, which are either not possible or exhibit degraded performance when implemented via CMOS. Such non-linear VCCSs help to improve the performance of certain CNN operations (e.g., global maximum/minimum). We provide two case studies - image contrast enhancement and maximum row selection - that illustrate the benefits of non-linear VCCSs (e.g., reduced computation time, energy dissipation, etc.) when compared to CMOS-based approaches.","author":["Qiuwen Lou","Indranil Palit","Andras Horvath","X.

Existing efforts on this front are mostly focused on approximate circuit design, approximate logic synthesis or processor architecture approximation techniques. This work aims at how to make good use of approximate circuits at system and block level. In particular, approximation aware scheduling, functional unit allocation and binding algorithms are developed for data intensive applications. Simple yet credible error models, which are essential for precision control in the optimizations, are investigated. The algorithms are further extended to include bitwidth optimization in fixed point computations.

Training methods have been proposed to program the memristors in a crossbar by following existing training algorithms in neural network models. However, the robustness of these training methods has not been well investigated by taking into account the limits imposed by realistic hardware implementations. In this work, we present a quantitative analysis on the impact of device imperfections and circuit design constraints on the robustness of two popular training methods -- \"close-loop on-device\" (CLD) and \"open-loop off-device\" (OLD). A novel variation-aware training scheme, namely, Vortex, is then invented to enhance the training robustness of memristor crossbar-based NCS by actively compensating the impact of device variations and optimizing the mapping scheme from computations to crossbars. On average, Vortex can significantly improve the test rate by 29.6% and 26.4%, compared to the traditional OLD and CLD, respectively.","author":["Beiye Liu","Hai Li","Yiran Chen","Xin Li","Qing Wu","Tingwen Huang"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 15","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744930"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"A.

Further, these platforms are starting to host multiple applications concurrently on the multiple CPU cores. Unfortunately, today's hardware exposes an interface that forces the host software (Android drivers) to treat each IP core as an isolated device. Consequently, the host CPU has to get involved in the (i) processing of each frame, (ii) scheduling them to ensure timely progress through the IP cores to meet their QoS needs, and (iii) explicitly having to move data from one IP core to the next, with main memory serving as the common staging area. We show in this paper through measurements on a Nexus 7 platform that the frequent invocation of the CPU for processing these frames and the involvement of main memory as a data flow conduit, are serious limitations. Instead, we propose a novel IP virtualization framework (VIP), involving three key ideas that allow several IPs to be chained together and made to appear to the software as a single device. First, chaining of IPs avoids data transfer through the memory system, enhancing the throughput of flows through the IPs. Second, by using a burst-mode, the CPU can initiate the processing of several frames through the virtual IP chain, without getting involved (and interrupted) for each frame, thereby allowing better energy saving and utilization opportunities. Removing the CPU from this loop, requires alternate orchestration of frame flows to ensure QoS guarantees for each frame of each application. Our third enhancement in VIP creates several virtual paths, one for each flow, through these IP chains with the hardware scheduling the frames to enforce QoS guarantees despite any contention for resources along the way. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of VIP on energy consumption and QoS for multiple applications.","author":["Nachiappan Chidambaram Nachiappan","Haibo Zhang","Jihyun Ryoo","Niranjan Soundararajan","Anand Sivasubramaniam","Mahmut T.

GPUs achieve superior performance by making use of massive multi-threading and fast context-switching to hide pipeline stalls and memory access latency. However, recent characterization results have shown that general purpose GPU (GPGPU) applications commonly encounter long stall latencies that cannot be easily hidden with the large number of concurrent threads/warps. This results in varying execution time disparity between different parallel warps, hurting the overall performance of GPUs -- the warp criticality problem. To tackle the warp criticality problem, we propose a coordinated solution, criticality-aware warp acceleration (CAWA), that efficiently manages compute and memory resources to accelerate the critical warp execution. Specifically, we design (1) an instruction-based and stall-based criticality predictor to identify the critical warp in a thread-block, (2) a criticality-aware warp scheduler that preferentially allocates more time resources to the critical warp, and (3) a criticality-aware cache reuse predictor that assists critical warp acceleration by retaining latency-critical and useful cache blocks in the L1 data cache. CAWA targets to remove the significant execution time disparity in order to improve resource utilization for GPGPU workloads. Our evaluation results show that, under the proposed coordinated scheduler and cache prioritization management scheme, the performance of the GPGPU workloads can be improved by 23% while other state-of-the-art schedulers, GTO and 2-level schedulers, improve performance by 16% and -2% respectively.","author":["Shin-Ying Lee","Akhil Arunkumar","Carole-Jean Wu"],"issue":["ISCA '15: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2015","Pages   515\u2013527","https://doi.org/10.1145/2749469.2750418"],"date":"13 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"A.

The efficiency of the new implementation was aided by a clear strategy that arose from a theoretical analysis of the scheduling algorithm: concentrate on minimizing overheads that contribute to the work, even at the expense of overheads that contribute to the critical path. Although it may seem counterintuitive to move overheads onto the critical path, this \"work-first\" principle has led to a portable Cilk-5 implementation in which the typical cost of spawning a parallel thread is only between 2 and 6 times the cost of a C function call on a variety of contemporary machines. Many Cilk programs run on one processor with virtually no degradation compared to equivalent C programs. This paper describes how the work-first principle was exploited in the design of Cilk-5's compiler and its runtime system. In particular, we present Cilk-5's novel \"two-clone\" compilation strategy and its Dijkstra-like mutual-exclusion protocol for implementing the ready deque in the work-stealing scheduler.","author":["Matteo Frigo","Charles E.

Typically, these graphs are represented using node-link diagrams. In these areas differentiating between cyclic and acyclic subgraphs shows important information about the structure and eases the analysis of these graphs. However, existing approaches are uniform and do not differentiate between different structures while computing the layout of the directed graph. We propose a topology-based approach that decomposes directed graphs into subgraphs for different topological structures, builds a two-level hierarchy of coarse grained graphs, and applies optimized area-aware layout algorithms to draw them. We applied our approach to one synthetic data set for illustration purposes and to one real data set showing usage dependencies in a software system. The results show that the different structural components of the directed graphs can be clearly identified.","author":["Ala Abuthawabeh","Dirk Zeckzer"],"issue":["SCCG '15: Proceedings of the 31st Spring Conference on Computer Graphics","April 2015","Pages   89\u201396","https://doi.org/10.1145/2788539.2788551"],"date":"22 April 2015","ref":[{"text":"AlTarawneh, R., Langbein, M., Humayoun, S.

This is true for conventional databases as well as spatial databases, where typical search operations include the point query (find all objects that contain a given search point) and the region query (find all objects that overlap a given search region). More than ten years of spatial database research have resulted in a great variety of multidimensional access methods to support such operations. We give an overview of that work. After a brief survey of spatial data management in general, we first present the class of point access methods, which are used to search sets of points in two or more dimensions. The second part of the paper is devoted to  spatial access methods to handle extended objects, such as rectangles or polyhedra. We conclude with a discussion of theoretical and experimental results concerning the relative performance of various approaches.","author":["Volker Gaede","Oliver G\u00fcnther"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 30","Issue 2","June 1998","pp   170\u2013231","https://doi.org/10.1145/280277.280279"],"date":"01 June 1998","ref":[{"text":"ABEL, D.

Most scientific reports show performance improvements of new techniques and are thus obliged to ensure reproducibility or at least interpretability. Our investigation of a stratified sample of 120 papers across three top conferences in the field shows that the state of the practice is lacking. For example, it is often unclear if reported improvements are deterministic or observed by chance. In addition to distilling best practices from existing work, we propose statistically sound analysis and reporting techniques and simple guidelines for experimental design in parallel computing and codify them in a portable benchmarking library. We aim to improve the standards of reporting research results and initiate a discussion in the HPC field. A wide adoption of our minimal set of rules will lead to better interpretability of performance results and improve the scientific culture in HPC.","author":["Torsten Hoefler","Roberto Belli"],"issue":["SC '15: Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2015","Article No.: 73","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2807591.2807644"],"date":"15 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"D.

Accordingly, researchers and industry practitioners alike have focused a great deal of effort designing network fabrics to efficiently interconnect and manage the traffic within these datacenters in performant yet efficient fashions. Unfortunately, datacenter operators are generally reticent to share the actual requirements of their applications, making it challenging to evaluate the practicality of any particular design.Moreover, the limited large-scale workload information available in the literature has, for better or worse, heretofore largely been provided by a single datacenter operator whose use cases may not be widespread. In this work, we report upon the network traffic observed in some of Facebook's datacenters. While Facebook operates a number of traditional datacenter services like Hadoop, its core Web service and supporting cache infrastructure exhibit a number of behaviors that contrast with those reported in the literature. We report on the contrasting locality, stability, and predictability of network traffic in Facebook's datacenters, and comment on their implications for network architecture, traffic engineering, and switch design.","author":["Arjun Roy","Hongyi Zeng","Jasmeet Bagga","George Porter","Alex C.

Three themes unify the five generations of datacenter networks detailed in this paper. First, multi-stage Clos topologies built from commodity switch silicon can support cost-effective deployment of building-scale networks. Second, much of the general, but complex, decentralized network routing and management protocols supporting arbitrary deployment scenarios were overkill for single-operator, pre-planned datacenter networks. We built a centralized control mechanism based on a global configuration pushed to all datacenter switches. Third, modular hardware design coupled with simple, robust software allowed our design to also support inter-cluster and wide-area networks. Our datacenter networks run at dozens of sites across the planet, scaling in capacity by 100x over ten years to more than 1Pbps of bisection bandwidth.","author":["Arjun Singh","Joon Ong","Amit Agarwal","Glen Anderson","Ashby Armistead","Roy Bannon","Seb Boving","Gaurav Desai","Bob Felderman","Paulie Germano","Anand Kanagala","Jeff Provost","Jason Simmons","Eiichi Tanda","Jim Wanderer","Urs H\u00f6lzle","Stephen Stuart","Amin Vahdat"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 45","Issue 4","October 2015","pp   183\u2013197","https://doi.org/10.1145/2829988.2787508"],"date":"17 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"Ahn, J.

One way to combat the variability in machine response time is to add replicas of straggling tasks and wait for the earliest copy to finish. Using the theory of extreme order statistics, we analyze how task replication reduces latency, and its impact on the cost of computing resources. We also propose a heuristic algorithm to search for the best replication strategies when it is difficult to model the empirical behavior of task execution time and use the proposed analysis techniques. Evaluation of the heuristic policies on Google Trace data shows a significant latency reduction compared to the replication strategy used in MapReduce.","author":["Da Wang","Gauri Joshi","Gregory Wornell"],"issue":["ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review","Volume 43","Issue 3","December 2015","pp   7\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/2847220.2847223"],"date":"19 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"Google cluster data. http://code.google.com/p/googleclusterdata/.","order":1},{"text":"Ananthanarayanan, G., Ghodsi, A., and S.

Meanwhile, FPGA provides a power-efficient and highly parallel platform for many applications, and has been applied to custom computing in many domains. In this paper, we describe FPGP (FPGA Graph Processing), a streamlined vertex-centric graph processing framework on FPGA, based on the interval-shard structure. FPGP is adaptable to different graph algorithms and users do not need to change the whole implementation on the FPGA. In our implementation, an on-chip parallel graph processor is proposed to both maximize the off-chip bandwidth of graph data and fully utilize the parallelism of graph processing. Meanwhile, we analyze the performance of FPGP and show the scalability of FPGP when the bandwidth of data path increases. FPGP is more power-efficient than single machine systems and scalable to larger graphs compared with other FPGA-based graph systems.","author":["Guohao Dai","Yuze Chi","Yu Wang","Huazhong Yang"],"issue":["FPGA '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2016","Pages   105\u2013110","https://doi.org/10.1145/2847263.2847339"],"date":"21 February 2016","ref":[{"text":"J.

The large amount of data associated with process variables monitored over time form a rich reservoir of information, which can be used for a variety of purposes, such as anomaly detection, quality control, and fault diagnostics. In particular, following the same recipe for a certain Integrated Circuit device, multiple tools and chambers can be deployed for the production of this device, during which multiple time series can be collected, such as temperature, impedance, gas flow, electric bias, etc. These time series naturally fit into a two-dimensional array (matrix), i.e., each element in this array corresponds to a time series for one process variable from one chamber. To leverage the rich structural information in such temporal data, in this article, we propose a novel framework named C-Struts to simultaneously cluster on the two dimensions of this array. In this framework, we interpret the structural information as a set of constraints on the cluster membership, introduce an auxiliary probability distribution accordingly, and design an iterative algorithm to assign each time series to a certain cluster on each dimension. Furthermore, we establish the equivalence between C-Struts and a generic optimization problem, which is able to accommodate various distance functions. Extensive experiments on synthetic, benchmark, as well as manufacturing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","author":["Yada Zhu","Jingrui He"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data","Volume 10","Issue 4","July 2016","Article No.: 43","pp   1\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/2875427"],"date":"24 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"Arindam Banerjee, Inderjit S.

Several efforts have argued that accurate throughput prediction can dramatically improve (1) initial bitrate selection for low startup delay and high initial resolution; (2) midstream bitrate adaptation for high QoE. However, prior ef- forts did not systematically quantify real-world throughput predictability or develop good prediction algorithms. To bridge this gap, this paper makes three key technical contributions: First, we analyze the throughput characteristics in a dataset with 20M+ sessions. We find: (a) Sessions sharing similar key features (e.g., ISP, region) present similar initial values and dynamical patterns; (b) There is a natural \u201cstateful\u201d dynamical behavior within a given session. Second, building on these insights, we develop CS2P, a better throughput prediction system. CS2P leverages data-driven approach to learn (a) clusters of similar sessions, (b) an initial throughput predictor, and (c) a Hidden-Markov-Model based midstream predictor modeling the stateful evolution of throughput. Third, we develop a prototype system and show by trace-driven simulation and real-world experiments that CS2P outperforms state-of-art by 40% and 50% median pre- diction error respectively for initial and midstream through- put and improves QoE by 14% over buffer-based adaptation algorithm.","author":["Yi Sun","Xiaoqi Yin","Junchen Jiang","Vyas Sekar","Fuyuan Lin","Nanshu Wang","Tao Liu","Bruno Sinopoli"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGCOMM Conference","August 2016","Pages   272\u2013285","https://doi.org/10.1145/2934872.2934898"],"date":"22 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"Cisco Visual Networking Index. http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/index.html.","order":1},{"text":"DASH-264 JavaScript reference client landing page 1.4.0. http://dashif.org/reference/players/javascript/1.4.0/samples/dash-if-reference-player/index.html.","order":2},{"text":"Dash.js. https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/wiki.","order":3},{"text":"FCC Measuring Broadband America. http://www.fcc.gov/measuring-broadband-america.","order":4},{"text":"Final Report on the Validation of Objective Models of Video Quality Assessment. http://videoclarity.com/PDF/COM-80E_final_report.pdf.","order":5},{"text":"Hadamard Product. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_product_(matrices).","order":6},{"text":"HSDPA. http://home.ifi.uio.no/paalh/dataset/hsdpa-tcp-logs/.","order":7},{"text":"iQIYI. http://www.iqiyi.com.","order":8},{"text":"MLab NDT. https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/m-lab/ndt/.","order":9},{"text":"Netflix. http://www.netflix.com.","order":10},{"text":"Node.js. https://nodejs.org/en/.","order":11},{"text":"Pathchar. http://www.caida.org/tools/utilities/others/pathchar/.","order":12},{"text":"YouTube live encoder settings, bitrates and resolutions. https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2853702?hl=en.","order":13},{"text":"S.

Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally varound the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.","author":["Marco Tulio Ribeiro","Sameer Singh","Carlos Guestrin"],"issue":["KDD '16: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2016","Pages   1135\u20131144","https://doi.org/10.1145/2939672.2939778"],"date":"13 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"S.

These devices will allow software to access persistent data structures directly in NVRAM using processor loads and stores, however, ensuring consistency of persistent data across power failures and crashes is difficult. Atomic, durable transactions are a widely used abstraction to enforce such consistency. Implementing transactions on NVRAM requires the ability to constrain the order of NVRAM writes, for example, to ensure that a transaction's log record is complete before it is marked committed. Since NVRAM write latencies are expected to be high, minimizing these ordering constraints is critical for achieving high performance. Recent work has proposed programming interfaces to express NVRAM write ordering constraints to hardware so that NVRAM writes may be coalesced and reordered while preserving necessary constraints. Unfortunately, a straightforward implementation of transactions under these interfaces imposes unnecessary constraints. We show how to remove these dependencies through a variety of techniques, notably, deferring commit until after locks are released. We present a comprehensive analysis contrasting two transaction designs across three NVRAM programming interfaces, demonstrating up to 2.5x speedup.","author":["Aasheesh Kolli","Steven Pelley","Ali Saidi","Peter M.

Memory contention is considered to be the major limiting factor of program scalability as data parallelism limits the amount of synchronization or data dependencies between parallel work units. Reflecting the architecture of NUMA systems, contention is modeled at the last-level caches of the compute nodes and the memory nodes using a two-level queuing model to estimate the mean service time of the individual memory nodes. Scalability predictions for individual or co-located parallel applications are based solely on data obtained during a short sampling period at runtime; this allows the presented model to be employed in a variety of scenarios. The proposed model has been implemented into an open-source OpenCL and the GNU OpenMP runtime and evaluated on a 64-core AMD system. For a wide variety of parallel workloads and configurations, the evaluations show that the model is able to predict the scalability of data-parallel kernels with high accuracy.","author":["Younghyun Cho","Surim Oh","Bernhard Egger"],"issue":["PACT '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation","September 2016","Pages   191\u2013205","https://doi.org/10.1145/2967938.2967960"],"date":"11 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"AMD.

Despite technology scaling, the gap between on-chip storage and memory footprint of embedded applications keeps widening. We present a solution to preserve the speedup of accelerators when scaling from small to large data sets. Combining specialized DMA and address translation with a software layer in Linux, our design is transparent to user applications and broadly applicable to any class of SoCs hosting high-throughput accelerators. We demonstrate the robustness of our design across many heterogeneous workload scenarios and memory allocation policies with FPGA-based SoC prototypes featuring twelve concurrent accelerators accessing up to 768MB out of 1GB-addressable DRAM.","author":["Paolo Mantovani","Emilio G.

Using DNA to archive data is an attractive possibility because it is extremely dense, with a raw limit of 1 exabyte/mm3 (109 GB/mm3), and long-lasting, with observed half-life of over 500 years. This paper presents an architecture for a DNA-based archival storage system. It is structured as a key-value store, and leverages common biochemical techniques to provide random access. We also propose a new encoding scheme that offers controllable redundancy, trading off reliability for density. We demonstrate feasibility, random access, and robustness of the proposed encoding with wet lab experiments involving 151 kB of synthesized DNA and a 42 kB random-access subset, and simulation experiments of larger sets calibrated to the wet lab experiments. Finally, we highlight trends in biotechnology that indicate the impending practicality of DNA storage for much larger datasets.","author":["James Bornholt","Randolph Lopez","Douglas M.

The FORTRAN standards committee is currently considering a successor to FORTRAN 77, usually called FORTRAN 8x, that will permit the programmer to explicitly specify vector and array operations.Although FORTRAN 8x will make it convenient to specify explicit vector operations in new programs, it does little for existing code. In order to benefit from the power of vector hardware, existing programs will need to be rewritten in some language (presumably FORTRAN 8x) that permits the explicit specification of vector operations. One way to avoid a massive manual recoding effort is to provide a translator that discovers the parallelism implicit in a FORTRAN program and automatically rewrites that program in FORTRAN 8x.Such a translation from FORTRAN to FORTRAN 8x is not straightforward because FORTRAN DO loops are not always semantically equivalent to the corresponding FORTRAN 8x parallel operation. The semantic difference between these two constructs is precisely captured by the concept of dependence. A translation from FORTRAN to FORTRAN 8x preserves the semantics of the original program if it preserves the dependences in that program.The theoretical background is developed here for employing data dependence to convert FORTRAN programs to parallel form. Dependence is defined and characterized in terms of the conditions that give rise to it; accurate tests to determine dependence are presented; and transformations that use dependence to uncover additional parallelism are discussed.","author":["Randy Allen","Ken Kennedy"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems","Volume 9","Issue 4","Oct. 1987","pp   491\u2013542","https://doi.org/10.1145/29873.29875"],"date":"01 October 1987","ref":[{"text":"AHO, A.

With the transition from planar Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology to FinFETs, FinFET SRAM design has become important. However, increasing leakage power consumption of FinFETs due to aggressive scaling, width quantization, read-write conflict, and process variations make FinFET SRAM design challenging. In this article, we show how Multiparameter Asymmetric (MPA) FinFETs can be used to design ultra-low-leakage and robust 6T SRAM cells. We combine multiple asymmetries, namely, asymmetry in gate work function, source/drain doping concentration, and gate underlap, to address various SRAM design issues all at once. We propose five novel MPA FinFET SRAM cell designs and compare them with symmetric and Single-Parameter Asymmetric (SPA) FinFET SRAM cells using dc and transient metrics. We show that the leakage current of MPA FinFET SRAM cells can be reduced by up to 58 \u00d7 while ensuring reasonable read/write stability metric values. In addition, high stability metric values can be achieved with 22 \u00d7 leakage current reduction compared to the traditional symmetric FinFET SRAM cell. There is no area overhead associated with MPA FinFET SRAM cells.","author":["Abdullah Guler","Niraj K.

In addition to their huge hardware resources, they are also integrated into complete systems on chips (SOCs), e.g., in the latest Xilinx Zynq or Altera Stratix platforms. However, cooperation between FPGAs and their surroundings, and the flexibility of hardware task management could still be improved. For instance, mechanisms have yet to be automated to allow multi-user approaches. A reconfigurable resource can be shared between applications or users only if it has a context-switch ability allowing applications to be paused and resumed in response to system demands. Here, we present a high-level synthesis (HLS) design flow producing a context-switch-capable circuit. The design flow manipulates the intermediate representation of an HLS tool to build the context extraction mechanism and to optimize performance for the circuit produced. The method is based on efficient checkpoint selection and insertion of a powerful scan-chain into the initial circuit. This scan-chain can extract flip-flops or memory content. Experiments with the system produced show that it has a low hardware overhead for many benchmark applications, and that the hardware added has a negligible impact on application performance. Comparisons with current standard methods highlight the efficiency of our contributions.","author":["Alban Bourge","Olivier Muller","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rousseau"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 10","Issue 1","December 2016","Article No.: 9","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/2996199"],"date":"09 December 2016","ref":[{"text":"Ghazanfar Asadi and Mehdi B.

It is clear that for long-term and sustained operation, energy must be harvested from some source. Although a large amount of work has considered how to power sensors on the exterior of structures with solar panels or vibration harvesting, very little attention was given to the problem of how to power sensors deep within a structure e.g. within its foundations. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to wirelessly power sensors deep within concrete using wireless power transfer (WPT). High-frequency WPT as typically used in air experiences high losses due to the high volumetric water content of concrete and thus cannot penetrate more than a few cm. We instead exploit the fact that concrete is reinforced with thick steel rods (\"rebar\") to increase its tensile strength and attempt to use these rods as conduits to guide power through the structure, using low frequency magneto-induction. As an example, with a 1 W input power, 1 mW can be consistently obtained at a distance of over 300 mm, three orders of magnitude better than an air-coupled WPT for the same coil geometry. We investigate the variation in optimal operating frequency with increasing distance and show how to further increase power transfer efficiency to a distant sensor through the use of unloaded, intermediate resonators.","author":["Zhihua Wang","Orfeas Kypris","Andrew Markham"],"issue":["ENSsys'16: Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Energy Harvesting and Energy-Neutral Sensing Systems","November 2016","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2996884.2996885"],"date":"14 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"M.

In contrast to this visionary networked system paradigm, prior research efforts on the IoT are still very fragmented and confined to disjoint explorations of different applications, architecture, security, services, protocol, and economical domains, thus preventing design exploration and optimization from a unified and global perspective. In this context, this survey article first proposes a mathematical modeling framework that is rich in expressivity to capture IoT characteristics from a global perspective. It also sets forward a set of fundamental challenges in sensing, decentralized computation, robustness, energy efficiency, and hardware security based on the proposed modeling framework. Possible solutions are discussed to shed light on future development of the IoT system paradigm.","author":["Yuankun Xue","Ji Li","Shahin Nazarian","Paul Bogdan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 22","Issue 3","May 2017","Article No.: 53","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/3001934"],"date":"21 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"B.

Although approximately 71% of the world is covered in water, only 2.5% of this is fresh water; hence, fresh water is a valuable resource that must be carefully monitored and maintained. In developing countries, 80% of people are without access to potable water. Cholera is still reported in more than 50 countries. In Africa, 75% of the drinking water comes from underground sources, which makes water monitoring an issue of key concern, as water monitoring can be used to track water quality changes over time, identify existing or emerging problems, and design effective intervention programs to remedy water pollution. It is important to have detailed knowledge of potable water quality to enable proper treatment and also prevent contamination. In this article, we review methods for water quality monitoring (WQM) from traditional manual methods to more technologically advanced methods employing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for in situ WQM. In particular, we highlight recent developments in the sensor devices, data acquisition procedures, communication and network architectures, and power management schemes to maintain a long-lived operational WQM system. Finally, we discuss open issues that need to be addressed to further advance automatic WQM using WSNs.","author":["Kofi Sarpong Adu-Manu","Cristiano Tapparello","Wendi Heinzelman","Ferdinand Apietu Katsriku","Jamal-Deen Abdulai"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks","Volume 13","Issue 1","February 2017","Article No.: 4","pp   1\u201341","https://doi.org/10.1145/3005719"],"date":"28 January 2017","ref":[{"text":"F.

This includes invocation of multiple methods, synthesis of inputs to the methods to reach the failing location, and crafting of thread interleavings that cause the erroneous behavior. Neither fuzzing-based testing techniques nor over-approximate static analyses are well positioned to detect such subtle defects while retaining high accuracy alongside satisfactory coverage.  In this paper, we propose a directed, iterative and scalable testing engine that combines the strengths of static and dynamic analysis to help synthesize concurrent executions to expose complex concurrency-induced bugs. Our engine accepts as input the library, its client (either sequential or concurrent) and a specification of correctness. Then, it iteratively refines the client to generate an execution that can break the input specification. Each step of the iterative process includes statically identifying sub-goals towards the goal of failing the specification, generating a plan toward meeting these goals, and merging of the paths traversed dynamically with the plan computed statically via constraint solving to generate a new client. The engine reports full reproduction scenarios, guaranteed to be true, for the bugs it finds.  We have created a prototype of our approach named MINION. We validated MINION by applying it to well-tested concurrent classes from popular Java libraries, including the latest versions of openjdk and google-guava. We were able to detect 31 real crashes across 10 classes in a total of 23 minutes, including previously unknown bugs. Comparison with three other tools reveals that combined, they report only 9 of the 31 crashes (and no other crashes beyond MINION). This is because several of these bugs manifest under deeply nested path conditions (observed maximum of 11), deep nesting of method invocations (observed maximum of 6) and multiple refinement iterations to generate the crash-inducing client.","author":["Malavika Samak","Omer Tripp","Murali Krishna Ramanathan"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 51","Issue 10","October 2016","pp   430\u2013446","https://doi.org/10.1145/3022671.2984040"],"date":"19 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"PushbackReader.java. http://grepcode.com/file/ repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/ openjdk/8u40-b25/java/io/PushbackReader. java/.","order":1},{"text":"The Watson Libraries for Analysis. http://wala. sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page.","order":2},{"text":"A.

As an increasing popular example, exergames, and the alike gesture recognition applications, have attracted extensive research in designing accurate, pervasive and low-cost user interfaces. Recent advances in wireless sensing show promise for a ubiquitous gesture-based interaction interface with Wi-Fi. In this work, we extract complete information of motion-induced Doppler shifts with only commodity Wi-Fi. The key insight is to harness antenna diversity to carefully eliminate random phase shifts while retaining relevant Doppler shifts. We further correlate Doppler shifts with motion directions, and propose a light-weight pipeline to detect, segment, and recognize motions without training. On this basis, we present WiDance, a Wi-Fi-based user interface, which we utilize to design and prototype a contactless dance-pad exergame. Experimental results in typical indoor environment demonstrate a superior performance with an accuracy of 92%, remarkably outperforming prior approaches.","author":["Kun Qian","Chenshu Wu","Zimu Zhou","Yue Zheng","Zheng Yang","Yunhao Liu"],"issue":["CHI '17: Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","May 2017","Pages   1961\u20131972","https://doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025678"],"date":"02 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"Heba Abdelnasser, Moustafa Youssef, and Khaled A.

Previous work on High-Level Synthesis (HLS) DSE mainly focused on finding a tradeoff curve with Pareto-optimal designs. HLS is, however, a single process (component) synthesis method. Very often, the latency of the components requires a specific fixed latency when inserted within a larger system. This work presents a fast multi-threaded method to find the smallest micro-architecture for a given BIP and target latency by discriminating between all different exploration knobs and exploring these concurrently. Experimental results show that our proposed method is very effective and comprehensive results compare the quality of results vs. the speedup of your proposed explorer.","author":["Benjamin Carrion Schafer"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 22","Issue 4","July 2017","Article No.: 65","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041219"],"date":"20 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"Giuseppe Ascia, Vincenzo Catania, Alessandro G.

Such systems need to cater to increasingly dynamic workloads, requiring efficient dynamic resource allocation strategies to satisfy hard or soft real-time constraints. This article provides an extensive survey of hard and soft real-time dynamic resource allocation strategies proposed since the mid-1990s and highlights the emerging trends for multi-/many-core systems. The survey covers a taxonomy of the resource allocation strategies and considers their various optimization objectives, which have been used to provide comprehensive comparison. The strategies employ various principles, such as market and biological concepts, to perform the optimizations. The trend followed by the resource allocation strategies, open research challenges, and likely emerging research directions have also been provided.","author":["Amit Kumar Singh","Piotr Dziurzanski","Hashan Roshantha Mendis","Leandro Soares Indrusiak"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 50","Issue 2","June 2017","Article No.: 24","pp   1\u201340","https://doi.org/10.1145/3057267"],"date":"11 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"Waheed Ahmed, Muhammad Shafique, Lars Bauer, and J\u00f6rg Henkel. 2011.

To create a highly dense communication network between the pre- and post-neurons, RRAM devices are used as synapses in the neuromorphic systems due to many advantages including their small sizes and low-power operations. However, due to RRAM reliability issues, in particular soft-errors, the performance of the RRAM-based neuromorphic systems are significantly degraded. In this article, we propose a novel framework for detecting and resolving the degradation in the system performance due to the RRAM reliability soft-errors. The read and write circuits modifications to implement the framework, and their impact on the delay and energy consumption of the neuromorphic system are also discussed in this article. Using a combination of BRIAN and SPICE simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can restore the accuracy of the example RRAM-based neuromorphic system from 43% back to its target value of 91.6% with a minimal impact on the read (< 0.1% and 1.1% increase in the delay and energy respectively) and write (0% and < 0.1% increase in the delay and energy respectively) operations.","author":["Amr M.S.

Online training for RCS enables hardware-based learning for a given application and reduces the additional error caused by device parameter variations. However, a high occurrence rate of hard faults due to immature fabrication processes and limited write endurance restrict the applicability of on-line training for RCS. We propose a fault-tolerant on-line training method that alternates between a fault-detection phase and a fault-tolerant training phase. In the fault-detection phase, a quiescent-voltage comparison method is utilized. In the training phase, a threshold-training method and a re-mapping scheme is proposed. Our results show that, compared to neural computing without fault tolerance, the recognition accuracy for the Cifar-10 dataset improves from 37% to 83% when using low-endurance RRAM cells, and from 63% to 76% when using RRAM cells with high endurance but a high percentage of initial faults.","author":["Lixue Xia","Mengyun Liu","Xuefei Ning","Krishnendu Chakrabarty","Yu Wang"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 33","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062248"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"M.

As the capacity of DRAM cache is typically large, prior techniques on cache compression, which solely focus on improving cache capacity, provide only a marginal benefit. We show that more performance benefit can be obtained if the compression of the DRAM cache is tailored to provide higher bandwidth. If a DRAM cache can provide two compressed lines in a single access, and both lines are useful, the effective bandwidth of the DRAM cache would double. Unfortunately, it is not straight-forward to compress DRAM caches for bandwidth. The typically used Traditional Set Indexing (TSI) maps consecutive lines to consecutive sets, so the multiple compressed lines obtained from the set are from spatially distant locations and unlikely to be used within a short period of each other. We can change the indexing of the cache to place consecutive lines in the same set to improve bandwidth; however, when the data is incompressible, such spatial indexing reduces effective capacity and causes significant slowdown. Ideally, we would like to have spatial indexing when the data is compressible and TSI otherwise. To this end, we propose Dynamic-Indexing Cache comprEssion (DICE), a dynamic design that can adapt between spatial indexing and TSI, depending on the compressibility of the data. We also propose low-cost Cache Index Predictors (CIP) that can accurately predict the cache indexing scheme on access in order to avoid probing both indices for retrieving a given cache line. Our studies with a 1GB DRAM cache, on a wide range of workloads (including SPEC and Graph), show that DICE improves performance by 19.0% and reduces energy-delay-product by 36% on average. DICE is within 3% of a design that has double the capacity and double the bandwidth. DICE incurs a storage overhead of less than 1KB and does not rely on any OS support.","author":["Vinson Young","Prashant J. Nair","Moinuddin K.

Thus to advance passive sensing, the ability to track fine-grained human mobility information acts as a key enabler. In this paper, we propose Widar, a Wi-Fi-based tracking system that simultaneously estimates a human's moving velocity (both speed and direction) and location at a decimeter level. Instead of applying statistical learning techniques, Widar builds a theoretical model that geometrically quantifies the relationships between CSI dynamics and the user's location and velocity. On this basis, we propose novel techniques to identify frequency components related to human motion from noisy CSI readings and then derive a user's location in addition to velocity. We implement Widar on commercial Wi-Fi devices and validate its performance in real environments. Our results show that Widar achieves decimeter-level accuracy, with a median location error of 25 cm given initial positions and 38 cm without them and a median relative velocity error of 13%.","author":["Kun Qian","Chenshu Wu","Zheng Yang","Yunhao Liu","Kyle Jamieson"],"issue":["Mobihoc '17: Proceedings of the 18th ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing","July 2017","Article No.: 6","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3084041.3084067"],"date":"10 July 2017","ref":[{"text":"Fadel Adib, Zachary Kabelac, and Dina Katabi. 2015.

While ID-based methods, such as collaborative filtering and low-rank factorization, are well known for making recommendations, they are not suitable for news recommendations because candidate articles expire quickly and are replaced with new ones within short spans of time. Word-based methods, which are often used in information retrieval settings, are good candidates in terms of system performance but have issues such as their ability to cope with synonyms and orthographical variants and define \"queries\" from users' historical activities. This paper proposes an embedding-based method to use distributed representations in a three step end-to-end manner: (i) start with distributed representations of articles based on a variant of a denoising autoencoder, (ii) generate user representations by using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with browsing histories as input sequences, and (iii) match and list articles for users based on inner-product operations by taking system performance into consideration. The proposed method performed well in an experimental offline evaluation using past access data on Yahoo! JAPAN's homepage. We implemented it on our actual news distribution system based on these experimental results and compared its online performance with a method that was conventionally incorporated into the system. As a result, the click-through rate (CTR) improved by 23% and the total duration improved by 10%, compared with the conventionally incorporated method. Services that incorporated the method we propose are already open to all users and provide recommendations to over ten million individual users per day who make billions of accesses per month.","author":["Shumpei Okura","Yukihiro Tagami","Shingo Ono","Akira Tajima"],"issue":["KDD '17: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2017","Pages   1933\u20131942","https://doi.org/10.1145/3097983.3098108"],"date":"13 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Kyunghyun Cho, Bart van Merrienboer, Caglar Gulcehre, Dzmitry Bahdanau, Fethi Bougares, Holger Schwenk, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

Managed languages such as Java, Python or Scala are widely used in this setting. However, while these languages can increase productivity, they are often associated with problems such as unpredictable garbage collection pauses or warm-up overheads. We argue that the reason for these problems is that current language runtime systems were not initially designed for the cloud setting. To address this, we propose seven tenets for designing future language runtime systems for cloud data centers. We then outline the design of a general substrate for building such runtime systems, based on these seven tenets.","author":["Martin Maas","Krste Asanovi\u0107","John Kubiatowicz"],"issue":["HotOS '17: Proceedings of the 16th Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems","May 2017","Pages   138\u2013143","https://doi.org/10.1145/3102980.3103003"],"date":"07 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, Manjunath Kudlur, Josh Levenberg, Rajat Monga, Sherry Moore, Derek G.

The proposed codes are well suited for error correction in flash memories for high reliability data storage. The GC codes are constructed from inner extended binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes and outer Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. The extended BCH codes enable high-rate GC codes. Moreover, the decoder can take advantage of soft information. For the first three levels of inner codes we propose an optional Chase soft decoder. In this work, the code construction is explained and a decoder architecture is presented. Furthermore, area and throughput results are discussed.","author":["Jens Spinner","J\u00fcrgen Freudenberger"],"issue":["SBCCI '17: Proceedings of the 30th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design: Chip on the Sands","August 2017","Pages   185\u2013190","https://doi.org/10.1145/3109984.3109989"],"date":"28 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"2010.","order":1},{"text":"D Chase. 1972.

Blockchain is a fault-tolerant distributed ledger that does not need an administrator. We call transfer of digital asset as a \"transaction\". We need to hold all transactions to use Blockchain. Therefore, the amount of Blockchain data increases as time proceeds. On the other hand, the number of Internet of Things (IoT) products has been increasing. It is difficult for IoT products to hold all Blockchain data because of their data capacity. Thus, they access Blockchain network via servers that have enough data capacity. More and more IoT products will join Blockchain network via servers, so it is useful to reduce workloads and improve throughput. In this paper, we propose caching technique using a Field Programmable Gate Array-based (FPGA) Network Interface Card (NIC) that has 10Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE) interfaces. FPGA NIC instead of the server responds to requests from IoT products if the cache hits. The proposed system can reduce server workloads. We implemented the proposed hardware cache to achieve high throughput on NetFPGA-10G board. We counted the number of requests that the Blockchain server processed at a given time and calculated throughput as evaluation. Throughput improved from 6.73 to 7.45 times when hitting the cache.","author":["Yuma Sakakibara","Kohei Nakamura","Hiroki Matsutani"],"issue":["HEART2017: Proceedings of the 8th International Symposium on Highly Efficient Accelerators and Reconfigurable Technologies","June 2017","Article No.: 1","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3120895.3120897"],"date":"07 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"BLOCKCHAIN info. https://blockchain.info/ja/charts/n-transactions-per-block.","order":1},{"text":"Open Source Network Tester. https://github.com/NetFPGA/OSNT-Public/wiki.","order":2},{"text":"The NetFPGA Project, http://netfpga.org/.","order":3},{"text":"Andreas M Antonopoulos. 2014.

In this paper, we propose a novel vision task named Video Visual Relation Detection (VidVRD) to perform visual relation detection in videos instead of still images (ImgVRD). As compared to still images, videos provide a more natural set of features for detecting visual relations, such as the dynamic relations like \"A-follow-B'' and \"A-towards-B'', and temporally changing relations like \"A-chase-B'' followed by \"A-hold-B''. However, VidVRD is technically more challenging than ImgVRD due to the difficulties in accurate object tracking and diverse relation appearances in video domain. To this end, we propose a VidVRD method, which consists of object tracklet proposal, short-term relation prediction and greedy relational association. Moreover, we contribute the first dataset for VidVRD evaluation, which contains 1,000 videos with manually labeled visual relations, to validate our proposed method. On this dataset, our method achieves the best performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art baselines.","author":["Xindi Shang","Tongwei Ren","Jingfan Guo","Hanwang Zhang","Tat-Seng Chua"],"issue":["MM '17: Proceedings of the 25th ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2017","Pages   1300\u20131308","https://doi.org/10.1145/3123266.3123380"],"date":"19 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Stanislaw Antol, Aishwarya Agrawal, Jiasen Lu, Margaret Mitchell, Dhruv Batra, C Lawrence Zitnick, and Devi Parikh. 2015.

More specifically, our analysis has the objective of the dancer assessment with respect to both choreography execution accuracy and the synchronization of the dance movements with the musical rhythm. For this task, we make use of the explicit, expert-provided knowledge on dance movements and their relations to the musical beat. Due to the complexity of this knowledge, the MEBNs were used as the probabilistic ontological framework in which the knowledge is formalized. The reason we opt for MEBNs for this task is that they combine Bayesian and formal (first-order) logic into a single model. In this way, the Bayesian probabilistic part of MEBNs was used to capture, using example data and training, the implicit part of the expert knowledge about dances, i.e., this part of the knowledge that cannot be formalized and explicitly defined accurately enough, while the logical maintains the explicit knowledge representation in the same way ontologies do. Moreover, we present in detail the MEBN models we built for Tsamiko and Salsa, using expert-provided explicit knowledge. Last, we conduct experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MEBN-based methodology we employ to achieve our analysis objectives. The results of the experiments demonstrate the superiority of MEBNs to conventional models, such as BNs, in terms of the dancer assessment accuracy.","author":["Giannis Chantas","Sotiris Karavarsamis","Spiros Nikolopoulos","Ioannis Kompatsiaris"],"issue":["Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage","Volume 11","Issue 3","September 2018","Article No.: 12","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/3131610"],"date":"09 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"Dimitrios S.

The speed and energy dissipation of hibernation directly impacts the efficiency of the systems employing such computing paradigms. CMOS-compatible emerging memory technologies such as ReRAM provide non-volatile flip-flops (NvFFs) that realize fast and energy efficient hibernation using in-place store/restore. This paper presents memristive voltage divider (MVD), a non-volatile unit for NvFFs. Compared to conventional dual ReRAM units, MVD enables 67% reduction in energy dissipation and 36% reduction in store time, which translates into 79% reduction in the energy-delay product. MVD also remedies the endurance and variability concerns of ReRAM by providing read-while-write capability that enables low-overhead, fast, and energy efficient write verification mechanisms for NvFFs. As proof of concept, we also demonstrate an exemplar NvFF architecture using MVD for which energy dissipation trend in store and restore operations are reported.","author":["Mehrdad Biglari","Dietmar Fey"],"issue":["MEMSYS '17: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Memory Systems","October 2017","Pages   217\u2013222","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132402.3132432"],"date":"02 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Djaafar Chabi, Weisheng Zhao, Erya Deng, Yue Zhang, Nesrine Ben Romdhane, Jacques-Olivier Klein, and Claude Chappert. 2014.

Unlike all previous approaches, which typically extract direct hypernym edges for terms, our approach utilizes a novel probabilistic framework to extract hypernym subsequences. Taxonomy induction from extracted subsequences is cast as an instance of the minimum-cost flow problem on a carefully designed directed graph. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art taxonomy induction approaches across four languages. Importantly, we also show that our approach is robust to the presence of noise in the input vocabulary. To the best of our knowledge, this robustness has not been empirically proven in any previous approach.","author":["Amit Gupta","R\u00e9mi Lebret","Hamza Harkous","Karl Aberer"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   1329\u20131338","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133041"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"Daniele Alfarone and Jesse Davis. 2015.

Tensors are often sparse and compound operations must frequently be computed in a single kernel for performance and to save memory. Programmers are left to write kernels for every operation of interest, with different mixes of dense and sparse tensors in different formats. The combinations are infinite, which makes it impossible to manually implement and optimize them all. This paper introduces the first compiler technique to automatically generate kernels for any compound tensor algebra operation on dense and sparse tensors. The technique is implemented in a C++ library called taco. Its performance is competitive with best-in-class hand-optimized kernels in popular libraries, while supporting far more tensor operations.","author":["Fredrik Kjolstad","Shoaib Kamil","Stephen Chou","David Lugato","Saman Amarasinghe"],"issue":["Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages","Volume 1","Issue OOPSLA","October 2017","Article No.: 77","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/3133901"],"date":"12 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, Manjunath Kudlur, Josh Levenberg, Rajat Monga, Sherry Moore, Derek G.

Prior work on attacking VCS shows that the hidden voice commands that are incomprehensible to people can control the systems. Hidden voice commands, though \"hidden\", are nonetheless audible. In this work, we design a totally inaudible attack, DolphinAttack, that modulates voice commands on ultrasonic carriers (e.g., f > 20 kHz) to achieve inaudibility. By leveraging the nonlinearity of the microphone circuits, the modulated low-frequency audio commands can be successfully demodulated, recovered, and more importantly interpreted by the speech recognition systems. We validated DolphinAttack on popular speech recognition systems, including Siri, Google Now, Samsung S Voice, Huawei HiVoice, Cortana and Alexa. By injecting a sequence of inaudible voice commands, we show a few proof-of-concept attacks, which include activating Siri to initiate a FaceTime call on iPhone, activating Google Now to switch the phone to the airplane mode, and even manipulating the navigation system in an Audi automobile. We propose hardware and software defense solutions, and suggest to re-design voice controllable systems to be resilient to inaudible voice command attacks.","author":["Guoming Zhang","Chen Yan","Xiaoyu Ji","Tianchen Zhang","Taimin Zhang","Wenyuan Xu"],"issue":["CCS '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2017","Pages   103\u2013117","https://doi.org/10.1145/3133956.3134052"],"date":"30 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Muhammad Taher Abuelma'atti. 2003.

Most of the papers reviewed touched on some of the services in healthcare, there is practically little or no literature on the application or implementation of IoT in cancer care services. This has prompted the need to (re)assess the provision and positioning of healthcare services to harness the benefits associated with the use of IoT technology. This research proposes the implementation of an IoT based healthcare system focusing on two services, namely, cancer care and business analytics/cloud services. This combination proffers solution and framework for analyzing health data gathered from IoT through various sensor networks and other smart devices to help healthcare providers to turn a stream of data into actionable insights and evidence-based healthcare decision-making to improve and enhance cancer treatment.","author":["Adeniyi Onasanya","Maher Elshakankiri"],"issue":["UCC '17: Proceedings of the10th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing","December 2017","Pages   205\u2013206","https://doi.org/10.1145/3147213.3149217"],"date":"05 December 2017","ref":[{"text":"A Wireless Sensor Networks Bibliography.

Using a random graph model of concurrency, we show for three general classes of concurrency control methods, examples of which are (1) standard locking, (2) strict priority scheduling, and (3) optimistic methods, that (1) E(n, p) \u2a7d n(1 - p/2)n-1, (2) E(n, p) \u2a7d (1 - (1 - p)n)/p, and (3) 1 + ((1 - p)/p)ln(p(n - 1) + 1) \u2a7d E(n, p) \u2a7d 1 + (1/p)ln(p(n - 1) + 1). Thus, for fixed p, as n \u21a3 \u221e), (1) E \u21a3 0 for standard locking methods, (2) E \u2a7d 1/p for strict priority scheduling methods, and (3) E \u21a3 \u221e for optimistic methods. Also found are bounds on E in the case where conflicts are analyzed so as to maximize E.The predictions of the random graph model are confirmed by simulations of an abstract transaction processing system. In practice, though, there is a price to pay for the increased effective level of concurrency of methods (2) and (3): using these methods there is more wasted work (i.e., more steps executed by transactions that are later aborted). In response to this problem, three new concurrency control methods suggested by the random graph model analysis are developed. Two of these, called (a) running priority and (b) older or running priority, are shown by the simulation results to perform better than the previously known methods (l)-(3) for relatively large n or large p, in terms of achieving a high effective level of concurrency at a comparatively small cost in wasted work.","author":["Peter Franaszek","John T.

Both conventional techniques and emerging approaches are brought together to fill this gap between user demand and mobile devices\u2019 limited capabilities. Recent research has focused on enhancing the performance of mobile devices via augmentation techniques. Augmentation techniques for mobile cloud computing refer to the computing paradigms and solutions to outsource mobile device computation and storage to more powerful computing resources in order to enhance a mobile device\u2019s computing capability and energy efficiency (e.g., code offloading). Adopting augmentation techniques in the heterogeneous and intermittent mobile cloud computing environment creates new challenges for computation management, energy efficiency, and system reliability. In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive taxonomy and survey of the existing techniques and frameworks for mobile cloud augmentation regarding both computation and storage. Different from the existing taxonomies in this field, we focus on the techniques aspect, following the idea of realizing a complete mobile cloud computing system. The objective of this survey is to provide a guide on what available augmentation techniques can be adopted in mobile cloud computing systems as well as supporting mechanisms such as decision-making and fault tolerance policies for realizing reliable mobile cloud services. We also present a discussion on the open challenges and future research directions in this field.","author":["Bowen Zhou","Rajkumar Buyya"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 51","Issue 1","April 2018","Article No.: 13","pp   1\u201338","https://doi.org/10.1145/3152397"],"date":"04 January 2018","ref":[{"text":"Saeid Abolfazli, Zohreh Sanaei, Erfan Ahmed, Abdullah Gani, and Rajkumar Buyya. 2014.

However, its unique reliability challenges, i.e., the asymmetric bit failure mechanism at different bit flippings, have raised significant concerns in its real applications. Recent studies even show that the common memory error repair \u201cremedies\u201d cannot efficiently address them. In this article, we for the first time systematically study the potentials of the strong low-density parity-check (LDPC) code for combating such unique asymmetric errors in both single-level-cell (SLC) and multi-level-cell (MLC) STT-RAM designs. A generic STT-RAM channel model suitable for the SLC/MLC designs, is developed to analytically calibrate all the accumulated asymmetric factors of the write/read operations. The key initial information for LDPC decoding, namely asymmetric log-likelihood ratio (A-LLR), is redesigned and extracted from the proposed channel model, to unleash the LDPC\u2019s asymmetric error correcting capability. LDPC codec is also carefully designed to lower the hardware cost by leveraging the systematic-structured parity check matrix. Then two customized short-length LDPC codes\u2014(585,512) and (683,512)\u2014augmented from the semi-random parity check matrix and the A-LLR based asymmetric decoding, are proposed for SLC and MLC STT-RAM designs, respectively. Experiments show that our proposed LDPC designs can improve the STT-RAM reliability by at least 102 (104) when compared to the existing error correction codes (ECCs) for the SLC (MLC) design, demonstrating the feasibility of LDPC solutions on STT-RAM.","author":["Bohua Li","Yukui Pei","Wujie Wen"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 14","Issue 1","March 2018","Article No.: 10","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/3154836"],"date":"08 March 2018","ref":[{"text":"Xiuyuan Bi, Zhenyu Sun, Hai Li, and Wenqing Wu. 2012.

We study the risk that investors face from the closure of Bitcoin exchanges, which convert between Bitcoins and hard currency. We examine the track record of 80\u00a0Bitcoin exchanges established between 2010 and 2015. We find that nearly half (38) have since closed, with customer account balances sometimes wiped out. Fraudsters are sometimes to blame, but not always. Twenty-five exchanges suffered security breaches, 15 of which subsequently closed. We present logistic regressions using longitudinal data on Bitcoin exchanges aggregated quarterly. We find that experiencing a breach is correlated with a 13 times greater odds that an exchange will close in that same quarter. We find that higher-volume exchanges are less likely to close (each doubling in trade volume corresponds to a 12% decrease in the odds of closure). We also find that exchanges that derive most of their business from trading less popular (fiat) currencies, which are offered by at most one competitor, are less likely to close.","author":["Tyler Moore","Nicolas Christin","Janos Szurdi"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Internet Technology","Volume 18","Issue 4","November 2018","Article No.: 50","pp   1\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/3155808"],"date":"30 September 2018","ref":[{"text":"Jake Adelstein and Nathalie-Kyoko Stucky. 2016.

However, existing graph feature models---e.g. Subgraph Feature Extractor (SFE) or its predecessor, Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA) and its variants---depend on a limited set of graph features, connecting paths. This type of features may be missing for many interesting potential links, though, and the existing techniques cannot provide any predictions at all then. In this paper, we address the limitations of existing works by introducing a new graph-based feature model - Distinct Subgraph Paths (DSP). Our model uses a richer set of graph features and therefore can predict new relevant facts that neither SFE, nor PRA or its variants can discover by principle. We use a standard benchmark data set to show that DSP model performs better than the state-of-the-art - SFE (ANYREL) and PRA - in terms of mean average precision (MAP), mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and [email\u00a0protected], 10, 20, with no extra computational cost incurred.","author":["Sameh K.

The possibility of programming an actual quantum device has elicited much enthusiasm. Yet, quantum programming still lacks the compiler support that modern programming languages enjoy today. To use universal quantum computers like IBM's, programmers must design low-level circuits. In particular, they must map logical qubits into physical qubits that need to obey connectivity constraints. This task resembles the early days of programming, in which software was built in machine languages. In this paper, we formally introduce the qubit allocation problem and provide an exact solution to it. This optimal algorithm deals with the simple quantum machinery available today; however, it cannot scale up to the more complex architectures scheduled to appear. Thus, we also provide a heuristic solution to qubit allocation, which is faster than the current solutions already implemented to deal with this problem.","author":["Marcos Yukio Siraichi","Vin\u00edcius Fernandes dos Santos","Caroline Collange","Fernando Magno Quintao Pereira"],"issue":["CGO 2018: Proceedings of the 2018 International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization","February 2018","Pages   113\u2013125","https://doi.org/10.1145/3168822"],"date":"24 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Steven Balensiefer, Lucas Kregor-Stickles, and Mark Oskin. 2005.

Most previous work in this area has concentrated only on designing and optimizing accelerators for 2D CNN, with few attempts made to accelerate 3D CNN on FPGA. We find accelerating 3D CNNs on FPGA to be challenge due to their high computational complexity and storage demands. More importantly, although the computation patterns of 2D and 3D CNNs are analogous, the conventional approaches adopted for accelerating 2D CNNs may be unfit for 3D CNN acceleration. In this paper, in order to accelerate 2D and 3D CNNs using a uniform framework, we propose a uniform template-based architecture that uses templates based on the Winograd algorithm to ensure fast development of 2D and 3D CNN accelerators. Furthermore, we also develop a uniform analytical model to facilitate efficient design space explorations of 2D and 3D CNN accelerators based on our architecture. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the template-based architecture by implementing accelerators for real-life 2D and 3D CNNs (VGG16 and C3D) on multiple FPGA platforms. On S2C VUS440, we achieve up to 1.13 TOPS and 1.11 TOPS under low resource utilization for VGG16 and C3D, respectively. End-to-end comparisons with CPU and GPU solutions demonstrate that our implementation of C3D achieves gains of up to 13x and 60x in performance and energy relative to a CPU solution, and a 6.4x energy efficiency gain over a GPU solution.","author":["Junzhong Shen","You Huang","Zelong Wang","Yuran Qiao","Mei Wen","Chunyuan Zhang"],"issue":["FPGA '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2018","Pages   97\u2013106","https://doi.org/10.1145/3174243.3174257"],"date":"15 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"M.

A significant amount of research has been devoted to understanding, measuring, and modelling QoE for a variety of media services. The next logical step is to actively exploit that accumulated knowledge to improve and manage the quality of multimedia services, while at the same time ensuring efficient and cost-effective network operations. Moreover, with many different players involved in the end-to-end service delivery chain, identifying the root causes of QoE impairments and finding effective solutions for meeting the end users\u2019 requirements and expectations in terms of service quality is a challenging and complex problem. In this article, we survey state-of-the-art findings and present emerging concepts and challenges related to managing QoE for networked multimedia services. Going beyond a number of previously published survey articles addressing the topic of QoE management, we address QoE management in the context of ongoing developments, such as the move to softwarized networks, the exploitation of big data analytics and machine learning, and the steady rise of new and immersive services (e.g., augmented and virtual reality). We address the implications of such paradigm shifts in terms of new approaches in QoE modeling and the need for novel QoE monitoring and management infrastructures.","author":["Lea Skorin-Kapov","Mart\u00edn Varela","Tobias Ho\u00dffeld","Kuan-Ta Chen"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications","Volume 14","Issue 2s","April 2018","Article No.: 29","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/3176648"],"date":"22 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"3GPP. 2017.

Our model, LRML (Latent Relational Metric Learning) is a novel metric learning approach for recommendation. More specifically, instead of simple push-pull mechanisms between user and item pairs, we propose to learn latent relations that describe each user item interaction. This helps to alleviate the potential geometric inflexibility of existing metric learning approaches. This enables not only better performance but also a greater extent of modeling capability, allowing our model to scale to a larger number of interactions. In order to do so, we employ a augmented memory module and learn to attend over these memory blocks to construct latent relations. The memory-based attention module is controlled by the user-item interaction, making the learned relation vector specific to each user-item pair. Hence, this can be interpreted as learning an exclusive and optimal relational translation for each user-item interaction. The proposed architecture demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance across multiple recommendation benchmarks. LRML outperforms other metric learning models by 6%-7.5% in terms of [email\u00a0protected] and [email\u00a0protected] on large datasets such as Netflix and MovieLens20M. Moreover, qualitative studies also demonstrate evidence that our proposed model is able to infer and encode explicit sentiment, temporal and attribute information despite being only trained on implicit feedback. As such, this ascertains the ability of LRML to uncover hidden relational structure within implicit datasets.","author":["Yi Tay","Luu Anh Tuan","Siu Cheung Hui"],"issue":["WWW '18: Proceedings of the 2018 World Wide Web Conference","April 2018","Pages   729\u2013739","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186154"],"date":"23 April 2018","ref":[{"text":"Immanuel Bayer, Xiangnan He, Bhargav Kanagal, and Steffen Rendle. 2017.

In this exploratory research paper, we start from this premise and posit that all existing index structures can be replaced with other types of models, including deep-learning models, which we term \\em learned indexes. We theoretically analyze under which conditions learned indexes outperform traditional index structures and describe the main challenges in designing learned index structures. Our initial results show that our learned indexes can have significant advantages over traditional indexes. More importantly, we believe that the idea of replacing core components of a data management system through learned models has far reaching implications for future systems designs and that this work provides just a glimpse of what might be possible.","author":["Tim Kraska","Alex Beutel","Ed H.

In this work, we propose a source-to-source compiler that can transform C/C++ source code to optimized OpenCL kernel and host code. This eases the programmability of heterogeneous architectures, to apply different optimization techniques and let the programmer have access during the optimization process. We use polyhedral modeling, which is based on the Polly tool from the LLVM framework, to analysis the code. The information is transferred to the Polyhedral Parallel Code Generator (PPCG), which is a source-to-source compiler that generates OpenCL or CUDA code, since Polly is designed for CPUs. PPCG uses the Abstract Syntax Tree of the Clang for transformation and can thus only process C-code as input. Our approach opens up many new possibilities, like processing other input languages or applying different optimizations, since it works on the intermediate language of the LLVM framework. A main part of the work was the creation of valid C-code from LLVM-IR basic blocks and regions. In addition, a module for recognizing and transforming local variables was created.","author":["Lester Kalms","Tim Hebbeler","Diana G\u00f6hringer"],"issue":["PARMA-DITAM '18: Proceedings of the 9th Workshop and 7th Workshop on Parallel Programming and RunTime Management Techniques for Manycore Architectures and Design Tools and Architectures for Multicore Embedded Computing Platforms","January 2018","Pages   45\u201350","https://doi.org/10.1145/3183767.3183779"],"date":"23 January 2018","ref":[{"text":"Olaf Bachmann, Paul S.

However, emerging technologies including CNFET technology suffer from immature, poor process quality, leading to process imperfections, which in turn degrade circuit performance. This paper presents a methodology to evaluate circuit level impact and design solution related with imperfect process. Monte Carlo simulation is applied to consider the statistical nature of the process imperfections. With a specific study on glitch tolerance (important circuit-level performance metric in advanced technology nodes) in CNFET circuits, our simulation framework provides the link between degradation in glitch tolerance with poor process quality. Moreover, we have proposed that approximate circuits can significantly improve glitch tolerance in comparison to precise counterparts, due to lesser nodes, reduced stacked configurations, and reduced number of connections at some nodes because of simpler topologies. With an example of 4-bit adder and 4-bit multiplier circuits, we have demonstrated that approximate circuits are able to lower the glitch vulnerability to an acceptable level, with a tolerable logic error. Moreover, approximate circuits would also relax the requirement on process quality to keep process-induced failures below certain target value.","author":["Kaship Sheikh","Lan Wei"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '18: Proceedings of the 2018 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2018","Pages   27\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/3194554.3194587"],"date":"30 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"M.

Facts encoded in KGs are frequently used by search applications to augment result pages. When presenting a KG fact to the user, providing other facts that are pertinent to that main fact can enrich the user experience and support exploratory information needs. \\em KG fact contextualization is the task of augmenting a given KG fact with additional and useful KG facts. The task is challenging because of the large size of KGs; discovering other relevant facts even in a small neighborhood of the given fact results in an enormous amount of candidates. We introduce a neural fact contextualization method (\\em NFCM ) to address the KG fact contextualization task. NFCM first generates a set of candidate facts in the neighborhood of a given fact and then ranks the candidate facts using a supervised learning to rank model. The ranking model combines features that we automatically learn from data and that represent the query-candidate facts with a set of hand-crafted features we devised or adjusted for this task. In order to obtain the annotations required to train the learning to rank model at scale, we generate training data automatically using distant supervision on a large entity-tagged text corpus. We show that ranking functions learned on this data are effective at contextualizing KG facts. Evaluation using human assessors shows that it significantly outperforms several competitive baselines.","author":["Nikos Voskarides","Edgar Meij","Ridho Reinanda","Abhinav Khaitan","Miles Osborne","Giorgio Stefanoni","Prabhanjan Kambadur","Maarten de Rijke"],"issue":["SIGIR '18: The 41st International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research & Development in Information Retrieval","June 2018","Pages   765\u2013774","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210031"],"date":"27 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mart'\u0131n Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, et almbox. . 2016.

The following results are presented: The language generated by a context-free grammmar is linear in a sense that is defined precisely.The requirement of unambiguity\u2014that every sentence has a unique phrase structure\u2014weakens the grammar in the sense that there exists a CF language that cannot be generated unambiguously by a CF grammar.The result that not every CF language is a finite automaton (FA) language is improved in the following way. There exists a CF language L such that for any L\u2032 \u2286 L, if L\u2032 is FA, an L\u2033 \u2286 L can be found such that L\u2033 is also FA, L\u2032 \u2286 L\u2033 and L\u2033 contains infinitely many sentences not in L\u2032.A type of grammar is defined that is intermediate between type 1 and type 2 grammars.

Although existing HIN based recommendation methods have achieved performance improvement to some extent, they have two major shortcomings. First, these models seldom learn an explicit representation for path or meta-path in the recommendation task. Second, they do not consider the mutual effect between the meta-path and the involved user-item pair in an interaction. To address these issues, we develop a novel deep neural network with the co-attention mechanism for leveraging rich meta-path based context for top-N recommendation. We elaborately design a three-way neural interaction model by explicitly incorporating meta-path based context. To construct the meta-path based context, we propose to use a priority based sampling technique to select high-quality path instances. Our model is able to learn effective representations for users, items and meta-path based context for implementing a powerful interaction function. The co-attention mechanism improves the representations for meta-path based con- text, users and items in a mutual enhancement way. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model. In particular, the proposed model performs well in the cold-start scenario and has potentially good interpretability for the recommendation results.","author":["Binbin Hu","Chuan Shi","Wayne Xin Zhao","Philip S.

Knowledge distillation (KD) was shown to be successful in image recognition to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency. We propose a KD technique for learning to rank problems, called ranking distillation (RD). Specifically, we train a smaller student model to learn to rank documents/items from both the training data and the supervision of a larger teacher model. The student model achieves a similar ranking performance to that of the large teacher model, but its smaller model size makes the online inference more efficient. RD is flexible because it is orthogonal to the choices of ranking models for the teacher and student. We address the challenges of RD for ranking problems. The experiments on public data sets and state-of-the-art recommendation models showed that RD achieves its design purposes: the student model learnt with RD has less than an half size of the teacher model while achieving a ranking performance similar tothe teacher model and much better than the student model learnt without RD.","author":["Jiaxi Tang","Ke Wang"],"issue":["KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2018","Pages   2289\u20132298","https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3220021"],"date":"19 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Rohan Anil, Gabriel Pereyra, Alexandre Passos, Robert Orm\u00e1ndi, George E.

The results reported to date, rather than being definitive, have tended to be contradictory. In this paper, rather than presenting \u201cyet another algorithm performance study,\u201d we critically investigate the assumptions made in the models used in past studies and their implications. We employ a fairly complete model of a database environment for studying the relative performance of three different approaches to the concurrency control problem under a variety of modeling assumptions. The three approaches studied represent different extremes in how transaction conflicts are dealt with, and the assumptions addressed pertain to the nature of the database system's resources, how transaction restarts are modeled, and the amount of information available to the concurrency control algorithm about transactions' reference strings. We show that differences in the underlying assumptions explain the seemingly contradictory performance results. We also address the question of how realistic the various assumptions are for actual database systems.","author":["Rakesh Agrawal","Michael J.

In this research, an on-device training circuitry for threshold-current memristors integrated in a crossbar structure is proposed. Furthermore, alternate approaches of mapping the synaptic weights into fully trained and semi-trained crossbars are investigated. In a semi-trained crossbar, a confined subset of memristors are tuned and the remaining subset of memristors are not programmed. This translates to optimal resource utilization and power consumption, compared to a fully programmed crossbar. The semi-trained crossbar architecture is applicable to a broad class of neural networks. System level verification is performed with an extreme learning machine for binomial and multinomial classification. The total power for a single 4 \u00d7 4 layer network, when implemented in IBM 65nm node, is estimated to be \u224842.16\u03bcW and the area is estimated to be 26.48\u03bcm \u00d7 22.35\u03bcm.","author":["Abdullah M.

Even though some existing works employ the encryption or the built-in erase to achieve this requirement, they still suffer the risk of being deciphered or the issue of performance degradation. In contrast to the existing work, a fast sanitization scheme is proposed to provide the highest degree of security for data sanitization; that is, every old version of data could be immediately sanitized with zero live-data-copy overhead once the new version of data is created/written. In particular, this scheme further considers the reliability issue of MLC flash memories; the proposed scheme includes a one-shot sanitization design to minimize the disturbance during data sanitization. The feasibility and the capability of the proposed scheme were evaluated through extensive experiments based on real flash chips. The results demonstrate that this scheme can achieve the data sanitization with zero live-data-copy, where performance overhead is less than 1%.","author":["Ping-Hsien Lin","Yu-Ming Chang","Yung-Chun Li","Wei-Chen Wang","Chien-Chung Ho","Yuan-Hao Chang"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 41","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240773"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"1997.

Timing speculation is a promising approach to further increase the energy efficiency of DNN accelerators. Architectural exploration for timing speculation requires detailed gate-level timing simulations that can be time-consuming for large DNNs which execute millions of multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations. In this paper we propose FATE, a new methodology for fast and accurate timing simulations of DNN accelerators like the Google TPU. FATE proposes two novel ideas: (i) DelayNet, a DNN based timing model for MAC units; and (ii) a statistical sampling methodology that reduces the number of MAC operations for which timing simulations are performed. We show that FATE results in between 8X --58X speed-up in timing simulations, while introducing less than 2% error in classification accuracy estimates. We demonstrate the use of FATE by comparing a conventional DNN accelerator that uses 2's complement (2C) arithmetic with one that uses signed magnitude representation (SMR). We show that that the SMR implementation provides 18% more energy savings for the same classification accuracy than 2C, a result that might be of independent interest.","author":["Jeff (Jun) Zhang","Siddharth Garg"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 24","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240809"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"Jorge Albericio, Patrick Judd, Tayler Hetherington, Tor Aamodt, Natalie Enright Jerger, and Andreas Moshovos. 2016.

A popular and practical method of scheduling this kind of dynamic MIMD-style computation is \u201cwork stealing,\u201d in which processors needing work steal computational threads from other processors. In this paper, we give the first provably good work-stealing scheduler for multithreaded computations with dependencies.Specifically, our analysis shows that the expected time to execute a fully strict computation on P processors using our work-stealing scheduler is T1/P + O(T \u221e , where T1 is the minimum serial execution time of the multithreaded computation and (T \u221e is the minimum execution time with an infinite number of processors. Moreover, the space required by the execution is at most S1P, where S1 is the minimum serial space requirement. We also show that the expected total communication of the algorithm is at most O(PT \u221e( 1 + nd)Smax), where Smax is the size of the largest activation record of any thread and nd is the maximum number of times that any thread synchronizes with its parent. This communication bound justifies the folk wisdom that work-stealing schedulers are more communication efficient than their work-sharing counterparts. All three of these bounds are existentially optimal to within a constant factor.","author":["Robert D. Blumofe","Charles E.

While the underlying arithmetic is structurally simple, compute and memory requirements are challenging. One of the promising opportunities is leveraging reduced-precision representations for inputs, activations, and model parameters. The resulting scalability in performance, power efficiency, and storage footprint provides interesting design compromises in exchange for a small reduction in accuracy. FPGAs are ideal for exploiting low-precision inference engines leveraging custom precisions to achieve the required numerical accuracy for a given application. In this article, we describe the second generation of the FINN framework, an end-to-end tool that enables design-space exploration and automates the creation of fully customized inference engines on FPGAs. Given a neural network description, the tool optimizes for given platforms, design targets, and a specific precision. We introduce formalizations of resource cost functions and performance predictions and elaborate on the optimization algorithms. Finally, we evaluate a selection of reduced precision neural networks ranging from CIFAR-10 classifiers to YOLO-based object detection on a range of platforms including PYNQ and AWS\u00a0F1, demonstrating new unprecedented measured throughput at 50\u00a0TOp/s on AWS\u00a0F1 and 5\u00a0TOp/s on embedded devices.","author":["Michaela Blott","Thomas B.

In this work, a relationship between the number of sample rays and the quality of the estimate of this integral is derived. Furthermore, the number of rays required does not depend on the dimensionality of the space being sampled, but only on the variance of the multi-dimensional image function.

Caches work well for programs that exhibit sufficient locality. Other programs, however, have reference patterns that fail to exploit the cache, thereby suffering heavily from high memory latency. In order to get high cache efficiency and achieve good program performance, efficient memory accessing behavior is necessary. In fact, for many programs, program transformations or source-code changes can radically alter memory access patterns, significantly improving cache performance. Both hand-tuning and compiler optimization techniques are often used to transform codes to improve cache utilization.  Unfortunately, cache conflicts   are difficult to predict and estimate, precluding effective transformations. Hence, effective transformations require detailed knowledge about the frequency and causes of cache misses in the code. This article describes methods for generating and solving Cache Miss Equations (CMEs) that give a detailed representation of cache behavior, including conflict misses, in loop-oriented scientific code. Implemented within the SUIF compiler framework, our approach extends traditional compiler reuse analysis to generate linear Diophantine equations that summarize each loop's memory behavior. While solving these equations is in general difficult, we show that is also unnecessary, as mathematical techniques for manipulating Diophantine equations allow us to relatively easily compute and/or reduce  the  number of possible solutions, where each solution corresponds to a potential cache miss. The mathematical precision of CMEs allows us to find true optimal solutions for transformations such as blocking or padding. The generality of CMEs also allows us to reason about interactions between transformations applied in concert. The article also gives examples of their use to determine array padding  and offset amounts that minimize cache misses, and to determine optimal blocking factors for tiled code. Overall, these equations represent an analysis framework that offers the generality and precision needed for detailed compiler optimizations.","author":["Somnath Ghosh","Margaret Martonosi","Sharad Malik"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems","Volume 21","Issue 4","July 1999","pp   703\u2013746","https://doi.org/10.1145/325478.325479"],"date":"01 July 1999","ref":[{"text":"Adler, A. and Coury, J.

This paper describes our submission (team JSI Classic) to the competition that was organized by the dataset authors. We used a carefully executed machine learning approach, achieving 90% accuracy classifying eight different activities (Still, Walk, Run, Bike, Car, Bus, Train, Subway). The first step was data preprocessing, including a normalization of the phone orientation. Then, a wide set of hand-crafted domain features in both frequency and time domain were computed and their quality was evaluated. Finally, the appropriate machine learning model was chosen (XGBoost) and its hyper-parameters were optimized. The recognition result for the testing dataset will be presented in the summary paper of the challenge [13].","author":["Vito Janko","Nina Re\u0161\u00e7i\u00e7","Miha Mlakar","Vid Drobni\u010d","Matja\u017e Gams","Ga\u0161per Slapni\u010dar","Martin Gjoreski","Jani Bizjak","Matej Marinko","Mitja Lu\u0161trek"],"issue":["UbiComp '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM International Joint Conference and 2018 International Symposium on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and Wearable Computers","October 2018","Pages   1511\u20131520","https://doi.org/10.1145/3267305.3267518"],"date":"08 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Happiness and Satisfaction with Work Commute. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-012-0003-2.","order":1},{"text":"Mutual info score. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_classif.html.","order":2},{"text":"Pearson correlation coefficient. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient.","order":3},{"text":"Sussex-Huawei Locomotion Challenge. http://www.shl-dataset.org/activity-recognition-challenge.","order":4},{"text":"tsfresh. http://tsfresh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.","order":5},{"text":"XGBoost. https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.","order":6},{"text":"Cvetkovi\u0107, B., Janko, V., and Lu\u0161trek, M.

The task of community detection over these networks is of paramount importance in a variety of applications. Recently, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been widely adopted for community detection due to its great interpretability and its natural fitness for capturing the community membership of nodes. However, the existing NMF-based community detection approaches are shallow methods. They learn the community assignment by mapping the original network to the community membership space directly. Considering the complicated and diversified topology structures of real-world networks, it is highly possible that the mapping between the original network and the community membership space contains rather complex hierarchical information, which cannot be interpreted by classic shallow NMF-based approaches. Inspired by the unique feature representation learning capability of deep autoencoder, we propose a novel model, named Deep Autoencoder-like NMF (DANMF), for community detection. Similar to deep autoencoder, DANMF consists of an encoder component and a decoder component. This architecture empowers DANMF to learn the hierarchical mappings between the original network and the final community assignment with implicit low-to-high level hidden attributes of the original network learnt in the intermediate layers. Thus, DANMF should be better suited to the community detection task. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DANMF can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art NMF-based community detection approaches.","author":["Fanghua Ye","Chuan Chen","Zibin Zheng"],"issue":["CIKM '18: Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2018","Pages   1393\u20131402","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271697"],"date":"17 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Michael J.

Over the last 40 years, the interest in signature studies has grown steadily, having as its main reference the application of automatic signature verification, as previously published reviews in 1989, 2000, and 2008 bear witness. Ever since, and over the last 10 years, the application of handwritten signature technology has strongly evolved and much research has focused on the possibility of applying systems based on handwritten signature analysis and processing to a multitude of new fields. After several years of haphazard growth of this research area, it is time to assess its current developments for their applicability in order to draw a structured way forward. This perspective reports a systematic review of the last 10 years of the literature on handwritten signatures with respect to the new scenario, focusing on the most promising domains of research and trying to elicit possible future research directions in this subject.","author":["Moises Diaz","Miguel A.

The L-system is used to define growing process of crack patterns. The L-system produces a sequence of letters and it is translated as visual representation by the turtle graphics concept. In order to investigate what kind of grammar can be suitable to generate realistic crack patterns, an WebGL application has been developed. The developed application can generate variety of crack patterns. Through experiments, we discovered several grammars which generates realistic crack patterns. The final crack patterns are often difficult to predict, but it is possible to control the number of branches and geometry of fragments with an appropriate selection of grammar. Our approach provides a possibility toward an intuitive control of crack propagation process and final crack geometry.","author":["Megumi Takato","Yohei Nishidate"],"issue":["ICAIT'2018: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Applications in Information Technology","November 2018","Pages   58\u201362","https://doi.org/10.1145/3274856.3274868"],"date":"01 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"S.

This design was motivated by the fact that word separators are not used in many highly analytic East and Southeast Asian languages. Although several of the languages are well-studied, e.g., Chinese and Japanese, many are understudied with low resources, e.g., Burmese (Myanmar) and Khmer. In the first part of the article, the proposed annotation system, named nova, is introduced. nova contains only four basic tags (n, v, a, and o); these tags can be further modified and combined to adapt complex linguistic phenomena in tokenization and POS tagging.

Latest research studies showed that the memristor technology has a great potential for realizing power- and area-efficient neuromorphic computing systems (NCS).

Unreliable devices can severely degrade system performance, which arises as one of the major challenges in developing memristor-based NCS. In this paper, we first review the impacts of the limited reliability of memristor devices and summarize the recent research progress in building reliable and efficient memristor-based NCS.

Streamlining data movement between memory and compute holds the key to boosting these metrics. To unleash latent performance in FPGA-based inference processors, we outline a convolutional neural network accelerator that operates at 92.9% of the peak FPGA clock rate. First, we map neural-network operators to a minimalist hardware architecture to simplify data movement between memory and compute. Doing so enables the design to close timing at high clock rates. Second, we describe a schedule that keeps compute utilization high. We apply this architecture to classify MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets. This design achieves 95.5% compute efficiency with GoogLeNet, whose nested topology makes creating an efficient design especially challenging.","author":["Ephrem Wu","Xiaoqian Zhang","David Berman","Inkeun Cho","John Thendean"],"issue":["FPGA '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2019","Pages   191\u2013200","https://doi.org/10.1145/3289602.3293925"],"date":"20 February 2019","ref":[{"text":"Abadi, M. et al. 2016.

Network morphism, which keeps the functionality of a neural network while changing its neural architecture, could be helpful for NAS by enabling more efficient training during the search. In this paper, we propose a novel framework enabling Bayesian optimization to guide the network morphism for efficient neural architecture search. The framework develops a neural network kernel and a tree-structured acquisition function optimization algorithm to efficiently explores the search space. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets have been done to demonstrate the superior performance of the developed framework over the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we build an open-source AutoML system based on our method, namely Auto-Keras. The code and documentation are available at https://autokeras.com. The system runs in parallel on CPU and GPU, with an adaptive search strategy for different GPU memory limits.","author":["Haifeng Jin","Qingquan Song","Xia Hu"],"issue":["KDD '19: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2019","Pages   1946\u20131956","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292500.3330648"],"date":"25 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"Peter Auer, Nicolo Cesa-Bianchi, and Paul Fischer. 2002.

A KG is a multi-relational graph that has proven valuable for many tasks including question answering and semantic search. In this paper, we present GENI, a method for tackling the problem of estimating node importance in KGs, which enables several downstream applications such as item recommendation and resource allocation. While a number of approaches have been developed to address this problem for general graphs, they do not fully utilize information available in KGs, or lack flexibility needed to model complex relationship between entities and their importance. To address these limitations, we explore supervised machine learning algorithms. In particular, building upon recent advancement of graph neural networks (GNNs), we develop GENI, a GNN-based method designed to deal with distinctive challenges involved with predicting node importance in KGs. Our method performs an aggregation of importance scores instead of aggregating node embeddings via predicate-aware attention mechanism and flexible centrality adjustment. In our evaluation of GENI and existing methods on predicting node importance in real-world KGs with different characteristics, GENI achieves 5-17% higher [email\u00a0protected] than the state of the art.","author":["Namyong Park","Andrey Kan","Xin Luna Dong","Tong Zhao","Christos Faloutsos"],"issue":["KDD '19: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2019","Pages   596\u2013606","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292500.3330855"],"date":"25 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"Denilson Barbosa, Haixun Wang, and Cong Yu. 2013.

Previous work, however, has consisted of either proof-of-concept implementations of components, usually the range-limited force; full systems, but with much of the work shared by the host CPU; or prototype demonstrations, e.g., using OpenCL, that neither implement a whole system nor have competitive performance. In this paper, we present what we believe to be the first full-scale FPGA-based simulation engine, and show that its performance is competitive with a GPU (running Amber in an industrial production environment). The system features on-chip particle data storage and management, short- and long-range force evaluation, as well as bonded forces, motion update, and particle migration. Other contributions of this work include exploring numerous architectural trade-offs and analysis of various mappings schemes among particles/cells and the various on-chip compute units. The potential impact is that this system promises to be the basis for long timescale Molecular Dynamics with a commodity cluster.","author":["Chen Yang","Tong Geng","Tianqi Wang","Rushi Patel","Qingqing Xiong","Ahmed Sanaullah","Chunshu Wu","Jiayi Sheng","Charles Lin","Vipin Sachdeva","Woody Sherman","Martin Herbordt"],"issue":["SC '19: Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2019","Article No.: 67","Pages   1\u201331","https://doi.org/10.1145/3295500.3356179"],"date":"17 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"D.A.

Data compression is an effective approach to improving memory capacity and bandwidth; but prior works have focused primarily on lossless compression and retrieval for data-critical applications. While data integrity is critical to many applications, a growing number of memory-bound applications contain non-critical program data; this property can be exploited to improve memory performance and capacity. In this work, we enable approximate storage to exploit the inherent error resilience of multimedia and other applications, through lossy compression, to improve storage without adversely affecting application functionality. We realize an incidence of approximate storage through modification of the Base-Delta-Immediate algorithm to create a lossy memory compression algorithm. We conclude that approximate storage is an effective and promising technique for improving effective memory capacity and decreasing the energy cost of memory access; results show that memory capacity can be increased by 15% with only 3% loss in image recognition application quality.","author":["Brian Worek","Paul Ampadu"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '19: Proceedings of the 2019 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2019","Pages   327\u2013330","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299874.3318029"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"V.

We present: 1) a task analysis of HGML that shows the tasks that a user would want to carry out, 2) a characterization of two scientific publications, one in neuroscience and one in political science, in terms of how the authors would search for solutions using an AutoML system, 3) requirements for HGML based on those characterizations, and 4) an assessment of existing AutoML systems in terms of those requirements.","author":["Yolanda Gil","James Honaker","Shikhar Gupta","Yibo Ma","Vito D'Orazio","Daniel Garijo","Shruti Gadewar","Qifan Yang","Neda Jahanshad"],"issue":["IUI '19: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces","March 2019","Pages   614\u2013624","https://doi.org/10.1145/3301275.3302324"],"date":"17 March 2019","ref":[{"text":"C.

The reported designs tend to utilize a similar underlying architecture based on multiplier-accumulator (MAC) arrays, which has the practical consequence of limiting the FPGA-based accelerator performance by the number of available on-chip DSP blocks, while leaving other resource under-utilized. To address this problem, we consider a transformation to the convolution computation, which leads to transformation of the accelerator design space and relaxes the pressure on the required DSP resources. We demonstrate that our approach enables us to strike a judicious balance between utilization of the on-chip memory, logic, and DSP resources, due to which, our accelerator considerably outperforms state of the art. We report the effectiveness of our approach on a Stratix-V GXA7 FPGA, which shows 55% throughput improvement, while using 6.25% less DSP blocks, compared to the best reported CNN accelerator on the same device.","author":["Dong Wang","Ke Xu","Qun Jia","Soheil Ghiasi"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 87","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317753"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"A.

To address the issue, flash devices adopt error correction codes (ECC) with strong error correction capability, like low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, to correct errors. The drawback of LDPC is that, to correct data with a high raw bit error rate (RBER), read latency will be amplified. This work proposes to address this issue with the assistance of approximate data. First, studies have been conducted and show there are ample amount of approximate data available in flash storage. Second, a novel data organization is proposed to fortify the reliability of regular data by leaving approximate data unprotected. Finally, a new data allocation strategy and modified garbage collection scheme are presented to complete the design. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can improve read performance by 30% on average comparing to current techniques.","author":["Qiao Li","Liang Shi","Jun Yang","Youtao Zhang","Chun Jason Xue"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 215","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317848"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"K.

Bayesian Optimization (BO) is an effective method to deal with black-box functions. This paper mainly focuses on balancing exploration and exploitation in multi-objective black-box optimization problems by multiple samplings in BBO. In each iteration, multiple recommendations are generated via two different trade-off strategies respectively the expected improvement (EI) and a multiobjective framework with the mean and variance function of the GP posterior forming two conflict objectives. We compare our algorithm with ParEGO by running on 12 test functions. Hypervolume (HV, also known as S-metric) results show that our algorithm works well in exploration-exploitation trade-off for multiobjective black-box optimization problems.","author":["Hongyan Wang","Hua Xu","Yuan Yuan","Xiaomin Sun","Junhui Deng"],"issue":["GECCO '19: Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion","July 2019","Pages   237\u2013238","https://doi.org/10.1145/3319619.3321962"],"date":"13 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"K.

We approach the hyperlink classification problem from a structured graph embedding perspective, and show that we can solve the problem by modifying the recently proposed knowledge graph embedding techniques. The key idea of our modification is to introduce a relation perturbation while the original knowledge graph embedding models only corrupt entities when generating negative triplets in training. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the knowledge graph embedding idea to the hyperlink classification problem.

New vision problems are emerging in step with the fashion industry's rapid evolution towards an online, social, and personalized business. Style models, trend forecasting, interactive search, and recommendation all require visual understanding with rich detail and subtlety. As a result, research in this area is poised to have great influence on how people shop, how the fashion industry analyzes its enterprise, and how we model the cultural trends revealed by what people wear. In this talk, I will present our work over the last few years developing computer vision methods for fashion. To begin, we explore how to discover styles from Web photos, learning how people assemble their outfits and the latent themes they share. Leveraging such styles, we show how to infer compatibility of new garments, optimize personalized mix-and-match capsule wardrobes, suggest minimal edits to make an outfit more fashionable, and recommend clothing that flatters diverse human body shapes. Next, turning to the world stage, we investigate fashion forecasting and influence. Given photos of fashion products, we learn to forecast what looks and styles will be popular in the future. We further boost those forecasts by modeling the spatio-temporal style influences between 44 major world cities. Throughout, by learning models from unlabeled Web photos, our approaches sidestep subjective manual annotations in favor of direct observations of what people choose to wear.","author":["Kristen Grauman"],"issue":["WSDM '20: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","January 2020","Pages   3","https://doi.org/10.1145/3336191.3372192"],"date":"22 January 2020","ref":[{"text":"Fashion++: Minimal Edits for Outfit Improvement.

An important characteristic of a trustworthy AI system is the absence of algorithmic bias. 'Individual discrimination' exists when a given individual different from another only in 'protected attributes' (e.g., age, gender, race, etc.) receives a different decision outcome from a given machine learning (ML) model as compared to the other individual. The current work addresses the problem of detecting the presence of individual discrimination in given ML models. Detection of individual discrimination is test-intensive in a black-box setting, which is not feasible for non-trivial systems. We propose a methodology for auto-generation of test inputs, for the task of detecting individual discrimination. Our approach combines two well-established techniques - symbolic execution and local explainability for effective test case generation. We empirically show that our approach to generate test cases is very effective as compared to the best-known benchmark systems that we examine.","author":["Aniya Aggarwal","Pranay Lohia","Seema Nagar","Kuntal Dey","Diptikalyan Saha"],"issue":["ESEC/FSE 2019: Proceedings of the 2019 27th ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering","August 2019","Pages   625\u2013635","https://doi.org/10.1145/3338906.3338937"],"date":"12 August 2019","ref":[{"text":"Julius Adebayo and Lalana Kagal. 2016.

On the other hand, each of the current vendor-specific TEEs makes a fixed set of trade-offs with little room for customization. We present Keystone---the first open-source framework for building customized TEEs. Keystone uses simple abstractions provided by the hardware such as memory isolation and a programmable layer underneath untrusted components (e.g., OS). We build reusable TEE core primitives from these abstractions while allowing platform-specific modifications and flexible feature choices. We showcase how Keystone-based TEEs run on unmodified RISC-V hardware and demonstrate the strengths of our design in terms of security, TCB size, execution of a range of benchmarks, applications, kernels, and deployment models.","author":["Dayeol Lee","David Kohlbrenner","Shweta Shinde","Krste Asanovi\u0107","Dawn Song"],"issue":["EuroSys '20: Proceedings of the Fifteenth European Conference on Computer Systems","April 2020","Article No.: 38","Pages   1\u201316","https://doi.org/10.1145/3342195.3387532"],"date":"15 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"2013.

Binary neural networks (BNN) are particularly effective in trading accuracy for performance, energy efficiency, or hardware/software complexity. Here, we introduce a spintronic, re-configurable in-memory BNN accelerator, PIMBALL: Processing In Memory BNN AcceL(L)erator, which allows for massively parallel and energy efficient computation. PIMBALL is capable of being used as a standard spintronic memory (STT-MRAM) array and a computational substrate simultaneously. We evaluate PIMBALL using multiple image classifiers and a genomics kernel. Our simulation results show that PIMBALL is more energy efficient than alternative CPU-, GPU-, and FPGA-based implementations while delivering higher throughput.","author":["Salonik Resch","S.

Intensified efforts in STT-MRAM research by the memory manufacturers may indicate a revolution with STT-MRAM memory technology is imminent, and therefore it is essential to perform system level research to explore use-cases and identify computing domains that could benefit from this technology. Special STT-MRAM features such as intrinsic radiation hardness, non-volatility, zero stand-by power and capability to function in extreme temperatures makes it particularly suitable for aerospace, avionics and automotive applications. Such applications often have real-time requirements --- that is, certain tasks must complete within a strict deadline. Analyzing whether this deadline is met requires Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) Analysis, which is a fundamental part of evaluating any real-time system. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using STT-MRAM in real-time embedded systems by analyzing average system performance impact and WCET implications.","author":["Kazi Asifuzzaman","Mikel Fernandez","Petar Radojkovi\u0107","Jaume Abella","Francisco J.

Stochastic Computing (SC) is an emerging paradigm that replaces these conventional units with simple logic circuits and is particularly suitable for fault-tolerant applications. We propose an energy-efficient use of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), a spintronic device that exhibits probabilistic switching behavior, as Stochastic Number Generators (SNGs), which forms the basis of our NN implementation in the SC domain. Further, the error resilience of target applications of NNs allows approximating the synaptic weights in our MTJ-based NN implementation, in ways brought about by properties of the MTJ-SNG, to achieve energy-efficiency. An algorithm is designed that, given an error tolerance, can perform such approximations in a single-layer NN in an optimal way owing to the convexity of the problem formulation. We then use this algorithm and develop a heuristic approach for approximating multi-layer NNs. Classification problems were evaluated on the optimized NNs and results showed substantial savings in energy for little loss in accuracy.","author":["Ankit Mondal","Ankur Srivastava"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 16","Issue 1","February 2020","Article No.: 7","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/3359622"],"date":"15 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"National Institute of Standards and Technology. 2017.

Hence, this approach is attractive for digital health applications, where data is sourced through edge devices and users care about privacy. Here, we report on the feasibility to train deep neural networks on the Raspberry Pi4s as edge devices. A CNN, a LSTM and a MLP was successfully trained on the MNIST data-set. Further, federated learning was demonstrated experimentally on IID and non-IID samples in a parametric study, to benchmark the model convergence. The weight updates from the workers are shared with the cloud to train the general model through federated learning. With the CNN and the non-IID samples a test-accuracy of up to 85% could be achieved within a training time of 2 minutes, while exchanging less than 10 MB data per device. In addition, we discuss federated learning from an use-case standpoint, elaborating on privacy risks and labeling requirements for the application of emotion detection from sound. Based on the experimental findings, we discuss possible research directions to improve model and system performance. Finally, we provide best practices for a practitioner, considering the implementation of federated learning.","author":["Anirban Das","Thomas Brunschwiler"],"issue":["AIChallengeIoT'19: Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Challenges in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Internet of Things","November 2019","Pages   39\u201342","https://doi.org/10.1145/3363347.3363365"],"date":"10 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"Martin Abadi, Andy Chu, Ian Goodfellow, H Brendan McMahan, Ilya Mironov, Kunal Talwar, and Li Zhang. 2016.

BYOC is an open-source hardware framework that provides a scalable cache coherence system, that includes out-of-the-box support for four different ISAs (RISC-V 32-bit, RISC-V 64-bit, x86, and SPARCv9) and has been connected to ten different cores. The framework also supports multiple loosely coupled accelerators and is a fully working system supporting SMP Linux. The Transaction-Response Interface (TRI) introduced with BYOC has been specifically designed to make it easy to add in new cores with new ISAs and memory interfaces. This work demonstrates multiple multi-ISA designs running on FPGA and characterises the communication costs. This work describes many of the architectural design trade-offs for building such a flexible system. BYOC is well suited to be the premiere platform for heterogeneous-ISA architecture, system software, and compiler research.","author":["Jonathan Balkind","Katie Lim","Michael Schaffner","Fei Gao","Grigory Chirkov","Ang Li","Alexey Lavrov","Tri M.

Fabricated using conventional CMOS processes, MEMS-based storage consists of thousands of small, mechanical probe tips that access gigabytes of high-density, nonvolatile magnetic storage. This paper takes a first step towards understanding the performance characteristics of these devices by mapping them onto a disk-like metaphor. Using simulation models based on the mechanics equations governing the devices' operation, this work explores how different physical characteristics (e.g., actuator forces and per-tip data rates) impact the design trade-offs and performance of MEMS-based storage. Overall results indicate that average access times for MEMS-based storage are 6.5 times faster than for a modern disk (1.5 ms vs. 9.7 ms). Results from filesystem and database bench-marks show that this improvement reduces application I/O stall times up to 70%, resulting in overall performance improvements of 3X.","author":["John Linwood Griffin","Steven W.

Although SC circuits have small area and critical-path delay, due to the need of many clock cycles to perform computation, they have a large overall latency and energy consumption. One solution to this problem is to further minimize the circuits. In this work, we explore target function approximation to derive an SC circuit with significantly reduced area and delay. We propose two static methods that first construct a set of functions close to the given target function and then select the best synthesized SC circuit realizing one of these functions. We also propose an efficient dynamic method that simultaneously searches for the best approximated target function and the corresponding minimized SC circuit. The experimental results show that on average, our dynamic method dramatically reduces the area, critical-path delay, and area-delay product of the SC circuits by 80%, 59%, and 91%, respectively, over the state-of-the-art Maclaurin polynomial-based method for a given error bound of 2%. The code of our methods is made open-source.","author":["Chen Wang","Weihua Xiao","John P.

The past decade has seen major advances in many perception tasks, such as visual object recognition and speech recognition, using deep learning models. For higher-level inference, however, probabilistic graphical models with their Bayesian nature are still more powerful and flexible. In recent years, Bayesian deep learning has emerged as a unified probabilistic framework to tightly integrate deep learning and Bayesian models.1 In this general framework, the perception of text or images using deep learning can boost the performance of higher-level inference and, in turn, the feedback from the inference process is able to enhance the perception of text or images. This survey provides a comprehensive introduction to Bayesian deep learning and reviews its recent applications on recommender systems, topic models, control, and so on. We also discuss the relationship and differences between Bayesian deep learning and other related topics, such as Bayesian treatment of neural networks.","author":["Hao Wang","Dit-Yan Yeung"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 53","Issue 5","October 2020","Article No.: 108","pp   1\u201337","https://doi.org/10.1145/3409383"],"date":"28 September 2020","ref":[{"text":"Gediminas Adomavicius and YoungOk Kwon. 2012.

Two technologies of interest are Posit and RISC-V. Posit was introduced in mid-2017 as a viable alternative to IEEE-754, and RISC-V provides a commercial-grade open source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). In this article, we bring these two technologies together and propose a Configurable Posit Enabled RISC-V Core called PERI.The article provides insights on how the Single-Precision Floating Point (\u201cF\u201d) extension of RISC-V can be leveraged to support posit arithmetic. We also present the implementation details of a parameterized and feature-complete posit Floating Point Unit (FPU). The configurability and the parameterization features of this unit generate optimal hardware, which caters to the accuracy and energy/area tradeoffs imposed by the applications, a feature not possible with IEEE-754 implementation. The posit FPU has been integrated with the RISC-V compliant SHAKTI C-class core as an execution unit. To further leverage the potential of posit, we enhance our posit FPU to support two different exponent sizes (with posit-size being 32-bits), thereby enabling multiple-precision at runtime. To enable the compilation and execution of C programs on PERI, we have made minimal modifications to the GNU C Compiler (GCC), targeting the \u201cF\u201d extension of the RISC-V. We compare posit with IEEE-754 in terms of hardware area, application accuracy, and runtime. We also present an alternate methodology of integrating the posit FPU with the RISC-V core as an accelerator using the custom opcode space of RISC-V.","author":["Sugandha Tiwari","Neel Gala","Chester Rebeiro","V.

By combining the principles of parallelism and pipelining, the CCC can emulate the cube-connected machine and the shuffle-exchange network with no significant degradation of performance but with a more compact structure.

The k-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an n record file are: insertion, O(log n); deletion of the root, O(n(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, O(log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), O(n log n). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t keys specified [proven maximum running time of O(n(k-t)/k)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of O(log n).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.","author":["Jon Louis Bentley"],"issue":["Communications of the ACM","Volume 18","Issue 9","Sept. 1975","pp   509\u2013517","https://doi.org/10.1145/361002.361007"],"date":"01 September 1975","ref":[{"text":"Friedman, J.H., Bentley, J.L., and Finkel, R.A.

TA is the process of summarizing the topological information of a subset of network elements. This summary is flooded throughout the network and used by various nodes to determine appropriate routes for connection requests. A key issue in the design of a TA scheme is the appropriate balance between compaction and the corresponding routing performance. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we introduce a source-oriented approach to TA, hich provides better performance than existing approaches. The intuition behind this approach is that the advertised topology-state information is used by source nodes to determine tentative  routes for connection requests. Accordingly, only information relevant to source nodes needs to be advertised. We integrate the source-oriented approach into three new TA schemes that provide different trade-offs between compaction and accuracy. Second, we extend our source-oriented approach to multi-QoS-based TA. A key issue here is the determination of appropriate values for the multiple QoS parameters associated with a logical link. Two new approaches to computing these values are introduced. Extensive simulations are used to evaluate the performance of out proposed schemes.","author":["Turgay Korkmaz","Marwan Krunz"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation","Volume 10","Issue 4","Oct. 2000","pp   295\u2013325","https://doi.org/10.1145/369534.369542"],"date":"01 October 2000","ref":[{"text":"AHUJA, R.

PAST is based on a self-organizing, Internet-based overlay network of storage nodes that cooperatively route file queries, store multiple replicas of files, and cache additional copies of popular files.In the PAST system, storage nodes and files are each assigned uniformly distributed identifiers, and replicas of a file are stored at nodes whose identifier matches most closely the file's identifier. This statistical assignment of files to storage nodes approximately balances the number of files stored on each node. However, non-uniform storage node capacities and file sizes require more explicit storage load balancing to permit graceful behavior under high global storage utilization; likewise, non-uniform popularity of files requires caching to minimize fetch distance and to balance the query load.We present and evaluate PAST, with an emphasis on its storage management and caching system. Extensive trace-driven experiments show that the system minimizes fetch distance, that it balances the query load for popular files, and that it displays graceful degradation of performance as the global storage utilization increases beyond 95%.","author":["Antony Rowstron","Peter Druschel"],"issue":["SOSP '01: Proceedings of the eighteenth ACM symposium on Operating systems principles","October 2001","Pages   188\u2013201","https://doi.org/10.1145/502034.502053"],"date":"21 October 2001","ref":[{"text":"Napster. http://www.napster.com/.]]","order":1},{"text":"The Gnutella protocol specification, 2000. http: / / dss.clip2.com/GnuteUaProtocolO4.pdf.]]","order":2},{"text":"W.

We explore energy behavior of the memory systems by changing design parameters such as processor clock, memory clock and cache configuration. Finally we propose new energy reduction techniques for the address bus and practical mode control schemes for the SDRAM devices.

This design shift has motivated the development of Frontier, a timing-driven FPGA placement system that uses design macroblocks in conjunction with a series of placement algorithms to achieve highly routable and high-performance layouts quickly. In the first stage of design placement, a macro-based floorplanner is used to quickly identify an initial layout based on intermacro connectivity. Next, FPGA routability and performance metrics are used to evaluate the quality of the initial placement. Finally, if the floorplan is determined to be insufficient from a routability or performance standpoint, a feedback-driven placement perturbation step is employed to achieve a lower cost placement. For a collection of large reconfigurable computing benchmark circuits our timing-driven placement system exhibits a 2.6\u00d7 speedup in combined place and route time versus commercial FPGA CAD software with improved design performance for most designs. It is shown that floorplanning, placement evaluation, and backend optimization are all necessary to achieve high-performance placement solutions.","author":["Russell Tessier"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 7","Issue 2","April 2002","pp   284\u2013305","https://doi.org/10.1145/544536.544540"],"date":"01 April 2002","ref":[{"text":"Babb, J., Frank, M., Lee, V., Waingold, E., and Barua, R. 1997.

This paper concerns static analysis to detect redundant memory operations and enable other compiler transformations to remove such redundant operations.We present an extended global value numbering algorithm to detect redundant memory operations. The key of the new algorithm is a novel SSA-based representation for memory state which allows accurate reasoning about memory state. Using this representation, the algorithm can trace values through memory operations to detect equivalence in the same way that it traces them through register-based scalar operations. Thus it discovers both redundancy involving scalar values and redundancy involving memory operations. The redundancy relation detected by the algorithm can then be used by traditional redundancy elimination transformations to remove those redundant operations.Experiments using a suite of realistic applications demonstrate the algorithm is powerful and fast. In practice, it has essentially linear time complexity.","author":["Keith D.

This paper presents a graph covering algorithm. The graph covering is done in two steps: template generation and template selection. The objective of template generation step is to extract functional equivalent structures, i.e. templates, from a control data flow graph. By inspecting the graph, the algorithm generates all the possible templates and the corresponding matches. Using unique serial numbers and circle numbers, the algorithm can find all distinct templates with multiple outputs. The template selection algorithm shows how this information can be used in compilers for reconfigurable systems. The objective of the template selection algorithm is to find an efficient cover for an application graph with a minimal number of distinct templates and minimal number of matches.","author":["Yuanqing Guo","Gerard J.M.

We argue that such technology, no matter how well it is designed, is of little educational value unless it engages learners in an active learning activity. Drawing on a review of experimental studies of visualization effectiveness, we motivate this position against the backdrop of current attitudes and best practices with respect to visualization use. We suggest a new taxonomy of learner engagement with visualization technology. Grounded in Bloom's well-recognized taxonomy of understanding, we suggest metrics for assessing the learning outcomes to which such engagement may lead. Based on these taxonomies of engagement and effectiveness metrics, we present a framework for experimental studies of visualization effectiveness. Interested computer science educators are invited to collaborate with us by carrying out studies within this framework.","author":["Thomas L.

By combining unstructured point clouds with the implicit surface definition of the moving least squares approximation, we obtain a hybrid geometry representation that allows us to exploit the advantages of implicit and parametric surface models. Based on this representation we introduce a shape modeling system that enables the designer to perform large constrained deformations as well as boolean operations on arbitrarily shaped objects. Due to minimum consistency requirements, point-sampled surfaces can easily be re-structured on the fly to support extreme geometric deformations during interactive editing. In addition, we show that strict topology control is possible and sharp features can be generated and preserved on point-sampled objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system on a large set of input models, including noisy range scans, irregular point clouds, and sparsely as well as densely sampled models.","author":["Mark Pauly","Richard Keiser","Leif P.

Many phenomena that are difficult or impossible with other techniques are simple with ray tracing, including shadows, reflections, and refracted light. Ray directions, however, have been determined precisely, and this has limited the capabilities of ray tracing. By distributing the directions of the rays according to the analytic function they sample, ray tracing can incorporate fuzzy phenomena. This provides correct and easy solutions to some previously unsolved or partially solved problems, including motion blur, depth of field, penumbras, translucency, and fuzzy reflections. Motion blur and depth of field calculations can be integrated with the visible surface calculations, avoiding the problems found in previous methods.","author":["Robert L.

When FPGAs are used as computational devices in a larger system, however, it is better to employ fixed-frequency FPGAs operating at a high clock frequency. Such fixed-frequency arrays require pipelined interconnect structures, which are difficult to support in a traditional FPGA architecture. We have developed a novel approach, called a \"corner-turn\" interconnect, based on a Manhattan array of logically depopulated S-boxes with full connectivity but limited routability. This interconnect supports new polynomial-time routing techniques while maintaining conventional placement and other upstream toolflow. We have used the corner-turn interconnect to define a fixed-frequency FPGA architecture, the SFRA, that is largely compatible with the Xilinx Virtex while providing higher speed, pipelined operation. Our tools automatically repipeline designs to operate at the SFRA's intrinsic clock frequency. Since the arrays are largely compatible, we directly compare the SFRA with the Virtex on four benchmark designs. On these benchmarks, the SFRA offers higher throughput and competitive throughput per area. The SFRA routing and retiming tools also run one to two orders of magnitude faster than their Xilinx counterparts.","author":["Nicholas Weaver","John Hauser","John Wawrzynek"],"issue":["FPGA '04: Proceedings of the 2004 ACM/SIGDA 12th international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2004","Pages   3\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/968280.968283"],"date":"22 February 2004","ref":[{"text":"V.

This is done with the guarantee that the mapping depth of the circuit will not increase compared to the circuit with a single Vdd. We first design a single-Vdd mapping algorithm that achieves better power results than the latest published low-power mapping algorithms. We then show that our dual-Vdd mapping algorithm can further improve power savings by up to 11.6% over the single-Vdd mapper. In addition, we investigate the best low-Vdd/high-Vdd ratio for the largest power reduction among several dual-Vdd combinations.

The high potential of reducing the query processing cost as well as the large spectrum of associated applications have attracted considerable attention to this query type from the database community. This paper presents an incremental safe-region-based technique for answering MkNN queries, called the V*-Diagram. In general, a safe region is a set of points where the query point can move without changing the query answer. Traditional safe-region approaches compute a safe region based on the data objects but independent of the query location. Our approach exploits the current knowledge of the query point and the search space in addition to the data objects. As a result, the V*-Diagram has much smaller IO and computation costs than existing methods. The experimental results show that the V*-Diagram outperforms the best existing technique by two orders of magnitude.","author":["Sarana Nutanong","Rui Zhang","Egemen Tanin","Lars Kulik"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 1","Issue 1","August 2008","pp   1095\u20131106","https://doi.org/10.14778/1453856.1453973"],"date":"01 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"F.

Graph edit distance is one of the most widely accepted measures to determine similarities between graphs and has extensive applications in the fields of pattern recognition, computer vision etc. Unfortunately, the problem of graph edit distance computation is NP-Hard in general. Accordingly, in this paper we introduce three novel methods to compute the upper and lower bounds for the edit distance between two graphs in polynomial time. Applying these methods, two algorithms AppFull and AppSub are introduced to perform different kinds of graph search on graph databases. Comprehensive experimental studies are conducted on both real and synthetic datasets to examine various aspects of the methods for bounding graph edit distance. Result shows that these methods achieve good scalability in terms of both the number of graphs and the size of graphs. The effectiveness of these algorithms also confirms the usefulness of using our bounds in filtering and searching of graphs.","author":["Zhiping Zeng","Anthony K. H.

When several queries execute concurrently, this model introduces contention, because the physical plans---unaware of each other---compete for access to the underlying I/O and computation resources. As a result, while modern systems can efficiently optimize and evaluate a single complex data analysis query, their performance suffers significantly when multiple complex queries run at the same time.We describe an augmentation of traditional query engines that improves join throughput in large-scale concurrent data warehouses. In contrast to the conventional query-at-a-time model, our approach employs a single physical plan that can share I/O, computation, and tuple storage across all in-flight join queries. We use an \"always-on\" pipeline of non-blocking operators, coupled with a controller that continuously examines the current query mix and performs run-time optimizations. Our design allows the query engine to scale gracefully to large data sets, provide predictable execution times, and reduce contention. In our empirical evaluation, we found that our prototype outperforms conventional commercial systems by an order of magnitude for tens to hundreds of concurrent queries.","author":["George Candea","Neoklis Polyzotis","Radek Vingralek"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 2","Issue 1","August 2009","pp   277\u2013288","https://doi.org/10.14778/1687627.1687659"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"D.

Each of these sources provides a set of values and different sources can often provide conflicting values. To present quality data to users, it is critical that data integration systems can resolve conflicts and discover true values. Typically, we expect a true value to be provided by more sources than any particular false one, so we can take the value provided by the majority of the sources as the truth. Unfortunately, a false value can be spread through copying and that makes truth discovery extremely tricky. In this paper, we consider how to find true values from conflicting information when there are a large number of sources, among which some may copy from others.We present a novel approach that considers dependence between data sources in truth discovery. Intuitively, if two data sources provide a large number of common values and many of these values are rarely provided by other sources (e.g., particular false values), it is very likely that one copies from the other. We apply Bayesian analysis to decide dependence between sources and design an algorithm that iteratively detects dependence and discovers truth from conflicting information. We also extend our model by considering accuracy of data sources and similarity between values. Our experiments on synthetic data as well as real-world data show that our algorithm can significantly improve accuracy of truth discovery and is scalable when there are a large number of data sources.","author":["Xin Luna Dong","Laure Berti-Equille","Divesh Srivastava"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 2","Issue 1","August 2009","pp   550\u2013561","https://doi.org/10.14778/1687627.1687690"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"L.

Recent work on RDF engines has focused on scalable performance for querying, and has largely disregarded updates. In addition to incremental bulk loading, applications also require online updates with flexible control over multi-user isolation levels and data consistency. The challenge lies in meeting these requirements while retaining the capability for fast querying.This paper presents a comprehensive solution that is based on an extended deferred-indexing method with integrated versioning. The version store enables time-travel queries that are efficiently processed without adversely affecting queries on the current data. For flexible consistency, transactional concurrency control is provided with options for either snapshot isolation or full serializability. All methods are integrated in an extension of the RDF-3X system, and their very good performance for both queries and updates is demonstrated by measurements of multi-user workloads with real-life data as well as stress-test synthetic loads.","author":["Thomas Neumann","Gerhard Weikum"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   256\u2013263","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920877"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"D.

However, the performance of spatial database systems has not been satisfactory since their implementations of spatial operations cannot fully utilize the power of modern parallel hardware. In this paper, we provide a customized software solution that exploits GPUs and multi-core CPUs to accelerate spatial cross-comparison in a cost-effective way. Our solution consists of an efficient GPU algorithm and a pipelined system framework with task migration support. Extensive experiments with real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution, which improves the performance of spatial cross-comparison by over 18 times compared with a parallelized spatial database approach.","author":["Kaibo Wang","Yin Huai","Rubao Lee","Fusheng Wang","Xiaodong Zhang","Joel H.

Performance issues can impact over one billion users so we track thousands of servers, hundreds of PB of daily network traffic, hundreds of daily code changes, and many other metrics. We require latencies of under a minute from events occuring (a client request on a phone, a bug report filed, a code change checked in) to graphs showing those events on developers' monitors.Scuba is the data management system Facebook uses for most real-time analysis. Scuba is a fast, scalable, distributed, in-memory database built at Facebook. It currently ingests millions of rows (events) per second and expires data at the same rate. Scuba stores data completely in memory on hundreds of servers each with 144 GB RAM. To process each query, Scuba aggregates data from all servers. Scuba processes almost a million queries per day. Scuba is used extensively for interactive, ad hoc, analysis queries that run in under a second over live data. In addition, Scuba is the workhorse behind Facebook's code regression analysis, bug report monitoring, ads revenue monitoring, and performance debugging.","author":["Lior Abraham","John Allen","Oleksandr Barykin","Vinayak Borkar","Bhuwan Chopra","Ciprian Gerea","Daniel Merl","Josh Metzler","David Reiss","Subbu Subramanian","Janet L.

As a result, researchers have proposed systems and optimizations to reduce these costs by allowing users to trade off accuracy and speed. In this work, we examine end-to-end DNN execution in visual analytics systems on modern accelerators. Through a novel measurement study, we show that the preprocessing of data (e.g., decoding, resizing) can be the bottleneck in many visual analytics systems on modern hardware.To address the bottleneck of preprocessing, we introduce two optimizations for end-to-end visual analytics systems. First, we introduce novel methods of achieving accuracy and throughput trade-offs by using natively present, low-resolution visual data. Second, we develop a runtime engine for efficient visual DNN inference. This runtime engine a) efficiently pipelines preprocessing and DNN execution for inference, b) places preprocessing operations on the CPU or GPU in a hardware- and input-aware manner, and c) efficiently manages memory and threading for high throughput execution. We implement these optimizations in a novel system, Smol, and evaluate Smol on eight visual datasets. We show that its optimizations can achieve up to 5.9X end-to-end throughput improvements at a fixed accuracy over recent work in visual analytics.","author":["Daniel Kang","Ankit Mathur","Teja Veeramacheneni","Peter Bailis","Matei Zaharia"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 14","Issue 2","October 2020","pp   87\u2013100","https://doi.org/10.14778/3425879.3425881"],"date":"01 October 2020","ref":[{"text":"2018.

Several attributes such as string length, frequency, mutual information and entropy are chosen for word/non-word determination.

The difference to the time alignment HMM is that there is no monotony constraint for the possible word orderings.

While much existing adaptive assistance has focused on providing explicit feedback directly to the relevant student, we propose a two-dimensional design space which explores alternative methods of adaptive assistance that are implicit, indirect, or both. We investigated the viability of these ideas using data collected in a classroom evaluation of an ACLS system for peer tutoring which incorporated the design ideas in a manner that provided cognitive support to peer tutors. In this paper, we discuss how students interacted with the different forms of feedback, and propose a second iteration of the assistance that involves collaborative support in addition to domain support.","author":["Erin Walker","Nikol Rummel","Kenneth R.
