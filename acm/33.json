Coalescing, however, can be harmful to the colorability of the graph because it tends to yield a graph with nodes of higher degrees. Unlike aggressive coalescing, which coalesces any pair of noninterfering copy-related nodes, conservative coalescing or iterated coalescing perform safe coalescing that preserves the colorability. Unfortunately, these heuristics give up coalescing too early, losing many opportunities for coalescing that would turn out to be safe. Moreover, they ignore the fact that coalescing may even improve the colorability of the graph by reducing the degree of neighbor nodes that are interfering with both the source and target nodes being coalesced. This article proposes a new heuristic called optimistic coalescing which optimistically performs aggressive coalescing, thus exploiting the positive impact of coalescing aggressively, but when a coalesced node is to be spilled, it is split back into separate nodes. Since there is a better chance of coloring one of those splits, we can reduce the overall spill amount.","author":["Jinpyo Park","Soo-Mook Moon"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems","Volume 26","Issue 4","July 2004","pp   735\u2013765","https://doi.org/10.1145/1011508.1011512"],"date":"01 July 2004","ref":[{"text":"Appel, A. and MacQueen, D. 1991.

SI avoids many concurrency errors, and it never delays read-only transactions. However it does not guarantee serializability. It has been widely assumed that, under SI, read-only transactions always execute serializably provided the concurrent update transactions are serializable. The reason for this is that all SI reads return values from a single instant of time when all committed transactions have completed their writes and no writes of non-committed transactions are visible. This seems to imply that read-only transactions will not read anomalous results so long as the update transactions with which they execute do not write such results. In the current note, however, we exhibit an example contradicting these assumptions: it is possible for an SI history to be non-serializable while the sub-history containing all update transactions is serializable.","author":["Alan Fekete","Elizabeth O'Neil","Patrick O'Neil"],"issue":["ACM SIGMOD Record","Volume 33","Issue 3","September 2004","pp   12\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/1031570.1031573"],"date":"01 September 2004","ref":[{"text":"{BBGMOO95} H.

FAB is built from a collection of bricks, small storage appliances containing commodity disks, CPU, NVRAM, and network interface cards. FAB deploys a new majority-voting-based algorithm to replicate or erasure-code logical blocks across bricks and a reconfiguration algorithm to move data in the background when bricks are added or decommissioned. We argue that voting is practical and necessary for reliable, high-throughput storage systems such as FAB. We have implemented a FAB prototype on a 22-node Linux cluster. This prototype sustains 85MB/second of throughput for a database workload, and 270MB/second for a bulk-read workload. In addition, it can outperform traditional master-slave replication through performance decoupling and can handle brick failures and recoveries smoothly without disturbing client requests.","author":["Yasushi Saito","Svend Fr\u00f8lund","Alistair Veitch","Arif Merchant","Susan Spence"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 32","Issue 5","December 2004","pp   48\u201358","https://doi.org/10.1145/1037947.1024400"],"date":"07 October 2004","ref":[{"text":"Atul Adya, William J.

The seminal papers of Kleinberg [1998, 1999] and Brin and Page [1998] introduced Link Analysis Ranking, where hyperlink structures are used to determine the relative authority of a Web page and produce improved algorithms for the ranking of Web search results. In this article we work within the hubs and authorities framework defined by Kleinberg and we propose new families of algorithms. Two of the algorithms we propose use a Bayesian approach, as opposed to the usual algebraic and graph theoretic approaches. We also introduce a theoretical framework for the study of Link Analysis Ranking algorithms. The framework allows for the definition of specific properties of Link Analysis Ranking algorithms, as well as for comparing different algorithms. We study the properties of the algorithms that we define, and we provide an axiomatic characterization of the INDEGREE heuristic which ranks each node according to the number of incoming links. We conclude the article with an extensive experimental evaluation. We study the quality of the algorithms, and we examine how different structures in the graphs affect their performance.","author":["Allan Borodin","Gareth O. Roberts","Jeffrey S.

These systems typically have to provide an instant start-up time. However, we observe that mounting a file system for flash memory takes 1 to 25 seconds mainly depending on the flash capacity. Since the flash chip capacity is doubled in every year, this mounting time will soon become the most dominant reason of the delay of system start-up time. Therefore, in this paper, we present instant mounting techniques for flash file systems by storing the in-memory file system metadata to flash memory when unmounting the file system and reloading the stored metadata quickly when mounting the file system. These metadata snapshot techniques are specifically developed for NOR- and NAND-type flash memories, while at the same time, overcoming their physical constraints. The proposed techniques check the validity of the stored snapshot and use the proposed fast crash recovery techniques when the snapshot is invalid. Based on the experimental results, the proposed techniques can reduce the flash mounting time by about two orders of magnitude over the existing de facto standard flash file system.","author":["Keun Soo Yim","Jihong Kim","Kern Koh"],"issue":["SAC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM symposium on Applied computing","March 2005","Pages   843\u2013849","https://doi.org/10.1145/1066677.1066871"],"date":"13 March 2005","ref":[{"text":"Aleph One Company, \"The Yet Another Flash Filing System (YAFFS),\" http://www.aleph1.co.uk/yaffs/.","order":1},{"text":"R.

While recent algorithmic improvements and optimized parallel software implementations have increased ray tracing performance to realtime levels, no compact and programmable hardware solution has been available yet.This paper describes the architecture and a prototype implementation of a single chip, fully programmable Ray Processing Unit (RPU). It combines the flexibility of general purpose CPUs with the efficiency of current GPUs for data parallel computations. This design allows for realtime ray tracing of dynamic scenes with programmable material, geometry, and illumination shaders.Although, running at only 66 MHz the prototype FPGA implementation already renders images at up to 20 frames per second, which in many cases beats the performance of highly optimized software running on multi-GHz desktop CPUs. The performance and efficiency of the proposed architecture is analyzed using a variety of benchmark scenes.","author":["Sven Woop","J\u00f6rg Schmittler","Philipp Slusallek"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 24","Issue 3","July 2005","pp   434\u2013444","https://doi.org/10.1145/1073204.1073211"],"date":"01 July 2005","ref":[{"text":"Aila, T., and Laine, S. 2004.

In this paper, we propose algorithms for addressing two important problems that are encountered while using TCAMs: reducing range expansion and multi-match classification.Our first algorithm addresses the problem of expansion of rules with range fields to represent range rules in TCAMs, a single range rule is mapped to multiple TCAM entries, which reduces the utilization of TCAMs. We propose a new scheme called Database Independent Range PreEncoding (DIRPE) that, in comparison to earlier approaches, reduces the worst-case number of TCAM entries a single rule maps on to. DIRPE works without prior knowledge of the database, scales when a large number of ranges is present, and has good incremental update properties.Our second algorithm addresses the problem of finding multiple matches in a TCAM. When searched, TCAMs return the first matching entry; however, new applications require either the first few or all matching entries. We describe a novel algorithm, called Multi-match Using Discriminators (MUD), that finds multiple matches without storing any per-search state information in the TCAM, thus making it suitable for multi-threaded environments. MUD does not increase the number of TCAM entries needed, and hence scales to large databases.Our algorithms do not require any modifications to existing TCAMs and are hence relatively easy to deploy. We evaluate the algorithms using real-life and random databases.","author":["Karthik Lakshminarayanan","Anand Rangarajan","Srinivasan Venkatachary"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 35","Issue 4","October 2005","pp   193\u2013204","https://doi.org/10.1145/1090191.1080115"],"date":"22 August 2005","ref":[{"text":"F.

Best-choice clustering (ISPD05) is used to construct a hierarchy of problem formulations. Generalized force-directed placement guides global placement at each level of the cluster hierarchy. During the declustering pass from coarsest to finest level, large movable objects are gradually fixed in positions without overlapping with one another. This progressive legalization of large objects during continuous optimization supports determination of a completely overlap-free configuration as close as possible to the continuous solution. Various discrete heuristics are applied to this legalized placement in order to improve the final wirelength.","author":["Tony F.

While extensive measurement studies have been performed to highlight the trade-off between computation and communication in sensor networks, the role of storage has received little attention. The storage subsystems on currently available sensor platforms have not exploited technology trends, and consequently the energy cost of storage on these platforms is as high as that of communication. Current flash memories, however, offer a low-priced, high-capacity and extremely energy-efficient storage solution.In this paper, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of the active and sleep-mode energy consumption of available flash-based storage options for sensor platforms. Our results demonstrate more than a 100-fold decrease in per-byte energy consumption for surface-mount parallel NAND flash in comparison with the MicaZ on-board serial flash. In addition, this dramatically reduces storage energy costs relative to communication, introducing a new dimension in traditional computation vs communication trade-offs. Our results have significant ramifications on the design of sensor platforms as well as on the energy consumption of sensing applications. We quantify the potential energy gains for two commonly used sensor network services: communication and in-network data aggregation. Our measurements show significant improvements in each service: 50-fold and up to 10-fold reductions in energy for communication and data aggregation respectively.","author":["Gaurav Mathur","Peter Desnoyers","Deepak Ganesan","Prashant Shenoy"],"issue":["IPSN '06: Proceedings of the 5th international conference on Information processing in sensor networks","April 2006","Pages   374\u2013381","https://doi.org/10.1145/1127777.1127833"],"date":"19 April 2006","ref":[{"text":"xD-Picture Card. www.xd-picture.com.","order":1},{"text":"Atmel Corporation.

Due to their large area and high density, caches are worst hit by soft errors. Although Error Correction Code based mechanisms protect the data in caches, they have high performance and power overheads. Since multimedia applications are increasingly being used in mission-critical embedded systems where both reliability and energy are a major concern, there is a de?nite need to improve reliability in embedded systems, without too much energy overhead. We observe that while a soft error in multimedia data may only result in a minor loss in QoS, a soft error in avariable that controls the execution ?ow of the program may be fatal. Consequently, we propose to partition the data space into failure critical and failure non-critical data, and provide a high-degree of soft error protection only to the failure critical data in Horizontally Partitioned Caches. Experimental results demonstrate that our selective data protection can achieve the failure rate close to that of a soft error protected cache system, while retaining the performance and energy consumption similar to those of a traditional cache system, with some degradation in QoS. For example, for conventional con?guration as in IntelXScale, our approach achieves the same failure rate, while improving performance by 28% and reducing energy consumption by 29%in comparison with a soft error protected cache.","author":["Kyoungwoo Lee","Aviral Shrivastava","Ilya Issenin","Nikil Dutt","Nalini Venkatasubramanian"],"issue":["CASES '06: Proceedings of the 2006 international conference on Compilers, architecture and synthesis for embedded systems","October 2006","Pages   411\u2013420","https://doi.org/10.1145/1176760.1176810"],"date":"22 October 2006","ref":[{"text":"R.

The cost ofbuilding datacenter facilities capable of delivering a given power capacity tosuch a computer can rival the recurring energy consumption costs themselves.Therefore, there are strong economic incentives to operate facilities as closeas possible to maximum capacity, so that the non-recurring facility costs canbe best amortized. That is difficult to achieve in practice because ofuncertainties in equipment power ratings and because power consumption tends tovary significantly with the actual computing activity. Effective powerprovisioning strategies are needed to determine how much computing equipmentcan be safely and efficiently hosted within a given power budget. In this paper we present the aggregate power usage characteristics of largecollections of servers (up to 15 thousand) for different classes ofapplications over a period of approximately six months. Those observationsallow us to evaluate opportunities for maximizing the use of the deployed powercapacity of datacenters, and assess the risks of over-subscribing it. We findthat even in well-tuned applications there is a noticeable gap (7 - 16%)between achieved and theoretical aggregate peak power usage at the clusterlevel (thousands of servers). The gap grows to almost 40% in wholedatacenters. This headroom can be used to deploy additional compute equipmentwithin the same power budget with minimal risk of exceeding it. We use ourmodeling framework to estimate the potential of power management schemes toreduce peak power and energy usage. We find that the opportunities for powerand energy savings are significant, but greater at the cluster-level (thousandsof servers) than at the rack-level (tens). Finally we argue that systems needto be power efficient across the activity range, and not only at peakperformance levels.","author":["Xiaobo Fan","Wolf-Dietrich Weber","Luiz Andre Barroso"],"issue":["ISCA '07: Proceedings of the 34th annual international symposium on Computer architecture","June 2007","Pages   13\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/1250662.1250665"],"date":"09 June 2007","ref":[{"text":"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Our method alternates between stochastic gradient descent steps and projection steps. We prove that the number of iterations required to obtain a solution of accuracy \u03b5 is \u00d5(1/\u03b5). In contrast, previous analyses of stochastic gradient descent methods require \u03a9 (1/\u03b52) iterations. As in previously devised SVM solvers, the number of iterations also scales linearly with 1/\u03bb, where \u03bb is the regularization parameter of SVM. For a linear kernel, the total run-time of our method is \u00d5 (d/(\u03bb\u03b5)), where d is a bound on the number of non-zero features in each example. Since the run-time does not depend directly on the size of the training set, the resulting algorithm is especially suited for learning from large datasets. Our approach can seamlessly be adapted to employ non-linear kernels while working solely on the primal objective function. We demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of our approach by conducting experiments on large text classification problems, comparing our solver to existing state-of-the-art SVM solvers. For example, it takes less than 5 seconds for our solver to converge when solving a text classification problem from Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) with 800,000 training examples.","author":["Shai Shalev-Shwartz","Yoram Singer","Nathan Srebro"],"issue":["ICML '07: Proceedings of the 24th international conference on Machine learning","June 2007","Pages   807\u2013814","https://doi.org/10.1145/1273496.1273598"],"date":"20 June 2007","ref":[{"text":"Boyd, S., & Vandenberghe, L.

However, SDRAMs have highly variable access times that depend on previous requests. This makes it difficult to accurately and analytically determine latencies and the useful bandwidth at design time, and hence to guarantee that hard real-time requirements are met. The main contribution of this paper is a memory controller design that provides a guaranteed minimum bandwidth and a maximum latency bound to the IPs. This is accomplished using a novel two-step approach to predictable SDRAM sharing. First, we define memory access groups, corresponding to precomputed sequences of SDRAM commands, with known efficiency and latency. Second, a predictable arbiter is used to schedule these groups dynamically at run-time, such that an allocated bandwidth and a maximum latency bound is guaranteed to the IPs. The approach is general and covers all generations of SDRAM. We present a modular implementation of our memory controller that is efficientlyintegrated into the network interface of a network-on-chip. The area of the implementation is cheap, and scales linearly with the number of IPs. An instance with six ports runs at 200 MHz and requires 0.042mm2 in 0.13\u03bcm CMOS technology.","author":["Benny Akesson","Kees Goossens","Markus Ringhofer"],"issue":["CODES+ISSS '07: Proceedings of the 5th IEEE/ACM international conference on Hardware/software codesign and system synthesis","September 2007","Pages   251\u2013256","https://doi.org/10.1145/1289816.1289877"],"date":"30 September 2007","ref":[{"text":"B.

The Amazon.com platform, which provides services for many web sites worldwide, is implemented on top of an infrastructure of tens of thousands of servers and network components located in many datacenters around the world. At this scale, small and large components fail continuously and the way persistent state is managed in the face of these failures drives the reliability and scalability of the software systems. This paper presents the design and implementation of Dynamo, a highly available key-value storage system that some of Amazon's core services use to provide an \"always-on\" experience. To achieve this level of availability, Dynamo sacrifices consistency under certain failure scenarios. It makes extensive use of object versioning and application-assisted conflict resolution in a manner that provides a novel interface for developers to use.","author":["Giuseppe DeCandia","Deniz Hastorun","Madan Jampani","Gunavardhan Kakulapati","Avinash Lakshman","Alex Pilchin","Swaminathan Sivasubramanian","Peter Vosshall","Werner Vogels"],"issue":["SOSP '07: Proceedings of twenty-first ACM SIGOPS symposium on Operating systems principles","October 2007","Pages   205\u2013220","https://doi.org/10.1145/1294261.1294281"],"date":"14 October 2007","ref":[{"text":"Adya, A., Bolosky, W.

Despite the large amount of recent work on TM implementations, however, very little effort has been devoted to precisely defining what guarantees these implementations should provide. A formal description of such guarantees is necessary in order to check the correctness of TM systems, as well as to establish TM optimality results and inherent trade-offs. This paper presents opacity, a candidate correctness criterion for TM implementations. We define opacity as a property of concurrent transaction histories and give its graph theoretical interpretation. Opacity captures precisely the correctness requirements that have been intuitively described by many TM designers. Most TM systems we know of do ensure opacity. At a very first approximation, opacity can be viewed as an extension of the classical database serializability property with the additional requirement that even non-committed transactions are prevented from accessing inconsistent states. Capturing this requirement precisely, in the context of general objects, and without precluding pragmatic strategies that are often used by modern TM implementations, such as versioning, invisible reads, lazy updates, and open nesting, is not trivial. As a use case of opacity, we prove the first lower bound on the complexity of TM implementations. Basically, we show that every single-version TM system that uses invisible reads and does not abort non-conflicting transactions requires, in the worst case, ?(k) steps for an operation to terminate, where k is the total number of objects shared by transactions. This (tight) bound precisely captures an inherent trade-off in the design of TM systems. The bound also highlights a fundamental gap between systems in which transactions can be fully isolated from the outside environment, e.g., databases or certain specialized transactional languages, and systems that lack such isolation capabilities, e.g., general TM frameworks.","author":["Rachid Guerraoui","Michal Kapalka"],"issue":["PPoPP '08: Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and practice of parallel programming","February 2008","Pages   175\u2013184","https://doi.org/10.1145/1345206.1345233"],"date":"20 February 2008","ref":[{"text":"H.

The protocol modifies the linear window growth function of existing TCP standards to be a cubic function in order to improve the scalability of TCP over fast and long distance networks. It also achieves more equitable bandwidth allocations among flows with different RTTs (round trip times) by making the window growth to be independent of RTT -- thus those flows grow their congestion window at the same rate. During steady state, CUBIC increases the window size aggressively when the window is far from the saturation point, and the slowly when it is close to the saturation point. This feature allows CUBIC to be very scalable when the bandwidth and delay product of the network is large, and at the same time, be highly stable and also fair to standard TCP flows. The implementation of CUBIC in Linux has gone through several upgrades. This paper documents its design, implementation, performance and evolution as the default TCP algorithm of Linux.","author":["Sangtae Ha","Injong Rhee","Lisong Xu"],"issue":["ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","Volume 42","Issue 5","July 2008","pp   64\u201374","https://doi.org/10.1145/1400097.1400105"],"date":"01 July 2008","ref":[{"text":"Git logs for CUBIC updates. http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6.git;a=history;f=net/ipv4/tcpcubic.c;h=eb5b9854c8c7330791ada69b8c9e8695f7a73f3d;hb=HEAD.","order":1},{"text":"Iperf. http://sourceforge.net/projects/iperf.","order":2},{"text":"Linux CUBIC source navigation. http://lxr.linux.no/linux/net/ipv4/tcp_cubic.c.","order":3},{"text":"TCP Testing Wiki. http://netsrv.csc.ncsu.edu/wiki/index.php/TCP_Testing.","order":4},{"text":"Testing setup for Linux and FreeBSD. http://netsrv.csc.ncsu.edu/wiki/index.php/Testing_Setup_of_kernel_2.6.23.9.","order":5},{"text":"Pluggable congestion avoidance modules. http://lwn.net/Articles/128681/ (2005).","order":6},{"text":"Aikat, J., Kaur, J., Smith, F., and Jeffay, K.

One solution to this problem is improved authoring to create more comprehensible structures. This paper proposes several authoring tools, based on hypertext structure analysis.In many hypertext systems authors are encouraged to create hierarchical structures, but when writing, the hierarchy is lost because of the inclusion of cross-reference links. The first part of this paper looks at ways of recovering lost hierarchies and finding new ones, offering authors different views of the same hypertext. The second part helps authors by identifying properties of the hypertext document. Multiple metrics are developed including compactness and stratum. Compactness indicates the intrinsic connectedness of the hypertext, and stratum reveals to what degree the hypertext is organized so that some nodes must be read before others.Several existing hypertexts are used to illustrate the benefits of each technique. The collection of techniques provides a multifaceted view of the hypertext, which should allow authors to reduce undesired structural complexity and create documents that readers can traverse more easily.","author":["Rodrigo A.

In addition, these analyses prove to be very convenient to conduct, as they are totally non-invasive.Research reports indicate that EMA can be conducted globally, typically with macroscopic home-made coils circling the device under attack, with fair results. However, as accurate professional EM antennas are now becoming more accessible, it has become commonplace to carry out EM analyses locally.Cartography has been carried out by optical means on circuits realized with technology greater than 250 nanometers. Nonetheless, for deep submicron technologies, the feature size of devices that are spied upon is too small to be visible with photographic techniques. In addition, the presence of the 6+ metallization layers obviously prevents a direct observation of the layout. Therefore, EM imaging is emerging as a relevant means to discover the underlying device structure.In this article, we present the first images of deep-submicron FPGAs. The resolution is not as accurate as photographic pictures: we notably compare the layout of toy design examples placed at the four corners of the FPGAs with the EM images we collected. We observe that EM imaging has the advantage of revealing active regions, which can be useful in locating a particular processor (visible while active---invisible when inactive).In the context of EM attacks, we stress that the exact localization of the cryptographic target is not necessary: the coarse resolution we obtain is sufficient. We note that the EM imaging does not reveal the exact layout of the FPGA, but instead directly guides the attacker towards the areas which are leaking the most. We achieve attacks with an accurate sensor, both far from (namely on a SMC capacitor on the board) and close to (namely directly over the FPGA) the encryption co-processor. As compared to the previously published attacks, we report a successful attack on a DES module in fewer than 6,300 measurements, which is currently the best cracking performance against this encryption algorithm implemented in FPGAs.","author":["Laurent Sauvage","Sylvain Guilley","Yves Mathieu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 2","Issue 1","March 2009","Article No.: 4","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/1502781.1502785"],"date":"01 March 2009","ref":[{"text":"Agrawal, D., Archambeault, B., Rao, J.

Both ranking and clustering can provide overall views on information network data, and each has been a hot topic by itself. However, ranking objects globally without considering which clusters they belong to often leads to dumb results, e.g., ranking database and computer architecture conferences together may not make much sense. Similarly, clustering a huge number of objects (e.g., thousands of authors) in one huge cluster without distinction is dull as well. In this paper, we address the problem of generating clusters for a specified type of objects, as well as ranking information for all types of objects based on these clusters in a multi-typed (i.e., heterogeneous) information network. A novel clustering framework called RankClus is proposed that directly generates clusters integrated with ranking. Based on initial K clusters, ranking is applied separately, which serves as a good measure for each cluster. Then, we use a mixture model to decompose each object into a K-dimensional vector, where each dimension is a component coefficient with respect to a cluster, which is measured by rank distribution. Objects then are reassigned to the nearest cluster under the new measure space to improve clustering. As a result, quality of clustering and ranking are mutually enhanced, which means that the clusters are getting more accurate and the ranking is getting more meaningful. Such a progressive refinement process iterates until little change can be made. Our experiment results show that RankClus can generate more accurate clusters and in a more efficient way than the state-of-the-art link-based clustering methods. Moreover, the clustering results with ranks can provide more informative views of data compared with traditional clustering.","author":["Yizhou Sun","Jiawei Han","Peixiang Zhao","Zhijun Yin","Hong Cheng","Tianyi Wu"],"issue":["EDBT '09: Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology","March 2009","Pages   565\u2013576","https://doi.org/10.1145/1516360.1516426"],"date":"24 March 2009","ref":[{"text":"J.

Previous research in graphics and vision has leveraged such nearest-neighbor searches to provide a variety of high-level digital image editing tools. However, the cost of computing a field of such matches for an entire image has eluded previous efforts to provide interactive performance. Our algorithm offers substantial performance improvements over the previous state of the art (20-100x), enabling its use in interactive editing tools. The key insights driving the algorithm are that some good patch matches can be found via random sampling, and that natural coherence in the imagery allows us to propagate such matches quickly to surrounding areas. We offer theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the algorithm, as well as empirical and practical evidence for its high quality and performance. This one simple algorithm forms the basis for a variety of tools -- image retargeting, completion and reshuffling -- that can be used together in the context of a high-level image editing application. Finally, we propose additional intuitive constraints on the synthesis process that offer the user a level of control unavailable in previous methods.","author":["Connelly Barnes","Eli Shechtman","Adam Finkelstein","Dan B Goldman"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 28","Issue 3","August 2009","Article No.: 24","pp   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/1531326.1531330"],"date":"27 July 2009","ref":[{"text":"Ashikhmin, M. 2001.

One of the difficulties is, however, that the endurance of most nonvolatile memory technologies is much shorter than the conventional SRAM and DRAM technology. This has limited its usage to only the low levels of a memory hierarchy, e.g., disks, that is far from the CPU.In this paper, we study the use of a new type of nonvolatile memories -- the Phase Change Memory (PCM) as the main memory for a 3D stacked chip. The main challenges we face are the limited PCM endurance, longer access latencies, and higher dynamic power compared to the conventional DRAM technology. We propose techniques to extend the endurance of the PCM to an average of 13 (for MLC PCM cell) to 22 (for SLC PCM) years. We also study the design choices of implementing PCM to achieve the best tradeoff between energy and performance. Our design reduced the total energy of an already low-power DRAM main memory of the same capacity by 65%, and energy-delay2 product by 60%. These results indicate that it is feasible to use PCM technology in place of DRAM in the main memory for better energy efficiency.","author":["Ping Zhou","Bo Zhao","Jun Yang","Youtao Zhang"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 37","Issue 3","June 2009","pp   14\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/1555815.1555759"],"date":"20 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"F.

This paper presents a study of NAND Flash SSD architectures and their management techniques, quantifying SSD performance under user-driven/PC applications in a multi-tasked environment; user activity represents typical PC workloads and includes browsing files and folders, emailing, text editing and document creation, surfing the web, listening to music and playing movies, editing large pictures, and running office applications.We find the following: (a) the real limitation to NAND Flash memory performance is not its low per-device bandwidth but its internal core interface; (b) NAND Flash memory media transfer rates do not need to scale up to those of HDDs for good performance; (c) SSD organizations that exploit concurrency at both the system and device level (e.g. RAID-like organizations and Micron-style (superblocks) improve performance significantly; and (d) these system- and device-level concurrency mechanisms are, to a significant degree, orthogonal: that is, the performance increase due to one does not come at the expense of the other, as each exploits a different facet of concurrency exhibited within the PC workload.","author":["Cagdas Dirik","Bruce Jacob"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 37","Issue 3","June 2009","pp   279\u2013289","https://doi.org/10.1145/1555815.1555790"],"date":"20 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"Agrawal, N., Prabhakaran, V., Wobber, T., Davis, J.

These systems must power many components for long periods of time and are particularly sensitive to energy use. Recent techniques for reducing energy consumption in wireless sensor networks, such as aggregation, require additional computation to reduce energy intensive radio transmissions. Larger demands on the processor will require more computational energy, but traditional energy reduction approaches, such as multi-core scaling with reduced frequency and voltage may prove heavy handed and ineffective for motes (sensor network nodes). Instead, application-specific hardware design (ASHD) architectures can reduce computational energy consumption by processing operations common to specific applications more efficiently than a general purpose processor. By the nature of their deeply embedded operation, motes support a limited set of applications, and thus the conventional general purpose computing paradigm may not be well-suited to mote operation. This paper examines the design considerations of a hardware accelerator for compressed Bloom filters, a data structure for efficiently storing set membership. We evaluate our ASHD design for three representative wireless sensor network applications and demonstrate that ASHD design reduces network latency by 59% and computational energy by 98%, showing the need for architecting processors for ASHD accelerators.","author":["Michael J.

In particular, the data center network should enable any server to be assigned to any service. To meet these goals, we present VL2, a practical network architecture that scales to support huge data centers with uniform high capacity between servers, performance isolation between services, and Ethernet layer-2 semantics. VL2 uses (1) flat addressing to allow service instances to be placed anywhere in the network, (2) Valiant Load Balancing to spread traffic uniformly across network paths, and (3) end-system based address resolution to scale to large server pools, without introducing complexity to the network control plane. VL2's design is driven by detailed measurements of traffic and fault data from a large operational cloud service provider. VL2's implementation leverages proven network technologies, already available at low cost in high-speed hardware implementations, to build a scalable and reliable network architecture. As a result, VL2 networks can be deployed today, and we have built a working prototype. We evaluate the merits of the VL2 design using measurement, analysis, and experiments. Our VL2 prototype shuffles 2.7 TB of data among 75 servers in 395 seconds - sustaining a rate that is 94% of the maximum possible.","author":["Albert Greenberg","James R.

The \"digital\" microfluidic biochips are manipulating liquids not as a continuous flow, but as discrete droplets, and hence they are highly reconfigurable and scalable. A digital biochip is composed of a two-dimensional array of cells, together with reservoirs for storing the samples and reagents. Several adjacent cells are dynamically grouped to form a virtual device, on which operations are executed. During the execution of an operation, the virtual device can be reconfigured to occupy a different group of cells on the array. In this paper, we present a Tabu Search metaheuristic for the synthesis of digital microfluidic biochips, which, starting from a biochemical application and a given biochip architecture, determines the allocation, resource binding, scheduling and placement of the operations in the application. In our approach, we consider moving the modules during their operation, in order to improve the completion time of the biochemical application. The proposed heuristic has been evaluated using three real-life case studies and ten synthetic benchmarks.","author":["Elena Maftei","Paul Pop","Jan Madsen"],"issue":["CASES '09: Proceedings of the 2009 international conference on Compilers, architecture, and synthesis for embedded systems","October 2009","Pages   195\u2013204","https://doi.org/10.1145/1629395.1629423"],"date":"11 October 2009","ref":[{"text":"Advanced Liquid Logic. http://www.liquid--logic.com/technology.html.","order":1},{"text":"K.

Process variations cause large fluctuations in performance and power consumption in the manufactured chips. In addition, these fluctuations cause reductions in the chip yields. In this work, we present an analysis of a representative high-performance processor architecture and show that the caches have the highest probability of causing yield losses under process variations. We then propose a novel selective wordline voltage boosting mechanism that aims at reducing the latency of the cache lines that are affected by process variations. We show that our approach can eliminate over 80% of the yield losses under medium level of variations, while incurring less than 1% per-access energy overhead on average and less than 4.5% area overhead.","author":["Yan Pan","Joonho Kong","Serkan Ozdemir","Gokhan Memik","Sung Woo Chung"],"issue":["DAC '09: Proceedings of the 46th Annual Design Automation Conference","July 2009","Pages   57\u201362","https://doi.org/10.1145/1629911.1629929"],"date":"26 July 2009","ref":[{"text":"A.

These systems often rely on collaborating filtering (CF), where past transactions are analyzed in order to establish connections between users and products. The most common approach to CF is based on neighborhood models, which originate from similarities between products or users. In this work we introduce a new neighborhood model with an improved prediction accuracy. Unlike previous approaches that are based on heuristic similarities, we model neighborhood relations by minimizing a global cost function. Further accuracy improvements are achieved by extending the model to exploit both explicit and implicit feedback by the users. Past models were limited by the need to compute all pairwise similarities between items or users, which grow quadratically with input size. In particular, this limitation vastly complicates adopting user similarity models, due to the typical large number of users. Our new model solves these limitations by factoring the neighborhood model, thus making both item-item and user-user implementations scale linearly with the size of the data. The methods are tested on the Netflix data, with encouraging results.","author":["Yehuda Koren"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data","Volume 4","Issue 1","January 2010","Article No.: 1","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/1644873.1644874"],"date":"18 January 2010","ref":[{"text":"Adomavicius, G. and Tuzhilin, A. 2005.

The Wisconsin Wind Tunnel (WWT) runs a parallel shared-memory program on a parallel computer (CM-5) and uses execution-driven, distributed, discrete-event simulation to accurately calculate program execution time. WWT is a virtual prototype that exploits similarities between the system under design (the target) and an existing evaluation platform (the host). The host directly executes all target program instructions and memory references that hit in the target cache. WWT's shared memory uses the CM-5 memory's error-correcting code (ECC) as valid bits for a fine-grained extension of shared virtual memory. Only memory references that miss in the target cache trap to WWT, which simulates a cache-coherence protocol. WWT correctly interleaves target machine events and calculates target program execution time. WWT runs on parallel computers with greater speed and memory capacity than uniprocessors. WWT's simulation time decreases as target system size increases for fixed-size problems and holds roughly constant as the target system and problem scale.","author":["Steven K. Reinhardt","Mark D.

Driven by mutual benefits, or by regulations that require certain data to be published, there is a demand for the exchange and publication of data among various parties. Data in its original form, however, typically contains sensitive information about individuals, and publishing such data will violate individual privacy. The current practice in data publishing relies mainly on policies and guidelines as to what types of data can be published and on agreements on the use of published data. This approach alone may lead to excessive data distortion or insufficient protection. Privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP) provides methods and tools for publishing useful information while preserving data privacy. Recently, PPDP has received considerable attention in research communities, and many approaches have been proposed for different data publishing scenarios. In this survey, we will systematically summarize and evaluate different approaches to PPDP, study the challenges in practical data publishing, clarify the differences and requirements that distinguish PPDP from other related problems, and propose future research directions.","author":["Benjamin C.

However, concurrent programming, which is always challenging, is made much more so by two problems. First, real multiprocessors typically do not provide the sequentially consistent memory that is assumed by most work on semantics and verification. Instead, they have relaxed memory models, varying in subtle ways between processor families, in which different hardware threads may have only loosely consistent views of a shared memory. Second, the public vendor architectures, supposedly specifying what programmers can rely on, are often in ambiguous informal prose (a particularly poor medium for loose specifications), leading to widespread confusion.In this paper we focus on x86 processors. We review several recent Intel and AMD specifications, showing that all contain serious ambiguities, some are arguably too weak to program above, and some are simply unsound with respect to actual hardware. We present a new x86-TSO programmer's model that, to the best of our knowledge, suffers from none of these problems. It is mathematically precise (rigorously defined in HOL4) but can be presented as an intuitive abstract machine which should be widely accessible to working programmers. We illustrate how this can be used to reason about the correctness of a Linux spinlock implementation and describe a general theory of data-race freedom for x86-TSO. This should put x86 multiprocessor system building on a more solid foundation; it should also provide a basis for future work on verification of such systems.","author":["Peter Sewell","Susmit Sarkar","Scott Owens","Francesco Zappa Nardelli","Magnus O.

Previous approaches to these problems either relied heavily on programmer support to partition an application, or they were coarse-grained requiring full process (or full VM) migration. MAUI uses the benefits of a managed code environment to offer the best of both worlds: it supports fine-grained code offload to maximize energy savings with minimal burden on the programmer. MAUI decides at run-time which methods should be remotely executed, driven by an optimization engine that achieves the best energy savings possible under the mobile device's current connectivity constrains. In our evaluation, we show that MAUI enables: 1) a resource-intensive face recognition application that consumes an order of magnitude less energy, 2) a latency-sensitive arcade game application that doubles its refresh rate, and 3) a voice-based language translation application that bypasses the limitations of the smartphone environment by executing unsupported components remotely.","author":["Eduardo Cuervo","Aruna Balasubramanian","Dae-ki Cho","Alec Wolman","Stefan Saroiu","Ranveer Chandra","Paramvir Bahl"],"issue":["MobiSys '10: Proceedings of the 8th international conference on Mobile systems, applications, and services","June 2010","Pages   49\u201362","https://doi.org/10.1145/1814433.1814441"],"date":"15 June 2010","ref":[{"text":"R.

Small changes to critical regions, on the other hand, can induce disproportionally large changes in the behavior or output. Identifying the critical and forgiving regions in the input and the corresponding critical and forgiving regions of code is directly relevant to many software engineering tasks. We present a system, Snap, for automatically grouping related input bytes into fields and classifying each field and corresponding regions of code as critical or forgiving. Given an application and one or more inputs, Snap uses targeted input fuzzing in combination with dynamic execution and influence tracing to classify regions of input fields and code as critical or forgiving. Our experimental evaluation shows that Snap makes classifications with close to perfect precision (99%) and very good recall (between 99% and 73%, depending on the application).","author":["Michael Carbin","Martin C.

Differential privacy offers a strong statistical guarantee that the effect of the presence of any individual in a database will be negligible, even when an adversary has auxiliary knowledge. Much of the prior work in this area consists of proving algorithms to be differentially private one at a time; we propose to streamline this process with a functional language whose type system automatically guarantees differential privacy, allowing the programmer to write complex privacy-safe query programs in a flexible and compositional way. The key novelty is the way our type system captures function sensitivity, a measure of how much a function can magnify the distance between similar inputs: well-typed programs not only can't go wrong, they can't go too far on nearby inputs. Moreover, by introducing a monad for random computations, we can show that the established definition of differential privacy falls out naturally as a special case of this soundness principle. We develop examples including known differentially private algorithms, privacy-aware variants of standard functional programming idioms, and compositionality principles for differential privacy.","author":["Jason Reed","Benjamin C.

Our communication architecture is runtime adaptive and it deploys a distributed artificial neural network to aid routing decisions. It thereby provides a light-weight mechanism for local routing information to propagate through the communication architecture and is capable of self-organizing efficiently (since scalable) to varying communication workload scenarios. The underlying basic concepts are borrowed from spiking neural networks, a special case of artificial neural networks. Our experiments show that already with low hardware overhead, a significant improvement of the runtime routing behavior compared to current state-of-the-art approaches is possible. We report an improvement of 23% in routing quality compared to wXY [9] routing in terms of failed transactions.","author":["Thomas Ebi","Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque","J\u00f6rg Henkel"],"issue":["CODES/ISSS '10: Proceedings of the eighth IEEE/ACM/IFIP international conference on Hardware/software codesign and system synthesis","October 2010","Pages   223\u2013230","https://doi.org/10.1145/1878961.1879002"],"date":"24 October 2010","ref":[{"text":"G.

On the one hand early limit studies report that DVFS is effective at large timescales (on the order of million(s) of cycles) with large scaling overheads (on the order of tens of microseconds), and they conclude that there is no need for small overhead DVFS at small timescales. Recent work on the other hand\u2014motivated by the surge of on-chip voltage regulator research\u2014explores the potential of fine-grained DVFS and reports substantial energy savings at timescales of hundreds of cycles (while assuming no scaling overhead).This article unifies these apparently contradictory conclusions through a DVFS limit study that simultaneously explores timescale and scaling speed. We find that coarse-grained DVFS is unaffected by timescale and scaling speed, however, fine-grained DVFS may lead to substantial energy savings for memory-intensive workloads. Inspired by these insights, we subsequently propose a fine-grained microarchitecture-driven DVFS mechanism that scales down voltage and frequency upon individual off-chip memory accesses using on-chip regulators. Fine-grained DVFS reduces energy consumption by 12% on average and up to 23% over a collection of memory-intensive workloads for an aggressively clock-gated processor, while incurring an average 0.08% performance degradation (and at most 0.14%). We also demonstrate that the proposed fine-grained DVFS mechanism is orthogonal to existing coarse-grained DVFS policies, and further reduces energy by 6% on average and up to 11% for memory-intensive applications with limited performance impact (at most 0.7%).","author":["Stijn Eyerman","Lieven Eeckhout"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 8","Issue 1","April 2011","Article No.: 1","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/1952998.1952999"],"date":"05 February 2011","ref":[{"text":"Abedinpour, S., Bakkaloglu, B., and Kiaei, S. 2007.

Best-effort Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) designs, such as Sun's prototype Rock processor and AMD's proposed Advanced Synchronization Facility (ASF), can efficiently execute many transactions, but abort in some cases due to various limitations. Hybrid TM systems can use a compatible software TM (STM) in such cases.We introduce a family of hybrid TMs built using the recent NOrec STM algorithm that, unlike existing hybrid approaches, provide both low overhead on hardware transactions and concurrent execution of hardware and software transactions.

To address this problem, we introduce GraphStep, a domain-specific compute model that captures algorithms that act on static, irregular, sparse graphs. In GraphStep, algorithms are expressed directly without requiring the programmer to explicitly manage parallel synchronization, operation ordering, placement, or scheduling details. Problems in the sparse graph domain are usually highly concurrent and communicate along graph edges. Exposing concurrency and communication structure allows scheduling of parallel operations and management of communication that is necessary for performance on a spatial computer. We study the performance of a semantic network application, a shortest-path application, and a max-flow/min-cut application. We introduce a language syntax for GraphStep applications. The total speedup over sequential versions of the applications studied ranges from a factor of 19 to a factor of 15,000. Spatially-aware graph optimizations (e.g., node decomposition, placement and route scheduling) delivered speedups from 3 to 30 times over a spatially-oblivious mapping.","author":["Michael Delorimier","Nachiket Kapre","Nikil Mehta","Andr\u00e9 Dehon"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems","Volume 6","Issue 3","September 2011","Article No.: 17","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/2019583.2019584"],"date":"29 September 2011","ref":[{"text":"Agha, G. 1998.

There are several types of microfluidic biochips, each having its advantages and limitations. In this paper we are interested in flow-based biochips, in which the flow of liquid is manipulated using integrated microvalves. By combining several microvalves, more complex units, such as micropumps, switches, mixers, and multiplexers, can be built. Although researchers have proposed significant work on the system-level synthesis of droplet-based biochips, which manipulate droplets on a two-dimensional array of electrodes, no research on system-level synthesis of flow-based bioch-ips has been reported so far. The focus has been on application modeling and component-level simulation. Therefore, for the first time to our knowledge, we propose a system-level modeling and synthesis approach for flow-based biochips. We have developed a topology graph-based model of the biochip architecture, and we have used a sequencing graph to model the biochemical applications. We consider that the architecture of the biochip is given, and we are interested to synthesize an implementation, consisting of the binding of operations in the application to the functional units of the architecture, the scheduling of operations and the routing and scheduling of the fluid flows, such that the application completion time is minimized. We propose a List Scheduling-based heuristic for solving this problem. The proposed heuristic has been evaluated using two real-life case studies and a set of four synthetic benchmarks.","author":["Wajid Hassan Minhass","Paul Pop","Jan Madsen"],"issue":["CASES '11: Proceedings of the 14th international conference on Compilers, architectures and synthesis for embedded systems","October 2011","Pages   225\u2013234","https://doi.org/10.1145/2038698.2038733"],"date":"09 October 2011","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, memory controller design has so far largely focused on improving average-case performance. As a consequence, the latency of memory accesses is unpredictable, which complicates the worst-case execution time analysis necessary for hard real-time embedded systems. Our work introduces a novel DRAM controller design that is predictable and that significantly reduces worst-case access latencies. Instead of viewing the DRAM device as one resource that can only be shared as a whole, our approach views it as multiple resources that can be shared between one or more clients individually. We partition the physical address space following the internal structure of the DRAM device, i.e., its ranks and banks, and interleave ac- cesses to the blocks of this partition. This eliminates contention for shared resources within the device, making accesses temporally predictable and temporally isolated. This paper describes our DRAM controller design and its integration with a precision-timed (PRET) architecture called PTARM. We present analytical bounds on the latency and throughput of the proposed controller, and confirm these via simulation.","author":["Jan Reineke","Isaac Liu","Hiren D. Patel","Sungjun Kim","Edward A.

It can simplify network and traffic management in enterprise and data center environments, because it enables flow-level control over Ethernet switching and provides global visibility of the flows in the network. However, such fine-grained control and visibility comes with costs: the switch-implementation costs of involving the switch's control-plane too often and the distributed-system costs of involving the OpenFlow controller too frequently, both on flow setups and especially for statistics-gathering.In this paper, we analyze these overheads, and show that OpenFlow's current design cannot meet the needs of high-performance networks. We design and evaluate DevoFlow, a modification of the OpenFlow model which gently breaks the coupling between control and global visibility, in a way that maintains a useful amount of visibility without imposing unnecessary costs. We evaluate DevoFlow through simulations, and find that it can load-balance data center traffic as well as fine-grained solutions, without as much overhead: DevoFlow uses 10--53 times fewer flow table entries at an average switch, and uses 10--42 times fewer control messages.","author":["Andrew R.

In this paper, we present a performance analysis framework that can help shed light on such bottlenecks for GPGPU applications. Although a handful of GPGPU profiling tools exist, most of the traditional tools, unfortunately, simply provide programmers with a variety of measurements and metrics obtained by running applications, and it is often difficult to map these metrics to understand the root causes of slowdowns, much less decide what next optimization step to take to alleviate the bottleneck. In our approach, we first develop an analytical performance model that can precisely predict performance and aims to provide programmer-interpretable metrics. Then, we apply static and dynamic profiling to instantiate our performance model for a particular input code and show how the model can predict the potential performance benefits. We demonstrate our framework on a suite of micro-benchmarks as well as a variety of computations extracted from real codes.","author":["Jaewoong Sim","Aniruddha Dasgupta","Hyesoon Kim","Richard Vuduc"],"issue":["PPoPP '12: Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGPLAN symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming","February 2012","Pages   11\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/2145816.2145819"],"date":"25 February 2012","ref":[{"text":"MacSim. http://code.google.com/p/macsim/.","order":1},{"text":"S.

Among various approaches to address this problem, we propose to reduce the number of writes to the flash via exploiting the content locality between the write data and its corresponding old version in the flash. This content locality means, the new version, i.e., the content of a new write request, shares some extent of similarity with its old version. The information redundancy existing in the difference (delta) between the new and old data leads to a small compression ratio. The key idea of our approach, named Delta-FTL (Delta Flash Translation Layer), is to store this compressed delta in the SSD, instead of the original new data, in order to reduce the number of writes committed to the flash. This write reduction further extends the lifetime of SSDs due to less frequent garbage collection process, which is a significant write amplification factor in SSDs. Experimental results based on our Delta-FTL prototype show that Delta-FTL can significantly reduce the number of writes and garbage collection operations and thus improve SSD lifetime at a cost of trivial overhead on read latency performance.","author":["Guanying Wu","Xubin He"],"issue":["EuroSys '12: Proceedings of the 7th ACM european conference on Computer Systems","April 2012","Pages   253\u2013266","https://doi.org/10.1145/2168836.2168862"],"date":"10 April 2012","ref":[{"text":"ARM Cortex R4. www.arm.com/files/pdf/Cortex-R4-white-paper.pdf.","order":1},{"text":"N.

We show that the light field emitted by an N-layer, M-frame tensor display can be represented by an Nth-order, rank-M tensor. Using this representation we introduce a unified optimization framework, based on nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF), encompassing all tensor display architectures. This framework is the first to allow joint multilayer, multiframe light field decompositions, significantly reducing artifacts observed with prior multilayer-only and multiframe-only decompositions; it is also the first optimization method for designs combining multiple layers with directional backlighting. We verify the benefits and limitations of tensor displays by constructing a prototype using modified LCD panels and a custom integral imaging backlight. Our efficient, GPU-based NTF implementation enables interactive applications. Through simulations and experiments we show that tensor displays reveal practical architectures with greater depths of field, wider fields of view, and thinner form factors, compared to prior automultiscopic displays.","author":["Gordon Wetzstein","Douglas Lanman","Matthew Hirsch","Ramesh Raskar"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 31","Issue 4","July 2012","Article No.: 80","pp   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/2185520.2185576"],"date":"01 July 2012","ref":[{"text":"Akeley, K., Watt, S.

Main memory subsystem is expected to consist of hybrid DRAM and phase-change RAM (PRAM) due to the difficulties in DRAM scaling. In this work, we address the performance optimization of the hybrid DRAM/PRAM main memory for single chip CPU/GPU. Based on the tight requirements of low latency from CPU and the relative tolerance to long latency from GPU, DRAM is first allocated to CPU while PRAM with longer write latency is allocated to GPU. Then, in order to improve the write performance of GPU traffic, we propose (1) an in-DRAM write buffer to accommodate GPU write traffics, (2) dynamic hot data management to improve the efficiency of write buffer, (3) runtime-adaptive adjustment of write buffer size to meet the given CPU performance bound, and (4) CPU-aware DRAM access scheduling to give low latency to CPU traffics. The experiments show that the proposed method gives 1.02~44.2 times performance improvement in GPU performance with modest (negligible) CPU performance overhead (when compute-intensive CPU programs run).","author":["Dongki Kim","Sungkwang Lee","Jaewoong Chung","Dae Hyun Kim","Dong Hyuk Woo","Sungjoo Yoo","Sunggu Lee"],"issue":["DAC '12: Proceedings of the 49th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2012","Pages   888\u2013896","https://doi.org/10.1145/2228360.2228519"],"date":"03 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"Intel, Co., 2","order":1},{"text":"NVIDIA.

This continues to be true in spite of various synchronization-reduction techniques that have been proposed. Previously studied synchronization-reduction techniques tacitly assume that all synchronizations specified in a source program are essential to guarantee quality of the results produced by the program. Recently there have been proposals to relax the synchronizations in a parallel program and compute approximate results. A fundamental challenge in using relaxed synchronization is guaranteeing that the relaxed program always produces results with a specified quality. We propose a methodology that addresses this challenge in programming with relaxed synchronization. Using our methodology programmers can systematically relax synchronization while always producing results that are of same quality as the original (un-relaxed) program. We demonstrate significant speedups using our methodology on a variety of benchmarks (e.g., up to 15x on KMeans benchmark, and up to 3x on a already highly tuned kernel from Graph500 benchmark).","author":["Lakshminarayanan Renganarayana","Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan","Ravi Nair","Daniel Prener"],"issue":["RACES '12: Proceedings of the 2012 ACM workshop on Relaxing synchronization for multicore and manycore scalability","October 2012","Pages   41\u201350","https://doi.org/10.1145/2414729.2414737"],"date":"21 October 2012","ref":[{"text":"J.

The impending resistivity increase in the Cu wires is found to cause significant decrease of both write and read window margins at the regime when electron surface scattering and grain boundary scattering are substantial. At deeply-scaled device dimensions, the wire energy dissipation and wire latency become comparable to or even exceed the intrinsic values of memory cells. The large current density flowing through the wordlines/bitlines raises additional reliability concerns for the cross-point memory array. All these issues are exacerbated at smaller memory resistance values and larger memory array sizes. They thereby impose strict constraints on the memory device design and preclude the realization of large-scale cross-point memory array with minimum feature sizes beyond the 10 nm node. A rethink in the design methodology of cross-point memory to incorporate and mitigate the scaling effects of wordline/bitline is necessary.

This necessitates the need to realize efficient mapping methodologies for such complex computing platforms. This paper provides an extensive survey and categorization of state-of-the-art mapping methodologies and highlights the emerging trends for multi/many-core systems. The methodologies aim at optimizing system's resource usage, performance, power consumption, temperature distribution and reliability for varying application models. The methodologies perform design-time and run-time optimization for static and dynamic workload scenarios, respectively. These optimizations are necessary to fulfill the end-user demands. Comparison of the methodologies based on their optimization aim has been provided. The trend followed by the methodologies and open research challenges have also been discussed.","author":["Amit Kumar Singh","Muhammad Shafique","Akash Kumar","J\u00f6rg Henkel"],"issue":["DAC '13: Proceedings of the 50th Annual Design Automation Conference","May 2013","Article No.: 1","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2463209.2488734"],"date":"29 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"W.

Hekaton is fully integrated into SQL Server; it is not a separate system. To take advantage of Hekaton, a user simply declares a table memory optimized. Hekaton tables are fully transactional and durable and accessed using T-SQL in the same way as regular SQL Server tables. A query can reference both Hekaton tables and regular tables and a transaction can update data in both types of tables. T-SQL stored procedures that reference only Hekaton tables can be compiled into machine code for further performance improvements. The engine is designed for high con-currency. To achieve this it uses only latch-free data structures and a new optimistic, multiversion concurrency control technique. This paper gives an overview of the design of the Hekaton engine and reports some experimental results.","author":["Cristian Diaconu","Craig Freedman","Erik Ismert","Per-Ake Larson","Pravin Mittal","Ryan Stonecipher","Nitin Verma","Mike Zwilling"],"issue":["SIGMOD '13: Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","June 2013","Pages   1243\u20131254","https://doi.org/10.1145/2463676.2463710"],"date":"22 June 2013","ref":[{"text":"Florian Funke, Alfons Kemper, Thomas Neumann: HyPer-sonic Combined Transaction AND Query Processing.

Unlike standard parallelizing compilers (which are designed to preserve the semantics of the original sequential computation), QuickStep is instead designed to generate (potentially nondeterministic) parallel programs that produce acceptably accurate results acceptably often. The freedom to generate parallel programs whose output may differ (within statistical accuracy bounds) from the output of the sequential program enables a dramatic simplification of the compiler, a dramatic increase in the range of applications that it can parallelize, and a significant expansion in the range of parallel programs that it can legally generate.Results from our benchmark set of applications show that QuickStep can automatically generate acceptably accurate and efficient parallel programs---the automatically generated parallel versions of five of our six benchmark applications run between 5.0 and 7.8 times faster on eight cores than the original sequential versions. These applications and parallelizations contain features (such as the use of modern object-oriented programming constructs or desirable parallelizations with infrequent but acceptable data races) that place them inherently beyond the reach of standard approaches.","author":["Sasa Misailovic","Deokhwan Kim","Martin Rinard"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 12","Issue 2s","May 2013","Article No.: 88","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/2465787.2465790"],"date":"01 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"Aleen, F. and Clark, N. 2009.

Zombie supports both single-level cell (SLC) and multi-level cell (MLC) variants. It extends the lifetime of blocks in working memory pages (primary blocks) by pairing them with spare blocks, i.e., working blocks in pages that have been disabled due to exhaustion of a single block's error correction resources, which would be 'dead' otherwise. Spare blocks adaptively provide error correction resources to primary blocks as failures accumulate over time. This reduces the waste caused by early block failures, making working blocks in discarded pages a useful resource. Even though we use PCM as the target technology, Zombie applies to any memory technology that suffers stuck-at cell failures. This paper describes the Zombie framework, a combination of two new error correction mechanisms (ZombieXOR for SLC and ZombieMLC for MLC) and the extension of two previously proposed SLC mechanisms (ZombieECP and ZombieERC). The result is a 58% to 92% improvement in endurance for Zombie SLC memory and an even more impressive 11x to 17x improvement for ZombieMLC, both with performance overheads of only 0.1% when memories using prior error correction mechanisms reach end of life.","author":["Rodolfo Azevedo","John D.

However, due to frequent machine replacements and upgrades, modern WSCs are in fact composed of diverse commodity microarchitectures and machine configurations. Yet, current WSCs are architected with the assumption of homogeneity, leaving a potentially significant performance opportunity unexplored. In this paper, we expose and quantify the performance impact of the \"homogeneity assumption\" for modern production WSCs using industry-strength large-scale web-service workloads. In addition, we argue for, and evaluate the benefits of, a heterogeneity-aware WSC using commercial web-service production workloads including Google's web-search. We also identify key factors impacting the available performance opportunity when exploiting heterogeneity and introduce a new metric, opportunity factor, to quantify an application's sensitivity to the heterogeneity in a given WSC. To exploit heterogeneity in \"homogeneous\" WSCs, we propose \"Whare-Map,\" the WSC Heterogeneity Aware Mapper that leverages already in-place continuous profiling subsystems found in production environments. When employing \"Whare-Map\", we observe a cluster-wide performance improvement of 15% on average over heterogeneity--oblivious job placement and up to an 80% improvement for web-service applications that are particularly sensitive to heterogeneity.","author":["Jason Mars","Lingjia Tang"],"issue":["ISCA '13: Proceedings of the 40th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2013","Pages   619\u2013630","https://doi.org/10.1145/2485922.2485975"],"date":"23 June 2013","ref":[{"text":"D.

Unikernels are single-purpose appliances that are compile-time specialised into standalone kernels, and sealed against modification when deployed to a cloud platform. In return they offer significant reduction in image sizes, improved efficiency and security, and should reduce operational costs. Our Mirage prototype compiles OCaml code into unikernels that run on commodity clouds and offer an order of magnitude reduction in code size without significant performance penalty. The architecture combines static type-safety with a single address-space layout that can be made immutable via a hypervisor extension. Mirage contributes a suite of type-safe protocol libraries, and our results demonstrate that the hypervisor is a platform that overcomes the hardware compatibility issues that have made past library operating systems impractical to deploy in the real-world.","author":["Anil Madhavapeddy","Richard Mortier","Charalampos Rotsos","David Scott","Balraj Singh","Thomas Gazagnaire","Steven Smith","Steven Hand","Jon Crowcroft"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 48","Issue 4","April 2013","pp   461\u2013472","https://doi.org/10.1145/2499368.2451167"],"date":"16 March 2013","ref":[{"text":"D.

Empirical analysis, on recently crawled product reviews from a popular Chinese e-commerce website, reveals the failure of many state-of-the-art spam indicators on detecting collusive spammers. Two novel methods are then proposed: 1) a KNN-based method that considers the pairwise similarity of two reviewers based on their group-level relational information and selects k most similar reviewers for voting; 2) a more general graph-based classification method that jointly classifies a set of reviewers based on their pairwise transaction correlations. Experimental results show that both our methods promisingly outperform the indicator-only classifiers in various settings.","author":["Chang Xu","Jie Zhang","Kuiyu Chang","Chong Long"],"issue":["CIKM '13: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management","October 2013","Pages   979\u2013988","https://doi.org/10.1145/2505515.2505700"],"date":"27 October 2013","ref":[{"text":"S.

However, the relatively slow switching times (10--100 ms) assumed by these approaches, and the accompanying latencies of their control planes, has limited its use to only the largest data center networks with highly aggregated and constrained workloads. As faster switch technologies become available, designing a control plane capable of supporting them becomes a key challenge.In this paper, we design and implement an OCS prototype capable of switching in 11.5 us, and we use this prototype to expose a set of challenges that arise when supporting switching at microsecond time scales. In response, we propose a microsecond-latency control plane based on a circuit scheduling approach we call Traffic Matrix Scheduling (TMS) that proactively communicates circuit assignments to communicating entities so that circuit bandwidth can be used efficiently.","author":["George Porter","Richard Strong","Nathan Farrington","Alex Forencich","Pang Chen-Sun","Tajana Rosing","Yeshaiahu Fainman","George Papen","Amin Vahdat"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 43","Issue 4","October 2013","pp   447\u2013458","https://doi.org/10.1145/2534169.2486007"],"date":"27 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"M.

However, some of these promising technologies, such as image-guided online replanning and arc therapy, rely heavily on the availability of fast dose calculation. In this article, based on a popular dose calculation algorithm, the Collapsed-Cone Convolution/Superposition (CCCS) algorithm, we present a multi-FPGA accelerator to speed up radiation dose calculation. Our performance-driven design strategy yields a fully pipelined architecture, which includes a resource-economic raytracing engine and high-performance energy deposition pipeline. An evaluation based on a set of clinical treatment planning cases confirms that our FPGA design almost fully utilizes the available external memory bandwidth and achieves close to the best possible performance for the CCCS algorithm while using less resource. Compared with an existing FPGA design which aimed to accelerate the identical algorithm, the proposed design achieved 1.9X speedup by providing better memory bandwidth utilization (81.7% v.s. 43% of the available external memory bandwidth), higher working frequency (90MHz v.s. 70MHz) and less logic resource usage (25K v.s. 55K logic cells). Furthermore, it obtains a speedup of 20X over a commercial multithreaded software on a quad-core system and 15X performance improvement over closely related results. In terms of accuracy, the measured less than 1% statistical fluctuation indicates that our solution is practical in real medical scenarios.","author":["Bo Zhou","Xiaobo Sharon Hu","Danny Z.

Conversely, most hits observed by the SLLC come from a small subset of already reused lines. In this paper, we propose the reuse cache, a decoupled tag/data SLLC which is designed to only store the data of lines that have been reused. Thus, the size of the data array can be dramatically reduced. Specifically, we (i) introduce a selective data allocation policy to exploit reuse locality and maintain reused data in the SLLC, (ii) tune the data allocation with a suitable replacement policy and coherence protocol, and finally, (iii) explore different ways of organizing the data/tag arrays and study the performance sensitivity to the size of the resulting structures. The role of a reuse cache to maintain performance with decreasing sizes is investigated in the experimental part of this work, by simulating multiprogrammed and multithreaded workloads in an eight-core chip multiprocessor. As an example, we show that a reuse cache with a tag array equivalent to a conventional 4 MB cache and only a 1 MB data array would perform as well as a conventional cache of 8 MB, requiring only 16.7% of the storage capacity.","author":["Jorge Albericio","Pablo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez","V\u00edctor Vi\u00f1als","Jos\u00e9 M.

As the capacity of DRAM memories has increased, so has the amount of time consumed in doing refresh. Refresh operations contend with read operations, which increases read latency and reduces system performance. We show that eliminating latency penalty due to refresh can improve average performance by 7.2%. However, simply doing intelligent scheduling of refresh operations is ineffective at obtaining significant performance improvement.This article provides an alternative and scalable option to reduce the latency penalty due to refresh. It exploits the property that each refresh operation in a typical DRAM device internally refreshes multiple DRAM rows in JEDEC-based distributed refresh mode. Therefore, a refresh operation has well-defined points at which it can potentially be Paused to service a pending read request. Leveraging this property, we propose Refresh Pausing, a solution that is highly effective at alleviating the contention from refresh operations. It provides an average performance improvement of 5.1% for 8Gb devices and becomes even more effective for future high-density technologies. We also show that Refresh Pausing significantly outperforms the recently proposed Elastic Refresh scheme.","author":["Prashant J. Nair","Chia-Chen Chou","Moinuddin K.

An increase in the voltage drop above the threshold level, caused by EM-induced increase in resistances of the individual interconnect segments, is considered as a failure criterion. It replaces a currently employed conservative weakest segment criterion, which does not account an essential redundancy for current propagation existing in the power-ground (p/g) networks. EM-induced increase in the resistance of the individual grid segments is described in the approximation of the recently developed physics-based formalism for void nucleation and growth. A statistical approach to calculation of the void nucleation times in the group of branches comprising the interconnect tree is implemented. As a result, p/g networks become time-varying linear networks. A developed technique for calculating the hydrostatic stress evolution inside a multi-branch interconnect tree allows to avoid over optimistic prediction of the time-to-failure (TTF) made with the Blech-Black analysis of individual branches of interconnect tree. Experimental results obtained on a number of IBM benchmark circuits validate the proposed methodology.","author":["Xin Huang","Tan Yu","Valeriy Sukharev","Sheldon X.-D.

To send multiple streams of data in a MIMO system, prior designs rely on a technique called zero-forcing, a way of \"nulling\" the interference between data streams by mathematically inverting the wireless channel matrix. In general, zero-forcing is highly effective, significantly improving throughput. But in certain physical situations, the MIMO channel matrix can become \"poorly conditioned,\" harming performance. With these situations in mind, Geosphere uses sphere decoding, a more computationally demanding technique that can achieve higher throughput in such channels. To overcome the sphere decoder's computational complexity when sending dense wireless constellations at a high rate, Geosphere introduces search and pruning techniques that incorporate novel geometric reasoning about the wireless constellation. These techniques reduce computational complexity of 256-QAM systems by almost one order of magnitude, bringing computational demands in line with current 16- and 64-QAM systems already realized in ASIC.

Traditional techniques to optimize flow-level metrics do not perform well in optimizing such collections, because the network is largely agnostic to application-level requirements. The recently proposed coflow abstraction bridges this gap and creates new opportunities for network scheduling. In this paper, we address inter-coflow scheduling for two different objectives: decreasing communication time of data-intensive jobs and guaranteeing predictable communication time. We introduce the concurrent open shop scheduling with coupled resources problem, analyze its complexity, and propose effective heuristics to optimize either objective. We present Varys, a system that enables data-intensive frameworks to use coflows and the proposed algorithms while maintaining high network utilization and guaranteeing starvation freedom. EC2 deployments and trace-driven simulations show that communication stages complete up to 3.16X faster on average and up to 2X more coflows meet their deadlines using Varys in comparison to per-flow mechanisms. Moreover, Varys outperforms non-preemptive coflow schedulers by more than 5X.","author":["Mosharaf Chowdhury","Yuan Zhong","Ion Stoica"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM conference on SIGCOMM","August 2014","Pages   443\u2013454","https://doi.org/10.1145/2619239.2626315"],"date":"17 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"Akka. http://akka.io.","order":1},{"text":"Amazon EC2. http://aws.amazon.com/ec2.","order":2},{"text":"Apache Hadoop. http://hadoop.apache.org.","order":3},{"text":"Apache Hive. http://hive.apache.org.","order":4},{"text":"Kryo serialization library. https://code.google.com/p/kryo.","order":5},{"text":"S.

Based on experience with these prototypes, we identify additional steps that will be required for ONOS to support use cases such as core network traffic engineering and scheduling, and to become a usable open source, distributed network OS platform that the SDN community can build upon.","author":["Pankaj Berde","Matteo Gerola","Jonathan Hart","Yuta Higuchi","Masayoshi Kobayashi","Toshio Koide","Bob Lantz","Brian O'Connor","Pavlin Radoslavov","William Snow","Guru Parulkar"],"issue":["HotSDN '14: Proceedings of the third workshop on Hot topics in software defined networking","August 2014","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2620728.2620744"],"date":"22 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"Open Networking Foundation.

However, a key weakness of topic modeling is that it needs a large amount of data (e.g., thousands of documents) to provide reliable statistics to generate coherent topics. However, in practice, many document collections do not have so many documents. Given a small number of documents, the classic topic model LDA generates very poor topics. Even with a large volume of data, unsupervised learning of topic models can still produce unsatisfactory results. In recently years, knowledge-based topic models have been proposed, which ask human users to provide some prior domain knowledge to guide the model to produce better topics. Our research takes a radically different approach. We propose to learn as humans do, i.e., retaining the results learned in the past and using them to help future learning. When faced with a new task, we first mine some reliable (prior) knowledge from the past learning/modeling results and then use it to guide the model inference to generate more coherent topics. This approach is possible because of the big data readily available on the Web. The proposed algorithm mines two forms of knowledge: must-link (meaning that two words should be in the same topic) and cannot-link (meaning that two words should not be in the same topic). It also deals with two problems of the automatically mined knowledge, i.e., wrong knowledge and knowledge transitivity. Experimental results using review documents from 100 product domains show that the proposed approach makes dramatic improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.","author":["Zhiyuan Chen","Bing Liu"],"issue":["KDD '14: Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2014","Pages   1116\u20131125","https://doi.org/10.1145/2623330.2623622"],"date":"24 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"D.

However, their computational and energy requirements can be quite high, and hence their energy-efficient implementation is of great interest. We propose a new approach to design energy-efficient hardware implementations of large-scale neural networks (NNs) using approximate computing. Our work is motivated by the observations that (i) NNs are used in applications where less-than-perfect results are acceptable, and often inevitable, and (ii) they are highly resilient to inexactness in many (but not all) of their constituent computations. We make two key contributions. First, we propose a method to transform any given NN into an Approximate Neural Network (AxNN). This is performed by (i) adapting the backpropagation technique, which is commonly used to train these networks, to quantify the impact of approximating each neuron to the overall network quality (e.g., classification accuracy), and (ii) selectively approximating those neurons that impact network quality the least. Further, we make the key observation that training is a naturally error-healing process that can be used to mitigate the impact of approximations to neurons. Therefore, we incrementally retrain the network with the approximations in-place, reclaiming a significant portion of the quality ceded by approximations. As a second contribution, we propose a programmable and quality-configurable neuromorphic processing engine (qcNPE), which utilizes arrays of specialized processing elements that execute neuron computations with dynamically configurable accuracies and can be used to execute AxNNs from diverse applications. We evaluated the proposed approach by constructing AXNNs for 6 recognition applications (ranging in complexity from 12-47,818 neurons and 160-3,155,968 connections) and executing them on two different platforms--qcNPE implementation containing 272 processing elements in 45nm technology and a commodity Intel Xeon server. Our results demonstrate 1.14X-1.92X energy benefits for virtually no loss (< 0.5%) in output quality, and even higher improvements (upto 2.3X) when some loss (upto 7.5%) in output quality is acceptable.","author":["Swagath Venkataramani","Ashish Ranjan","Kaushik Roy","Anand Raghunathan"],"issue":["ISLPED '14: Proceedings of the 2014 international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2014","Pages   27\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/2627369.2627613"],"date":"11 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"K.

One of the main benefits of such architecture is its latency-hiding capability. However, the efficacy of GPU's latency-hiding varies significantly across GPGPU applications. To investigate this, this paper first proposes a new algorithm that profiles execution behavior of GPGPU applications. We characterize latencies caused by various pipeline hazards, memory accesses, synchronization primitives, and the warp scheduler. Our results show that the current round-robin warp scheduler works well in overlapping various latency stalls with the execution of other available warps for only a few GPGPU applications. For other applications, there is an excessive latency stall that cannot be hidden by the scheduler effectively. With the latency characterization insight, we observe a significant execution time disparity for warps within the same thread block, which causes sub-optimal performance, called the warp criticality problem. To tackle the warp criticality problem, we design a family of criticality-aware warp scheduling (CAWS) policies by scheduling the critical warp(s) more frequently than other warps. Our results on the breadth-first-search, B+tree search, two point angular correlation function, and K-means clustering show that, with oracle knowledge of warp criticality, our best-performing scheduling policy can improve GPGPU applications' performance by 17% on average. With our designed criticality predictor, the various scheduling policies can improve performance by 10-21% on breadth-first-search. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to characterize warp criticality and explore different criticality-aware warp scheduling policies for GPGPU workloads.","author":["Shin-Ying Lee","Carole-Jean Wu"],"issue":["PACT '14: Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on Parallel architectures and compilation","August 2014","Pages   175\u2013186","https://doi.org/10.1145/2628071.2628107"],"date":"24 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, all methods for such automatic sample preparation suffer from a drawback that they assume the availability of input fluids in pure form, that is, each with an extreme concentration factor (CF) of 100%. In many real-life scenarios, the stock solutions consist of samples/reagents with multiple CFs. No algorithm is yet known for preparing a target mixture of fluids with a given ratio when its constituents are supplied with random concentrations. An intriguing question is whether or not a given target ratio is feasible to produce from such a general input condition. In this article, we first study the feasibility properties for the generalized mixing problem under the (1:1) mix-split model with an allowable error in the target CFs not exceeding 1 2d, where the integer d is user specified and denotes the desired accuracy level of CF. Next, an algorithm is proposed which produces the desired target ratio of N reagents in ONd mix-split steps, where N (\u2009\u2265\u20093) denotes the number of constituent fluids in the mixture. The feasibility analysis also leads to the characterization of the total space of input stock solutions from which a given target mixture can be derived, and conversely, the space of all target ratios, which are derivable from a given set of input reagents with arbitrary CFs. Finally, we present a generalized algorithm for diluting a sample S in minimum (1:1) mix-split steps when two or more arbitrary concentrations of S (diluted with the same buffer) are supplied as inputs. These results settle several open questions in droplet-based algorithmic microfluidics and offer efficient solutions for a wider class of on-chip sample preparation problems.","author":["Sudip Roy","Bhargab B.

One important challenge is that network holes may arbitrarily increase the routing path length. Fortunately, recent studies have shown that constant path stretch is achievable using nonlocal information. The constant stretch, however, is possible at the cost of high communication and storage overhead: a source node must complete a \u201cpath-setup\u201d process prior to data transmission by exchanging a message with a destination node using a default geographic routing (e.g., GPSR). In this article, we propose the first geographic routing protocol (LVGR) that provably achieves worst-case stretch of \u0398 (D/\u03b3) (where D is the diameter of the network and \u03b3 is the communication range of nodes) with low communication and storage overhead. LVGR represents a hole as a convex hull, the internal structure of which is represented as a local visibility graph. Based on the convex hulls and local visibility graphs, LVGR generates paths with guaranteed stretch. Through theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we prove the worst-case stretch of LVGR and demonstrate that LVGR reduces communication overhead by up to 97% and storage overhead by up to 60%, compared with the state of the art.","author":["Myounggyu Won","Radu Stoleru"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks","Volume 11","Issue 1","November 2014","Article No.: 18","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/2629659"],"date":"04 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"Noa Arad and Yuval Shavitt. 2009.

However, operators often lack intelligent mechanisms to control the way users access their WiFi networks. This lack of sophisticated control creates poor network utilization, which in turn degrades the quality of experience (QoE). To meet user traffic demands, it is evident that operators need solutions that optimally balance user traffic across cellular and WiFi networks. Motivated by the lack of practical solutions in this space, we design and implement ATOM - an end-to-end system for adaptive traffic offloading for WiFi-LTE deployments. ATOM has two novel components: (i) A network interface selection algorithm that maps user traffic across WiFi and LTE to optimize user QoE and (ii) an interface switching service that seamlessly re-directs ongoing user sessions in a cost-effective and standards-compatible manner. Our evaluations on a real LTE-WiFi testbed using YouTube traffic reveals that ATOM reduces video stalls by 3-4 times compared to naive solutions.","author":["Rajesh Mahindra","Hari Viswanathan","Karthik Sundaresan","Mustafa Y.

Service providers have to go through effort-intensive and time-consuming business negotiations with building operators, or hire dedicated personnel to gather such data. In this paper, we propose Jigsaw, a floor plan reconstruction system that leverages crowdsensed data from mobile users. It extracts the position, size and orientation information of individual landmark objects from images taken by users. It also obtains the spatial relation between adjacent landmark objects from inertial sensor data, then computes the coordinates and orientations of these objects on an initial floor plan. By combining user mobility traces and locations where images are taken, it produces complete floor plans with hallway connectivity, room sizes and shapes. Our experiments on 3 stories of 2 large shopping malls show that the 90-percentile errors of positions and orientations of landmark objects are about 1~2m and 5~9\u00b0, while the hallway connectivity is 100% correct.","author":["Ruipeng Gao","Mingmin Zhao","Tao Ye","Fan Ye","Yizhou Wang","Kaigui Bian","Tao Wang","Xiaoming Li"],"issue":["MobiCom '14: Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking","September 2014","Pages   249\u2013260","https://doi.org/10.1145/2639108.2639134"],"date":"07 September 2014","ref":[{"text":"Accelerometer, Gyro and IMU Buying Guide. https://www.sparkfun.com/pages/accel_gyro_guide.","order":1},{"text":"Google indoor maps availability. http://support.google.com/gmm/bin/answer.py?hl=en\\&answer=1685827.","order":2},{"text":"M.

Loss of accuracy is not permissible in all computing domains, but there are a growing number of data-intensive domains where the output of programs need not be perfectly correct to provide useful results or even noticeable differences to the end user. These soft domains include multimedia processing, machine learning, and data mining/analysis. An important challenge with approximate computing is transparency to insulate both software and hardware developers from the time, cost, and difficulty of using approximation. This paper proposes a software-only system, Paraprox, for realizing transparent approximation of data-parallel programs that operates on commodity hardware systems. Paraprox starts with a data-parallel kernel implemented using OpenCL or CUDA and creates a parameterized approximate kernel that is tuned at runtime to maximize performance subject to a target output quality (TOQ) that is supplied by the user. Approximate kernels are created by recognizing common computation idioms found in data-parallel programs (e.g., Map, Scatter/Gather, Reduction, Scan, Stencil, and Partition) and substituting approximate implementations in their place. Across a set of 13 soft data-parallel applications with at most 10% quality degradation, Paraprox yields an average performance gain of 2.7x on a NVIDIA GTX 560 GPU and 2.5x on an Intel Core i7 quad-core processor compared to accurate execution on each platform.","author":["Mehrzad Samadi","Davoud Anoushe Jamshidi","Janghaeng Lee","Scott Mahlke"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 42","Issue 1","March 2014","pp   35\u201350","https://doi.org/10.1145/2654822.2541948"],"date":"24 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"The credit card equation, 2013. http://faculty.bennington.edu/~jzimba/CreditCardEquation Derivation.pdf.","order":1},{"text":"A.

The identities of Bitcoin users are hidden behind pseudonyms (public keys) which are recommended to be changed frequently in order to increase transaction unlinkability. We present an efficient method to deanonymize Bitcoin users, which allows to link user pseudonyms to the IP addresses where the transactions are generated. Our techniques work for the most common and the most challenging scenario when users are behind NATs or firewalls of their ISPs. They allow to link transactions of a user behind a NAT and to distinguish connections and transactions of different users behind the same NAT. We also show that a natural countermeasure of using Tor or other anonymity services can be cut-off by abusing anti-DoS countermeasures of the Bitcoin network. Our attacks require only a few machines and have been experimentally verified. The estimated success rate is between 11% and 60% depending on how stealthy an attacker wants to be. We propose several countermeasures to mitigate these new attacks.","author":["Alex Biryukov","Dmitry Khovratovich","Ivan Pustogarov"],"issue":["CCS '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","November 2014","Pages   15\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/2660267.2660379"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"Best VPN's using Bitcoin. https://bitcointalk.org?topic=247212.0, 2014.","order":1},{"text":"Bitcoin code project, v.0.8.6. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin, 2014.","order":2},{"text":"Bitcoin Wiki. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/, 2014.","order":3},{"text":"Bitnodes. https://github.com/ayeowch/bitnodes, 2014.","order":4},{"text":"BlockChain.info. https://blockchain.info/charts, 2014.","order":5},{"text":"D.

We relied on two state of the art methods for SATD, one using the Fast Hadamard Transform (FHT) butterfly and another one using the so-called Transform-Exempted (TE) SATD algorithm. Those were combined with architectural decisions, as the use of a transpose buffer. A total of six Hadamard-based SATD architectures were synthesized for a commercial 45 nm standard cell library. The best energy results are related to TE-SATD architectures: down to 7.62 pJ/SATD in the case of parallel architecture with pipeline. However, considering also the area results when evaluating energy, the best results are achieved when both methods are applied to the transpose buffer base architecture: nearly 10 pJ/SATD with up to 71% smaller area compared with parallel base architectures.","author":["Luiz Henrique Cancellier","Andr\u00e9 Beims Br\u00e4scher","Ismael Seidel","Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds G\u00fcntzel"],"issue":["SBCCI '14: Proceedings of the 27th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design","September 2014","Article No.: 36","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2660540.2661004"],"date":"01 September 2014","ref":[{"text":"F.

Several new approaches and technologies are being considered as potential elements making up such a future mobile network, including cloud RANs, application of SDN principles, exploiting new and unused portions of spectrum, use of massive MIMO and full-duplex communications. Research on these technologies requires realistic and flexible experimentation platforms that offer a wide range of experimentation modes from real-world experimentation to controlled and scalable evaluations while at the same time retaining backward compatibility with current generation systems.

In this article we present a framework that enables the exploration, both analytically and experimentally, of properties of code-improving transformations. The major component of the framework is a specification language, Gospel, for expressing the conditions needed to safely apply a transformation and the actions required to change the code to implement the transformation. The framework includes a technique that facilitates an analytical investigation of code-improving transformations using the Gospel specifications. It also contains a tool, Genesis, that automatically produces a  transformer that implements the transformations specified in Gospel. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework by exploring the enabling and disabling properties of transformations. We first present analytical results on the enabling and disabling properties of a set of code transformations, including both traditional and parallelizing transformations, and then describe experimental results showing the types of transformations and the enabling and disabling interactions actually found in a set of programs.","author":["Deborah L.

The field is in need of a systematic review due to the recent influx of Multimodal (MM) affect detection systems that differ in several respects and sometimes yield incompatible results. This article provides such a survey via a quantitative review and meta-analysis of 90 peer-reviewed MM systems. The review indicated that the state of the art mainly consists of person-dependent models (62.2% of systems) that fuse audio and visual (55.6%) information to detect acted (52.2%) expressions of basic emotions and simple dimensions of arousal and valence (64.5%) with feature- (38.9%) and decision-level (35.6%) fusion techniques. However, there were also person-independent systems that considered additional modalities to detect nonbasic emotions and complex dimensions using model-level fusion techniques. The meta-analysis revealed that MM systems were consistently (85% of systems) more accurate than their best unimodal counterparts, with an average improvement of 9.83% (median of 6.60%). However, improvements were three times lower when systems were trained on natural (4.59%) versus acted data (12.7%). Importantly, MM accuracy could be accurately predicted (cross-validated R2 of 0.803) from unimodal accuracies and two system-level factors. Theoretical and applied implications and recommendations are discussed.","author":["Sidney K.

The special case of measuring coherence of topics has been recently studied to remedy the problem that topic models give no guaranty on the interpretablity of their output. Several benchmark datasets were produced that record human judgements of the interpretability of topics. We are the first to propose a framework that allows to construct existing word based coherence measures as well as new ones by combining elementary components. We conduct a systematic search of the space of coherence measures using all publicly available topic relevance data for the evaluation. Our results show that new combinations of components outperform existing measures with respect to correlation to human ratings. nFinally, we outline how our results can be transferred to further applications in the context of text mining, information retrieval and the world wide web.","author":["Michael R\u00f6der","Andreas Both","Alexander Hinneburg"],"issue":["WSDM '15: Proceedings of the Eighth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2015","Pages   399\u2013408","https://doi.org/10.1145/2684822.2685324"],"date":"02 February 2015","ref":[{"text":"N.

One promising approach to energy-efficient computation, approximate computing, trades off output accuracy for significant gains in energy efficiency. However, debugging the actual cause of output quality problems in approximate programs is challenging. This paper presents dynamic techniques to debug and monitor the quality of approximate computations. We propose both offline debugging tools that instrument code to determine the key sources of output degradation and online approaches that monitor the quality of deployed applications. We present two offline debugging techniques and three online monitoring mechanisms. The first offline tool identifies correlations between output quality and the execution of individual approximate operations. The second tracks approximate operations that flow into a particular value. Our online monitoring mechanisms are complementary approaches designed for detecting quality problems in deployed applications, while still maintaining the energy savings from approximation. We present implementations of our techniques and describe their usage with seven applications. Our online monitors control output quality while still maintaining significant energy efficiency gains, and our offline tools provide new insights into the effects of approximation on output quality.","author":["Michael Ringenburg","Adrian Sampson","Isaac Ackerman","Luis Ceze","Dan Grossman"],"issue":["ASPLOS '15: Proceedings of the Twentieth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2015","Pages   399\u2013411","https://doi.org/10.1145/2694344.2694365"],"date":"14 March 2015","ref":[{"text":"Carlos Alvarez, Jesus Corbal, and Mateo Valero.

However, ECC still involves complex modular arithmetic that is a particular burden for small processors. In this context, Bernstein proposed the highly efficient ECC instance Curve25519 that particularly enables efficient software implementations at a security level comparable to AES-128 with inherent resistance to simple power analysis (SPA) and timing attacks. In this work, we show that Curve25519 is likewise competitive on FPGAs even when countermeasures to thwart side-channel power analysis are included. Our basic multicore DSP-based architectures achieves a maximal performance of more than 32,000 point multiplications per second on a Xilinx Zynq 7020 FPGA. Including a mix of side-channel countermeasures to impede simple and differential power analysis, we still achieve more than 27,500 point multiplications per second with a moderate increase in logic resources.","author":["Pascal Sasdrich","Tim G\u00fcneysu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 9","Issue 1","November 2015","Article No.: 3","pp   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/2700834"],"date":"04 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"ANSI X9.62-2005. 2005.

However, many neural networks utilized in real applications often have a sparse connectivity, which is hard to be efficiently mapped to a crossbar structure. Moreover, the scale of the neural networks is normally much larger than that can be offered by the latest integration technology of memristor crossbars. In this work, we propose AutoNCS -- an EDA framework that can automate the NCS designs that combine memristor crossbars and discrete synapse modules. The connections of the neural networks are clustered to improve the utilization of the memristor elements in crossbar structures by taking into account the physical design cost of the NCS. Our results show that AutoNCS can substantially enhance the utilization efficiency of memristor crossbars while reducing the wirelength, area and delay of the physical designs of the NCS.","author":["Wei Wen","Chi-Ruo Wu","Xiaofang Hu","Beiye Liu","Tsung-Yi Ho","Xin Li","Yiran Chen"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 12","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744795"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"M.

This work is motivated by the observation that the register values of threads within the same warp are similar, namely the arithmetic differences between two successive thread registers is small. Removing data redundancy of register values through register compression reduces the effective register width, thereby enabling power reduction opportunities. GPU register files are huge as they are necessary to keep concurrent execution contexts and to enable fast context switching. As a result register file consumes a large fraction of the total GPU chip power. GPU design trends show that the register file size will continue to increase to enable even more thread level parallelism. To reduce register file data redundancy warped-compression uses low-cost and implementation-efficient base-delta-immediate (BDI) compression scheme, that takes advantage of banked register file organization used in GPUs. Since threads within a warp write values with strong similarity, BDI can quickly compress and decompress by selecting either a single register, or one of the register banks, as the primary base and then computing delta values of all the other registers, or banks. Warped-compression can be used to reduce both dynamic and leakage power. By compressing register values, each warp-level register access activates fewer register banks, which leads to reduction in dynamic power. When fewer banks are used to store the register content, leakage power can be reduced by power gating the unused banks. Evaluation results show that register compression saves 25% of the total register file power consumption.","author":["Sangpil Lee","Keunsoo Kim","Gunjae Koo","Hyeran Jeon","Won Woo Ro","Murali Annavaram"],"issue":["ISCA '15: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2015","Pages   502\u2013514","https://doi.org/10.1145/2749469.2750417"],"date":"13 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"CACTI: An integrated cache and memory access time, cycle time, area, leakage, and dynamic power model. {Online}.

The collection and analysis of such data has the potential to support various applications, including personalized medical services. While the benefits of the genomics revolution are trumpeted by the biomedical community, the increased availability of such data has major implications for personal privacy; notably because the genome has certain essential features, which include (but are not limited to) (i) an association with traits and certain diseases, (ii) identification capability (e.g., forensics), and (iii) revelation of family relationships. Moreover, direct-to-consumer DNA testing increases the likelihood that genome data will be made available in less regulated environments, such as the Internet and for-profit companies. The problem of genome data privacy thus resides at the crossroads of computer science, medicine, and public policy. While the computer scientists have addressed data privacy for various data types, there has been less attention dedicated to genomic data. Thus, the goal of this paper is to provide a systematization of knowledge for the computer science community. In doing so, we address some of the (sometimes erroneous) beliefs of this field and we report on a survey we conducted about genome data privacy with biomedical specialists. Then, after characterizing the genome privacy problem, we review the state-of-the-art regarding privacy attacks on genomic data and strategies for mitigating such attacks, as well as contextualizing these attacks from the perspective of medicine and public policy. This paper concludes with an enumeration of the challenges for genome data privacy and presents a framework to systematize the analysis of threats and the design of countermeasures as the field moves forward.","author":["Muhammad Naveed","Erman Ayday","Ellen W.

In this paper we propose a novel polynomial time algorithm for optimal FPGA mapping with forward retiming to minimize the clock period with guaranteed initial state computation. It enables a new methodology of separating forward retiming from backward retiming to avoid time-consuming iterations between retiming and initial state computation. Our algorithm compares very favorably with both of the conventional approaches of separate mapping followed by retiming [1, 8] and the recent approaches of combined mapping with retiming [12, 2]. It is also applicable to circuits with partial initial state assignment.","author":["Jason Cong","Chang Wu"],"issue":["DAC '98: Proceedings of the 35th annual Design Automation Conference","May 1998","Pages   330\u2013335","https://doi.org/10.1145/277044.277139"],"date":"01 May 1998","ref":[{"text":"J.

We show that simple packet delay, measured as round-trip times at hosts, is an effective congestion signal without the need for switch feedback. First, we show that advances in NIC hardware have made RTT measurement possible with microsecond accuracy, and that these RTTs are sufficient to estimate switch queueing. Then we describe how TIMELY can adjust transmission rates using RTT gradients to keep packet latency low while delivering high bandwidth. We implement our design in host software running over NICs with OS-bypass capabilities. We show using experiments with up to hundreds of machines on a Clos network topology that it provides excellent performance: turning on TIMELY for OS-bypass messaging over a fabric with PFC lowers 99 percentile tail latency by 9X while maintaining near line-rate throughput. Our system also outperforms DCTCP running in an optimized kernel, reducing tail latency by $13$X. To the best of our knowledge, TIMELY is the first delay-based congestion control protocol for use in the datacenter, and it achieves its results despite having an order of magnitude fewer RTT signals (due to NIC offload) than earlier delay-based schemes such as Vegas.","author":["Radhika Mittal","Vinh The Lam","Nandita Dukkipati","Emily Blem","Hassan Wassel","Monia Ghobadi","Amin Vahdat","Yaogong Wang","David Wetherall","David Zats"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Conference on Special Interest Group on Data Communication","August 2015","Pages   537\u2013550","https://doi.org/10.1145/2785956.2787510"],"date":"17 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"Chelsio T5 Packet Rate Performance Report. http://goo.gl/3jJL6p, Pg 2.","order":1},{"text":"Data Center Bridging Task Group. http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/dcbridges.html.","order":2},{"text":"Dual Port 10 Gigabit Server Adapter with Precision Time Stamping. http://goo.gl/VtL5oO.","order":3},{"text":"Gnuplot documentation. http://goo.gl/4sgrUU, Pg. 48.","order":4},{"text":"Mellanox for Linux. http://goo.gl/u44Xea.","order":5},{"text":"The NetFPGA Project. http://netfpga.org/.","order":6},{"text":"TSO Sizing and the FQ Scheduler. http://lwn.net/Articles/564978/.","order":7},{"text":"Using Hardware Timestamps with PF RING. http://goo.gl/oJtHCe, 2011.","order":8},{"text":"Who (Really) Needs Sub-microsecond Packet Timestamps? http://goo.gl/TI3r1u, 2013.","order":9},{"text":"A.

In this paper, we identify, analyze and address the synchronization (sync) inefficiency problem of modern mobile cloud storage services. Our measurement results demonstrate that existing commercial sync services fail to make full use of available bandwidth, and generate a large amount of unnecessary sync traffic in certain circumstance even though the incremental sync is implemented. These issues are caused by the inherent limitations of the sync protocol and the distributed architecture. Based on our findings, we propose QuickSync, a system with three novel techniques to improve the sync efficiency for mobile cloud storage services, and build the system on two commercial sync services. Our experimental results using representative workloads show that QuickSync is able to reduce up to 52.9% sync time in our experiment settings.","author":["Yong Cui","Zeqi Lai","Xin Wang","Ningwei Dai","Congcong Miao"],"issue":["MobiCom '15: Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking","September 2015","Pages   592\u2013603","https://doi.org/10.1145/2789168.2790094"],"date":"07 September 2015","ref":[{"text":"Dynamorio. http://dynamorio.org.","order":1},{"text":"Googledrive. http://www.google.com/drive/index.html.","order":2},{"text":"librsync. http://librsync.sourceforge.net/.","order":3},{"text":"Onedrive. https://onedrive.live.com.","order":4},{"text":"Seafile source code. https://github.com/haiwen/seafile.","order":5},{"text":"B.

Aside from users' ratings, their affiliated reviews often provide the rationale for their ratings and identify what aspects of the item they cared most about. We explore the rich evidence source of aspects in user reviews to improve top-N recommendation. By extracting aspects (i.e., the specific properties of items) from textual reviews, we enrich the user--item binary relation to a user--item--aspect ternary relation. We model the ternary relation as a heterogeneous tripartite graph, casting the recommendation task as one of vertex ranking. We devise a generic algorithm for ranking on tripartite graphs -- TriRank -- and specialize it for personalized recommendation. Experiments on two public review datasets show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Most importantly, TriRank endows the recommender system with a higher degree of explainability and transparency by modeling aspects in reviews. It allows users to interact with the system through their aspect preferences, assisting users in making informed decisions.","author":["Xiangnan He","Tao Chen","Min-Yen Kan","Xiao Chen"],"issue":["CIKM '15: Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2015","Pages   1661\u20131670","https://doi.org/10.1145/2806416.2806504"],"date":"17 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"S.

To achieve low latency, RAMCloud stores all data in DRAM at all times. To support large capacities (1PB or more), it aggregates the memories of thousands of servers into a single coherent key-value store. RAMCloud ensures the durability of DRAM-based data by keeping backup copies on secondary storage. It uses a uniform log-structured mechanism to manage both DRAM and secondary storage, which results in high performance and efficient memory usage. RAMCloud uses a polling-based approach to communication, bypassing the kernel to communicate directly with NICs; with this approach, client applications can read small objects from any RAMCloud storage server in less than 5\u03bcs, durable writes of small objects take about 13.5\u03bcs. RAMCloud does not keep multiple copies of data online; instead, it provides high availability by recovering from crashes very quickly (1 to 2 seconds). RAMCloud\u2019s crash recovery mechanism harnesses the resources of the entire cluster working concurrently so that recovery performance scales with cluster size.","author":["John Ousterhout","Arjun Gopalan","Ashish Gupta","Ankita Kejriwal","Collin Lee","Behnam Montazeri","Diego Ongaro","Seo Jin Park","Henry Qin","Mendel Rosenblum","Stephen Rumble","Ryan Stutsman","Stephen Yang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Computer Systems","Volume 33","Issue 3","September 2015","Article No.: 7","pp   1\u201355","https://doi.org/10.1145/2806887"],"date":"31 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"Ars Technica. 2013.

Circuit ORAM makes both theoretical and practical contributions. From a theoretical perspective, Circuit ORAM shows that the well-known Goldreich-Ostrovsky logarithmic ORAM lower bound is tight under certain parameter ranges, for several performance metrics. Therefore, we are the first to give an answer to a theoretical challenge that remained open for the past twenty-seven years. Second, Circuit ORAM earns its name because it achieves (almost) optimal circuit size both in theory and in practice for realistic choices of block sizes. We demonstrate compelling practical performance and show that Circuit ORAM is an ideal candidate for secure multi-party computation applications.","author":["Xiao Wang","Hubert Chan","Elaine Shi"],"issue":["CCS '15: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2015","Pages   850\u2013861","https://doi.org/10.1145/2810103.2813634"],"date":"12 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/672.pdf.","order":1},{"text":"http://www.oblivm.com.","order":2},{"text":"D.

Focusing on two methods from prior work, random differential testing and testing via equivalence modulo inputs (EMI), we present several strategies for random generation of deterministic, communicating OpenCL kernels, and an injection mechanism that allows EMI testing to be applied to kernels that otherwise exhibit little or no dynamically-dead code. We use these methods to conduct a large, controlled testing campaign with respect to 21 OpenCL (device, compiler) configurations, covering a range of CPU, GPU, accelerator, FPGA and emulator implementations. Our study provides independent validation of claims in prior work related to the effectiveness of random differential testing and EMI testing, proposes novel methods for lifting these techniques to the many-core setting and reveals a significant number of OpenCL compiler bugs in commercial implementations.","author":["Christopher Lidbury","Andrei Lascu","Nathan Chong","Alastair F.

External analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are combined together with the FPGA to form a complete, application-specific system. This system is thus limited in compactness, flexibility, and reconfigurability. To address those issues we propose an ADC architecture, implemented in a FPGA, that is fully reconfigurable and easy to calibrate. This allows to alter the design, according to the system requirements. Therefore it can be used in a wide range of operating conditions and adjusted to changes in supply voltage and FPGA temperature. This architecture employs time-to-digital converters (TDCs) and phase interpolation techniques to reach a sampling rate higher than the clock frequency (400 MHz) of up to 1.2 GSa/s. The resulting FPGA ADC can achieve a 6 bit resolution over a 0.6 to 1.9 V input range. The system non-linearities (INL, DNL) are less than 0.45 LSB. The main advantages of this architecture are its scalability and reconfigurability, enabling applications with changing demands, on one single platform.","author":["Stefan Visser","Harald Homulle","Edoardo Charbon"],"issue":["FPGA '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2016","Pages   281","https://doi.org/10.1145/2847263.2847310"],"date":"21 February 2016","ref":[{"text":"Lattice 2010 Leveraging {FPGA} and {CPLD} digital logic to implement analog to digital converters,\" Lattice Semiconductor, Mar. 2010. {Online}.

A high-intensity laser excites physical matter to emit light at an arbitrary three-dimensional position. Popular applications can thus be explored, especially because plasma induced by a femtosecond laser is less harmful than that generated by a nanosecond laser. There are two methods of rendering graphics with a femtosecond laser in air: producing holograms using spatial light modulation technology and scanning of a laser beam by a galvano mirror. The holograms and workspace of the system proposed here occupy a volume of up to 1 cm3; however, this size is scalable depending on the optical devices and their setup. This article provides details of the principles, system setup, and experimental evaluation, and discusses the scalability, design space, and applications of this system. We tested two laser sources: an adjustable (30--100fs) laser that projects up to 1,000 pulses/s at an energy of up to 7mJ/pulse and a 269fs laser that projects up to 200,000 pulses/s at an energy of up to 50\u03bcJ/pulse. We confirmed that the spatiotemporal resolution of volumetric displays implemented using these laser sources is 4,000 and 200,000 dots/s, respectively. Although we focus on laser-induced plasma in air, the discussion presented here is also applicable to other rendering principles such as fluorescence and microbubbles in solid or liquid materials.","author":["Yoichi Ochiai","Kota Kumagai","Takayuki Hoshi","Jun Rekimoto","Satoshi Hasegawa","Yoshio Hayasaki"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 35","Issue 2","May 2016","Article No.: 17","pp   1\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/2850414"],"date":"19 February 2016","ref":[{"text":"M.

AUTOGEN analyzes the set of DP table locations accessed by the iterative algorithm when run on a DP table of small size, and automatically identifies a recursive access pattern and a corresponding provably correct recursive algorithm for solving the DP recurrence. We use AUTOGEN to autodiscover efficient algorithms for several well-known problems. Our experimental results show that several autodiscovered algorithms significantly outperform parallel looping and tiled loop-based algorithms. Also these algorithms are less sensitive to fluctuations of memory and bandwidth compared with their looping counterparts, and their running times and energy profiles remain relatively more stable. To the best of our knowledge, AUTOGEN is the first algorithm that can automatically discover new nontrivial divide-and-conquer algorithms.","author":["Rezaul Chowdhury","Pramod Ganapathi","Jesmin Jahan Tithi","Charles Bachmeier","Bradley C.

Efficient graph analytics thus becomes an important subject of study. To increase efficiency and scalability, in-memory computation and parallelism have been explored extensively to speed up various graph analytical workloads. In many graph analytical engines (e.g., Pregel, Neo4j, GraphLab), parallelism is achieved via one of the three concurrency control models, namely, bulk synchronization processing (BSP), asynchronous processing, and synchronous processing. Among them, synchronous processing has the potential to achieve the best performance due to fine-grained parallelism, while ensuring the correctness and the convergence of the computation, if an effective concurrency control scheme is used. This paper explores the topological properties of the underlying graph to design and implement a highly effective concurrency control scheme for efficient synchronous processing in an in-memory graph analytical engine. Our design uses a novel hybrid approach that combines 2PL (two-phase locking) with OCC (optimistic concurrency control), for high degree and low degree vertices in a graph respectively. Our results show that the proposed hybrid synchronous scheduler has significantly outperformed other synchronous schedulers in existing graph analytical engines, as well as BSP and asynchronous schedulers.","author":["Zechao Shang","Feifei Li","Jeffrey Xu Yu","Zhiwei Zhang","Hong Cheng"],"issue":["SIGMOD '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data","June 2016","Pages   463\u2013478","https://doi.org/10.1145/2882903.2915238"],"date":"14 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"R.

To build accurate prediction models, previous studies focus on manually designing features that encode the characteristics of programs and exploring different machine learning algorithms. Existing traditional features often fail to capture the semantic differences of programs, and such a capability is needed for building accurate prediction models. To bridge the gap between programs' semantics and defect prediction features, this paper proposes to leverage a powerful representation-learning algorithm, deep learning, to learn semantic representation of programs automatically from source code. Specifically, we leverage Deep Belief Network (DBN) to automatically learn semantic features from token vectors extracted from programs' Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). Our evaluation on ten open source projects shows that our automatically learned semantic features significantly improve both within-project defect prediction (WPDP) and cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) compared to traditional features. Our semantic features improve WPDP on average by 14.7% in precision, 11.5% in recall, and 14.2% in F1. For CPDP, our semantic features based approach outperforms the state-of-the-art technique TCA+ with traditional features by 8.9% in F1.","author":["Song Wang","Taiyue Liu","Lin Tan"],"issue":["ICSE '16: Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Software Engineering","May 2016","Pages   297\u2013308","https://doi.org/10.1145/2884781.2884804"],"date":"14 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"S.

Economic forces, driven by the desire to introduce flash-based Solid-State Drives (SSDs) into the high-end storage market, have resulted in hybrid storage systems in the cloud. However, a single flash-based SSD cannot satisfy the performance, reliability, and capacity requirements of enterprise or HPC storage systems in the cloud. While an array of SSDs organized in a RAID structure, such as RAID5, provides the potential for high storage capacity and bandwidth, reliability and performance problems will likely result from the parity update operations. In this article, we propose a Log Disk Mirroring scheme (LDM) to improve the performance and reliability of SSD-based disk arrays. LDM is a hybrid disk array architecture that consists of several SSDs and two hard disk drives (HDDs). In an LDM array, the two HDDs are mirrored as a write buffer that temporally absorbs the small write requests. The small and random write data are written on the mirroring buffer by using the logging technique that sequentially appends new data. The small write data are merged and destaged to the SSD-based disk array during the system idle periods. Our prototype implementation of the LDM array and the performance evaluations show that the LDM array significantly outperforms the pure SSD-based disk arrays by a factor of 20.4 on average, and outperforms HPDA by a factor of 5.0 on average.

However, the inherent strong dispersion is a tremendous obstacle that limits the use of DOEs in full spectrum imaging, causing unacceptable loss of color fidelity in the images. In particular, metamerism introduces a data dependency in the image blur, which has been neglected in computational imaging methods so far. We introduce both a diffractive achromat based on computational optimization, as well as a corresponding algorithm for correction of residual aberrations. Using this approach, we demonstrate high fidelity color diffractive-only imaging over the full visible spectrum. In the optical design, the height profile of a diffractive lens is optimized to balance the focusing contributions of different wavelengths for a specific focal length. The spectral point spread functions (PSFs) become nearly identical to each other, creating approximately spectrally invariant blur kernels. This property guarantees good color preservation in the captured image and facilitates the correction of residual aberrations in our fast two-step deconvolution without additional color priors. We demonstrate our design of diffractive achromat on a 0.5mm ultrathin substrate by photolithography techniques. Experimental results show that our achromatic diffractive lens produces high color fidelity and better image quality in the full visible spectrum.","author":["Yifan Peng","Qiang Fu","Felix Heide","Wolfgang Heidrich"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 35","Issue 4","July 2016","Article No.: 31","pp   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897824.2925941"],"date":"11 July 2016","ref":[{"text":"Aieta, F., Genevet, P., Kats, M.

While the method of HE has been extensively cross-examined and reported in wide arrays of usability testing activities, its potential as a highly reliable inspection procedure is yet to be systematically formalized for lean development cycle. This paper demonstrated the application of the MAUi framework to the evaluation of a high-fidelity prototype that explored touchscreen interactions between three-dimension virtual objects on a mobile device. The initial results suggested that MAUi is a much reliable usability inspection method as the findings, given by four different inspectors shared 85% of true ability from user testing event. In addition, the MAUi framework can be used as a checklist for fine-tuning the readiness of any minimal viable products on mobile device.","author":["Lin Chou Cheng"],"issue":["CHIuXiD '16: Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference in HCI and UX Indonesia 2016","April 2016","Pages   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/2898459.2898460"],"date":"13 April 2016","ref":[{"text":"A.

Future systems are attempting to address these demands with heterogeneous memory architectures coupling DRAM with high capacity, low cost, but also lower performance, non-volatile memories (NVM) such as PCM and RRAM. A key usage model intended for NVM is as cheaper high capacity volatile memory. Data center operators are bound to ask whether this model for the usage of NVM to replace the majority of DRAM memory leads to a large slowdown in their applications? It is crucial to answer this question because a large performance impact will be an impediment to the adoption of such systems. This paper presents a thorough study of representative applications -- including a key-value store (MemC3), an in-memory database (VoltDB), and a graph analytics framework (GraphMat) -- on a platform that is capable of emulating a mix of memory technologies. Our conclusions are that it is indeed possible to use a mix of a small amount of fast DRAM and large amounts of slower NVM without a proportional impact to an application's performance. The caveat is that this result can only be achieved through careful placement of data structures. The contribution of this paper is the design and implementation of a set of libraries and automatic tools that enables programmers to achieve optimal data placement with minimal effort on their part. With such guided placement and with DRAM constituting only 6% of the total memory footprint for GraphMat and 25% for VoltDB and MemC3 (remaining memory is NVM with 4x higher latency and 8x lower bandwidth than DRAM), we show that our target applications demonstrate only a 13% to 40% slowdown. Without guided placement, these applications see, in the worst case, 1.5x to 5.9x slowdown on the same configuration. Based on a realistic assumption that NVM will be 5x cheaper (per bit) than DRAM, this hybrid solution also results in 2x to 2.8x better performance/$ than a DRAM-only system.","author":["Subramanya R.

Despite efforts to prevent asking questions that have already been answered, the site contains duplicate questions. This may cause developers to unnecessarily wait for a question to be answered when it has already been asked and answered. The site currently depends on its moderators and users with high reputation to manually mark those questions as duplicates, which not only results in delayed responses but also requires additional efforts. In this paper, we first perform a manual investigation to understand why users submit duplicate questions in Stack Overflow. Based on our manual investigation we propose a classification technique that uses a number of carefully chosen features to identify duplicate questions. Evaluation using a large number of questions shows that our technique can detect duplicate questions with reasonable accuracy. We also compare our technique with DupPredictor, a state-of-the-art technique for detecting duplicate questions, and we found that our proposed technique has a better recall-rate than that technique.","author":["Muhammad Ahasanuzzaman","Muhammad Asaduzzaman","Chanchal K.

However, STT-RAM suffers from a reliability issue, read disturbance, which stems from the fact that the voltage difference between read current and write current becomes smaller as technology scales. The read disturbance leads to high error rates for read operations, which cannot be effectively protected by SECDEC ECC on large-capacity register files of GPUs. Prior schemes (e.g. read-restore) to mitigate the read disturbance usually incur either non-trivial performance loss or excessive energy overhead, thus not applicable for the GPU register file design which aims to achieve both high performance and energy efficiency. To combat the read disturbance on GPU register files, we propose a novel software-hardware co-designed solution, i.e. Red-Shield, which consists of three optimizations to overcome limitations of the existing solutions. First, we identify dead reads at compiling stage and augment instructions to avoid unnecessary restores. Second, we employ a small read buffer to accommodate register reads with high access locality to further reduce restores. Third, we propose an adaptive restore mechanism to selectively pick the suitable restore scheme, according to the busy status of corresponding register banks. Experimental results show that our proposed design can effectively mitigate the performance loss and energy overhead caused by restore operations, while still maintaining the reliability of reads.","author":["Hang Zhang","Xuhao Chen","Nong Xiao","Fang Liu","Zhiguang Chen"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '16: Proceedings of the 26th edition on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2016","Pages   389\u2013392","https://doi.org/10.1145/2902961.2902988"],"date":"18 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"A.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of tree-based pipeline optimization for automating one of the most tedious parts of machine learning--pipeline design. We implement an open source Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) in Python and demonstrate its effectiveness on a series of simulated and real-world benchmark data sets. In particular, we show that TPOT can design machine learning pipelines that provide a significant improvement over a basic machine learning analysis while requiring little to no input nor prior knowledge from the user. We also address the tendency for TPOT to design overly complex pipelines by integrating Pareto optimization, which produces compact pipelines without sacrificing classification accuracy. As such, this work represents an important step toward fully automating machine learning pipeline design.","author":["Randal S. Olson","Nathan Bartley","Ryan J. Urbanowicz","Jason H.

We highlight two critical issues of existing works. First, due to the large space of unobserved feedback, most existing works resort to assign a uniform weight to the missing data to reduce computational complexity. However, such a uniform assumption is invalid in real-world settings. Second, most methods are also designed in an offline setting and fail to keep up with the dynamic nature of online data. We address the above two issues in learning MF models from implicit feedback. We first propose to weight the missing data based on item popularity, which is more effective and flexible than the uniform-weight assumption. However, such a non-uniform weighting poses efficiency challenge in learning the model. To address this, we specifically design a new learning algorithm based on the element-wise Alternating Least Squares (eALS) technique, for efficiently optimizing a MF model with variably-weighted missing data. We exploit this efficiency to then seamlessly devise an incremental update strategy that instantly refreshes a MF model given new feedback. Through comprehensive experiments on two public datasets in both offline and online protocols, we show that our implemented, open-source (https://github.com/hexiangnan/sigir16-eals) eALS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art implicit MF methods.","author":["Xiangnan He","Hanwang Zhang","Min-Yen Kan","Tat-Seng Chua"],"issue":["SIGIR '16: Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","July 2016","Pages   549\u2013558","https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2911489"],"date":"07 July 2016","ref":[{"text":"D.

We extract the best-performing syntax-based features like permissions and API calls, and some semantics-based features like happen-befores and unwanted behaviours, and train classifiers using popular supervised and semi-supervised learning methods.

The design of temporal encoder has attracted a widespread attention in the field of neuromorphic computing in the past few years. The information in the temporal encoding scheme with inter-spike intervals can arise from correlations between spike times, which could not be incorporated in the traditional rate encoding scheme. In this paper, we propose a robust and energy efficient analog implementation of the spiking temporal encoder. We pattern the neural activities across multiple timescales and encode the sensory information using time dependent temporal scales. The concept of iteration structure is introduced to construct a neural encoder that greatly increases the information process ability of the proposed temporal encoder. Integrated with iteration technique and operational-amplifier-free design, the error rate of the output temporal codes is reduced to an extremely low level. A lower sampling rate accompanied by additional verification spikes is introduced in the schemes, which significantly reduces the power consumption of the encoding system. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed neuron circuit is the first analog hardware implementation of the neural encoder that could present the sensory data using inter-spike interval temporal encoding scheme. The simulation and measurement results show the proposed temporal encoder exhibits not only energy efficiency but also high accuracy.","author":["Chenyuan Zhao","Jialing Li","Yang Yi"],"issue":["ICCAD '16: Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2016","Article No.: 115","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967052"],"date":"07 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"D.

Our configuration technique adjusts the number of channels in the network dynamically depending on response time, power, and accuracy targets. To enable this dynamic configuration technique, we co-design a new training algorithm, where the network is incrementally trained such that the weights in channels trained in earlier steps are fixed. Our technique provides the flexibility of multiple networks while storing and utilizing one set of weights. We evaluate our techniques using both an ASIC-based hardware accelerator as well as a low-power embedded GPGPU and show that our approach leads to only a small or negligible loss in the final network accuracy. We analyze the performance of our proposed methodology using three well-known networks for MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets, and we show that we are able to achieve up to 95% energy reduction with less than 1% accuracy loss across the three benchmarks. In addition, compared to prior work on dynamic network reconfiguration, we show that our approach leads to approximately 50% savings in storage requirements, while achieving similar accuracy.","author":["Hokchhay Tann","Soheil Hashemi","R.

A fundamental problem in a DSDPS is the scheduling problem (i.e., assigning workload to workers/machines) with the objective of minimizing average end-to-end tuple processing time. A widely-used solution is to distribute workload evenly over machines in the cluster in a round-robin manner, which is obviously not efficient due to lack of consideration for communication delay. Model-based approaches (such as queueing theory) do not work well either due to the high complexity of the system environment.We aim to develop a novel model-free approach that can learn to well control a DSDPS from its experience rather than accurate and mathematically solvable system models, just as a human learns a skill (such as cooking, driving, swimming, etc). Specifically, we, for the first time, propose to leverage emerging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for enabling model-free control in DSDPSs; and present design, implementation and evaluation of a novel and highly effective DRL-based control framework, which minimizes average end-to-end tuple processing time by jointly learning the system environment via collecting very limited runtime statistics data and making decisions under the guidance of powerful Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). To validate and evaluate the proposed framework, we implemented it based on a widely-used DSDPS, Apache Storm, and tested it with three representative applications: continuous queries, log stream processing and word count (stream version). Extensive experimental results show 1) Compared to Storm's default scheduler and the state-of-the-art model-based method, the proposed framework reduces average tuple processing by 33.5% and 14.0% respectively on average. 2) The proposed framework can quickly reach a good scheduling solution during online learning, which justifies its practicability for online control in DSDPSs.","author":["Teng Li","Zhiyuan Xu","Jian Tang","Yanzhi Wang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 6","February 2018","pp   705\u2013718","https://doi.org/10.14778/3199517.3199521"],"date":"01 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,","order":1},{"text":"A.M.

Users are not aware of multiple languages, so the language diversity becomes a great barrier for world communication. Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) provides a solution for this language barrier, where a user can search in his native language and get the relevant information in the required language. Currently, distributed word vector representation has a trend in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) task. These word vectors are used to identify similar contextual words. In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of word vectors across the languages in Hindi-English CLIR. Skip-Gram Model (SGM) is used to learn bi-lingual word vectors from sentence aligned comparable corpus. IBM model is used to align the source language and target language words from sentence aligned comparable corpus. Best target language translation is selected with the help of top-n word alignments and word vectors.","author":["Vijay Kumar Sharma","Namita Mittal"],"issue":["ICIA-16: Proceedings of the International Conference on Informatics and Analytics","August 2016","Article No.: 28","Pages   1\u20134","https://doi.org/10.1145/2980258.2980310"],"date":"25 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"Mustafa A, Tait J, and Oakes M.

With the appearance of fraudsters in social network sites, the importance of trust prediction has increased. Most such methods use only explicit and implicit trust information (e.g., if Smith likes several of Johnson's reviews, then Smith implicitly trusts Johnson), but they do not consider distrust. In this paper, we propose PIN-TRUST, a novel method to handle all three types of interaction information: explicit trust, implicit trust, and explicit distrust. The novelties of our method are the following: (a) it is carefully designed, to take into account positive, implicit, and negative information, (b) it is scalable (i.e., linear on the input size), (c) most importantly, it is effective and accurate. Our extensive experiments with a real dataset, Epinions.com data, of 100K nodes and 1M edges, confirm that PIN-TRUST is scalable and outperforms existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy, achieving up to 50.4 percentage relative improvement.","author":["Min-Hee Jang","Christos Faloutsos","Sang-Wook Kim","U Kang","Jiwoon Ha"],"issue":["CIKM '16: Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2016","Pages   629\u2013638","https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983753"],"date":"24 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"L.

The appropriate choice for a particular access can reduce the average memory latency. However, since application access patterns change at run time, static page policies cannot guarantee to deliver optimum execution time. Hybrid page policies have been investigated as a means of covering these dynamic scenarios and are now implemented in state-of-the-art processors. Hybrid page policies switch between open-page and close-page policies while the application is running, by monitoring the access pattern of row hits/conflicts and predicting future behavior. Unfortunately, as the size of DRAM memory increases, fine-grain tracking and analysis of memory access patterns does not remain practical. We propose a compact memory address-based encoding technique which can improve or maintain the performance of DRAMs page closure predictors while reducing the hardware overhead in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques. As a case study, we integrate our technique, HAPPY, with a state-of-the-art Intel-adaptive monitor (e.g. part of the Intel Xeon X5650) and a traditional Hybrid page policy. We evaluate them across 70 memory intensive workload mixes consisting of single-thread and multi-thread applications. The experimental results show that using the HAPPY encoding applied to the Intel-adaptive page closure policy can reduce the hardware overhead by 5x for the evaluated 64 GB memory (up to 40\u00d7 for a 512 GB memory) while maintaining the prediction accuracy.","author":["Mohsen Ghasempour","Aamer Jaleel","Jim D.

Current compiler algorithms for tiling are limited to loops which are perfectly nested or can be transformed, in trivial ways, into a perfect nest. This paper presents a number of program transformations to enable tiling for a class of nontrivial imperfectly-nested loops such that cache locality is improved. We define a program model for such loops and develop compiler algorithms for their tiling. We propose to adopt odd-even variable duplication to break anti- and output dependences without unduly increasing the working-set size, and to adopt speculative execution to enable tiling of loops which may terminate prematurely due to, e.g. convergence tests in iterative algorithms. We have implemented these techniques in a research compiler, Panorama. Initial experiments with several benchmark programs are performed on SGI workstations based on MIPS R5K and R10K processors. Overall, the transformed programs run faster by 9% to 164%.","author":["Yonghong Song","Zhiyuan Li"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 34","Issue 5","May 1999","pp   215\u2013228","https://doi.org/10.1145/301631.301668"],"date":"01 May 1999","ref":[{"text":"J.

While many of these applications require a reasonably quick response and may operate on data that is constantly changing, existing methods often lack speed and adaptability to cope with these requirements. This is aggravated by the fact that knowledge graphs are often extremely large and may easily contain millions of entities rendering many of these methods impractical. In this paper, we address the weaknesses of current methods by proposing Random Semantic Tensor Ensemble (RSTE), a scalable ensemble-enabled framework based on tensor factorization. Our proposed approach samples a knowledge graph tensor in its graph representation and performs link prediction via ensembles of tensor factorization. Our experiments on both publicly available datasets and real world enterprise/sales knowledge bases have shown that our approach is not only highly scalable, parallelizable and memory efficient, but also able to increase the prediction accuracy significantly across all datasets.","author":["Yi Tay","Anh Tuan Luu","Siu Cheung Hui","Falk Brauer"],"issue":["WSDM '17: Proceedings of the Tenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2017","Pages   751\u2013760","https://doi.org/10.1145/3018661.3018695"],"date":"02 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

First, we exploit Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Overlap-and-Add (OaA) to reduce the computational requirements of the convolutional layer. We map the frequency domain algorithms onto a highly-parallel OaA-based 2D convolver design on the FPGA. Then, we propose a novel data layout in shared memory for efficient data communication between the CPU and the FPGA. To reduce the memory access latency and sustain peak performance of the FPGA, our design employs double buffering. To reduce the inter-layer data remapping latency, we exploit concurrent processing on the CPU and the FPGA. Our approach can be applied to any kernel size less than the chosen FFT size with appropriate zero-padding leading to acceleration of a wide range of CNN models. We exploit the data parallelism of OaA-based 2D convolver and task parallelism to scale the overall system performance. By using OaA, the number of floating point operations is reduced by 39.14% ~54.10% for the state-of-art CNNs. We implement VGG16, AlexNet and GoogLeNet on Intel QuickAssist QPI FPGA Platform. These designs sustain 123.48 GFLOPs/sec, 83.00 GFLOPs/sec and 96.60 GFLOPs/sec, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art AlexNet implementation, our design achieves 1.35x GFLOPs/sec improvement using 3.33x less multipliers and 1.1x less memory. Compared with the state-of-art VGG16 implementation, our design has 0.66x GFLOPs/sec using 3.48x less multipliers without impacting the classification accuracy. For GoogLeNet implementation, our design achieves 5.56x improvement in performance compared with 16 threads running on a 10 Core Intel Xeon Processor at 2.8 GHz.","author":["Chi Zhang","Viktor Prasanna"],"issue":["FPGA '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2017","Pages   35\u201344","https://doi.org/10.1145/3020078.3021727"],"date":"22 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"B.

However, it has been a challenge for FPGA-based solutions to achieve a higher throughput than GPU counterparts. In this paper, we demonstrate that FPGA acceleration can be a superior solution in terms of both throughput and energy efficiency when a CNN is trained with binary constraints on weights and activations. Specifically, we propose an optimized accelerator architecture tailored for bitwise convolution and normalization that features massive spatial parallelism with deep pipeline (temporal parallelism) stages. Experiment results show that the proposed architecture running at 90 MHz on a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA achieves a computing throughput of 7.663 TOPS with a power consumption of 8.2 W regardless of the batch size of input data. This is 8.3x faster and 75x more energy-efficient than a Titan X GPU for processing online individual requests (in small batch size). For processing static data (in large batch size), the proposed solution is on a par with a Titan X GPU in terms of throughput while delivering 9.5x higher energy efficiency.","author":["Yixing Li","Zichuan Liu","Kai Xu","Hao Yu","Fengbo Ren"],"issue":["FPGA '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2017","Pages   290\u2013291","https://doi.org/10.1145/3020078.3021786"],"date":"22 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"Zhang, C., Li, P., Sun, G., Guan, Y., Xiao, B., & Cong, J. 2015.

Hence, SCM has the potential to become a universal memory, blurring well-known storage hierarchies. However, along with opportunities, SCM brings many challenges. In this tutorial we will dissect SCM challenges and provide an in-depth view of existing programming models that circumvent them, as well as novel data structures that stem from these models. We will also elaborate on fail-safety testing challenges -- an often overlooked, yet important topic. Finally, we will discuss SCM emulation techniques for end-to-end testing of SCM-based software components. In contrast to surveys investigating the use of SCM in database systems, this tutorial is designed as a programming guide for researchers and professionals interested in leveraging SCM in database systems.","author":["Ismail Oukid","Wolfgang Lehner"],"issue":["SIGMOD '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data","May 2017","Pages   1759\u20131764","https://doi.org/10.1145/3035918.3054777"],"date":"09 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"3D XPoint Technology. https://www.micron.com/about/our-innovation/3d-xpoint-technology.","order":1},{"text":"Control NUMA policy for processes or shared memory. https://linux.die.net/man/8/numactl.","order":2},{"text":"Direct Access for files. https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/dax.txt.","order":3},{"text":"Ext4 file system. https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/ext4.txt.","order":4},{"text":"How to emulate persistent memory. http://pmem.io/2016/02/22/pm-emulation.html.","order":5},{"text":"Intel\u00ae Architecture Instruction Set Extensions Programming Reference. http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-isa-extensions.","order":6},{"text":"International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors 2.0, Beyond CMOS, 2015. http://www.semiconductors.org/clientuploads/Research_Technology/ITRS/2015/6_2015%20ITRS%202.0%20Beyond%20CMOS.pdf.","order":7},{"text":"NVML Library. http://pmem.io/nvml/.","order":8},{"text":"SNIA NVM Programming Model V1.1. http://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/NVMProgrammingModel_v1.1.pdf.","order":9},{"text":"SR.

The increasing data volumes impose significant challenges to traditional data analysis tools in storing, processing, and analyzing these extremely large-scale data. For decades, hashing has been one of the most effective tools commonly used to compress data for fast access and analysis, as well as information integrity verification. Hashing techniques have also evolved from simple randomization approaches to advanced adaptive methods considering locality, structure, label information, and data security, for effective hashing. This survey reviews and categorizes existing hashing techniques as a taxonomy, in order to provide a comprehensive view of mainstream hashing techniques for different types of data and applications. The taxonomy also studies the uniqueness of each method and therefore can serve as technique references in understanding the niche of different hashing mechanisms for future development.","author":["Lianhua Chi","Xingquan Zhu"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 50","Issue 1","April 2017","Article No.: 11","pp   1\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/3047307"],"date":"04 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"Austin Appleby. 2008.

Among the existing UWSN localization approaches, reverse localization scheme (RLS) is an event-driven method suitable for underwater surveillance. RLS adopts the strongest arrival or the first arrival as the direct path, which is however not accurate enough due to the severe multipath effect in underwater acoustic channels. We propose median RLS (MRLS) to select the median path and weighted RLS (WRLS) by assigning each path with a possibility to be the direct path for UWSNs. Numerical results have validated the proposed schemes and further suggested that WRLS outperforms MRLS and traditional approaches and is capable to diminish the multipath effect.","author":["Yuhan Dong","Rui Wang","Zheng Li","Chen Cheng","Kai Zhang"],"issue":["IPSN '17: Proceedings of the 16th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","April 2017","Pages   323\u2013324","https://doi.org/10.1145/3055031.3055070"],"date":"18 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"Ian F Akyildiz, Dario Pompili, and Tommaso Melodia. 2006.

In this paper, we explore a multi-layer extension to knowledge graphs, hierarchical knowledge graphs (HKGs), that combines hierarchical and network visualizations into a unified data representation. Through interaction logs, we show that HKGs preserve the benefits of single-layer knowledge graphs at conveying domain knowledge while incorporating the sense-making advantages of hierarchies for knowledge seeking tasks. Specially, this paper describes our algorithm to construct these visualizations, analyzes interaction logs to quantitatively demonstrate performance parity with networks and performance advantages over hierarchies, and synthesizes data from interaction logs, inter- views, and thinkalouds on a testbed data set to demonstrate the utility of the unified hierarchy+network structure in our HKGs.","author":["Bahareh Sarrafzadeh","Edward Lank"],"issue":["SIGIR '17: Proceedings of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2017","Pages   145\u2013154","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080829"],"date":"07 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Franck Amadieu, Andr\u00e9 Tricot, and Claudette Marin\u00e9. 2010.

Volatile DRAM cells can retain information across a wide distribution of times ranging from milliseconds to many minutes, but each cell is currently refreshed every 64ms to account for the extreme tail end of the retention time distribution, leading to a high refresh overhead. Due to poor DRAM technology scaling, this problem is expected to get worse in future device generations. Hence, the current approach of refreshing all cells with the worst-case refresh rate must be replaced with a more intelligent design. Many prior works propose reducing the refresh overhead by extending the default refresh interval to a higher value, which we refer to as the target refresh interval, across parts or all of a DRAM chip. These proposals handle the small set of failing cells that cannot retain data throughout the entire extended refresh interval via retention failure mitigation mechanisms (e.g., error correcting codes or bit-repair mechanisms). This set of failing cells is discovered via retention failure profiling, which is currently a brute-force process that writes a set of known data to DRAM, disables refresh and waits for the duration of the target refresh interval, and then checks for retention failures across the DRAM chip. We show that this brute-force approach is too slow and is detrimental to system execution, especially with frequent online profiling. This paper presents reach profiling, a new methodology for retention failure profiling based on the key observation that an overwhelming majority of failing DRAM cells at a target refresh interval fail more reliably at both longer refresh intervals and higher temperatures. Using 368 state-of-the-art LPDDR4 DRAM chips from three major vendors, we conduct a thorough experimental characterization of the complex set of tradeoffs inherent in the profiling process. We identify three key metrics to guide design choices for retention failure profiling and mitigation mechanisms: coverage, false positive rate, and runtime. We propose reach profiling, a new retention failure profiling mechanism whose key idea is to profile failing cells at a longer refresh interval and/or higher temperature relative to the target conditions in order to maximize failure coverage while minimizing the false positive rate and profiling runtime. We thoroughly explore the tradeoffs associated with reach profiling and show that there is significant room for improvement in DRAM retention failure profiling beyond the brute-force approach. We show with experimental data that on average, by profiling at 250ms above the target refresh interval, our first implementation of reach profiling (called REAPER) can attain greater than 99% coverage of failing DRAM cells with less than a 50% false positive rate while running 2.5x faster than the brute-force approach. In addition, our end-to-end evaluations show that REAPER enables significant system performance improvement and DRAM power reduction, outperforming the brute-force approach and enabling high-performance operation at longer refresh intervals that were previously unreasonable to employ due to the high associated profiling overhead.","author":["Minesh Patel","Jeremie S.

Fine-grain fabrics (e.g. FPGAs) have traditionally suffered from performance and power inefficiencies due to bit-level reconfigurable abstractions. Both fine-grain and coarse-grain architectures (e.g. CGRAs) traditionally require low level programming and suffer from long compilation times. We address both challenges with Plasticine, a new spatially reconfigurable architecture designed to efficiently execute applications composed of parallel patterns. Parallel patterns have emerged from recent research on parallel programming as powerful, high-level abstractions that can elegantly capture data locality, memory access patterns, and parallelism across a wide range of dense and sparse applications. We motivate Plasticine by first observing key application characteristics captured by parallel patterns that are amenable to hardware acceleration, such as hierarchical parallelism, data locality, memory access patterns, and control flow. Based on these observations, we architect Plasticine as a collection of Pattern Compute Units and Pattern Memory Units. Pattern Compute Units are multi-stage pipelines of reconfigurable SIMD functional units that can efficiently execute nested patterns. Data locality is exploited in Pattern Memory Units using banked scratchpad memories and configurable address decoders. Multiple on-chip address generators and scatter-gather engines make efficient use of DRAM bandwidth by supporting a large number of outstanding memory requests, memory coalescing, and burst mode for dense accesses. Plasticine has an area footprint of 113 mm2 in a 28nm process, and consumes a maximum power of 49 W at a 1 GHz clock. Using a cycle-accurate simulator, we demonstrate that Plasticine provides an improvement of up to 76.9x in performance-per-Watt over a conventional FPGA over a wide range of dense and sparse applications.","author":["Raghu Prabhakar","Yaqi Zhang","David Koeplinger","Matt Feldman","Tian Zhao","Stefan Hadjis","Ardavan Pedram","Christos Kozyrakis","Kunle Olukotun"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   389\u2013402","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080256"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Joshua Auerbach, David F.

In this paper, by employing the merits of deep metric learning, we propose a novel metric-based generative adversarial network (MBGAN), which uses the distance-criteria to distinguish between real and fake samples. Specifically, the discriminator of MBGAN adopts a triplet structure and learns a deep nonlinear transformation, which maps input samples into a new feature space. In the transformed space, the distance between real samples is minimized, while the distance between real sample and fake sample is maximized. Similar to the adversarial procedure of existing GANs, a generator is trained to produce synthesized examples, which are close to real examples, while a discriminator is trained to maximize the distance between real and fake samples to a large margin. Meanwhile, instead of using a fixed margin, we adopt a data-dependent margin [30], so that the generator could focus on improving the synthesized samples with poor quality, instead of wasting energy on well-produce samples. Our proposed method is verified on various benchmarks, such as CIFAR-10, SVHN and CelebA, and generates high-quality samples.","author":["Guoxian Dai","Jin Xie","Yi Fang"],"issue":["MM '17: Proceedings of the 25th ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2017","Pages   672\u2013680","https://doi.org/10.1145/3123266.3123334"],"date":"19 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Martin Arjovsky, Soumith Chintala, and L\u00e9on Bottou. 2017.

However, because the design of mobile flash storage is highly cost-sensitive, hardware compression becomes a less attractive option. This study investigates the feasibility of data compression on mobile flash storage. It first characterizes data compressibility based on mobile apps, and the analysis shows that write traffic bound for mobile storage volumes is highly compressible. Based on this finding, a lightweight approach is introduced for firmware-based data compression in mobile flash storage. The controller and flash module work in a pipelined fashion to hide the data compression overhead. Together with this pipelined design, the proposed approach selectively compresses incoming data of high compressibility, while leaving data of low compressibility to a compression-aware garbage collector. Experimental results show that our approach greatly reduced the frequency of block erase by 50.5% compared to uncompressed flash storage. Compared to unconditional data compression, our approach improved the write latency by 10.4% at a marginal cost of 4% more block erase operations.","author":["Cheng Ji","Li-Pin Chang","Liang Shi","Congming Gao","Chao Wu","Yuangang Wang","Chun Jason Xue"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 16","Issue 5s","October 2017","Article No.: 183","pp   1\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/3126511"],"date":"27 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"2017.

Yet, various attacks that use a working chip as an oracle have been launched on logic locking to successfully retrieve its secret key, undermining the defense of all existing locking techniques. In this paper, we propose stripped-functionality logic locking (SFLL), which strips some of the functionality of the design and hides it in the form of a secret key(s), thereby rendering on-chip implementation functionally different from the original one. When loaded onto an on-chip memory, the secret keys restore the original functionality of the design. Through security-aware synthesis that creates a controllable mismatch between the reverse-engineered netlist and original design, SFLL provides a quantifiable and provable resilience trade-off between all known and anticipated attacks. We demonstrate the application of SFLL to large designs (>100K gates) using a computer-aided design (CAD) framework that ensures attaining the desired security level at minimal implementation cost, 8%, 5%, and 0.5% for area, power, and delay, respectively. In addition to theoretical proofs and simulation confirmation of SFLL's security, we also report results from the silicon implementation of SFLL on an ARM Cortex-M0 microprocessor in 65nm technology.","author":["Muhammad Yasin","Abhrajit Sengupta","Mohammed Thari Nabeel","Mohammed Ashraf","Jeyavijayan (JV) Rajendran","Ozgur Sinanoglu"],"issue":["CCS '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2017","Pages   1601\u20131618","https://doi.org/10.1145/3133956.3133985"],"date":"30 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Y.

Predicting the sign of sentiment links is a fundamental task in many areas such as personal advertising and public opinion analysis. Previous works mainly focus on textual sentiment classification, however, text information can only disclose the \"tip of the iceberg\u00bb\u00bb about users\u00bb true opinions, of which the most are unobserved but implied by other sources of information such as social relation and users\u00bb profile. To address this problem, in this paper we investigate how to predict possibly existing sentiment links in the presence of heterogeneous information. First, due to the lack of explicit sentiment links in mainstream social networks, we establish a labeled heterogeneous sentiment dataset which consists of users\u00bb sentiment relation, social relation and profile knowledge by entity-level sentiment extraction method. Then we propose a novel and flexible end-to-end Signed Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding (SHINE) framework to extract users\u00bb latent representations from heterogeneous networks and predict the sign of unobserved sentiment links. SHINE utilizes multiple deep autoencoders to map each user into a low-dimension feature space while preserving the network structure. We demonstrate the superiority of SHINE over state-of-the-art baselines on link prediction and node recommendation in two real-world datasets. The experimental results also prove the efficacy of SHINE in cold start scenario.","author":["Hongwei Wang","Fuzheng Zhang","Min Hou","Xing Xie","Minyi Guo","Qi Liu"],"issue":["WSDM '18: Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2018","Pages   592\u2013600","https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159666"],"date":"02 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mikhail Belkin and Partha Niyogi . 2001.

Most of these studies only cover general usage levels of natural languages ignoring processing-type sentences such as arithmetic sentences, sorting, and grouping. This research presents a Natural Language Semantic Model for Arithmetic Sentences (NLSMAS) which can define a meaning and calculate the result for arithmetic sentences, one of the most widely used processing-type sentences. Data for this research were10,000 arithmetic sentences, which were divided into four categories based on calculation difficulty. These sentences were analyzed focusing on sentence structures and semantic rules to create a Semantic GrammarGraph (SGG), the main part of NLSMAS. Finally, 12,000 arithmetic sentences from 300 samples were used as input for the evaluation of NLSMAS's performance. The result showed that NLSMAS can definearithmetic meanings and produce results with very high accuracy at 98.68 percent. The incorrect results were caused by typing error, grammatical error, and ambiguous sentences.","author":["Chalermpol Tapsai","Phayung Meesad","Choochart Haruechaiyasak"],"issue":["ICCIP '17: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Communication and Information Processing","November 2017","Pages   175\u2013179","https://doi.org/10.1145/3162957.3162976"],"date":"24 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"Foong, O.

It offers the potential of significant computational speed-ups in quantum chemistry, materials science, cryptography, and machine learning. The dominant approach to programming quantum computers is to provide an existing high-level language with libraries that allow for the expression of quantum programs. This approach can permit computations that are meaningless in a quantum context; prohibits succint expression of interaction between classical and quantum logic; and does not provide important constructs that are required for quantum programming. We present Q#, a quantum-focused domain-specific language explicitly designed to correctly, clearly and completely express quantum algorithms. Q# provides a type system; a tightly constrained environment to safely interleave classical and quantum computations; specialized syntax; symbolic code manipulation to automatically generate correct transformations of quantum operations; and powerful functional constructs which aid composition.","author":["Krysta Svore","Alan Geller","Matthias Troyer","John Azariah","Christopher Granade","Bettina Heim","Vadym Kliuchnikov","Mariia Mykhailova","Andres Paz","Martin Roetteler"],"issue":["RWDSL2018: Proceedings of the Real World Domain Specific Languages Workshop 2018","February 2018","Article No.: 7","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3183895.3183901"],"date":"24 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Dominic W.

However, embedded control flow deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, Caffe2, and MXNet fail to efficiently represent and execute such neural networks, due to lack of support for recursion. In this paper, we add recursion to the programming model of existing frameworks by complementing their design with recursive execution of dataflow graphs as well as additional APIs for recursive definitions. Unlike iterative implementations, which can only understand the topological index of each node in recursive data structures, our recursive implementation is able to exploit the recursive relationships between nodes for efficient execution based on parallel computation. We present an implementation on TensorFlow and evaluation results with various recursive neural network models, showing that our recursive implementation not only conveys the recursive nature of recursive neural networks better than other implementations, but also uses given resources more effectively to reduce training and inference time.","author":["Eunji Jeong","Joo Seong Jeong","Soojeong Kim","Gyeong-In Yu","Byung-Gon Chun"],"issue":["EuroSys '18: Proceedings of the Thirteenth EuroSys Conference","April 2018","Article No.: 19","Pages   1\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/3190508.3190530"],"date":"23 April 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi et al. 2016.

The proposed accelerator can simultaneously process data from different applications with diverse types of operational functions, and it allows multiple kernels to directly access flash without the assistance of a host-level file system or an I/O runtime library. We prototype FlashAbacus on a multicore-based PCIe platform that connects to FPGA-based flash controllers with a 20 nm node process.

Large SC-based systems like neural networks (NNs) or vision systems usually resort to BC, either explicitly or implicitly, for tasks requiring higher accuracy, such as data storage, control functions, or complex arithmetic operations. The resulting hybrid SC-BC features often incorporate unsatisfactory tradeoffs between system latency and accuracy. For example, they may require many costly SC-BC data format converters, which interrupt bit-stream flow and cause significant delay overhead. While improving accuracy has been a major research goal in SC, less attention has been paid to reducing latency. We present a novel design methodology called Maxflow that minimizes the latency of SC operations without reducing accuracy or interrupting data flow more than necessary. Maxflow supports delay-accuracy tradeoffs with little hardware modification. Its effectiveness is demonstrated for a deep NN, where it reduces overall latency substantially with no loss of accuracy compared to previous designs.","author":["Paishun Ting","John P.

This paper introduces Random Multimodel Deep Learning (RMDL): a new ensemble, deep learning approach for classification. Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results across many domains. RMDL solves the problem of finding the best deep learning structure and architecture while simultaneously improving robustness and accuracy through ensembles of deep learning architectures. RDML can accept as input a variety data to include text, video, images, and symbolic. This paper describes RMDL and shows test results for image and text data including MNIST, CIFAR-10, WOS, Reuters, IMDB, and 20newsgroup. These test results show that RDML produces consistently better performance than standard methods over a broad range of data types and classification problems.","author":["Kamran Kowsari","Mojtaba Heidarysafa","Donald E.

Computing in memory (CiM), where logic and arithmetic operations are performed in memory, could significantly reduce both energy consumption and computational overheads associated with data transfer. Compact, low-power, and fast CiM designs could ultimately lead to improved application-level performance. This paper introduces a CiM architecture based on ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs). The CiM design can serve as a general purpose, random access memory (RAM), and can also perform Boolean operations ((N)AND, (N)OR, X(N)OR, INV) as well as addition (ADD) between words in memory. Unlike existing CiM designs based on other emerging technologies, FeFET-CiM accomplishes the aforementioned operations via a single current reference in the sense amplifier, which leads to more compact designs and lower power. Furthermore, the high Ion/Ioff ratio of FeFETs enables an inexpensive voltage-based sense scheme. Simulation-based case studies suggest that our FeFET-CiM can achieve speed-ups (and energy reduction) of ~119X (~1.6X) and ~1.97X (~1.5X) over ReRAM and STT-RAM CiM designs with respect to in-memory addition of 32-bit words. Furthermore, our approach offers an average speedup of ~2.5X and energy reduction of ~1.7X when compared to a conventional (not in-memory) approach across a wide range of benchmarks.","author":["Dayane Reis","Michael Niemier","X.

There is a growing need to understand and analyze DRAM power consumption, which can be used to research new DRAM architectures and systems that consume less power. A major obstacle against such research is the lack of detailed and accurate information on the power consumption behavior of modern DRAM devices. Researchers have long relied on DRAM power models that are predominantly based off of a set of standardized current measurements provided by DRAM vendors, called IDD values. Unfortunately, we find that state-of-the-art DRAM power models are often highly inaccurate when compared with the real power consumed by DRAM. This is because existing DRAM power models (1) are based off of the worst-case power consumption of devices, as vendor specifications list the current consumed by the most power-hungry device sold; (2) do not capture variations in DRAM power consumption due to different data value patterns; and (3) do not account for any variation across different devices or within a device.","author":["Saugata Ghose","Abdullah Giray Yaglik\u00e7i","Raghav Gupta","Donghyuk Lee","Kais Kudrolli","William X.

Recent advances in recurrent neural networks have led to promising approaches to solving this problem, with long short-term memory model proving effective in capturing users' general interests from previous clicks. However, none of the existing approaches explicitly take the effects of users' current actions on their next moves into account. In this study, we argue that a long-term memory model may be insufficient for modeling long sessions that usually contain user interests drift caused by unintended clicks. A novel short-term attention/memory priority model is proposed as a remedy, which is capable of capturing users' general interests from the long-term memory of a session context, whilst taking into account users' current interests from the short-term memory of the last-clicks. The validity and efficacy of the proposed attention mechanism is extensively evaluated on three benchmark data sets from the RecSys Challenge 2015 and CIKM Cup 2016. The numerical results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in all the tests.","author":["Qiao Liu","Yifu Zeng","Refuoe Mokhosi","Haibin Zhang"],"issue":["KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2018","Pages   1831\u20131839","https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3219950"],"date":"19 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2015.

However, it still faces with computational challenges in problems such as link prediction and node recommendation, particularly with increasing scale of networks. Hashing is a promising approach for accelerating these problems by orders of magnitude. However, no prior studies have been focused on seeking binary codes for information networks to preserve high-order proximity. Since matrix factorization (MF) unifies and outperforms several well-known embedding methods with high-order proximity preserved, we propose a MF-based \\underlineI nformation \\underlineN etwork \\underlineH ashing (INH-MF) algorithm, to learn binary codes which can preserve high-order proximity. We also suggest Hamming subspace learning, which only updates partial binary codes each time, to scale up INH-MF. We finally evaluate INH-MF on four real-world information network datasets with respect to the tasks of node classification and node recommendation. The results demonstrate that INH-MF can perform significantly better than competing learning to hash baselines in both tasks, and surprisingly outperforms network embedding methods, including DeepWalk, LINE and NetMF, in the task of node recommendation.

For example, B4, Google's private software-defined WAN, is larger and growing faster than our connectivity to the public Internet. In this paper, we present the five-year evolution of B4. We describe the techniques we employed to incrementally move from offering best-effort content-copy services to carrier-grade availability, while concurrently scaling B4 to accommodate 100x more traffic. Our key challenge is balancing the tension introduced by hierarchy required for scalability, the partitioning required for availability, and the capacity asymmetry inherent to the construction and operation of any large-scale network. We discuss our approach to managing this tension: i) we design a custom hierarchical network topology for both horizontal and vertical software scaling, ii) we manage inherent capacity asymmetry in hierarchical topologies using a novel traffic engineering algorithm without packet encapsulation, and iii) we re-architect switch forwarding rules via two-stage matching/hashing to deal with asymmetric network failures at scale.","author":["Chi-Yao Hong","Subhasree Mandal","Mohammad Al-Fares","Min Zhu","Richard Alimi","Kondapa Naidu B.","Chandan Bhagat","Sourabh Jain","Jay Kaimal","Shiyu Liang","Kirill Mendelev","Steve Padgett","Faro Rabe","Saikat Ray","Malveeka Tewari","Matt Tierney","Monika Zahn","Jonathan Zolla","Joon Ong","Amin Vahdat"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '18: Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication","August 2018","Pages   74\u201387","https://doi.org/10.1145/3230543.3230545"],"date":"07 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"2017.

A key step in software refactoring is to identify which part of the software should be refactored. To facilitate the identification, a number of approaches have been proposed to identify certain structures in the code (called code smells) that suggest the possibility of refactoring. Most of such approaches rely on manually designed heuristics to map manually selected source code metrics to predictions. However, it is challenging to manually select the best features, especially textual features. It is also difficult to manually construct the optimal heuristics. To this end, in this paper we propose a deep learning based novel approach to detecting feature envy, one of the most common code smells. The key insight is that deep neural networks and advanced deep learning techniques could automatically select features (especially textual features) of source code for feature envy detection, and could automatically build the complex mapping between such features and predictions. We also propose an automatic approach to generating labeled training data for the neural network based classifier, which does not require any human intervention. Evaluation results on open-source applications suggest that the proposed approach significantly improves the state-of-the-art in both detecting feature envy smells and recommending destinations for identified smelly methods.","author":["Hui Liu","Zhifeng Xu","Yanzhen Zou"],"issue":["ASE 2018: Proceedings of the 33rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automated Software Engineering","September 2018","Pages   385\u2013396","https://doi.org/10.1145/3238147.3238166"],"date":"03 September 2018","ref":[{"text":"2018.

Despite the need for a developer who is performing a task to understand the context in which that task is undertaken, the tools we imagine, build and provide to support software developers are typically isolated. Instead of the tools helping a developer work within the appropriate context, it is the developer who must bring the context to the tools. In this talk, I will argue that the lack of context in the software engineering tools we build limits the effectiveness of developers and of our software development practices.","author":["Gail C.

Transceivers mutually train their beams to provide strong gains in the desired direction. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art beam-training protocols, such as the IEEE 802.11ad sector sweep, do not protect against malicious behavior. As revealed recently, attackers can inject forged feedback into the sector sweep to cause devices to steer their beams to other than the indented directions. To protect against this kind of beam-stealing, we propose a sector sweep with authentication (SSA) that extends the prevalent sector sweep with an authentication scheme. Doing so, we ensure that devices only accept the feedback from their intended peers. A combination of simulations in ns-3 and measurements on off-the-shelf devices reveals that the performance overhead of SSA is only 7.3% in comparison to the original sector sweep.","author":["Daniel Steinmetzer","Saad Ahmad","Nikolaos Anagnostopoulos","Matthias Hollick","Stefan Katzenbeisser"],"issue":["mmNets '18: Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Workshop on Millimeter Wave Networks and Sensing Systems","October 2018","Pages   3\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3264492.3264494"],"date":"01 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Hany Assasa and Joerg Widmer. 2016.

First, we obtained the FFT spectrogram from 60-second acceleration and gyro sensor data for each of six axes. A five-second sliding window was used for FFT processing. About 70% of the spectrogram figures from the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation dataset were used for training data. Our model was based on CNN using FFT spectrogram images. After training for 50 epochs, F-measure was about 90% for acceleration data and 85% for gyro data. Next, considering the results of each sensor axis, to improve the recognition rate, we combined the information of multiple sensors. Specifically, we synthesized new images by combining the FFT spectrogram figures of two axes and the best combination condition was examined by correlation analysis. The highest score, 93% recognition, came from the vertically arranged images derived from the norm of acceleration and the y-axis gyro.","author":["Chihiro Ito","Xin Cao","Masaki Shuzo","Eisaku Maeda"],"issue":["UbiComp '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM International Joint Conference and 2018 International Symposium on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and Wearable Computers","October 2018","Pages   1503\u20131510","https://doi.org/10.1145/3267305.3267517"],"date":"08 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"H.

However, they are usually incomplete, which affects the performance of such KG based applications. To alleviate this problem, a number of Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods have been developed to predict those implicit triples. Tensor/matrix based methods and translation based methods have attracted great attention for a long time. Recently, neural network has been introduced into KGC due to its extensive superiority in many fields (e.g., natural language processing and computer vision), and achieves promising results. In this paper, we propose a Shared Embedding based Neural Network (SENN) model for KGC. It integrates the prediction tasks of head entities, relations and tail entities into a neural network based framework with shared embeddings of entities and relations, while explicitly considering the differences among these prediction tasks. Moreover, we propose an adaptively weighted loss mechanism, which dynamically adjusts the weights of losses according to the mapping properties of relations, and the prediction tasks. Since relation prediction usually performs better than head and tail entity predictions, we further extend SENN to SENN+ by employing it to assist head and tail entity predictions. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed SENN and SENN+ methods. The shared embeddings and the adaptively weighted loss mechanism are also testified to be effective.","author":["Saiping Guan","Xiaolong Jin","Yuanzhuo Wang","Xueqi Cheng"],"issue":["CIKM '18: Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2018","Pages   247\u2013256","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271704"],"date":"17 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Peter Battaglia, Razvan Pascanu, Matthew Lai, Danilo Jimenez Rezende, and koray kavukcuoglu. 2016.

To efficiently learn node embeddings from a graph, graph embedding techniques usually preserve the proximity between node pairs sampled from the graph using random walks. In the context of a heterogeneous graph, which contains nodes from different domains, classical random walks are biased towards highly visible domains where nodes are associated with a dominant number of paths. To overcome this bias, existing heterogeneous graph embedding techniques typically rely on meta-paths (i.e., fixed sequences of node types) to guide random walks. However, using these meta-paths either requires prior knowledge from domain experts for optimal meta-path selection, or requires extended computations to combine all meta-paths shorter than a predefined length. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution that does not involve any meta-path. Specifically, we propose JUST, a heterogeneous graph embedding technique using random walks with JUmp and STay strategies to overcome the aforementioned bias in an more efficient manner. JUST can not only gracefully balance between homogeneous and heterogeneous edges, it can also balance the node distribution over different domains (i.e., node types). By conducting a thorough empirical evaluation of our method on three heterogeneous graph datasets, we show the superiority of our proposed technique. In particular, compared to a state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph embedding technique Hin2vec, which tries to optimally combine all meta-paths shorter than a predefined length, our technique yields better results in most experiments, with a dramatically reduced embedding learning time (about 3x speedup).","author":["Rana Hussein","Dingqi Yang","Philippe Cudr\u00e9-Mauroux"],"issue":["CIKM '18: Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2018","Pages   437\u2013446","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271777"],"date":"17 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"David Arthur and Sergei Vassilvitskii. 2007. k-means","order":1},{"text":": The advantages of careful seeding.

While this type of system is easy to implement it does not make use of semantics but relies on direct word matches between a query and reviews leading to a loss in both precision and recall. To study the challenging task of semantically enriching POIs from unstructured data in order to support open-domain search and question answering (QA), we introduce a new dataset POIReviewQA1. It consists of 20k questions (e.g. \"is this restaurant dog friendly?\") for 1022 Yelp business types. For each question we sampled 10 reviews, and annotated each sentence in the reviews whether it answers the question and what the corresponding answer is. To test a system's ability to understand the text we adopt an information retrieval evaluation by ranking all the review sentences for a question based on the likelihood that they answer this question. We build a Lucene-based baseline model, which achieves 77.0% AUC and 48.8% MAP. A sentence embedding-based model achieves 79.2% AUC and 41.8% MAP, indicating that the dataset presents a challenging problem for future research by the GIR community. The result technology can help exploit the thematic content of web documents and social media for characterisation of locations.","author":["Gengchen Mai","Krzysztof Janowicz","Cheng He","Sumang Liu","Ni Lao"],"issue":["GIR'18: Proceedings of the 12th Workshop on Geographic Information Retrieval","November 2018","Article No.: 5","Pages   1\u20132","https://doi.org/10.1145/3281354.3281359"],"date":"06 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"Sanjeev Arora, Yingyu Liang, and Tengyu Ma. 2017.

The utility of recommender systems cannot be overstated, given their widespread adoption in many web applications, along with their potential impact to ameliorate many problems related to over-choice. In recent years, deep learning has garnered considerable interest in many research fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, owing not only to stellar performance but also to the attractive property of learning feature representations from scratch. The influence of deep learning is also pervasive, recently demonstrating its effectiveness when applied to information retrieval and recommender systems research. The field of deep learning in recommender system is flourishing. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on deep learning-based recommender systems. More concretely, we provide and devise a taxonomy of deep learning-based recommendation models, along with a comprehensive summary of the state of the art. Finally, we expand on current trends and provide new perspectives pertaining to this new and exciting development of the field.","author":["Shuai Zhang","Lina Yao","Aixin Sun","Yi Tay"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 52","Issue 1","February 2019","Article No.: 5","pp   1\u201338","https://doi.org/10.1145/3285029"],"date":"25 February 2019","ref":[{"text":"Gediminas Adomavicius and Alexander Tuzhilin. 2005.

However, the applicability of RCS is limited by reliability problems that arise from the immature fabrication process. In order to take advantage of RCS in practical applications, fault-tolerant design is a key challenge. We present a survey of fault-tolerant designs for RRAM-based neuromorphic computing systems. We first describe RRAM-based crossbars and training architectures in RCS. Following this, we classify fault models into different categories, and review post-fabrication testing methods. Subsequently, online testing methods are presented. Finally, we present various fault-tolerant techniques that were designed to tolerate different types of RRAM faults. The methods reviewed in this survey represent recent trends in fault-tolerant designs of RCS, and are expected motivate further research in this field.","author":["Mengyun Liu","Lixue Xia","Yu Wang","Krishnendu Chakrabarty"],"issue":["ASPDAC '19: Proceedings of the 24th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2019","Pages   216\u2013223","https://doi.org/10.1145/3287624.3288743"],"date":"21 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Ching-Yi Chen et al.

However, although these heterogeneous computing platforms are becoming widely available, they are very difficult to program especially with FPGAs. As a result, the use of such platforms has been limited to a small subset of programmers with specialized hardware knowledge. To tackle this challenge, we introduce HeteroCL, a programming infrastructure composed of a Python-based domain-specific language (DSL) and an FPGA-targeted compilation flow. The HeteroCL DSL provides a clean programming abstraction that decouples algorithm specification from three important types of hardware customization in compute, data types, and memory architectures. HeteroCL further captures the interdependence among these different customization techniques, allowing programmers to explore various performance/area/accuracy trade-offs in a systematic and productive manner. In addition, our framework produces highly efficient hardware implementations for a variety of popular workloads by targeting spatial architecture templates such as systolic arrays and stencil with dataflow architectures. Experimental results show that HeteroCL allows programmers to explore the design space efficiently in both performance and accuracy by combining different types of hardware customization and targeting spatial architectures, while keeping the algorithm code intact.","author":["Yi-Hsiang Lai","Yuze Chi","Yuwei Hu","Jie Wang","Cody Hao Yu","Yuan Zhou","Jason Cong","Zhiru Zhang"],"issue":["FPGA '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2019","Pages   242\u2013251","https://doi.org/10.1145/3289602.3293910"],"date":"20 February 2019","ref":[{"text":"M.

Due to the huge model search space, it is impossible to try all models. Users tend to distrust automatic results and increase the search budget as much as they can, thereby undermining the efficiency of AutoML. To address these issues, we design and implement ATMSeer, an interactive visualization tool that supports users in refining the search space of AutoML and in analyzing the results. To guide the design of ATMSeer, we derive a workflow of using AutoML based on interviews with machine learning experts. A multi-granularity visualization is proposed to enable users to monitor the AutoML process, analyze the searched models, and refine the search space in real time. We demonstrate the utility and usability of ATMSeer through two case studies, expert interviews, and a user study with 13 end users.","author":["Qianwen Wang","Yao Ming","Zhihua Jin","Qiaomu Shen","Dongyu Liu","Micah J.

This paper proposes a general methodology to address the challenges. We decouple the NN applications from the target hardware by introducing a compiler that can transform an existing trained, unrestricted NN into an equivalent network that meets the given hardware's constraints. We propose multiple techniques to make the transformation adaptable to different kinds of NN chips, and reliable for restrict hardware constraints. We have built such a software tool that supports both spiking neural networks (SNNs) and traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). We have demonstrated its effectiveness with a fabricated neuromorphic chip and a processing-in-memory (PIM) design. Tests show that the inference error caused by this solution is insignificant and the transformation time is much shorter than the retraining time. Also, we have studied the parameter-sensitivity evaluations to explore the tradeoffs between network error and resource utilization for different transformation strategies, which could provide insights for co-design optimization of neuromorphic hardware and software.","author":["Yu Ji","Youhui Zhang","Wenguang Chen","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 53","Issue 2","February 2018","pp   448\u2013460","https://doi.org/10.1145/3296957.3173205"],"date":"19 March 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mart'\u0131n Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen, Craig Citro, Gregory S.

Nonvolatile logic based on resistive random-access memory (RRAM) is a promising route to implement such architecture. This paper presents the circuits and computing methodology to implement functionally complete Boolean logic and arithmetic block co-design using the CMOS-compatible 2-transistor-2-RRAM (2T2R) structure with reversely connected bipolar RRAM pairs. Arbitrary logic functions for two and multiple operands could be implemented in one-step operation, after which the computation results are in situ stored as the nonvolatile resistive states of the RRAM. In this design, the logic functionality is achieved by simply applying external operational voltages and/or corresponding RRAM initial states to the proposed 2T2R units. Compared with the traditional CMOS designs where the circuit topologies change with logic functions, the proposed 2T2R chain has a universal design with repeated unit blocks, independent of the logic functions. The highly regular and symmetric circuit structure makes it easy for design, integration, and fabrication. The proposed computing scheme/structure is intrinsic, clean, and efficient for IMC applications and presents superior performance in speed and area. The result of the study could build a technology cell library that can be potentially used as input to a technology-mapping algorithm for processing in-memory applications.","author":["Zongxian Yang","Yixiao Ma","Lan Wei"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '19: Proceedings of the 2019 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2019","Pages   147\u2013152","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299874.3317993"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Loke, A.

DNN accelerators are not designed with security in mind, but for higher performance and lower energy consumption. Hence, they are suffering from the security risk of being attacked. The insecure design flaws of existing DNN accelerators can be exploited to recover the structure of DNN model from the plain instructions, thus the runtime environment can be controlled to obtain the weights of DNN model. Furthermore, the structure of DNN model running on the accelerator is acquired by the side channel information and interrupt status register. To protect general DNN accelerator from being attacked by model inversion attack, this paper proposes a secure and general architecture called NPUFort, which guarantees the confidentiality of the parameters of DNN model and mitigates side-channel information leakage. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the secure architecture of DNN accelerators with negligible performance overhead.","author":["Xingbin Wang","Rui Hou","Yifan Zhu","Jun Zhang","Dan Meng"],"issue":["CF '19: Proceedings of the 16th ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers","April 2019","Pages   190\u2013196","https://doi.org/10.1145/3310273.3323070"],"date":"30 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"V Aklaghi, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Kambiz Samadi, H Esmaeilzadeh, and RK Gupta. 2018.

Such a representation relies on the tripartite graph which connects users, items and entities gathered from DBpedia, thus it encodes both collaborative and content-based information. These embeddings are then used to feed with positive and negative examples (the items the user liked and those she did not like) a classification model, which is finally exploited to classify new items as interesting or not interesting for the target user. In the experimental evaluation we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on varying of different graph embedding techniques and on several topologies of the graph. Results show that the embeddings learnt by combining collaborative data points with the information gathered from DBpedia led to the best results and also beat several state-of-the-art techniques.","author":["Cataldo Musto","Pierpaolo Basile","Giovanni Semeraro"],"issue":["UMAP'19 Adjunct: Adjunct Publication of the 27th Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization","June 2019","Pages   27\u201331","https://doi.org/10.1145/3314183.3324976"],"date":"06 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"S\u00f6ren Auer, Christian Bizer, Georgi Kobilarov, Jens Lehmann, Richard Cyganiak, and Zachary Ives. 2007.

One way is to use techniques from film animation to instruct the robot to move. This article is a systematic literature review of human-robot trials, pilots, and evaluations that have applied techniques from animation to move a robot. Through 27 articles, we find that animation techniques improves an individual\u2019s interaction with robots, improving the individual\u2019s perception of qualities of a robot, understanding what a robot intends to do, and showing the robot\u2019s state or possible emotion. Animation techniques also help people relate to robots that do not resemble a human or robot. The studies in the articles show further areas for research, such as applying animation principles in other types of robots and situations, combining animation techniques with other modalities, and testing robots moving with animation techniques over the long term.","author":["Trenton Schulz","Jim Torresen","Jo Herstad"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Human-Robot Interaction","Volume 8","Issue 2","June 2019","Article No.: 12","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/3317325"],"date":"03 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"Thibault Asselborn, Wafa Johal, and Pierre Dillenbourg. 2017.

Behavioral complexity of real systems makes abstraction crucial when producing a tractable model, and we illustrate how abstraction introduces nondeterminisim into system representations.An operational semantics, acceptance semantics, is introduced, and it is in terms of this active experimentation that meaning is given to the CIRCAL syntax, thus allowing proof of system properties to be constructed.","author":["George J.

However, network state and traffic typically exhibit unpredictable variations due to stochastically arriving requests with different quality of service (QoS) requirements. Thus, an adaptive online SFC deployment approach is needed to handle the real-time network variations and various service requests. In this paper, we firstly introduce a Markov decision process (MDP) model to capture the dynamic network state transitions. In order to jointly minimize the operation cost of NFV providers and maximize the total throughput of requests, we propose NFVdeep, an adaptive, online, deep reinforcement learning approach to automatically deploy SFCs for requests with different QoS requirements. Specifically, we use a serialization-and-backtracking method to effectively deal with large discrete action space. We also adopt a policy gradient based method to improve the training efficiency and convergence to optimality. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that NFVdeep converges fast in the training process and responds rapidly to arriving requests especially in large, frequently transferred network state space. Consequently, NFVdeep surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by 32.59% higher accepted throughput and 33.29% lower operation cost on average.","author":["Yikai Xiao","Qixia Zhang","Fangming Liu","Jia Wang","Miao Zhao","Zhongxing Zhang","Jiaxing Zhang"],"issue":["IWQoS '19: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Quality of Service","June 2019","Article No.: 21","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3326285.3329056"],"date":"24 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"Bernardetta Addis, DallalBelabed, Mathieu Bouet, and Stefano Secci. 2015.

They are derived from the polynomials that are relatively perpendicular to each other. Orthogonal moments are more efficient than non-orthogonal moments for image representation with minimum attribute redundancy, robustness to noise, invariance to rotation, translation, and scaling. Orthogonal moments can be both continuous and discrete. Prominent continuous moments are Zernike, Pseudo-Zernike, Legendre, and Gaussian-Hermite. This article provides a comprehensive and comparative review for continuous orthogonal moments along with their applications.","author":["Parminder Kaur","Husanbir Singh Pannu","Avleen Kaur Malhi"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 52","Issue 4","September 2019","Article No.: 67","pp   1\u201330","https://doi.org/10.1145/3331167"],"date":"30 August 2019","ref":[{"text":"Milton Abramowitz and Irene A.

ML techniques, especially recent renewed neural networks (deep neural networks), have proven to be efficient for a broad range of applications. ML techniques are conventionally executed on general-purpose processors (such as CPU and GPGPU), which usually are not energy efficient, since they invest excessive hardware resources to flexibly support various workloads. Consequently, application-specific hardware accelerators have been proposed recently to improve energy efficiency. However, such accelerators were designed for a small set of ML techniques sharing similar computational patterns, and they adopt complex and informative instructions (control signals) directly corresponding to high-level functional blocks of an ML technique (such as layers in neural networks) or even an ML as a whole. Although straightforward and easy to implement for a limited set of similar ML techniques, the lack of agility in the instruction set prevents such accelerator designs from supporting a variety of different ML techniques with sufficient flexibility and efficiency.In this article, we first propose a novel domain-specific Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for NN accelerators, called Cambricon, which is a load-store architecture that integrates scalar, vector, matrix, logical, data transfer, and control instructions, based on a comprehensive analysis of existing NN techniques. We then extend the application scope of Cambricon from NN to ML techniques. We also propose an assembly language, an assembler, and runtime to support programming with Cambricon, especially targeting large-scale ML problems. Our evaluation over a total of 16 representative yet distinct ML techniques have demonstrated that Cambricon exhibits strong descriptive capacity over a broad range of ML techniques and provides higher code density than general-purpose ISAs such as x86, MIPS, and GPGPU. Compared to the latest state-of-the-art NN accelerator design DaDianNao\u00a0[7] (which can only accommodate three types of NN techniques), our Cambricon-based accelerator prototype implemented in TSMC 65nm technology incurs only negligible latency/power/area overheads, with a versatile coverage of 10 different NN benchmarks and 7 other ML benchmarks. Compared to the recent prevalent ML accelerator PuDianNao, our Cambricon-based accelerator is able to support all the ML techniques as well as the 10 NNs but with only approximate 5.1% performance loss.","author":["Yunji Chen","Huiying Lan","Zidong Du","Shaoli Liu","Jinhua Tao","Dong Han","Tao Luo","Qi Guo","Ling Li","Yuan Xie","Tianshi Chen"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Computer Systems","Volume 36","Issue 3","August 2019","Article No.: 9","pp   1\u201335","https://doi.org/10.1145/3331469"],"date":"13 August 2019","ref":[{"text":"N.

This paper presents hardware designs for the sub-pixel interpolation unit of the FME step. The designs employ approximate computing techniques by reducing the number of taps in each filter to reduce memory access and hardware cost. The approximate filters were implemented in the HEVC reference software to assess their impact on coding performance. A complete interpolation architecture was implemented in VHDL and synthesized with different filter precision and input sizes in order to assess the effect of these parameters on hardware area and performance. The approximate designs reduce the number of adders/subtractors by up to 67.65% and memory bandwidth by up to 75% with a tolerable loss in coding performance (less than 1% using the Bjontegaard Delta bitrate metric). When synthesized to an FPGA device, 52.9% less logic elements are required with a modest increase in frequency.","author":["Rafael da Silva","\u00cdcaro Siqueira","Mateus Grellert"],"issue":["SBCCI '19: Proceedings of the 32nd Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design","August 2019","Article No.: 17","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3338852.3339859"],"date":"26 August 2019","ref":[{"text":"Vladimir Afonso, Henrique Maich, L Audibert, Bruno Zatt, Marcelo Porto, Luciano Agostini, and Altamiro Susin. 2016.

Most existing methods focus on treating entities and relations in triples independently and thus failing to capture the complex and hidden information that is inherently implicit inside the local neighborhood surrounding a triple. In this paper, we present a new approach for knowledge graph completion called GAEAT (Graph Auto-encoder Attention Network Embedding), which can encapsulate both entity and relation features. Specifically, we construct a triple-level auto-encoder by extending graph attention mechanisms to obtain latent representations of entities and relations simultaneously. To justify our proposed model, we evaluate GAEAT on two real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that GAEAT can outperform state-of-the-art KGE models in knowledge graph completion task, which validates the effectiveness of GAEAT.

ByteScheduler is based on our principled analysis that partitioning and rearranging the tensor transmissions can result in optimal results in theory and good performance in real-world even with scheduling overhead. To make ByteScheduler work generally for various DNN training frameworks, we introduce a unified abstraction and a Dependency Proxy mechanism to enable communication scheduling without breaking the original dependencies in framework engines. We further introduce a Bayesian Optimization approach to auto-tune tensor partition size and other parameters for different training models under various networking conditions. ByteScheduler now supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet without modifying their source code, and works well with both Parameter Server (PS) and all-reduce architectures for gradient synchronization, using either TCP or RDMA. Our experiments show that ByteScheduler accelerates training with all experimented system configurations and DNN models, by up to 196% (or 2.96X of original speed).","author":["Yanghua Peng","Yibo Zhu","Yangrui Chen","Yixin Bao","Bairen Yi","Chang Lan","Chuan Wu","Chuanxiong Guo"],"issue":["SOSP '19: Proceedings of the 27th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","October 2019","Pages   16\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/3341301.3359642"],"date":"27 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"2019.

For reduced start times, functions are deployed from unikernel snapshots, bypassing expensive initialization steps. To reduce the memory footprint of snapshots we apply page-level sharing across the entire software stack that is required to run a function. We demonstrate the effects of our techniques by replacing Linux on the compute node of a FaaS platform architecture. With our prototype OS, the deployment time of a function drops from 100s of milliseconds to under 10 ms. Platform throughput improves by 51x on workload composed entirely of new functions. We are able to cache over 50,000 function instances in memory as opposed to 3,000 using standard OS techniques. In combination, these improvements give the FaaS platform a new ability to handle large-scale bursts of requests.","author":["James Cadden","Thomas Unger","Yara Awad","Han Dong","Orran Krieger","Jonathan Appavoo"],"issue":["EuroSys '20: Proceedings of the Fifteenth European Conference on Computer Systems","April 2020","Article No.: 32","Pages   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/3342195.3392698"],"date":"15 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"(Accessed 3/30/2020).","order":1},{"text":"(Accessed 3/30/2020).

Visual relations, denoted by the triplet <subject, predicate, object>, could convey a wealth of information for visual understanding. Different from static images and because of the additional temporal channel, dynamic relations in videos are often correlated in both spatial and temporal dimensions, which make the relation detection in videos a more complex and challenging task. In this paper, we abstract videos into fully-connected spatial-temporal graphs. We pass message and conduct reasoning in these 3D graphs with a novel VidVRD model using graph convolution network. Our model can take advantage of spatial-temporal contextual cues to make better predictions on objects as well as their dynamic relationships. Furthermore, an online association method with a siamese network is proposed for accurate relation instances association. By combining our model (VRD-GCN) and the proposed association method, our framework for video relation detection achieves the best performance in the latest benchmarks. We validate our approach on benchmark ImageNet-VidVRD dataset. The experimental results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin and a series of ablation studies demonstrate our method's effectiveness.","author":["Xufeng Qian","Yueting Zhuang","Yimeng Li","Shaoning Xiao","Shiliang Pu","Jun Xiao"],"issue":["MM '19: Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Multimedia","October 2019","Pages   84\u201393","https://doi.org/10.1145/3343031.3351058"],"date":"15 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Jacob Andreas, Marcus Rohrbach, Trevor Darrell, and Dan Klein. 2015.

Previous methods model skeletons based on RNN or CNN, which has limited expressive power for irregular skeleton joints. While graph convolutional networks (GCN) have been proposed to address irregular graph-structured data, the fundamental graph construction remains challenging. In this paper, we represent skeletons naturally on graphs, and propose a graph regression based GCN (GR-GCN) for skeleton-based action recognition, aiming to capture the spatio-temporal variation in the data. As the graph representation is crucial to graph convolution, we first propose graph regression to statistically learn the underlying graph from multiple observations. In particular, we provide spatio-temporal modeling of skeletons and pose an optimization problem on the graph structure over consecutive frames, which enforces the sparsity of the underlying graph for efficient representation. The optimized graph not only connects each joint to its neighboring joints in the same frame strongly or weakly, but also links with relevant joints in the previous and subsequent frames. We then feed the optimized graph into the GCN along with the coordinates of the skeleton sequence for feature learning, where we deploy high-order and fast Chebyshev approximation of spectral graph convolution. Further, we provide analysis of the variation characterization by the Chebyshev approximation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed graph regression and show that the proposed GR-GCN achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the widely used NTU RGB+D, UT-Kinect and SYSU 3D datasets.","author":["Xiang Gao","Wei Hu","Jiaxiang Tang","Jiaying Liu","Zongming Guo"],"issue":["MM '19: Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Multimedia","October 2019","Pages   601\u2013610","https://doi.org/10.1145/3343031.3351170"],"date":"15 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Rushil Anirudh, Pavan Turaga, Jingyong Su, and Anuj Srivastava. 2015.

It is supported by several parallelization frameworks, as OpenMP and StarSs. Overhead related to automatic dependence inference and to the scheduling of ready-to-run tasks is a major performance limiting factor of Task Parallel systems. To amortize this overhead, programmers usually trade the higher parallelism that could be leveraged from finer-grained work partitions for the higher runtime-efficiency of coarser-grained work partitions. Such problems are even more severe for systems with many cores, as the task spawning frequency required for preserving cores from starvation grows linearly with their number. To mitigate these problems, researchers have designed hardware accelerators to improve runtime performance. Nevertheless, the high CPU-accelerator communication overheads of these solutions hampered their gains. We thus propose a RISC-V based architecture that minimizes communication overhead between the HW Task Scheduler and the CPU by allowing Task Scheduling software to directly interact with the former through custom instructions. Empirical evaluation of the architecture is made possible by an FPGA prototype featuring an eight-core Linux-capable Rocket Chip implementing such instructions. To evaluate the prototype performance, we both (1) adapted Nanos, a mature Task Scheduling runtime, to benefit from the new task-scheduling-accelerating instructions; and (2) developed Phentos, a new HW-accelerated light weight Task Scheduling runtime. Our experiments show that task parallel programs using Nanos-RV --- the Nanos version ported to our system --- are on average 2.13 times faster than those being serviced by baseline Nanos, while programs running on Phentos are 13.19 times faster, considering geometric means. Using eight cores, Nanos-RV is able to deliver speedups with respect to serial execution of up to 5.62 times, while Phentos produces speedups of up to 5.72 times.","author":["Lucas Morais","Vitor Silva","Alfredo Goldman","Carlos Alvarez","Jaume Bosch","Michael Frank","Guido Araujo"],"issue":["MICRO '52: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","October 2019","Pages   861\u2013872","https://doi.org/10.1145/3352460.3358271"],"date":"12 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Asanovi\u0107, K., Avizienis, R., Bachrach, J., Beamer, S., Biancolin, D., Celio, C., Cook, H., Dabbelt, D., Hauser, J., Izraelevitz, A., Karandikar, S., Keller, B., Kim, D., Koenig, J., Lee, Y., Love, E., Maas, M., Magyar, A., Mao, H., Moreto, M., Ou, A., Patterson, D.

While dynamic binary instrumentation tools such as PIN and DynamoRio are supported on CPUs, GPU architectures currently only have limited support for similar capabilities through static compile-time tools, which prohibits instrumentation of dynamically loaded libraries that are foundations for modern high-performance applications. This work presents NVBit, a fast, dynamic, and portable, binary instrumentation framework, that allows users to write instrumentation tools in CUDA/C/C++ and selectively apply that functionality to pre-compiled binaries and libraries executing on NVIDIA GPUs. Using dynamic recompilation at the SASS level, NVBit analyzes GPU kernel register requirements to generate efficient ABI compliant instrumented code without requiring the tool developer to have detailed knowledge of the underlying GPU architecture. NVBit allows basic-block instrumentation, multiple function injections to the same location, inspection of all ISA visible state, dynamic selection of instrumented or uninstrumented code, permanent modification of register state, source code correlation, and instruction removal. NVBit supports all recent NVIDIA GPU architecture families including Kepler, Maxwell, Pascal and Volta and works on any pre-compiled CUDA, OpenACC, OpenCL, or CUDA-Fortran application.","author":["Oreste Villa","Mark Stephenson","David Nellans","Stephen W.

Although quite a few promising network embedding methods have been proposed, most of them focus on static networks. In fact, temporal networks, which usually evolve over time in terms of microscopic and macroscopic dynamics, are ubiquitous. The micro-dynamics describe the formation process of network structures in a detailed manner, while the macro-dynamics refer to the evolution pattern of the network scale. Both micro- and macro-dynamics are the key factors to network evolution; however, how to elegantly capture both of them for temporal network embedding, especially macro-dynamics, has not yet been well studied. In this paper, we propose a novel temporal network embedding method with micro- and macro-dynamics, named $\\rmM^2DNE $. Specifically, for micro-dynamics, we regard the establishments of edges as the occurrences of chronological events and propose a temporal attention point process to capture the formation process of network structures in a fine-grained manner. For macro-dynamics, we define a general dynamics equation parameterized with network embeddings to capture the inherent evolution pattern and impose constraints in a higher structural level on network embeddings. Mutual evolutions of micro- and macro-dynamics in a temporal network alternately affect the process of learning node embeddings. Extensive experiments on three real-world temporal networks demonstrate that $\\rmM^2DNE $ significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts not only in traditional tasks, e.g., network reconstruction, but also in temporal tendency-related tasks, e.g., scale prediction.","author":["Yuanfu Lu","Xiao Wang","Chuan Shi","Philip S.

However, it is difficult to apply convolutional neural networks directly on ubiquitous graph data since the graph data lies in an irregular structure. A significant number of researchers engrossed themselves in studying graph convolutional networks transformed from Euclidean domain. Previous graph convolutional networks overviews mainly focus on reviewing recent methods in a comprehensive ways. In this survey, we review the convolutional networks from the perspective of receptive fields. Roughly, the convolutional networks fall into three main categories: spectral based methods, sampling based methods and attention based methods. We analysis the differences of these methods and propose three potential directions for future research of graph convolutional networks.","author":["Pei Quan","Yong Shi","Minglong Lei","Jiaxu Leng","Tianlin Zhang","Lingfeng Niu"],"issue":["WI '19 Companion: IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence - Companion Volume","October 2019","Pages   106\u2013110","https://doi.org/10.1145/3358695.3360934"],"date":"14 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2015.

Due to communication overhead and bottlenecks, the total throughput of SGD updates in a cluster scales sublinearly, saturating as the number of nodes increases. In this paper, we present a solution to predicting training throughput from profiling traces collected from a single-node configuration. Our approach is able to model the interaction of multiple nodes and the scheduling of concurrent transmissions between the parameter server and each node. By accounting for the dependencies between received parts and pending computations, we predict overlaps between computation and communication and generate synthetic execution traces for configurations with multiple nodes. We validate our approach on TensorFlow training jobs for popular image classification neural networks, on AWS and on our in-house cluster, using nodes equipped with GPUs or only with CPUs. We also investigate the effects of data transmission policies used in TensorFlow and the accuracy of our approach when combined with optimizations of the transmission schedule.","author":["Zhuojin Li","Wumo Yan","Marco Paolieri","Leana Golubchik"],"issue":["ICPE '20: Proceedings of the ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering","April 2020","Pages   76\u201387","https://doi.org/10.1145/3358960.3379141"],"date":"20 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"M.

To this end, in this paper, we introduce a new semantic data mining-based approach to support the (semi-)automatic generation of a biodiversity knowledge graph. The proposed approach exploits and links information from several biodiversity-related resources, including the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and the Global Biotic Interactions (GLOBI). In particular, we adopt a data mining technique to extract association rules that support the construction of an initial species interactions knowledge graph. We then make use of available biodiversity resources to enrich the knowledge graph. We believe that this graph will support scientists from the biodiversity domain to gain new insights and enrich the data interoperability.","author":["Dina Sharafeldeen","Alsayed Algergawy","Birgitta K\u00f6nig-Ries"],"issue":["iiWAS2019: Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services","December 2019","Pages   323\u2013329","https://doi.org/10.1145/3366030.3366035"],"date":"02 December 2019","ref":[{"text":"Stamatios-Aggelos N.

However, many such application workflows are based in part on publicly-available functions developed by third-parties, creating the potential for functions to behave in unexpected, or even malicious, ways. At present, developers are not in total control of where and how their data is flowing, creating significant security and privacy risks in growth markets that have embraced serverless (e.g., IoT).  As a practical means of addressing this problem, we present Valve, a serverless platform that enables developers to exert complete fine-grained control of information flows in their applications. Valve enables workflow developers to reason about function behaviors, and specify restrictions, through auditing of network-layer information flows. By proxying network requests and propagating taint labels across network flows, Valve is able to restrict function behavior without code modification. We demonstrate that Valve is able defend against known serverless attack behaviors including container reuse-based persistence and data exfiltration over cloud platform APIs with less than 2.8% runtime overhead, 6.25% deployment overhead and 2.35% teardown overhead.","author":["Pubali Datta","Prabuddha Kumar","Tristan Morris","Michael Grace","Amir Rahmati","Adam Bates"],"issue":["WWW '20: Proceedings of The Web Conference 2020","April 2020","Pages   939\u2013950","https://doi.org/10.1145/3366423.3380173"],"date":"20 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"2019. 21% of Open Source Serverless Apps Have Critical Vulnerabilities. https://www.puresec.io/blog/puresec-reveals-that-21-of-open-source-serverless-applications-have-critical-vulnerabilities.","order":1},{"text":"2019.

The compiler targets a specific class of SP-LoCs that manipulate discrete liquid droplets on a 2D grid, with cyber-physical feedback provided by integrated sensors and/or video monitoring equipment. The optimization strategy employed here aims to reduce the overhead of transporting fluids between operations, and explores tradeoffs between the latency and resource requirements of mixing operations: allocating more space for mixing shortens mixing time, but reduces the amount of spatial parallelism available to other operations. The compiler is empirically evaluated using a cycle-accurate simulator that mimics the behavior of the target SP-LoC. Our results show that a coalescing strategy, inspired by graph coloring register allocation, effectively reduces droplet transport latencies while speeding up the compiler and reducing its memory footprint. For biochemical reactions that are dominated by mixing operations, we observe a linear correlation between a preliminary result using a default mixing operation resource allocation and the percentage decrease in execution time that is achieved via resizing.","author":["Tyson Loveless","Jason Ott","Philip Brisk"],"issue":["CGO 2020: Proceedings of the 18th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization","February 2020","Pages   171\u2013184","https://doi.org/10.1145/3368826.3377925"],"date":"22 February 2020","ref":[{"text":"Mirela Alistar and Urs Gaudenz. 2017.

We have developed a framework called Nimble that automatically compiles system-level applications specified in C to executables on the target platform. A key component of this framework is a hardware/software partitioning algorithm that performs fine-grained partitioning (at loop and basic-block levels) of an application to execute on the combined CPU and datapath. The partitioning algorithm optimizes the global application execution time, including the software and hardware execution times, communication time and datapath reconfiguration time. Experimental results on real applications show that our algorithm is effective in rapidly finding close to optimal solutions.","author":["Yanbing Li","Tim Callahan","Ervan Darnell","Randolph Harr","Uday Kurkure","Jon Stockwood"],"issue":["DAC '00: Proceedings of the 37th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2000","Pages   507\u2013512","https://doi.org/10.1145/337292.337559"],"date":"01 June 2000","ref":[{"text":"T.

Several areas have benefited from research based on this technology, such as finance, remote sensing, data analysis, and healthcare. Data immutability, privacy, transparency, decentralization, and distributed ledgers are the main features that make blockchain an attractive technology. However, healthcare records that contain confidential patient data make this system very complicated because there is a risk of a privacy breach. This study aims to address research into the applications of the blockchain healthcare area. It sets out by discussing the management of medical information, as well as the sharing of medical records, image sharing, and log management. We also discuss papers that intersect with other areas, such as the Internet of Things, the management of information, tracking of drugs along their supply chain, and aspects of security and privacy. As we are aware that there are other surveys of blockchain in healthcare, we analyze and compare both the positive and negative aspects of their papers. Finally, we seek to examine the concepts of blockchain in the medical area, by assessing their benefits and drawbacks and thus giving guidance to other researchers in the area. Additionally, we summarize the methods used in healthcare per application area and show their pros and cons.","author":["Erikson J\u00falio De Aguiar","Bruno S.

Recently, Few-shot Learning (FSL) is proposed to tackle this problem. Using prior knowledge, FSL can rapidly generalize to new tasks containing only a few samples with supervised information. In this article, we conduct a thorough survey to fully understand FSL. Starting from a formal definition of FSL, we distinguish FSL from several relevant machine learning problems. We then point out that the core issue in FSL is that the empirical risk minimizer is unreliable. Based on how prior knowledge can be used to handle this core issue, we categorize FSL methods from three perspectives: (i) data, which uses prior knowledge to augment the supervised experience; (ii) model, which uses prior knowledge to reduce the size of the hypothesis space; and (iii) algorithm, which uses prior knowledge to alter the search for the best hypothesis in the given hypothesis space. With this taxonomy, we review and discuss the pros and cons of each category. Promising directions, in the aspects of the FSL problem setups, techniques, applications, and theories, are also proposed to provide insights for future research.1","author":["Yaqing Wang","Quanming Yao","James T.

However, the requirements for eCommerce, such as safety and timeliness, are becoming increasingly strict. Thus, the cloud-edge hybrid computing model has been introduced to accelerate information processing, especially in a mobile scenario. However, the mobile environment is characterized by limited resource storage and users who frequently move, and these characteristics strongly affect the reliability of service composition running in this environment. Consequently, applications are likely to fail if inappropriate services are invoked. To ensure that the composite service can operate normally, traditional dynamic reconfiguration methods tend to focus on cloud services scheduling. Unfortunately, most of these approaches cannot support timely responses to dynamic changes. In this article, the cloud-edge based dynamic reconfiguration to service workflow for mobile eCommerce environments is proposed. First, the service quality concept is extended. Specifically, the value and cost attributes of a service are considered. The value attribute is used to assess the stability of the service for some time to come, and the cost attribute is the cost of a service invocation. Second, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is used to predict the stability of services, which is related to the calculation of the value attribute. Then, in view of the limited available equipment resources, a method for calculating the cost of calling a service is introduced. Third, candidate services are selected by considering both service stability and the cost of service invocation, thus yielding a dynamic reconfiguration scheme that is more suitable for the cloud-edge environment. Finally, a series of comparative experiments were carried out, and the experimental results prove that the method proposed in this article offers higher stability, less energy consumption, and more accurate service prediction.","author":["Honghao Gao","Wanqiu Huang","Yucong Duan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Internet Technology","Volume 21","Issue 1","February 2021","Article No.: 6","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3391198"],"date":"13 January 2021","ref":[{"text":"Y.

To address these conflicting requirements, we propose a modular reconfigurable architecture called Smart Memories, targeted at computing needs in the 0.1\u03bc technology generation. A Smart Memories chip is made up of many processing tiles, each containing local memory, local interconnect, and a processor core. For efficient computation under a wide class of possible applications, the memories, the wires, and the computational model can all be altered to match the applications. To show the applicability of this design, two very different machines at opposite ends of the architectural spectrum, the Imagine stream processor and the Hydra speculative multiprocessor, are mapped onto the Smart Memories computing substrate. Simulations of the mappings show that the Smart Memories architecture can successfully map these architectures with only modest performance degradation.","author":["Ken Mai","Tim Paaske","Nuwan Jayasena","Ron Ho","William J.

In many DSP systems, using truncated multipliers instead of full precision multipliers can keep the accuracy at a desirable level while significantly reducing FPGA resources, delay, and power consumption. Truncated multipliers are widely used to accelerate DSP applications such as filtering, fast Fourier, and discrete cosine transforms. In this paper we propose a novel low-cost, low energy, and highspeed truncated multiplier using a hybrid binary-unary encoding method. We take advantage of the unary computing method to exploit two error correction mechanisms in order to reduce error without adding to the hardware cost. The proposed multipliers outperform Xilinx LogiCORE IP in terms of hardware cost, and outperform state-of-the-art FPGA-specific approximate multipliers in terms of accuracy and hardware costs. The proposed approximate multipliers result in area reductions between 12% to 48% for 7- to 15-bit multipliers on average. We assess the performance of the proposed multipliers on an FIR filter, 2-D discrete cosine transform, and fast Fourier transform as three common DSP algorithms. The evaluation results show that these applications can deliver desirable performance using the proposed multipliers.","author":["S.

As a result, it is crucial that power/performance tradeoffs be made more visible to chip architects and even compiler writers, in addition to circuit designers. Most existing power analysis tools achieve high accuracy by calculating power estimates for designs only after layout or floorplanning are complete. In addition to being available only late in the design process, such tools are often quite slow, which compounds the difficulty of running them for a large space of design possibilities.This paper presents Wattch, a framework for analyzing and optimizing microprocessor power dissipation at the architecture-level. Wattch is 1000X or more faster than existing layout-level power tools, and yet maintains accuracy within 10% of their estimates as verified using industry tools on leading-edge designs. This paper presents several validations of Wattch's accuracy. In addition, we present three examples that demonstrate how architects or compiler writers might use Wattch to evaluate power consumption in their design process.We see Wattch as a complement to existing lower-level tools; it allows architects to explore and cull the design space early on, using faster, higher-level tools. It also opens up the field of power-efficient computing to a wider range of researchers by providing a power evaluation methodology within the portable and familiar SimpleScalar framework.","author":["David Brooks","Vivek Tiwari","Margaret Martonosi"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 28","Issue 2","May 2000","pp   83\u201394","https://doi.org/10.1145/342001.339657"],"date":"01 May 2000","ref":[{"text":"M.

Therefore, this article introduces concept information derived from the lexical knowledge graph (e.g., Probase), and proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention model for Relation Prediction, which consists of entity-level attention mechanism and concept-level attention mechanism, to throughly integrate multiple semantic signals.

Since finding an optimal schedule is an NP-complete problem in general, researchers have resorted to devising efficient heuristics. A plethora of heuristics have been proposed based on a wide spectrum of techniques, including branch-and-bound, integer-programming, searching, graph-theory, randomization, genetic algorithms, and evolutionary methods. The objective of this survey is to describe various scheduling algorithms and their functionalities in a contrasting fashion as well as examine their relative merits in terms of performance and time-complexity. Since these algorithms are based on diverse   assumptions, they differ in their functionalities, and hence are difficult to describe in a unified context. We propose a taxonomy that classifies these algorithms into different categories. We consider 27 scheduling algorithms, with each algorithm explained through an easy-to-understand description followed by an illustrative example to demonstrate its operation. We also outline some of the novel and promising optimization approaches and current research trends in the area. Finally, we give an overview of the software tools that provide scheduling/mapping functionalities.","author":["Yu-Kwong Kwok","Ishfaq Ahmad"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 31","Issue 4","Dec. 1999","pp   406\u2013471","https://doi.org/10.1145/344588.344618"],"date":"01 December 1999","ref":[{"text":"ADAM, T.

Networked computers are becoming ubiquitous and are playing increasingly significant roles in our lives and in the basic infrastructures of science, business, and social interaction. For human-computer interaction to advance in the new millennium we need to better understand the emerging dynamic of interaction in which the focus task is no longer confined to the desktop but reaches into a complex networked world of information and computer-mediated interactions. We think the theory of distributed cognition has a special role to play in understanding interactions between people and technologies, for its  focus has always been on whole environments: what we really do in them and how we coordinate our activity in them. Distributed cognition provides a radical reorientation of how to think about designing and supporting human-computer interaction. As a theory it is specifically tailored to understanding interactions among people and technologies. In this article we propose distributed cognition as a new foundation for human-computer interaction, sketch an integrated research framework, and use selections from our earlier work to suggest how this framework can provide new opportunities in the design of digital work materials.","author":["James Hollan","Edwin Hutchins","David Kirsh"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction","Volume 7","Issue 2","June 2000","pp   174\u2013196","https://doi.org/10.1145/353485.353487"],"date":"01 June 2000","ref":[{"text":"AGAR, M. 1986.

Since embedded cores in an SOC are not directly accessible via chip inputs and outputs, special access mechanisms are required to test them at the system level. An efficient test access architecture should also reduce test cost by minimizing test application time. We address several issues related to the design of optimal test access architectures that minimize testing time., including the assignment of cores to test buses, distribution of test data width between multiple test buses, and analysis of test data width required to satisfy an upper bound on the testing time. Even though the decision versions of all these problems are shown to be NP-complete, they can be solved exactly for practical instances using integer  linear programming (ILP). As a case study, the ILP models for two hypothetical but nontrivial systems are solved using a public-domain ILP software package.","author":["Krishnendu Chakrabarty"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 6","Issue 1","Jan. 2001","pp   26\u201349","https://doi.org/10.1145/371254.371258"],"date":"01 January 2001","ref":[{"text":"AERTS,J.AND MARINISSEN, E.

We employ elasticity theory to construct differential equations that model the behavior of non-rigid curves, surfaces, and solids as a function of time. Elastically deformable models are active: they respond in a natural way to applied forces, constraints, ambient media, and impenetrable obstacles. The models are fundamentally dynamic and realistic animation is created by numerically solving their underlying differential equations. Thus, the description of shape and the description of motion are unified.","author":["Demetri Terzopoulos","John Platt","Alan Barr","Kurt Fleischer"],"issue":["ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics","Volume 21","Issue 4","July 1987","pp   205\u2013214","https://doi.org/10.1145/37402.37427"],"date":"01 August 1987","ref":[{"text":"Armstrong, W.W., and Green, M., \"The dynamics of articulated rigid bodies for purposes of animation,\" Proc.

Although such systems seem deceptively simple, a considerable amount of skill is required in order to satisfy non-trivial information needs. This paper presents a new conceptual paradigm for performing search in context, that largely automates the search process, providing even non-professional users with highly relevant results. This paradigm is implemented in practice in the IntelliZap system, where search is initiated from a text query marked by the user in a document she views, and is guided by the text surrounding the marked query in that document (\"the context\"). The context-driven information retrieval process involves semantic keyword extraction and clustering to automatically generate new, augmented queries. The latter are submitted to a host of general and domain-specific search engines. Search results are then semantically reranked, using context. Experimental results testify that using context to guide search, effectively offers even inexperienced users an advanced search tool on the Web.","issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 20","Issue 1","January 2002","pp   116\u2013131","https://doi.org/10.1145/503104.503110"],"date":"01 January 2002","ref":[{"text":"BHARAT, K. 2000.

Whenever you send a message, he censors each bit of the message with probability 1/2, replacing each censored bit by some reserved character. Well versed in such concepts as redundancy, this is no real problem to you. The question is, can it actually be turned around and used to your advantage? We answer this question strongly in the affirmative. We show that this protocol, more commonly known as oblivious transfer, can be used to simulate a more sophisticated protocol, known as oblivious circuit evaluation([Y]). We also show that with such a communication channel, one can have completely noninteractive zero-knowledge proofs of statements in NP. These results do not use any complexity-theoretic assumptions. We can show that they have applications to a variety of models in which oblivious transfer can be done.","author":["Joe Kilian"],"issue":["STOC '88: Proceedings of the twentieth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing","January 1988","Pages   20\u201331","https://doi.org/10.1145/62212.62215"],"date":"01 January 1988","ref":[{"text":"Abadi, Martin, Joan Feigenbaum, \"A Simple and Efficient Protocol for Secure Circuit Computation,'' to appear.","order":1},{"text":"Angluin, Dana and David Lichtenstein. \"Provable Security of Cryptosystems: a Survey,\" YALEU/DCS/TR-288, 1983.","order":2},{"text":"Barrington, D. \"Bounded Width Polynomial Size Branching Programs Recognize Exactly Those Languages in NCTM, Proceedings of I8th STOC, 1986, pp. 1-5.","doi":"10.1145/12130.12131","order":3},{"text":"Brassard, Gilles and Claude Cr~peau. \"Zero-Knowledge Simulation of Boolean Circuits,'' Proceedings of the 27th FOCS, IEEE, 1986, 188-195.","order":4},{"text":"Ben-Or, Michael, Shaft Goldwasser, Joe Kilian, and Avi Wigderson, \"Multi-Prover interactive Proof Systems, Removing Intractibility Assumptions,\" These proceedings.","doi":"10.1145/62212.62223","order":5},{"text":"Boppana, Ravi, Johan Hastad, and Stathis Zachos. \"Does CoNP Have Short Interactive Proofs?,\" IPL, 25, 1987, 127-132.","doi":"10.1016/0020-0190%2887%2990232-8","order":6},{"text":"Cripeau Claude, \"On the Equivalence of Two Types of Oblivious Transfer\", Crypto87.","order":7},{"text":"D.

A slice of a program is taken with respect to a program point p and a variable x; the slice consists of all statements of the program that might affect the value of x at point p. This paper concerns the problem of interprocedural slicing\u2014generating a slice of an entire program, where the slice crosses the boundaries of procedure calls. To solve this problem, we introduce a new kind of graph to represent programs, called a system dependence graph, which extends previous dependence representations to incorporate collections of procedures (with procedure calls) rather than just monolithic programs. Our main result is an algorithm for interprocedural slicing that uses the new representation. (It should be noted that our work concerns a somewhat restricted kind of slice: rather than permitting a program to b\ne sliced with respect to program point p and an arbitrary variable, a slice must be taken with respect to a variable that is defined or used at p.)The chief difficulty in interprocedural slicing is correctly accounting for the calling context of a called procedure. To handle this problem, system dependence graphs include some data dependence edges that represent transitive dependences due to the effects of procedure calls, in addition to the conventional direct-dependence edges. These edges are constructed with the aid of an auxiliary structure that represents calling and parameter-linkage relationships. This structure takes the form of an attribute grammar. The step of computing the required transitive-dependence edges is reduced to the construction of the subordinate characteristic graphs for the grammar's nonterminals.","author":["Susan Horwitz","Thomas Reps","David Binkley"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems","Volume 12","Issue 1","Jan. 1990","pp   26\u201360","https://doi.org/10.1145/77606.77608"],"date":"03 January 1990","ref":[{"text":"AHO, A.

Previous work addressed this problem by devising tools for detecting race conditions, a situation where two threads simultaneously access the same data variable, and at least one of the accesses is a write. However, verifying the absence of such simultaneous-access race conditions is neither necessary nor sufficient to ensure the absence of errors due to unexpected thread interactions.We propose that a stronger non-interference property is required, namely atomicity. Atomic methods can be assumed to execute serially, without interleaved steps of other threads. Thus, atomic methods are amenable to sequential reasoning techniques, which significantly simplifies both formal and informal reasoning about program correctness.This paper presents a type system for specifying and verifying the atomicity of methods in multithreaded Java programs. The atomic type system is a synthesis of Lipton's theory of reduction and type systems for race detection.We have implemented this atomic type system for Java and used it to check a variety of standard Java library classes. The type checker uncovered subtle atomicity violations in classes such as <tt>java.lang.String</tt> and <tt>java.lang.String-Buffer</tt> that cause crashes under certain thread interleavings.This paper proposes that a stronger non-interference property is required, namely atomicity, and presents a type system for verifying the atomicity of methods in multithreaded Java programs. Methods in a class can be annotated with the keyword <tt>atomic</tt>. Clients of a well-typed class can then assume that each atomic method is executed in one step, thus significantly simplifying both formal and informal reasoning about the client's correctness.","author":["Cormac Flanagan","Shaz Qadeer"],"issue":["PLDI '03: Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN 2003 conference on Programming language design and implementation","June 2003","Pages   338\u2013349","https://doi.org/10.1145/781131.781169"],"date":"09 May 2003","ref":[{"text":"A.

First, we present an RT-level power estimator for FPGAs with consideration of wire length. The power estimator closely reflects both dynamic and static power contributed by various FPGA components in 0.1um technology. The power estimation error is 16.2% on average. Second, we present a low power high level synthesis system, named LOPASS, for FPGA designs. It includes two algorithms for power consumption reduction: (i) a simulated annealing engine that carries out resource selection, function unit binding, scheduling, register binding, and data path generation simultaneously to effectively reduce power; (ii) an enhanced weighted bipartite matching algorithm that is able to reduce the total amount of MUX ports by 22.7%. Experimental results show that LOPASS is able to reduce power consumption by 35.8% compared to the results of Synopsys' Behavioral Compiler.","author":["Deming Chen","Jason Cong","Yiping Fan"],"issue":["ISLPED '03: Proceedings of the 2003 international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2003","Pages   134\u2013139","https://doi.org/10.1145/871506.871541"],"date":"25 August 2003","ref":[{"text":"A.

Cache-conscious indices are designed to improve performance by reducing the number of processor cache misses that are incurred during a search operation. Conventional wisdom suggests that the index's node size should be equal to the cache line size in order to minimize the number of cache misses and improve performance. As we show in this paper, this design choice ignores additional effects, such as the number of instructions executed and the number of TLB misses, which play a significant role in determining the overall performance. To capture the impact of node size on the performance of a cache-conscious B+ tree (CSB+-tree), we first develop an analytical model based on the fundamental components of the search process. This model is then validated with an actual implementation, demonstrating that the model is accurate. Both the analytical model and experiments confirm that using node sizes much larger than the cache line size can result in better search performance for the CSB+-tree.","author":["Richard A.

For example, there has been speculation [6] that regular logic fabrics [1] based on regular geometry patterns [2] can offer tighter control of variations and greater control of systematic manufacturing failures. In this paper we describe a routing framework that accommodates arbitrary descriptions of regular and structured routing architectures. We further propose new regular routing architectures and explore the various performance vs. manufacturability trade-offs. Results demonstrate that a more regular, restricted routing architecture can provide a substantial advantage in terms of manufacturability and predictability while incurring a moderate performance penalty.","author":["V.

Because distributed transactions are expensive in OLTP settings (a fact we demonstrate through a series of experiments), our partitioner attempts to minimize the number of distributed transactions, while producing balanced partitions. Schism consists of two phases: i) a workload-driven, graph-based replication/partitioning phase and ii) an explanation and validation phase. The first phase creates a graph with a node per tuple (or group of tuples) and edges between nodes accessed by the same transaction, and then uses a graph partitioner to split the graph into k balanced partitions that minimize the number of cross-partition transactions. The second phase exploits machine learning techniques to find a predicate-based explanation of the partitioning strategy (i.e., a set of range predicates that represent the same replication/partitioning scheme produced by the partitioner).The strengths of Schism are: i) independence from the schema layout, ii) effectiveness on n-to-n relations, typical in social network databases, iii) a unified and fine-grained approach to replication and partitioning. We implemented and tested a prototype of Schism on a wide spectrum of test cases, ranging from classical OLTP workloads (e.g., TPC-C and TPC-E), to more complex scenarios derived from social network websites (e.g., Epinions.com), whose schema contains multiple n-to-n relationships, which are known to be hard to partition. Schism consistently outperforms simple partitioning schemes, and in some cases proves superior to the best known manual partitioning, reducing the cost of distributed transactions up to 30%.","author":["Carlo Curino","Evan Jones","Yang Zhang","Sam Madden"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   48\u201357","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920853"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"S.

While these constraints can detect the presence of errors, they fall short of guiding us to correct the errors. Indeed, data repairing based on these constraints may not find certain fixes that are absolutely correct, and worse, may introduce new errors when repairing the data. We propose a method for finding certain fixes, based on master data, a notion of certain regions, and a class of editing rules. A certain region is a set of attributes that are assured correct by the users. Given a certain region and master data, editing rules tell us what attributes to fix and how to update them. We show how the method can be used in data monitoring and enrichment. We develop techniques for reasoning about editing rules, to decide whether they lead to a unique fix and whether they are able to fix all the attributes in a tuple, relative to master data and a certain region. We also provide an algorithm to identify minimal certain regions, such that a certain fix is warranted by editing rules and master data as long as one of the regions is correct. We experimentally verify the effectiveness and scalability of the algorithm.","author":["Wenfei Fan","Jianzhong Li","Shuai Ma","Nan Tang","Wenyuan Yu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   173\u2013184","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920867"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"F-measure. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-measure.","order":1},{"text":"T.

Spatial queries pose an additional threat to privacy because the location of a query may be sufficient to reveal sensitive information about the querier. In this paper we focus on k nearest neighbor (kNN) queries and define the notion of strong location privacy, which renders a query indistinguishable from any location in the data space. We argue that previous work fails to support this property for arbitrary kNN search. Towards this end, we introduce methods that offer strong location privacy, by integrating private information retrieval (PIR) functionality. Specifically, we employ secure hardware-aided PIR, which has been proven very efficient and is currently considered as a practical mechanism for PIR. Initially, we devise a benchmark solution building upon an existing PIR-based technique. Subsequently, we identify its drawbacks and present a novel scheme called AHG to tackle them. Finally, we demonstrate the performance superiority of AHG over our competitor, and its viability in applications demanding the highest level of privacy.","author":["Stavros Papadopoulos","Spiridon Bakiras","Dimitris Papadias"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   619\u2013629","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920920"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"Tor: anonymity online. http://www.torproject.org/.","order":1},{"text":"R.

Consequently, a major challenge for data integration is to derive the most complete and accurate integrated records from diverse and sometimes conflicting sources. We term this challenge the truth finding problem. We observe that some sources are generally more reliable than others, and therefore a good model of source quality is the key to solving the truth finding problem. In this work, we propose a probabilistic graphical model that can automatically infer true records and source quality without any supervision. In contrast to previous methods, our principled approach leverages a generative process of two types of errors (false positive and false negative) by modeling two different aspects of source quality. In so doing, ours is also the first approach designed to merge multi-valued attribute types. Our method is scalable, due to an efficient sampling-based inference algorithm that needs very few iterations in practice and enjoys linear time complexity, with an even faster incremental variant. Experiments on two real world datasets show that our new method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches to the truth finding problem.","author":["Bo Zhao","Benjamin I. P.

Therefore, rather than relying solely on developing new and better algorithms to handle such tasks, we look to the crowdsourcing solution -- employing human participation -- to make good the shortfall in current technology. Crowdsourcing is a good supplement to many computer tasks. A complex job may be divided into computer-oriented tasks and human-oriented tasks, which are then assigned to machines and humans respectively.To leverage the power of crowdsourcing, we design and implement a Crowdsourcing Data Analytics System, CDAS. CDAS is a framework designed to support the deployment of various crowdsourcing applications. The core part of CDAS is a quality-sensitive answering model, which guides the crowdsourcing engine to process and monitor the human tasks. In this paper, we introduce the principles of our quality-sensitive model. To satisfy user required accuracy, the model guides the crowdsourcing query engine for the design and processing of the corresponding crowdsourcing jobs. It provides an estimated accuracy for each generated result based on the human workers' historical performances. When verifying the quality of the result, the model employs an online strategy to reduce waiting time. To show the effectiveness of the model, we implement and deploy two analytics jobs on CDAS, a twitter sentiment analytics job and an image tagging job. We use real Twitter and Flickr data as our queries respectively. We compare our approaches with state-of-the-art classification and image annotation techniques. The results show that the human-assisted methods can indeed achieve a much higher accuracy. By embedding the quality-sensitive model into crowdsourcing query engine, we effectively reduce the processing cost while maintaining the required query answer quality.","author":["Xuan Liu","Meiyu Lu","Beng Chin Ooi","Yanyan Shen","Sai Wu","Meihui Zhang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 5","Issue 10","June 2012","pp   1040\u20131051","https://doi.org/10.14778/2336664.2336676"],"date":"01 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"O.

The drastic performance improvements that came along with these in-memory systems have made it possible to reunite the two areas of online transaction processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP): An emerging class of hybrid OLTP and OLAP database systems allows to process analytical queries directly on the transactional data. By offering arbitrarily current snapshots of the transactional data for OLAP, these systems enable real-time business intelligence.Despite memory sizes of several Terabytes in a single commodity server, RAM is still a precious resource: Since free memory can be used for intermediate results in query processing, the amount of memory determines query performance to a large extent. Consequently, we propose the compaction of memory-resident databases. Compaction consists of two tasks: First, separating the mutable working set from the immutable \"frozen\" data. Second, compressing the immutable data and optimizing it for efficient, memory-consumption-friendly snapshotting. Our approach reorganizes and compresses transactional data online and yet hardly affects the mission-critical OLTP throughput. This is achieved by unburdening the OLTP threads from all additional processing and performing these tasks asynchronously.","author":["Florian Funke","Alfons Kemper","Thomas Neumann"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 5","Issue 11","July 2012","pp   1424\u20131435","https://doi.org/10.14778/2350229.2350258"],"date":"01 July 2012","ref":[{"text":"D.

Along with these new users, important new workloads have emerged which feature many small, short, and increasingly interactive jobs in addition to the large, long-running batch jobs for which MapReduce was originally designed. As interactive, large-scale query processing is a strength of the RDBMS community, it is important that lessons from that field be carried over and applied where possible in this new domain. However, these new workloads have not yet been described in the literature. We fill this gap with an empirical analysis of MapReduce traces from six separate business-critical deployments inside Facebook and at Cloudera customers in e-commerce, telecommunications, media, and retail. Our key contribution is a characterization of new MapReduce workloads which are driven in part by interactive analysis, and which make heavy use of query-like programming frameworks on top of MapReduce. These workloads display diverse behaviors which invalidate prior assumptions about MapReduce such as uniform data access, regular diurnal patterns, and prevalence of large jobs. A secondary contribution is a first step towards creating a TPC-like data processing benchmark for MapReduce.","author":["Yanpei Chen","Sara Alspaugh","Randy Katz"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 5","Issue 12","August 2012","pp   1802\u20131813","https://doi.org/10.14778/2367502.2367519"],"date":"01 August 2012","ref":[{"text":"Apache Hive. http://hive.apache.org/.","order":1},{"text":"Apache Oozie(TM) Workflow Scheduler for Hadoop. http://incubator.apache.org/oozie/.","order":2},{"text":"Apache Pig. http://pig.apache.org/.","order":3},{"text":"Gridmix.

However, flash memory introduces new challenges, as data cannot be eciently updated in-place. To overcome the technology's limitations, SSDs incorporate a software Flash Translation Layer (FTL) that implements out-of-place updates, typically by storing data in a log-structured fashion. Despite a large number of existing FTL algorithms, SSD performance, predictability, and lifetime remain an issue, especially for the write-intensive workloads specific to database applications.In this paper, we show how to design FTLs that are more efficient by using the I/O write skew to guide data placement on flash memory. We model the relationship between data placement and write performance for basic I/O write patterns and detail the most important concepts of writing to flash memory: i) the trade-o between the extra capacity available and write overhead, ii) the benefit of adapting data placement to write skew, iii) the impact of the cleaning policy, and iv) how to estimate the best achievable write performance for a given I/O workload. Based on the findings of the theoretical model, we propose a new principled data placement algorithm that can be incorporated into existing FTLs. We show the benefits of our data placement algorithm when running micro-benchmarks and real database I/O traces: our data placement algorithm reduces write overhead by 20% - 75% when compared to state-of-art techniques.","author":["Radu Stoica","Anastasia Ailamaki"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 9","July 2013","pp   733\u2013744","https://doi.org/10.14778/2536360.2536372"],"date":"01 July 2013","ref":[{"text":"N.

One class of queries centers around node affinity, often quantified by random-walk distances between node pairs, including hitting time, commute time, and personalized PageRank (PPR). Despite the potential of these \"metrics,\" they are rarely, if ever, used in practice, largely due to extremely high computational costs.In this paper, we investigate methods to scalably and efficiently compute random-walk distances, by \"embedding\" graphs and distances into points and distances in geometric coordinate spaces. We show that while existing graph coordinate systems (GCS) can accurately estimate shortest path distances, they produce significant errors when embedding random-walk distances. Based on our observations, we propose a new graph embedding system that explicitly accounts for per-node graph properties that affect random walk. Extensive experiments on a range of graphs show that our new approach can accurately estimate both symmetric and asymmetric random-walk distances. Once a graph is embedded, our system can answer queries between any two nodes in 8 microseconds, orders of magnitude faster than existing methods. Finally, we show that our system produces estimates that can replace ground truth in applications with minimal impact on application output.","author":["Xiaohan Zhao","Adelbert Chang","Atish Das Sarma","Haitao Zheng","Ben Y.

Due to their complex schemas and variational information descriptions, it becomes very hard for users to formulate a query that can be properly processed by the existing systems. We argue that for a user-friendly graph query engine, it must support various kinds of transformations such as synonym, abbreviation, and ontology. Furthermore, the derived query results must be ranked in a principled manner.In this paper, we introduce a novel framework enabling <u>s</u>chema<u>l</u>ess and <u>s</u>tructure<u>l</u>ess graph <u>q</u>uerying (SLQ), where a user need not describe queries precisely as required by most databases. The query engine is built on a set of transformation functions that automatically map keywords and linkages from a query to their matches in a graph. It automatically learns an effective ranking model, without assuming manually labeled training examples, and can efficiently return top ranked matches using graph sketch and belief propagation. The architecture of SLQ is elastic for \"plug-in\" new transformation functions and query logs. Our experimental results show that this new graph querying paradigm is promising: It identifies high-quality matches for both keyword and graph queries over real-life knowledge graphs, and outperforms existing methods significantly in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.","author":["Shengqi Yang","Yinghui Wu","Huan Sun","Xifeng Yan"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 7","March 2014","pp   565\u2013576","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732286.2732293"],"date":"01 March 2014","ref":[{"text":"Dbpedia.","order":1},{"text":"Freebase.","order":2},{"text":"Yago2.","order":3},{"text":"A.

A possible solution to mitigate these bottlenecks is query off-loading to an intelligent storage engine, where partial or whole queries are pushed down to the storage engine. In this paper, we present Ibex, a prototype of an intelligent storage engine that supports off-loading of complex query operators. Besides increasing performance, Ibex also reduces energy consumption, as it uses an FPGA rather than conventional CPUs to implement the off-load engine. Ibex is a hybrid engine, with dedicated hardware that evaluates SQL expressions at line-rate and a software fallback for tasks that the hardware engine cannot handle. Ibex supports GROUP BY aggregation, as well as projection- and selection- based filtering. GROUP BY aggregation has a higher impact on performance but is also a more challenging operator to implement on an FPGA.","author":["Louis Woods","Zsolt Istv\u00e1n","Gustavo Alonso"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 11","July 2014","pp   963\u2013974","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732967.2732972"],"date":"01 July 2014","ref":[{"text":"A.

To gain an understanding of how Pregel-like systems perform, we conduct a study to experimentally compare Giraph, GPS, Mizan, and GraphLab on equal ground by considering graph and algorithm agnostic optimizations and by using several metrics. The systems are compared with four different algorithms (PageRank, single source shortest path, weakly connected components, and distributed minimum spanning tree) on up to 128 Amazon EC2 machines. We find that the system optimizations present in Giraph and GraphLab allow them to perform well. Our evaluation also shows Giraph 1.0.0's considerable improvement since Giraph 0.1 and identifies areas of improvement for all systems.","author":["Minyang Han","Khuzaima Daudjee","Khaled Ammar","M.

Our goal is to understand tradeoffs in accessing the data in row- or column-order and at what granularity one should share the model and data for a statistical task. We study this new tradeoff space and discover that there are tradeoffs between hardware and statistical efficiency. We argue that our tradeoff study may provide valuable information for designers of analytics engines: for each system we consider, our prototype engine can run at least one popular task at least 100\u00d7 faster.

Existing methods focus more on anomaly detection but not on repairing the detected anomalies. By simply filtering out the dirty data via anomaly detection, applications could still be unreliable over the incomplete time series. Instead of simply discarding anomalies, we propose to (iteratively) repair them in time series data, by creatively bonding the beauty of temporal nature in anomaly detection with the widely considered minimum change principle in data repairing. Our major contributions include: (1) a novel framework of iterative minimum repairing (IMR) over time series data, (2) explicit analysis on convergence of the proposed iterative minimum repairing, and (3) efficient estimation of parameters in each iteration. Remarkably, with incremental computation, we reduce the complexity of parameter estimation from O(n) to O(1). Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposal compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, we show that (the proposed) repairing indeed improves the time series classification application.","author":["Aoqian Zhang","Shaoxu Song","Jianmin Wang","Philip S.

The popularity of mobile computing and sharing economy has extended conventional web-based crowdsourcing to spatial crowdsourcing (SC), where spatial data such as location, mobility and the associated contextual information, plays a central role. In fact, spatial crowdsourcing has stimulated a series of recent industrial successes including Citizen Sensing (Waze), P2P ride-sharing (Uber) and Real-time Online-To-Offline (O2O) services (Instacart and Postmates).In this tutorial, we review the paradigm shift from web-based crowdsourcing to spatial crowdsourcing. We dive deep into the challenges and techniques brought by the unique spatio-temporal characteristics of spatial crowdsourcing. Particularly, we survey new designs in task assignment, quality control, incentive mechanism design and privacy protection on spatial crowdsourcing platforms, as well as the new trend to incorporate crowdsourcing to enhance existing spatial data processing techniques. We also discuss case studies of representative spatial crowdsourcing systems and raise open questions and current challenges for the audience to easily comprehend the tutorial and to advance this important research area.","author":["Yongxin Tong","Lei Chen","Cyrus Shahabi"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 12","August 2017","pp   1988\u20131991","https://doi.org/10.14778/3137765.3137827"],"date":"01 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Amazon's mechanical turk.","order":1},{"text":"Didi.","order":2},{"text":"Gigwalk.","order":3},{"text":"Grubhub.","order":4},{"text":"Instacart.","order":5},{"text":"odesk.","order":6},{"text":"Openstreetmap.","order":7},{"text":"Taskrabbit.","order":8},{"text":"Uber.","order":9},{"text":"Waze.","order":10},{"text":"M.

In this context, it has been recognized that to handle the complex knowledge-based scenarios encountered today, such as reasoning over large knowledge graphs, Datalog has to be extended with features such as existential quantification. Yet, Datalog-based reasoning in the presence of existential quantification is in general undecidable. Many efforts have been made to define decidable fragments. Warded Datalog+/- is a very promising one, as it captures PTIME complexity while allowing ontological reasoning. Yet so far, no implementation of Warded Datalog+/- was available. In this paper we present the Vadalog system, a Datalog-based system for performing complex logic reasoning tasks, such as those required in advanced knowledge graphs. The Vadalog system is Oxford's contribution to the VADA research programme, a joint effort of the universities of Oxford, Manchester and Edinburgh and around 20 industrial partners. As the main contribution of this paper, we illustrate the first implementation of Warded Datalog+/-, a high-performance Datalog+/- system utilizing an aggressive termination control strategy. We also provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation.","author":["Luigi Bellomarini","Emanuel Sallinger","Georg Gottlob"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 9","May 2018","pp   975\u2013987","https://doi.org/10.14778/3213880.3213888"],"date":"01 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"S.

RuDiK discovers both positive rules, which identify relationships between entities, e.g., \"if two persons have the same parent, they are siblings\", and negative rules, which identify data contradictions, e.g., \"if two persons are married, one cannot be the child of the other\". Rules help domain experts to curate data in large KBs. Positive rules suggest new facts to mitigate incompleteness and negative rules detect erroneous facts. Also, negative rules are useful to generate negative examples for learning algorithms. RuDiK goes beyond existing solutions since it discovers rules with a more expressive rule language w.r.t. previous approaches, which leads to wide coverage of the facts in the KB, and its mining is robust to existing errors and incompleteness in the KB. The system has been deployed for multiple KBs, including Yago, DBpedia, Freebase and Wiki-Data, and identifies new facts and real errors with 85% to 97% accuracy, respectively. This demonstration shows how RuDiK can be used to interact with domain experts. Once the audience pick a KB and a predicate, they will add new facts, remove errors, and train a machine learning system with automatically generated examples.","author":["Stefano Ortona","Venkata Vamsikrishna Meduri","Paolo Papotti"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 12","August 2018","pp   1946\u20131949","https://doi.org/10.14778/3229863.3236231"],"date":"01 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"X.

Both classes of existing replication algorithms, active-passive and active-active, were designed in a time when network was the dominant performance bottleneck. In essence, these techniques aim to minimize network communication between replicas at the cost of incurring more processing redundancy; a trade-off that suitably fitted the conventional wisdom of distributed database design. However, the emergence of next-generation networks with high throughput and low latency calls for revisiting these assumptions.In this paper, we first make the case that in modern RDMA-enabled networks, the bottleneck has shifted to CPUs, and therefore the existing network-optimized replication techniques are no longer optimal. We present Active-Memory Replication, a new high availability scheme that efficiently leverages RDMA to completely eliminate the processing redundancy in replication. Using Active-Memory, all replicas dedicate their processing power to executing new transactions, as opposed to performing redundant computation. Active-Memory maintains high availability and correctness in the presence of failures through an efficient RDMA-based undo-logging scheme. Our evaluation against active-passive and active-active schemes shows that Active-Memory is up to a factor of 2 faster than the second-best protocol on RDMA-based networks.","author":["Erfan Zamanian","Xiangyao Yu","Michael Stonebraker","Tim Kraska"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 12","Issue 11","July 2019","pp   1637\u20131650","https://doi.org/10.14778/3342263.3342639"],"date":"01 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"D.

With the advent of large-scale heterogeneous information networks that consist of multi-typed, interconnected objects, such as the bibliographic networks and social media networks, it is important to study similarity search in such networks. Intuitively, two objects are similar if they are linked by many paths in the network. However, most existing similarity measures are defined for homogeneous networks. Different semantic meanings behind paths are not taken into consideration. Thus they cannot be directly applied to heterogeneous networks.In this paper, we study similarity search that is defined among the same type of objects in heterogeneous networks. Moreover, by considering different linkage paths in a network, one could derive various similarity semantics. Therefore, we introduce the concept of meta path-based similarity, where a meta path is a path consisting of a sequence of relations defined between different object types (i.e., structural paths at the meta level). No matter whether a user would like to explicitly specify a path combination given sufficient domain knowledge, or choose the best path by experimental trials, or simply provide training examples to learn it, meta path forms a common base for a network-based similarity search engine. In particular, under the meta path framework we define a novel similarity measure called PathSim that is able to find peer objects in the network (e.g., find authors in the similar field and with similar reputation), which turns out to be more meaningful in many scenarios compared with random-walk based similarity measures. In order to support fast online query processing for PathSim queries, we develop an efficient solution that partially materializes short meta paths and then concatenates them online to compute top-k results. Experiments on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed paradigm.","author":["Yizhou Sun","Jiawei Han","Xifeng Yan","Philip S.

This figure makes segmentation accuracy depend significantly on the quality of the dictionary used for analysis. If the dictionary is not sufficiently good, it will lead to a great number of unknown or unrecognized words. These unrecognized words certainly reduce segmentation accuracy. To solve such problem, we propose a method based on decision tree models. Without use of a dictionary, specific information, called syntactic attribute, is applied to identify the structure of Thai words. C4.5 is used as a tool for this purpose. Using a Thai corpus, experiment results show that our method outperforms some well-known dictionary-dependent techniques, maximum and longest matching methods, in case of no dictionary.","author":["Thanaruk Theeramunkong","Sasiporn Usanavasin"],"issue":["HLT '01: Proceedings of the first international conference on Human language technology research","March 2001","Pages   1\u20135","https://doi.org/10.3115/1072133.1072209"],"date":"18 March 2001","ref":[{"text":"Kasioka, H., Eubank, S.

This includes the acoustic/phonetic characteristics of the speech they produce as well as their willingness and ability to constrain their input to the device according to instructions. Since speech recognition devices often do not perform as well in the field as they do in the laboratory, analyses of real user behavior have been undertaken. The results of several field trials suggest that real user compliance with instructions is dramatically affected by the particular details of the prompts supplied to the user. A significant amount of real user speech data has been collected during these trials (34,000 utterances, 29 hours of data). These speech databases are described along with the results of an experiment comparing the performance of a speech recognition system on real user vs. laboratory speech.","author":["Judith Spitz"],"issue":["HLT '91: Proceedings of the workshop on Speech and Natural Language","February 1991","Pages   164\u2013169","https://doi.org/10.3115/112405.112430"],"date":"19 February 1991","ref":[{"text":"Yashchin, D., Basson, S., Lauritzen, N., Levas, S., Loring, A., Rubin-Spitz, J.

Using cross-validation methods we achieved an F-score of 0.73 and we examine the contribution made by each part of the interpolation model to overcoming data sparseness.","author":["Nigel Collier","Chikashi Nobata","Jun-ichi Tsujii"],"issue":["COLING '00: Proceedings of the 18th conference on Computational linguistics - Volume 1","July 2000","Pages   201\u2013207","https://doi.org/10.3115/990820.990850"],"date":"31 July 2000","ref":[{"text":"A.

We study the effects of dynamic adjectives, semantically oriented adjectives, and gradable adjectives on a simple subjectivity classifier, and establish that they are strong predictors of subjectivity. A novel trainable method that statistically combines two indicators of gradability is presented and evaluated, complementing existing automatic techniques for assigning orientation labels.","author":["Vasileios Hatzivassiloglou","Janyce M.
