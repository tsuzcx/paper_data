Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for \"border matting\" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools.","author":["Carsten Rother","Vladimir Kolmogorov","Andrew Blake"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 23","Issue 3","August 2004","pp   309\u2013314","https://doi.org/10.1145/1015706.1015720"],"date":"01 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORP. 2002.

Global illumination techniques do not lend themselves easily to flexibility, ease of use, or speed, and have remained out of reach thus far for the vast majority of images generated in this context. This paper describes the implementation and integration of indirect illumination within a feature animation production renderer. For efficiency reasons, we choose to partially solve the rendering equation. We explain how this compromise allows us to speed-up final gathering calculations and reduce noise. We describe an efficient ray tracing strategy and its integration with a micro-polygon based scan line renderer supporting displacement mapping and programmable shaders. We combine a modified irradiance gradient caching technique with an approximate lighting model that enhances caching coherence and provides good scalability to render complex scenes into high-resolution images suitable for film. We describe the tools that are made available to the artists to control indirect lighting in final renders. We show that our approach provides an efficient solution, easy to art direct, that allows animators to enhance considerably the quality of images generated for a large category of production work.","author":["Eric Tabellion","Arnauld Lamorlette"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 23","Issue 3","August 2004","pp   469\u2013476","https://doi.org/10.1145/1015706.1015748"],"date":"01 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"APODACA, T., QUARONI, G., BREDOW, R., GOLDMAN, D., LANDIS, H., GRITZ, L., AND PHARR, M.

This is rather surprising, because floating-point is ubiquitous in computer systems: Almost every language has a floating-point datatype; computers from PCs to supercomputers have floating-point accelerators; most compilers will be called upon to compile floating-point algorithms from time to time; and virtually every operating system must respond to floating-point exceptions such as overflow. This paper presents a tutorial on the aspects of floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems. It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding error, continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating point standard, and concludes with examples of how computer system builders can better support floating point.","author":["David Goldberg"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 23","Issue 1","March 1991","pp   5\u201348","https://doi.org/10.1145/103162.103163"],"date":"01 March 1991","ref":[{"text":"AHO, A.

This article examines the problem of disk scheduling in a multimedia I/O system. In a multimedia server, the disk requests may have constant data rate requirements and need guaranteed service. We propose a new scheduling algorithm, SCAN-EDF, that combines the features of SCAN type of seek optimizing algorithm with an Earliest Deadline First (EDF) type of real-time scheduling algorithm. We compare SCAN-EDF with other scheduling strategies and show that SCAN-EDF combines the best features of both SCAN and EDF. We also investigate the impact of buffer space on the maximum number of video streams that can be supported.We show that by making the deadlines larger than the request periods, a larger number of streams can be supported.We also describe how we extended the SCAN-EDF algorithm in the PRISM multimedia architecture. PRISM is an integrated multimedia server, designed to satisfy the QOS requirements of multiple classes of requests. Our experience in implementing the extended SCAN-EDF algorithm in a generic operating system is discussed and performance metrics and results are presented to illustrate how the SCAN-EDF extensions and implementation strategies have succeeded in meeting the QOS requirements of different classes of requests.","author":["A.

Current disk caching and RAM file systems either impose high overhead to access memory content or fail to provide mechanisms to achieve data persistence across reboots.The Conquest file system is based on the observation that memory is becoming inexpensive, which enables all file system services to be delivered from memory, except for providing large storage capacity. Unlike caching, Conquest uses memory with battery backup as persistent storage, and provides specialized and separate data paths to memory and disk. Therefore, the memory data path contains no disk-related complexity. The disk data path consists of optimizations only for the specialized disk usage pattern.Compared to a memory-based file system, Conquest incurs little performance overhead. Compared to several disk-based file systems, Conquest achieves 1.3x to 19x faster memory performance, and 1.4x to 2.0x faster performance when exercising both memory and disk.Conquest realizes most of the benefits of persistent RAM at a fraction of the cost of a RAM-only solution. It also demonstrates that disk-related optimizations impose high overheads for accessing memory content in a memory-rich environment.","author":["An-I Andy Wang","Geoff Kuenning","Peter Reiher","Gerald Popek"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 2","Issue 3","August 2006","pp   309\u2013348","https://doi.org/10.1145/1168910.1168914"],"date":"01 August 2006","ref":[{"text":"APC. 2005.

By providing native kernel support for FPGA hardware, BORPH offers a homogeneous UNIX interface for both software and hardware processes. Hardware processes inherit the same level of service from the kernel, such as file system support, as typical UNIX software processes. Hardware and software components of a design therefore run as hardware and software processes within BORPH's run-time environment. The familiar and language independent UNIX kernel interface facilitates easy design reuse and rapid application development. Performance of our current implementation and our experience with developing a real-time wireless digital signal processing system based on BORPH will be presented.","author":["Hayden Kwok-Hay So","Artem Tkachenko","Robert Brodersen"],"issue":["CODES+ISSS '06: Proceedings of the 4th international conference on Hardware/software codesign and system synthesis","October 2006","Pages   259\u2013264","https://doi.org/10.1145/1176254.1176316"],"date":"22 October 2006","ref":[{"text":"http://www.cray.com/products/xd1/.","order":1},{"text":"http://www.mathworks.com/.","order":2},{"text":"http://www.xilinx.com.","order":3},{"text":"F.

Unfortunately, wayward writes from buggy software and random bit flips may result in an unreliable persistent store. We introduce two orthogonal and complementary approaches to reliably storing file system structures in NVRAM. First, we reinforce hardware and operating system memory consistency by employing page-level write protection and error correcting codes. Second, we perform on-line consistency checking of the filesystem structures by replaying logged file system transactions on copied data structures; a structure is consistent if the replayed copy matches its live counterpart. Our experiments show that the protection mechanisms can increase fault tolerance by six orders of magnitude while incurring an acceptable amount of overhead on writes to NVRAM. Since NVRAM is much faster and consumes far less power than disk-based storage, the added overhead of error checking leaves an NVRAM-based system both faster and more reliable than a disk-based system. Additionally, our techniques can be implemented on systems lacking hardware support for memory management, allowing them to be used on lowend and embedded systems without an MMU.","author":["Kevin M.

However, as the number of components on a single chip and their performance continue to increase, a shift from computation-based to communication-based design becomes mandatory. As a result, the communication architecture plays a major role in the area, performance, and energy consumption of the overall system. This article presents a comprehensive evaluation of three on-chip communication architectures targeting multimedia applications. Specifically, we compare and contrast the network-on-chip (NoC) with point-to-point (P2P) and bus-based communication architectures in terms of area, performance, and energy consumption. As the main contribution, we present complete P2P, bus-, and NoC-based implementations of a real multimedia application (i. e. the MPEG-2 encoder), and provide direct measurements using an FPGA prototype and actual video clips, rather than simulation and synthetic workloads. We also support the experimental findings through a theoretical analysis. Both experimental and analysis results show that the NoC architecture scales very well in terms of area, performance, energy, and design effort, while the P2P and bus-based architectures scale poorly on all accounts except for performance and area, respectively.","author":["Hyung Gyu Lee","Naehyuck Chang","Umit Y.

This article shows that the standard hash join algorithm for disk-oriented databases (i.e. GRACE) spends over 80% of its user time stalled on CPU cache misses, and explores the use of CPU cache prefetching to improve its cache performance. Applying prefetching to hash joins is complicated by the data dependencies, multiple code paths, and inherent randomness of hashing. We present two techniques, group prefetching and software-pipelined prefetching, that overcome these complications. These schemes achieve 1.29--4.04X speedups for the join phase and 1.37--3.49X speedups for the partition phase over GRACE and simple prefetching approaches. Moreover, compared with previous cache-aware approaches (i.e. cache partitioning), the schemes are at least 36% faster on large relations and do not require exclusive use of the CPU cache to be effective. Finally, comparing the elapsed real times when disk I/Os are in the picture, our cache prefetching schemes achieve 1.12--1.84X speedups for the join phase and 1.06--1.60X speedups for the partition phase over the GRACE hash join algorithm.","author":["Shimin Chen","Anastassia Ailamaki","Phillip B.

A Dryad application combines computational \"vertices\" with communication \"channels\" to form a dataflow graph. Dryad runs the application by executing the vertices of this graph on a set of available computers, communicating as appropriate through flies, TCP pipes, and shared-memory FIFOs.The vertices provided by the application developer are quite simple and are usually written as sequential programs with no thread creation or locking. Concurrency arises from Dryad scheduling vertices to run simultaneously on multiple computers, or on multiple CPU cores within a computer. The application can discover the size and placement of data at run time, and modify the graph as the computation progresses to make efficient use of the available resources.Dryad is designed to scale from powerful multi-core single computers, through small clusters of computers, to data centers with thousands of computers. The Dryad execution engine handles all the difficult problems of creating a large distributed, concurrent application: scheduling the use of computers and their CPUs, recovering from communication or computer failures, and transporting data between vertices.","author":["Michael Isard","Mihai Budiu","Yuan Yu","Andrew Birrell","Dennis Fetterly"],"issue":["ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","Volume 41","Issue 3","June 2007","pp   59\u201372","https://doi.org/10.1145/1272998.1273005"],"date":"21 March 2007","ref":[{"text":"Global grid forum. http://www.gridforum.org/.","order":1},{"text":"Intel IXP2XXX product line of network processors. http://www.intel.com/design/network/products/npfamily/ixp2xxx.htm.","order":2},{"text":"Intel platform 2015. http://www.Intel.com/technology/architecture/platform2015/.","order":3},{"text":"The LINQ project. http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/future/linq/.","order":4},{"text":"Open MPI. http://www.open-mpi.org/.","order":5},{"text":"SQL Server Integration Services. http://www.microsoft.com/sq1/technologies/integration/default.mspx.","order":6},{"text":"Thomas E.

The cost ofbuilding datacenter facilities capable of delivering a given power capacity tosuch a computer can rival the recurring energy consumption costs themselves.Therefore, there are strong economic incentives to operate facilities as closeas possible to maximum capacity, so that the non-recurring facility costs canbe best amortized. That is difficult to achieve in practice because ofuncertainties in equipment power ratings and because power consumption tends tovary significantly with the actual computing activity. Effective powerprovisioning strategies are needed to determine how much computing equipmentcan be safely and efficiently hosted within a given power budget.In this paper we present the aggregate power usage characteristics of largecollections of servers (up to 15 thousand) for different classes ofapplications over a period of approximately six months. Those observationsallow us to evaluate opportunities for maximizing the use of the deployed powercapacity of datacenters, and assess the risks of over-subscribing it. We findthat even in well-tuned applications there is a noticeable gap (7 - 16%)between achieved and theoretical aggregate peak power usage at the clusterlevel (thousands of servers). The gap grows to almost 40% in wholedatacenters. This headroom can be used to deploy additional compute equipmentwithin the same power budget with minimal risk of exceeding it. We use ourmodeling framework to estimate the potential of power management schemes toreduce peak power and energy usage. We find that the opportunities for powerand energy savings are significant, but greater at the cluster-level (thousandsof servers) than at the rack-level (tens). Finally we argue that systems needto be power efficient across the activity range, and not only at peakperformance levels.","author":["Xiaobo Fan","Wolf-Dietrich Weber","Luiz Andre Barroso"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 35","Issue 2","May 2007","pp   13\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/1273440.1250665"],"date":"09 June 2007","ref":[{"text":"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Many algorithms find clusters by maximizing the number of intra-cluster edges. While such algorithms find useful and interesting structures, they tend to fail to identify and isolate two kinds of vertices that play special roles - vertices that bridge clusters (hubs) and vertices that are marginally connected to clusters (outliers). Identifying hubs is useful for applications such as viral marketing and epidemiology since hubs are responsible for spreading ideas or disease. In contrast, outliers have little or no influence, and may be isolated as noise in the data. In this paper, we proposed a novel algorithm called SCAN (Structural Clustering Algorithm for Networks), which detects clusters, hubs and outliers in networks. It clusters vertices based on a structural similarity measure. The algorithm is fast and efficient, visiting each vertex only once. An empirical evaluation of the method using both synthetic and real datasets demonstrates superior performance over other methods such as the modularity-based algorithms.","author":["Xiaowei Xu","Nurcan Yuruk","Zhidan Feng","Thomas A.

The presentation will cover the fundamentals of ray tracing and photon mapping including efficient techniques and data-structures for managing large numbers of rays and photons. In addition, we will describe how to integrate the information from the photon maps in shading algorithms to render global illumination effects such as caustics, color bleeding, participating media, subsurface scattering, and motion blur.

Current discovery solutions were developed in the context of automatic service composition. Thus, the \u201cclient\u201d of the discovery procedure is an automated computer program rather than a human, with little, if any, tolerance to inexact results. However, in the real world, services which might be semantically distanced from each other are glued together using manual coding. In this article, we propose a new retrieval model for semantic Web services, with the objective of simplifying service discovery for human users. The model relies on simple and extensible keyword-based query language and enables efficient retrieval of approximate results, including approximate service compositions. Since representing all possible compositions and all approximate concept references can result in an exponentially-sized index, we investigate clustering methods to provide a scalable mechanism for service indexing. Results of experiments, designed to evaluate our indexing and query methods, show that satisfactory approximate search is feasible with efficient processing time.","author":["Eran Toch","Avigdor Gal","Iris Reinhartz-Berger","Dov Dori"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Internet Technology","Volume 8","Issue 1","November 2007","pp   2\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.1145/1294148.1294150"],"date":"01 November 2007","ref":[{"text":"Ankolekar, A., Martin, D.

Many different effective smoothing methods have been proposed, which mostly implement various heuristics to exploit corpus structures. In this paper, we propose a general and unified optimization framework for smoothing language models on graph structures. This framework not only provides a unified formulation of the existing smoothing heuristics, but also serves as a road map for systematically exploring smoothing methods for language models. We follow this road map and derive several different instantiations of the framework. Some of the instantiations lead to novel smoothing methods. Empirical results show that all such instantiations are effective with some outperforming the state of the art smoothing methods.","author":["Qiaozhu Mei","Duo Zhang","ChengXiang Zhai"],"issue":["SIGIR '08: Proceedings of the 31st annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval","July 2008","Pages   611\u2013618","https://doi.org/10.1145/1390334.1390438"],"date":"20 July 2008","ref":[{"text":"M.

We extend the tensor structure for describing linear transform algorithms, adding the ability to explicitly characterize two important dimensions of datapath architecture. This representation allows both algorithm and datapath to be specified within a single formula and gives the designer the ability to easily consider a wide space of possible datapaths at a high level of abstraction. We have constructed a formula manipulation system based on this representation and have written a compiler that can translate a formula into a hardware implementation. This enables an automatic \"push button\" compilation flow that produces a register transfer level hardware description from high-level datapath directives and an algorithm (written as a formula). In our experimental results, we demonstrate that this approach yields efficient designs over a large tradeoff space.","author":["Peter A. Milder","Franz Franchetti","James C.

ZigZag's core contribution is a new form of interference cancellation that exploits asynchrony across successive collisions. Specifically, 802.11 retransmissions, in the case of hidden terminals, cause successive collisions. These collisions have different interference-free stretches at their start, which ZigZag exploits to bootstrap its decoding.ZigZag makes no changes to the 802.11 MAC and introduces no overhead when there are no collisions. But, when senders collide, ZigZag attains the same throughput as if the colliding packets were a priori scheduled in separate time slots. We build a prototype of ZigZag in GNU Radio. In a testbed of 14 USRP nodes, ZigZag reduces the average packet loss rate at hidden terminals from 72.6% to about 0.7%.","author":["Shyamnath Gollakota","Dina Katabi"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 38","Issue 4","October 2008","pp   159\u2013170","https://doi.org/10.1145/1402946.1402977"],"date":"17 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"Broadcom Wireless LAN Adapter User Guide.","order":1},{"text":"Reference Manual for the NETGEAR ProSafe 802.11g Wireless AP WG102.","order":2},{"text":"ISL3873: Wireless LAN Integrated Medium Access Controller with Baseband Processor, 2000.","order":3},{"text":"J.

For such resource-constrained devices, data transmission is a very energy-consuming operation. To maximize WSN lifetime, it is essential to minimize the number of bits sent and received by each device. One natural approach is to aggregate sensor data along the path from sensors to the sink. Aggregation is especially challenging if end-to-end privacy between sensors and the sink (or aggregate integrity) is required. In this article, we propose a simple and provably secure encryption scheme that allows efficient additive aggregation of encrypted data. Only one modular addition is necessary for ciphertext aggregation. The security of the scheme is based on the indistinguishability property of a pseudorandom function (PRF), a standard cryptographic primitive. We show that aggregation based on this scheme can be used to efficiently compute statistical values, such as mean, variance, and standard deviation of sensed data, while achieving significant bandwidth savings. To protect the integrity of the aggregated data, we construct an end-to-end aggregate authentication scheme that is secure against outsider-only attacks, also based on the indistinguishability property of PRFs.","author":["Claude Castelluccia","Aldar C-F.

Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.","author":["Varun Chandola","Arindam Banerjee","Vipin Kumar"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 41","Issue 3","July 2009","Article No.: 15","pp   1\u201358","https://doi.org/10.1145/1541880.1541882"],"date":"30 July 2009","ref":[{"text":"Abe, N., Zadrozny, B., and Langford, J. 2006.

According to Amdhal's law, the performance enhancement possible with a given improvement is limited by the amount that the improved feature is used. This implies that the performance enhancement of an OLTP system would be seriously limited without a considerable improvement in I/O throughput. Since the market debut of flash memory SSD a few years ago, we have made a continued effort to overcome its poor random write performance and to provide stable and sufficient I/O bandwidth. In this paper, we present three different flash memory SSD models prototyped recently by Samsung Electronics. We then show how the flash memory SSD technology has advanced to reverse the widening trend of performance gap between processors and storage devices. We also demonstrate that even a single flash memory drive can outperform a level-0 RAID with eight enterprise class 15k-RPM disk drives with respect to transaction throughput, cost effectiveness and energy consumption.","author":["Sang-Won Lee","Bongki Moon","Chanik Park"],"issue":["SIGMOD '09: Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data","June 2009","Pages   863\u2013870","https://doi.org/10.1145/1559845.1559937"],"date":"29 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"Amir Ban and Ramat Hasharon.

The mix of fast CPU cores and fine-grained reconfigurable logic allows to map both sequential, control-dominated code and highly parallel data-centric computations onto one platform. However, traditional design techniques that view specialized hardware circuits as passive coprocessors are ill-suited for programming these reconfigurable computers. In particular, the programming models for software\u2014running on an embedded operating system\u2014and digital hardware\u2014synthesized to an FPGA\u2014lack commonalities, which hinders design space exploration and severely impairs the potential for code reuse.In this article, we present ReconOS, an execution environment based on existing embedded operating systems that extends the multithreaded programming model established in the software domain to reconfigurable hardware. Using threads and common synchronization and communication services as an abstraction layer, ReconOS allows for the creation of portable and flexible multithreaded applications targeting CPU/FPGA systems.

The integration of MRAM in FPGA instead of SRAM is one of the most promising solutions to overcome this issue, because its nonvolatility and high write/read speed allow to power down completely the logic blocks in \u201cidle\u201d states in the FPGA circuit. MRAM-based FPGA promises as well as some advanced reconfiguration methods such as runtime reconfiguration and multicontext configuration. However, the conventional MRAM technology based on field-induced magnetic switching (FIMS) writing approach consumes very high power, large circuit surface and produces high disturbance between memory cells. These drawbacks prevent FIMS-MRAM's further development in memory and logic circuit. Spin transfer torque (STT)-based MRAM is then evaluated to address these issues, some design techniques and novel computing architecture for FPGA logic circuits based on STT-MRAM technology are presented in this article. By using STMicroelectronics CMOS 90nm technology and a STT-MTJ spice model, some chip characteristic results as the programming latency and power have been calculated and simulated to demonstrate the expected performance of STT-MRAM based FPGA logic circuits.","author":["Weisheng Zhao","Eric Belhaire","Claude Chappert","Pascale Mazoyer"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 9","Issue 2","October 2009","Article No.: 14","pp   1\u201316","https://doi.org/10.1145/1596543.1596548"],"date":"29 October 2009","ref":[{"text":"ACTEL. 2007.

We show that these sequences are essentially equivalent to linear congruential sequences with very large prime moduli. So, the AWC/SWB generators can be viewed as efficient ways of implementing such large linear congruential generators. As a consequence, the theoretical properties of such generators can be studied in the same way as for linear congruential generators, namely, via the spectral and lattice tests. We also show how the equivalence can be exploited to implement efficient jumping-ahead facilities for the AWC and SWB sequences. Our numerical examples illustrate the fact that AWC/SWB generators have extremely bad lattice structure in high dimensions.","author":["Shu Tezuka","Pierre L'Ecuyer","Raymond Couture"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation","Volume 3","Issue 4","Oct. 1993","pp   315\u2013331","https://doi.org/10.1145/159737.159749"],"date":"01 October 1993","ref":[{"text":"C()UTURE, R , AND L'EcuYER, P 1993.

ClearView works on stripped Windows x86 binaries without any need for source code, debugging information, or other external information, and without human intervention. ClearView (1) observes normal executions to learn invariants thatcharacterize the application's normal behavior, (2) uses error detectors to distinguish normal executions from erroneous executions, (3) identifies violations of learned invariants that occur during erroneous executions, (4) generates candidate repair patches that enforce selected invariants by changing the state or flow of control to make the invariant true, and (5) observes the continued execution of patched applications to select the most successful patch. ClearView is designed to correct errors in software with high availability requirements. Aspects of ClearView that make it particularly appropriate for this context include its ability to generate patches without human intervention, apply and remove patchesto and from running applications without requiring restarts or otherwise perturbing the execution, and identify and discard ineffective or damaging patches by evaluating the continued behavior of patched applications. ClearView was evaluated in a Red Team exercise designed to test its ability to successfully survive attacks that exploit security vulnerabilities. A hostile external Red Team developed ten code injection exploits and used these exploits to repeatedly attack an application protected by ClearView. ClearView detected and blocked all of the attacks. For seven of the ten exploits, ClearView automatically generated patches that corrected the error, enabling the application to survive the attacks and continue on to successfully process subsequent inputs. Finally, the Red Team attempted to make Clear-View apply an undesirable patch, but ClearView's patch evaluation mechanism enabled ClearView to identify and discard both ineffective patches and damaging patches.","author":["Jeff H.

The purpose of this article is to describe some of these challenges and to present some solutions that would guide current and future practitioners in the field of Arabic natural language processing (ANLP). We begin with general features of the Arabic language in Sections 1, 2, and 3 and then we move to more specific properties of the language in the rest of the article. In Section 1 of this article we highlight the significance of the Arabic language today and describe its general properties. Section 2 presents the feature of Arabic Diglossia showing how the sociolinguistic aspects of the Arabic language differ from other languages. The stability of Arabic Diglossia and its implications for ANLP applications are discussed and ways to deal with this problematic property are proposed. Section 3 deals with the properties of the Arabic script and the explosion of ambiguity that results from the absence of short vowel representations and overt case markers in contemporary Arabic texts. We present in Section 4 specific features of the Arabic language such as the nonconcatenative property of Arabic morphology, Arabic as an agglutinative language, Arabic as a pro-drop language, and the challenge these properties pose to ANLP. We also present solutions that have already been adopted by some pioneering researchers in the field. In Section 5 we point out to the lack of formal and explicit grammars of Modern Standard Arabic which impedes the progress of more advanced ANLP systems. In Section 6 we draw our conclusion.","author":["Ali Farghaly","Khaled Shaalan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing","Volume 8","Issue 4","December 2009","Article No.: 14","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/1644879.1644881"],"date":"01 December 2009","ref":[{"text":"Abdel Monem, A., Shaalan, K., Rafea, A., and Baraka, H. 2009.","doi":"10.1007/s10590-009-9054-9","order":1},{"text":"Almas, Y. and Ahmed, K. 2007.

Past work has considered using 3D-stacked DRAM as a large last-level cache (LLC). While significant performance benefits can be gained with such an approach, there remain additional opportunities beyond the simple integration of commodity DRAM chips. In this work, we leverage the hardware organization typical of DRAM architectures to propose new cache management policies that would otherwise not be practical for standard SRAM-based caches. We propose a cache where each set is organized as multiple logical FIFO or queue structures that simultaneously provide performance isolation between threads as well as reduce the number of entries occupied by dead lines. Our results show that beyond the simplistic approach of stacking DRAM as cache, such tightly-integrated 3D architectures enable new opportunities for optimizing and improving system performance.","author":["Gabriel H.

The garbage collector cooperates with a transaction manager to provide safe and efficient transactional storage management. Clients read and write the heap in primary memory and can commit or abort their write operations. When write operations are committed they are preserved in stable storage and survive system failures. Clients can freely access the heap during garbage collection because the collector concurrently builds a compact replica of the heap. A log captures client write operations and is used to support both the transaction manager and the replicating garbage collector.Our implementation is the first to provide concurrent and compacting garbage collection of a persistent heap. Measurements show that concurrent replicating collection produces significantly shorter pause times than stop-and-copy collection. For small transactions, throughput is limited by the logging bandwidth of the underlying log manager. The results suggest that replicating garbage collection offers a flexible and efficient way to provide automatic storage management in transaction systems, object-oriented databases and persistent programming environments.","author":["James O'Toole","Scott Nettles","David Gifford"],"issue":["SOSP '93: Proceedings of the fourteenth ACM symposium on Operating systems principles","January 1994","Pages   161\u2013174","https://doi.org/10.1145/168619.168632"],"date":"01 December 1993","ref":[{"text":"Guy T.

However, one of the major challenges of STT-RAM is its high write current, which is disadvantageous when used as an on-chip cache since the dynamic power generated is too high. In this paper, we propose Early Write Termination (EWT), a novel technique to significantly reduce write energy with no performance penalty. EWT can be implemented with low complexity and low energy overhead. Our evaluation shows that up to 80% of write energy reduction can be achieved through EWT, resulting 33% less total energy consumption, and 34% reduction in ED2. These results indicate that EWT is an effective and practical scheme to improve the energy efficiency of a STT-RAM cache.","author":["Ping Zhou","Bo Zhao","Jun Yang","Youtao Zhang"],"issue":["ICCAD '09: Proceedings of the 2009 International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2009","Pages   264\u2013268","https://doi.org/10.1145/1687399.1687448"],"date":"02 November 2009","ref":[{"text":"Y.

Cassandra aims to run on top of an infrastructure of hundreds of nodes (possibly spread across different data centers). At this scale, small and large components fail continuously. The way Cassandra manages the persistent state in the face of these failures drives the reliability and scalability of the software systems relying on this service. While in many ways Cassandra resembles a database and shares many design and implementation strategies therewith, Cassandra does not support a full relational data model; instead, it provides clients with a simple data model that supports dynamic control over data layout and format.

This paper deals with a challenging problem related to the design of DMFB. Specifically the design problem considered is related to high performance droplet routing, where each droplet has single source location and single target location. The objectives are (i) minimizing the number of electrodes used in the DMFB, and (ii) minimizing the total routing time of all the droplets or arrival time of a droplet that is the last to arrive at its target(latest arrival time). We propose a simple algorithm for concurrent path allocation to multiple droplets, based on the Soukup's routing algorithm [22], together with the use of stalling, and possible detouring of droplets in cases of contentions. Selection of the droplets is based on their respective source to target Manhattan paths. The empirical results are quite encouraging.","author":["Pranab Roy","Hafizur Rahaman","Parthasarathi Dasgupta"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '10: Proceedings of the 20th symposium on Great lakes symposium on VLSI","May 2010","Pages   441\u2013446","https://doi.org/10.1145/1785481.1785583"],"date":"16 May 2010","ref":[{"text":"Boahringer.

A video encoder, for example, can often encode frames more quickly if it is given the freedom to produce slightly lower quality video. A developer attempting to optimize such computations must navigate a complex trade-off space to find optimizations that appropriately balance quality of service and performance. We present a new quality of service profiler that is designed to help developers identify promising optimization opportunities in such computations. In contrast to standard profilers, which simply identify time-consuming parts of the computation, a quality of service profiler is designed to identify subcomputations that can be replaced with new (and potentially less accurate) subcomputations that deliver significantly increased performance in return for acceptably small quality of service losses. Our quality of service profiler uses loop perforation (which transforms loops to perform fewer iterations than the original loop) to obtain implementations that occupy different points in the performance/quality of service trade-off space. The rationale is that optimizable computations often contain loops that perform extra iterations, and that removing iterations, then observing the resulting effect on the quality of service, is an effective way to identify such optimizable subcomputations. Our experimental results from applying our implemented quality of service profiler to a challenging set of benchmark applications show that it can enable developers to identify promising optimization opportunities and deliver successful optimizations that substantially increase the performance with only small quality of service losses.","author":["Sasa Misailovic","Stelios Sidiroglou","Henry Hoffmann","Martin Rinard"],"issue":["ICSE '10: Proceedings of the 32nd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering - Volume 1","May 2010","Pages   25\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/1806799.1806808"],"date":"01 May 2010","ref":[{"text":"prof.

Different from LRU-related caching or buffering studies, we are interested in prediction-based prefetching based on given execution traces of application executions. An implementation strategy is proposed for the storage of the prefetching information with limited SRAM and run-time overheads. An efficient prediction procedure is presented based on information extracted from application executions to reduce the performance gap between NAND flash memory and NOR flash memory in reads. With the behavior of a target application extracted from a set of collected traces, we show that data access to NOR flash memory can respond effectively over the proposed implementation.","author":["Yuan-Hao Chang","Jian-Hong Lin","Jen-Wei Hsieh","Tei-Wei Kuo"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 6","Issue 2","July 2010","Article No.: 5","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/1807060.1807062"],"date":"30 July 2010","ref":[{"text":"Chang, L.-P. and Kuo, T.-W. 2002.

Our study consists of two parts.First, we describe several carefully hand-tuned SpMV implementations for GPUs, identifying key GPU-specific performance limitations, enhancements, and tuning opportunities. These implementations, which include variants on classical blocked compressed sparse row (BCSR) and blocked ELLPACK (BELLPACK) storage formats, match or exceed state-of-the-art implementations. For instance, our best BELLPACK implementation achieves up to 29.0 Gflop/s in single-precision and 15.7 Gflop/s in double-precision on the NVIDIA T10P multiprocessor (C1060), enhancing prior state-of-the-art unblocked implementations (Bell and Garland, 2009) by up to 1.8\u00d7 and 1.5\u00d7 for single-and double-precision respectively.However, achieving this level of performance requires input matrix-dependent parameter tuning. Thus, in the second part of this study, we develop a performance model that can guide tuning. Like prior autotuning models for CPUs (e.g., Im, Yelick, and Vuduc, 2004), this model requires offline measurements and run-time estimation, but more directly models the structure of multithreaded vector processors like GPUs. We show that our model can identify the implementations that achieve within 15% of those found through exhaustive search.","author":["Jee W. Choi","Amik Singh","Richard W.

This trend to utilize multiple MC's will likely continue and a core or socket will consequently need to route memory requests to the appropriate MC via an inter- or intra-socket interconnect fabric similar to AMD's HyperTransport(TM), or Intel's Quick-Path Interconnect(TM). Such systems are therefore subject to non-uniform memory access (NUMA) latencies because of the time spent traveling to remote MCs. Each MC will act as the gateway to a particular piece of the physical memory. Data placement will therefore become increasingly critical in minimizing memory access latencies. To date, no prior work has examined the effects of data placement among multiple MCs in such systems. Future chip-multiprocessors are likely to comprise multiple MCs and an even larger number of cores. This trend will increase the memory access latency variation in these systems. Proper allocation of workload data to the appropriate MC will be important in reducing the latency of memory service requests. The allocation strategy will need to be aware of queuing delays, on-chip latencies, and row-buffer hit-rates for each MC. In this paper, we propose dynamic mechanisms that take these factors into account when placing data in appropriate slices of the physical memory. We introduce adaptive first-touch page-placement, and dynamic page-migration mechanisms to reduce DRAM access delays for multi-MC systems. These policies yield average performance improvements of 17% for adaptive first-touch page-placement, and 35% for a dynamic page-migration policy.","author":["Manu Awasthi","David W.

In its almost forty years of existence, this theory has been empirically supported exclusively through small-scale or controlled laboratory studies. Here we address this phenomenon in the context of Twitter conversations. Undoubtedly, this setting is unlike any other in which accommodation was observed and, thus, challenging to the theory. Its novelty comes not only from its size, but also from the non real-time nature of conversations, from the 140 character length restriction, from the wide variety of social relation types, and from a design that was initially not geared towards conversation at all. Given such constraints, it is not clear a priori whether accommodation is robust enough to occur given the constraints of this new environment. To investigate this, we develop a probabilistic framework that can model accommodation and measure its effects. We apply it to a large Twitter conversational dataset specifically developed for this task. This is the first time the hypothesis of linguistic style accommodation has been examined (and verified) in a large scale, real world setting. Furthermore, when investigating concepts such as stylistic influence and symmetry of accommodation, we discover a complexity of the phenomenon which was never observed before. We also explore the potential relation between stylistic influence and network features commonly associated with social status.","author":["Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil","Michael Gamon","Susan Dumais"],"issue":["WWW '11: Proceedings of the 20th international conference on World wide web","March 2011","Pages   745\u2013754","https://doi.org/10.1145/1963405.1963509"],"date":"28 March 2011","ref":[{"text":"S.

Such dynamic reconfiguration requires two important features: fast reconfiguration and numerous reconfiguration contexts. However, fast reconfiguration and numerous reconfiguration contexts share a trade-off relation on current VLSIs. Therefore, Optically Reconfigurable Gate Arrays (ORGAs) have been developed to resolve this dilemma. An ORGA architecture allows many configuration contexts by exploiting the large storage capacity of a holographic memory and fast reconfiguration using wide-bandwidth optical connections between a holographic memory and a programmable gate array VLSI. In addition, Dynamic Optically Reconfigurable Gate Arrays (DORGAs) using a photodiode memory architecture have already been developed to realize a high-gate-density VLSI. Therefore, this article presents the first demonstration of a nanosecond-order configuration of a nine-context DORGA architecture. Moreover, this article presents a proposal of a reconfiguration period adjustment technique to control each reconfiguration period to its best setting.","author":["Mao Nakajima","Minoru Watanabe"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 4","Issue 2","May 2011","Article No.: 15","pp   1\u201321","https://doi.org/10.1145/1968502.1968506"],"date":"01 May 2011","ref":[{"text":". 2011.

The interface between calling components of higher system layers and the buffer manager is described; the principal differences between virtual memory paging and database buffer management are outlined; the notion of referencing versus addressing of database pages is introduced; and the concept of fixing pages in the buffer to prevent uncontrolled replacement is explained.Three basic tasks have to be performed by the buffer manager: buffer search, allocation of frames to concurrent transactions, and page replacement. For each of these tasks, implementation alternatives are discussed and illustrated by examples from a performance evaluation project of a CODASYL DBMS.","author":["Wolfgang Effelsberg","Theo Haerder"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Database Systems","Volume 9","Issue 4","Dec. 1984","pp   560\u2013595","https://doi.org/10.1145/1994.2022"],"date":"05 December 1984","ref":[{"text":"BABAOGLU, O., AND JoY, W.

The \"digital\" microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) are manipulating liquids not as a continuous flow, but as discrete droplets on a two-dimensional array of electrodes. Basic microfluidic operations, such as mixing and dilution, are performed on the array, by routing the corresponding droplets on a series of electrodes. The challenges facing biochips are similar to those faced by microelectronics some decades ago. To meet the challenges of increasing design complexity, computer-aided-design (CAD) tools are being developed for DMFBs. This paper provides an overview of DMFBs and describes emerging CAD tools for the automated synthesis and optimization of DMFB designs, from fluidic-level synthesis and chip-level design to testing. Design automations are expected to alleviate the burden of manual optimization of bioassays, time-consuming chip designs, and costly testing and maintenance procedures. With the assistance of CAD tools, users can concentrate on the development and abstraction of nanoscale bioassays while leaving chip optimization and implementation details to CAD tools.","author":["Tsung-Yi Ho","Krishnendu Chakrabarty","Paul Pop"],"issue":["CODES+ISSS '11: Proceedings of the seventh IEEE/ACM/IFIP international conference on Hardware/software codesign and system synthesis","October 2011","Pages   335\u2013344","https://doi.org/10.1145/2039370.2039422"],"date":"09 October 2011","ref":[{"text":"Advanced Liquid Logic, Inc., http://www.liquid-logic.com.","order":1},{"text":"Nanotechnology News, http://www.nanotech-now.com/.","order":2},{"text":"Microfluidic Lab., Duke University, http://microfluidics.ee.duke.edu/","order":3},{"text":"M.

One approach is to adopt Nano-Magnetic Logic Circuits, highly appealing for their extremely reduced power consumption. Despite the interesting nature of this approach, many problems arise when this technology is considered for real designs. The wire is the most critical of these problems from the circuit implementation point of view. It works as a pipelined interconnection, and its delay in terms of clock cycles depends on its length. Serious complications arise at the design phase, both in terms of synthesis and of physical design.One possible solution is the use of a delay insensitive asynchronous logic, Null Convention Logic (NCLTM). Nevertheless its use has many negative consequences in terms of area occupation and speed loss with respect to a Boolean version. In this article we analyze and compare different solutions: nanomagnetic circuits based on full NCL, mixed Boolean-NCL, and fully Boolean logic. We discuss the advantages of these logics, but also the issues they raise. In particular we analyze feedback signals, which, due to their intrinsic pipelined nature, cause errors that still have not found a solution in the literature. The innovative arrangement we propose solves most of the problems and thus soundly increases the knowledge of this technology. The analysis is performed using a VHDL behavioral model we developed and a microprocessor we designed based on this model, as a sound and realistic test bench.","author":["Marco Vacca","Mariagrazia Graziano","Maurizio Zamboni"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 7","Issue 4","December 2011","Article No.: 15","pp   1\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/2043643.2043645"],"date":"01 December 2011","ref":[{"text":"2007.

RTM relies on PDE solutions using stencils that are 8th order or larger, which require large-scale HPC clusters to meet the computational demands. However, the rising power consumption of conventional cluster technology has prompted investigation of architectural alternatives that offer higher computational efficiency. In this work, we compare the performance and energy efficiency of three architectural alternatives -- the Intel Nehalem X5530 multicore processor, the NVIDIA Tesla C2050 GPU, and a general-purpose manycore chip design optimized for high-order wave equations called \"Green Wave.\" We have developed an FPGA-accelerated architectural simulation platform to accurately model the power and performance of the Green Wave design. Results show that across highly-tuned high-order RTM stencils, the Green Wave implementation can offer up to 8x and 3.5x energy efficiency improvement per node respectively, compared with the Nehalem and GPU platforms. These results point to the enormous potential energy advantages of our hardware/software co-design methodology.","author":["Jens Krueger","David Donofrio","John Shalf","Marghoob Mohiyuddin","Samuel Williams","Leonid Oliker","Franz-Josef Pfreund"],"issue":["SC '11: Proceedings of 2011 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2011","Article No.: 73","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2063384.2063482"],"date":"12 November 2011","ref":[{"text":"M.

In particular, cycle-accurate simulators are extremely important for microarchitecture exploration and detailed design decisions, but they are slow and, so, not suitable for simulating large-scale architectures, nor are they meant for this. Moreover, microarchitecture design decisions are irrelevant, or even misleading, for early processor design stages and high-level explorations. This allows one to raise the abstraction level of the simulated architecture, and also the application abstraction level, as it does not necessarily have to be represented as an instruction stream.In this paper we introduce a definition of different application abstraction levels, and how these are employed in TaskSim, a multi-core architecture simulator, to provide several architecture modeling abstractions, and simulate large-scale architectures with hundreds of cores. We compare the simulation speed of these abstraction levels to the ones in existing simulation tools, and also evaluate their utility and accuracy. Our simulations show that a very high-level abstraction, which may be even faster than native execution, is useful for scalability studies on parallel applications; and that just simulating explicit memory transfers, we achieve accurate simulations for architectures using non-coherent scratchpad memories, with just a 25x slowdown compared to native execution. Furthermore, we revisit trace memory simulation techniques, that are more abstract than instruction-by-instruction simulations and provide an 18x simulation speedup.","author":["Alejandro Rico","Felipe Cabarcas","Carlos Villavieja","Milan Pavlovic","Augusto Vega","Yoav Etsion","Alex Ramirez","Mateo Valero"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 8","Issue 4","January 2012","Article No.: 36","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/2086696.2086715"],"date":"26 January 2012","ref":[{"text":"2011.

One important difference between PCM and DRAM that has received less attention is the increased need for write power management. Writing to a PCM cell requires high current density over hundreds of nanoseconds, and hard limits on the number of simultaneous writes must be enforced to ensure correct operation, limiting write throughput and therefore overall performance. Because several wear reduction schemes only write those bits that need to be written, the amount of power required to write a cache line back to memory under such a system is now variable, which creates opportunity to reduce write power. This paper proposes policies that monitor the bits that have actually been changed over time, as opposed to simply those lines that are dirty. These polices can more effectively allocate power across the system to improve write concurrency. This method for allocating power across the memory subsystem is built on the idea of \"power tokens,\" a transferable, but time-specific, allocation of power. The results show that with a storage overhead of 4.3% in the last-level cache, a power-aware memory system can improve the performance of multiprogrammed workloads by up to 84%.","author":["Andrew Hay","Karin Strauss","Timothy Sherwood","Gabriel H.

Due to high performance or efficiency requirements, these transforms are often implemented in hardware. This implementation is challenging due to the large number of algorithmic options (e.g., fast Fourier transform algorithms or FFTs), the variety of ways that a fixed algorithm can be mapped to a sequential datapath, and the design of the components of this datapath. The best choices depend heavily on the resource budget and the performance goals of the target application. Thus, it is difficult for a designer to determine which set of options will best meet a given set of requirements.In this article we introduce the Spiral hardware generation framework and system for linear transforms. The system takes a problem specification as input as well as directives that define characteristics of the desired datapath. Using a mathematical language to represent and explore transform algorithms and datapath characteristics, the system automatically generates an algorithm, maps it to a datapath, and outputs a synthesizable register transfer level Verilog description suitable for FPGA or ASIC implementation. The quality of the generated designs rivals the best available handwritten IP cores.","author":["Peter Milder","Franz Franchetti","James C.

While most proposed techniques for achieving this rely on voltage overscaling (VOS), this paper shows that Imprecise Hardware (IHW) with design-time structural parameters can achieve orthogonal energy-quality tradeoffs. Two IHW adders are improved and two IHW multipliers are introduced in this paper. In addition, a simulation-free error estimation technique is proposed to rapidly and accurately estimate the impact of IHW on output quality. Finally, a quality-aware energy minimization methodology is presented. To validate this methodology, experiments are conducted on two computational kernels: DOT-PRODUCT and L2-NORM -- used in three applications -- Leukocyte Tracker, SVM classification and K-means clustering. Results show that the Hellinger distance between estimated and simulated error distribution is within 0.05 and that the methodology enables designers to explore energy-quality tradeoffs with significant reduction in simulation complexity.","author":["Jiawei Huang","John Lach","Gabriel Robins"],"issue":["DAC '12: Proceedings of the 49th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2012","Pages   504\u2013509","https://doi.org/10.1145/2228360.2228450"],"date":"03 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"Shim, B., Sridhara, S., Shanbhag, N. 2004, Reliable low-power digital signal processing via reduced precision redundancy,","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2004.826201","order":1},{"text":"Mohapatra, D., Karakonstantis, G., Roy, K. 2009, Significance driven computation: a voltage-scalable, variation-aware, quality-tuning motion estimator,","doi":"10.1145/1594233.1594282","order":2},{"text":"Mohapatra, D., Chippa, V.

This paper presents features of Lime, a new Java-compatible language targeting heterogeneous systems, that allow an optimizing compiler to generate high quality GPU code. The key insight is that the language type system enforces isolation and immutability invariants that allow the compiler to optimize for a GPU without heroic compiler analysis.Our compiler attains GPU speedups between 75% and 140% of the performance of native OpenCL code.","author":["Christophe Dubach","Perry Cheng","Rodric Rabbah","David F.

The key idea in the code is the sequential application of a pseudo-random hash function to the message bits to produce a sequence of coded symbols for transmission. This encoding ensures that two input messages that differ in even one bit lead to very different coded sequences after the point at which they differ, providing good resilience to noise and bit errors. To decode spinal codes, this paper develops an approximate maximum-likelihood decoder, called the bubble decoder, which runs in time polynomial in the message size and achieves the Shannon capacity over both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and binary symmetric channel (BSC) models. Experimental results obtained from a software implementation of a linear-time decoder show that spinal codes achieve higher throughput than fixed-rate LDPC codes, rateless Raptor codes, and the layered rateless coding approach of Strider, across a range of channel conditions and message sizes. An early hardware prototype that can decode at 10 Mbits/s in FPGA demonstrates that spinal codes are a practical construction.","author":["Jonathan Perry","Peter A. Iannucci","Kermin E.

We propose a new thread interleaving coverage-driven testing tool called Maple that seeks to expose untested thread interleavings as much as possible. It memoizes tested interleavings and actively seeks to expose untested interleavings for a given test input to increase interleaving coverage. We discuss several solutions to realize the above goal. First, we discuss a coverage metric based on a set of interleaving idioms. Second, we discuss an online technique to predict untested interleavings that can potentially be exposed for a given test input. Finally, the predicted untested interleavings are exposed by actively controlling the thread schedule while executing for the test input. We discuss our experiences in using the tool to expose several known and unknown bugs in real-world applications such as Apache and MySQL.","author":["Jie Yu","Satish Narayanasamy","Cristiano Pereira","Gilles Pokam"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 47","Issue 10","October 2012","pp   485\u2013502","https://doi.org/10.1145/2398857.2384651"],"date":"19 October 2012","ref":[{"text":"P.

For this reason, a large body of research exists on various techniques for accelerating these costly algorithms. One approach to achieving superior performance which has received comparatively little attention is the design of specialised ray-tracing hardware. The research that does exist on this topic has consistently demonstrated that significant performance and efficiency gains can be achieved with dedicated microarchitectures. However, previous work on hardware ray-tracing has focused almost entirely on the traversal and intersection aspects of the pipeline. As a result, the critical aspect of the management and construction of acceleration data-structures remains largely absent from the hardware literature.We propose that a specialised microarchitecture for this purpose could achieve considerable performance and efficiency improvements over programmable platforms. To this end, we have developed the first dedicated microarchitecture for the construction of binned SAH BVHs. Cycle-accurate simulations show that our design achieves significant improvements in raw performance and in the bandwidth required for construction, as well as large efficiency gains in terms of performance per clock and die area compared to manycore implementations. We conclude that such a design would be useful in the context of a heterogeneous graphics processor, and may help future graphics processor designs to reduce predicted technology-imposed utilisation limits.","author":["Michael J.

Because memory is viewed as unsafe, systems periodically write data back to disk. The extra disk traffic lowers performance, and the delay period before data is safe lowers reliability. The goal of the Rio (RAM I/O) file cache is to make ordinary main memory safe for persistent storage by enabling memory to survive operating system crashes. Reliable memory enables a system to achieve the best of both worlds: reliability equivalent to a write-through file cache, where every write is instantly safe, and performance equivalent to a pure write-back cache, with no reliability-induced writes to disk. To achieve reliability, we protect memory during a crash and restore it during a reboot (a \"warm\" reboot). Extensive crash tests show that even without protection, warm reboot enables memory to achieve reliability close to that of a write-through file system. Adding protection makes memory even safer than a write-through file system while adding essentially no overhead. By eliminating reliability-induced disk writes, Rio performs 4-22 times as fast as a write-through file system, 2-14 times as fast as a standard Unix file system, and 1-3 times as fast as an optimized system that risks losing 30 seconds of data and metadata.","author":["Peter M.

These characteristics led to a Software Defined Networking architecture using OpenFlow to control relatively simple switches built from merchant silicon. B4's centralized traffic engineering service drives links to near 100% utilization, while splitting application flows among multiple paths to balance capacity against application priority/demands.

With activity recognition having considerably matured, so has the number of challenges in designing, implementing, and evaluating activity recognition systems. This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive hands-on introduction for newcomers to the field of human activity recognition. It specifically focuses on activity recognition using on-body inertial sensors. We first discuss the key research challenges that human activity recognition shares with general pattern recognition and identify those challenges that are specific to human activity recognition. We then describe the concept of an Activity Recognition Chain (ARC) as a general-purpose framework for designing and evaluating activity recognition systems. We detail each component of the framework, provide references to related research, and introduce the best practice methods developed by the activity recognition research community. We conclude with the educational example problem of recognizing different hand gestures from inertial sensors attached to the upper and lower arm. We illustrate how each component of this framework can be implemented for this specific activity recognition problem and demonstrate how different implementations compare and how they impact overall recognition performance.","author":["Andreas Bulling","Ulf Blanke","Bernt Schiele"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 46","Issue 3","January 2014","Article No.: 33","pp   1\u201333","https://doi.org/10.1145/2499621"],"date":"01 January 2014","ref":[{"text":"Gregory D.

They provide a valuable source of information that can improve conventional recommender systems, if properly exploited. In this paper we present SPrank, a novel hybrid recommendation algorithm able to compute top-N item recommendations from implicit feedback exploiting the information available in the so called Web of Data. We leverage DBpedia, a well-known knowledge base in the LOD compass, to extract semantic path-based features and to eventually compute recommendations using a learning to rank algorithm. Experiments with datasets on two different domains show that the proposed approach outperforms in terms of prediction accuracy several state-of-the-art top-N recommendation algorithms for implicit feedback in situations affected by different degrees of data sparsity.","author":["Vito Claudio Ostuni","Tommaso Di Noia","Eugenio Di Sciascio","Roberto Mirizzi"],"issue":["RecSys '13: Proceedings of the 7th ACM conference on Recommender systems","October 2013","Pages   85\u201392","https://doi.org/10.1145/2507157.2507172"],"date":"12 October 2013","ref":[{"text":"Hetrec '11: Proceedings of the 2nd international workshop on information heterogeneity and fusion in recommender systems.

We present a query processing algorithm that uses the underlying R-tree index of a multidimensional data set to answer similarity queries efficiently. Our experiments show that the performance of this algorithm is competitive to that of processing ordinary (exact match) queries using the index, and much faster than sequential scanning.

Our design uses a single antenna for simultaneous TX/RX (i.e., the same resources as a standard half duplex system). We also propose novel analog and digital cancellation techniques that cancel the self interference to the receiver noise floor, and therefore ensure that there is no degradation to the received signal. We prototype our design by building our own analog circuit boards and integrating them with a fully WiFi-PHY compatible software radio implementation. We show experimentally that our design works robustly in noisy indoor environments, and provides close to the expected theoretical doubling of throughput in practice.","author":["Dinesh Bharadia","Emily McMilin","Sachin Katti"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 43","Issue 4","October 2013","pp   375\u2013386","https://doi.org/10.1145/2534169.2486033"],"date":"27 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"D.

In addition, maps\u2014especially historical maps\u2014are often the only information source about the earth as surveyed using geodetic techniques. In order to preserve these unique documents, increasing numbers of digital map archives have been established, driven by advances in software and hardware technologies. Since the early 1980s, researchers from a variety of disciplines, including computer science and geography, have been working on computational methods for the extraction and recognition of geographic features from archived images of maps (digital map processing). The typical result from map processing is geographic information that can be used in spatial and spatiotemporal analyses in a Geographic Information System environment, which benefits numerous research fields in the spatial, social, environmental, and health sciences. However, map processing literature is spread across a broad range of disciplines in which maps are included as a special type of image. This article presents an overview of existing map processing techniques, with the goal of bringing together the past and current research efforts in this interdisciplinary field, to characterize the advances that have been made, and to identify future research directions and opportunities.","author":["Yao-Yi Chiang","Stefan Leyk","Craig A.

The software employs a Legendre-Gauss-Radau quadrature orthogonal collocation method where the continuous-time optimal control problem is transcribed to a large sparse nonlinear programming problem (NLP). An adaptive mesh refinement method is implemented that determines the number of mesh intervals and the degree of the approximating polynomial within each mesh interval to achieve a specified accuracy. The software can be interfaced with either quasi-Newton (first derivative) or Newton (second derivative) NLP solvers, and all derivatives required by the NLP solver are approximated using sparse finite-differencing of the optimal control problem functions. The key components of the software are described in detail and the utility of the software is demonstrated on five optimal control problems of varying complexity. The software described in this article provides researchers a useful platform upon which to solve a wide variety of complex constrained optimal control problems.","author":["Michael A.

Integrating such meta triples into semantic knowledge bases would enable the querying and reasoning mechanisms to be aware of provenance, time, location, or certainty of triples. However, an efficient RDF representation for such meta knowledge of triples remains challenging. The existing standard reification approach allows such meta knowledge of RDF triples to be expressed using RDF by two steps. The first step is representing the triple by a Statement instance which has subject, predicate, and object indicated separately in three different triples. The second step is creating assertions about that instance as if it is a statement. While reification is simple and intuitive, this approach does not have formal semantics and is not commonly used in practice as described in the RDF Primer. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Singleton Property for representing statements about statements and provide a formal semantics for it. We explain how this singleton property approach fits well with the existing syntax and formal semantics of RDF, and the syntax of SPARQL query language. We also demonstrate the use of singleton property in the representation and querying of meta knowledge in two examples of Semantic Web knowledge bases: YAGO2 and BKR. Our experiments on the BKR show that the singleton property approach gives a decent performance in terms of number of triples, query length and query execution time compared to existing approaches. This approach, which is also simple and intuitive, can be easily adopted for representing and querying statements about statements in other knowledge bases.","author":["Vinh Nguyen","Olivier Bodenreider","Amit Sheth"],"issue":["WWW '14: Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World wide web","April 2014","Pages   759\u2013770","https://doi.org/10.1145/2566486.2567973"],"date":"07 April 2014","ref":[{"text":"J.

MLC and TLC Flash technology made it possible to store multiple bits in the same silicon area as SLC, thus reducing the cost per amount of data stored. However, at current sub-20nm technology nodes, MLC Flash devices fail to provide the levels of raw reliability, mainly cycling endurance, that are required by typical enterprise applications. Advanced signal-processing and coding schemes are needed to improve the Flash bit error rate and thus elevate the device reliability to the desired level. In this paper, we report on the use of adaptive voltage thresholds in the read operation of NAND Flash devices. We discuss how the optimal read voltage thresholds can be determined, and assess the benefit of adapting the read voltage thresholds in terms of cycling endurance, data retention and resilience to read disturb.","author":["Nikolaos Papandreou","Thomas Parnell","Haralampos Pozidis","Thomas Mittelholzer","Evangelos Eleftheriou","Charles Camp","Thomas Griffin","Gary Tressler","Andrew Walls"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '14: Proceedings of the 24th edition of the great lakes symposium on VLSI","May 2014","Pages   151\u2013156","https://doi.org/10.1145/2591513.2591594"],"date":"20 May 2014","ref":[{"text":"H.

Recycling of used chips constitutes a major form of counterfeiting attacks. If undetected, they can lead to serious consequences including system performance/reliability issues during field operation and potential revenue/reputation loss for a trusted manufacturer. Existing validation approaches based on path delay analysis suffer from reduced robustness and sensitivity under large process variations. On the other hand, existing design solutions based on aging sensors require additional design/verification efforts and cannot be applied to legacy chips. In this paper, we present a novel recycled chip identification approach, CACI, that exploits differential aging in self-similar modules (e.g., different parts of an adder) to isolate aged chips under large inter- and intra-die process variations. It compares dynamic current (IDDT) signatures between two adjacent similar circuit structures in a chip. We derive an isolation metric based on multiple current comparisons to provide high level of confidence. CACI does not rely on any embedded structures for authentication, thus it comes at virtually zero design overhead and can be applied to chips already in the market. Through extensive simulations, we show that for 15% inter- and 10% intra-die variations in threshold voltage for a 45nm CMOS process, over 97% of recycled chips can be reliably identified.","author":["Yu Zheng","Abhishek Basak","Swarup Bhunia"],"issue":["DAC '14: Proceedings of the 51st Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2014","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2593069.2593102"],"date":"01 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"U.

We explore this question in the context of tweet search and temporal feedback: starting with an initial set of results from a baseline retrieval model, we estimate the temporal density of relevant documents, which is then used for result reranking. Our contributions lie in a method to characterize this temporal density function using kernel density estimation, with and without human relevance judgments, and an approach to integrating this information into a standard retrieval model. Experiments on TREC datasets confirm that our temporal feedback formulation improves search effectiveness, thus providing support for our hypothesis. Our approach out-performs both a standard baseline and previous temporal retrieval models.

Existing wear-leveling techniques overcome this challenge through constantly remapping hot virtual pages, engendering a fair amount of extra write operations to PCM and imposing considerable energy overhead. Our observation is that it is unnecessary to fully balance the accesses to different physical pages during the execution of each process. Instead, since endurance is a lifetime factor, the hot virtual pages of different processes can be mapped to different physical pages in the PCM. Leveraging this property, we develop a wear-resistant page allocation algorithm, which exploits the diverse write characteristics of different program segments to improve PCM write endurance within almost no extra remapping cost. Experimental results show that the proposed technique can prolong PCM lifetime by hundreds of times within nearly zero searching and remapping overhead.","author":["Hoda Aghaei Khouzani","Yuan Xue","Chengmo Yang","Archana Pandurangi"],"issue":["ISLPED '14: Proceedings of the 2014 international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2014","Pages   327\u2013330","https://doi.org/10.1145/2627369.2627667"],"date":"11 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"S.

We compare two different approaches that could trade accuracy for performance. One is the traditional approach where the precision used in the datapath is limited to meet a target latency. The other is a proposed new approach which simply allows the datapath to operate without timing closure. We demonstrate analytically and experimentally that on average our approach obtains either smaller errors or equivalent faster operating frequencies in comparison to the traditional approach. This is because the worst case caused by timing violations only happens rarely, while precision loss results in errors to most data. We also show that for basic arithmetic operations such as addition, applying our approach to the simple building block of ripple carry adders can achieve better accuracy or performance than using faster adder designs to achieve similar latency.","author":["Kan Shi","David Boland","George A.

Social media data is big, linked, noisy, highly unstructured and in- complete, and differs from data in traditional data mining, which cultivates a new research field - social media mining. Social theories from social sciences are helpful to explain social phenomena. The scale and properties of social media data are very different from these of data social sciences use to develop social theories. As a new type of social data, social media data has a fundamental question - can we apply social theories to social media data? Recent advances in computer science provide necessary computational tools and techniques for us to verify social theories on large-scale social media data. Social theories have been applied to mining social media. In this article, we review some key social theories in mining social media, their verification approaches, interesting findings, and state-of-the-art algorithms. We also discuss some future directions in this active area of mining social media with social theories.","author":["Jiliang Tang","Yi Chang","Huan Liu"],"issue":["ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter","Volume 15","Issue 2","December 2013","pp   20\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/2641190.2641195"],"date":"16 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"E.

The goal is to automatically optimize replica placement in a way that leverages locality patterns in data accesses, such that internode communication is minimized. To do this efficiently is extremely challenging, as one needs not only to find lightweight and scalable ways to identify the right assignment of data replicas to nodes but also to preserve fast data lookup. The article introduces new techniques that address these challenges. The first challenge is addressed by optimizing, in a decentralized way, the placement of the objects generating the largest number of remote operations for each node. The second challenge is addressed by combining the usage of consistent hashing with a novel data structure, which provides efficient probabilistic data placement. These techniques have been integrated in a popular open-source key-value store. The performance results show that the throughput of the optimized system can be six times better than a baseline system employing the widely used static placement based on consistent hashing.","author":["Jo\u00e3o Paiva","Pedro Ruivo","Paolo Romano","Lu\u00eds Rodrigues"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems","Volume 9","Issue 4","January 2015","Article No.: 19","pp   1\u201330","https://doi.org/10.1145/2641573"],"date":"08 December 2014","ref":[{"text":"M.

In other words, chips will have an abundance of transistors, i.e., more than the number that can be simultaneously powered-on. Heterogeneous computing has been proposed as one way to effectively leverage this abundance of transistors in order to increase performance, energy efficiency and even reliability within power and thermal constraints. However, several critical challenges remain to be addressed including design, automated synthesis, design space exploration and run-time management of heterogeneous dark silicon processors. The hardware/software co-design and synthesis community has potentially much to contribute in solving these new challenges introduced by dark silicon and, in particular, heterogeneous computing. In this paper, we identify and highlight some of these critical challenges, and outline some of our early research efforts in addressing them.","author":["Muhammad Shafique","Siddharth Garg","Tulika Mitra","Sri Parameswaran","J\u00f6rg Henkel"],"issue":["CODES '14: Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis","October 2014","Article No.: 13","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2656075.2661645"],"date":"12 October 2014","ref":[{"text":"Jason Allred, Sanghamitra Roy, and Koushik Chakraborty.

But whether the technology in its current state will be a commercially and technically viable alternative to entrenched technologies such as flash-based SSDs remains undecided. To address this, it is important to consider PCM SSD devices not just from a device standpoint, but also from a holistic perspective.This article presents the results of our performance study of a recent all-PCM SSD prototype. The average latency for a 4KiB random read is 6.7\u03bcs, which is about 16\u00d7 faster than a comparable eMLC flash SSD. The distribution of I/O response times is also much narrower than flash SSD for both reads and writes. Based on the performance measurements and real-world workload traces, we explore two typical storage use cases: tiering and caching. We report that the IOPS/$ of a tiered storage system can be improved by 12--66% and the aggregate elapsed time of a server-side caching solution can be improved by up to 35% by adding PCM.Our results show that (even at current price points) PCM storage devices show promising performance as a new component in enterprise storage systems.","author":["Hyojun Kim","Sangeetha Seshadri","Clement L.

Alternatives to many security protocols originally employing traditional mathematical cryptography involve novel hardware security primitives, such as Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). In this article, we propose a novel hybrid memristor-CMOS PUF circuit and demonstrate its suitability through extensive simulations of environmental and process variation effects. The proposed PUF circuit has substantially less hardware overhead than previously proposed memristor-based PUF circuits while being inherently resistant to machine learning-based modeling attacks because of challenge-dependent delays of the memristor stages. The proposed PUF can be conveniently used in many security applications and protocols based on hardware-intrinsic security.","author":["Jimson Mathew","Rajat Subhra Chakraborty","Durga Prasad Sahoo","Yuanfan Yang","Dhiraj K.

Besides correct functionality, the demands placed on current circuits include the area of the circuit and its power consumption. By relaxing the functionality requirement, one can obtain more efficient circuits in terms of the area or power consumption at the cost of an error introduced to the output of the circuit. As a result, a variety of trade-offs between error and efficiency can be found. In this paper, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for the design of approximate digital circuits is proposed. The scalability of the evolutionary design has been recently improved using parallel implementation of the fitness function and by employing spatially structured evolutionary algorithms. The proposed multi-objective approach uses Cartesian Genetic Programming for the circuit representation and a modified NSGA-II algorithm. Multiple isolated islands are evolving in parallel and the populations are periodically merged and new populations are distributed across the islands. The method is evaluated in the task of approximate arithmetical circuits design.","author":["Radek Hrbacek"],"issue":["GECCO '15: Proceedings of the 2015 Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation","July 2015","Pages   687\u2013694","https://doi.org/10.1145/2739480.2754785"],"date":"11 July 2015","ref":[{"text":"K.

Large skew variation can cause difficulties in multi-corner timing closure because fixing violations at one corner can lead to violations at other corners. Such \"ping-pong\" effects lead to significant power and area overheads and time to signoff. We propose a novel framework encompassing both global and local clock network optimizations to minimize the sum of skew variations across different PVT corners between all sequentially adjacent sink pairs. The global optimization uses linear programming to guide buffer insertion, buffer removal and routing detours. The local optimization is based on machine learning-based predictors of latency change; these are used for iterative optimization with tree surgery, buffer sizing and buffer displacement operators. Our optimization achieves up to 22% total skew variation reduction across multiple testcases implemented in foundry 28nm technology, as compared to a best-practices CTS solution using a leading commercial tool.","author":["Kwangsoo Han","Jiajia Li","Andrew B.

Despite strong error correction capability, LDPC decoding induces long NAND flash read latency. In this work, we propose FlexLevel -- a robust NAND flash storage system design to improve data reliability and read efficiency affected by the LDPC operations. FlexLevel first reduces BER by enlarging noise margins via Vth (threshold voltage) level reduction. It reduces the sensing levels of LDPC but also causes loss of storage capacity. To compensate this capacity loss with minimum impact on read performance, FlexLevel identifies the data with high LDPC overhead and only applies the Vth level reduction technique to those data. Experimental results show that compared with state-of-the-art, FlexLevel can achieve up to 33% read speedup with very moderate capacity loss.","author":["Jie Guo","Wujie Wen","Jingtong Hu","Danghui Wang","Hai Li","Yiran Chen"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 194","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744843"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"S.

Before deploying STT-RAM and PCM into functional systems, a number of challenges still remain. Specifically, both require relatively high write energy, STT-RAM suffers from high bit error rates and PCM suffers from low endurance. A common solution to overcome those challenges is to minimize the number of bits changed per write. In this work, we introduce Pseudo-Random Encoding Scheme (PRES) to minimize the number of bit changes during memory writes. PRES maps the write data vector into an intermediate highly random set of data vectors. Subsequently, the intermediate data vector that yields the least number of differences when compared to the currently stored data is selected. Our evaluation shows that PRES reduces bit flips by up to 25% over a baseline differential writing scheme. Further, PRES reduces bit flips by 15% over the leading bit-flip minimization scheme, while decreasing encoding and decoding complexities by more than 90%.","author":["Seyed Mohammad Seyedzadeh","Rakan Maddah","Alex Jones","Rami Melhem"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 23","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2755440"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"H.-S.

The most attractive of the characteristics of ReRAM is its cross-point structure, which features a 4F2 cell size.In a cross-point structure, the existence of sneak current and resulting voltage loss due to the wire's resistance might cause read and write failures if not designed properly. In addition, a robust ReRAM design needs to deal with both soft and hard errors. In this article, we summarize mechanisms of both soft and hard errors of ReRAM cells and propose a unified model to characterize different failure behaviors. We quantitatively analyze the impact of cell failure types on the reliability of the cross-point array. We also propose an error-resilient architecture, which avoids unnecessary writes in the hard error detection unit. Assuming constant soft error rate, our approach can extend the lifetime of ReRAM up to 75% over a design without hard error detection and up to 12% over the design with a \u201cwrite-verify\u201d detection mechanism. Our approach yields greater significant lifetime improvement when considering postcycling retention degradation.","author":["Cong Xu","Dimin Niu","Yang Zheng","Shimeng Yu","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 20","Issue 4","September 2015","Article No.: 63","pp   1\u201321","https://doi.org/10.1145/2753759"],"date":"28 September 2015","ref":[{"text":"Nathan Binkert, Bradford Beckmann, Gabriel Black, Steven K.

The increase in memory capacity, however, is not matched by proportional decrease in memory latency, causing a mismatch for in-memory processing. As a result, data movement through the memory hierarchy is now one of the main performance bottlenecks for main memory data systems. Database systems researchers have proposed several innovative solutions to minimize data movement and to make data access patterns hardware-aware. Nevertheless, all relevant rows and columns for a given query have to be moved through the memory hierarchy; hence, movement of large data sets is on the critical path. In this paper, we present JAFAR, a Near-Data Processing (NDP) accelerator for pushing selects down to memory in modern column-stores. JAFAR implements the select operator and allows only qualifying data to travel up the memory hierarchy. Through a detailed simulation of JAFAR hardware we show that it has the potential to provide 9x improvement for selects in column-stores. In addition, we discuss both hardware and software challenges for using NDP in database systems as well as opportunities for further NDP accelerators to boost additional relational operators.","author":["Sam Likun Xi","Aurelia Augusta","Manos Athanassoulis","Stratos Idreos"],"issue":["DaMoN'15: Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware","May 2015","Article No.: 2","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2771937.2771945"],"date":"31 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"D.

Cello employs a two-level disk scheduling architecture, consisting of a class-independent scheduler and a set of class-specific schedulers. The two levels of the framework allocate disk bandwidth at two time-scales: the class-independent scheduler governs the coarse-grain allocation of bandwidth to application classes, while the class-specific schedulers control the fine-grain interleaving of requests. The two levels of the architecture separate application-independent mechanisms from application-specific scheduling policies, and thereby facilitate the co-existence of multiple class-specific schedulers. We demonstrate that Cello is suitable for next generation operating systems since: (i) it aligns the service provided with the application requirements, (ii) it protects application classes from one another, (iii) it is work-conserving and can adapt to changes in work-load, (iv) it minimizes the seek time and rotational latency overhead incurred during access, and (v) it is computationally efficient.","author":["Prashant J.

In this paper, we present Fibbing, an architecture that achieves both flexibility and robustness through central control over distributed routing. Fibbing introduces fake nodes and links into an underlying link-state routing protocol, so that routers compute their own forwarding tables based on the augmented topology. Fibbing is expressive, and readily supports flexible load balancing, traffic engineering, and backup routes. Based on high-level forwarding requirements, the Fibbing controller computes a compact augmented topology and injects the fake components through standard routing-protocol messages. Fibbing works with any unmodified routers speaking OSPF. Our experiments also show that it can scale to large networks with many forwarding requirements, introduces minimal overhead, and quickly reacts to network and controller failures.","author":["Stefano Vissicchio","Olivier Tilmans","Laurent Vanbever","Jennifer Rexford"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Conference on Special Interest Group on Data Communication","August 2015","Pages   43\u201356","https://doi.org/10.1145/2785956.2787497"],"date":"17 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"D.

Several exchanges have suffered catastrophic losses with customers permanently losing their savings. A proof of solvency demonstrates cryptographically that the exchange controls sufficient reserves to settle each customer's account. We introduce Provisions, a privacy-preserving proof of solvency whereby an exchange does not have to disclose its Bitcoin addresses; total holdings or liabilities; or any information about its customers. We also propose an extension which prevents exchanges from colluding to cover for each other's losses.

In most of these applications, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an indispensable step for amplifying specific DNA segments. To reduce the reaction time to meet the requirement of \u201creal-time\u201d applications, multiplexed PCR is widely utilized. In recent years, three-dimensional (3D) DMFBs that integrate photodetectors (i.e., cyberphysical DMFBs) have been developed, which offer the benefits of smaller size, higher sensitivity, and faster result generations. However, current DMFB design methods target optimization in only two dimensions, thus ignoring the 3D two-layer structure of a DMFB. Furthermore, these techniques ignore practical constraints related to the interference between on-chip device pairs, the performance-critical PCR thermal loop, and the physical size of devices. Moreover, some practical issues in real scenarios are not stressed (e.g., the avoidance of the cross-contamination for multiplexed PCR). In this article, we describe an optimization solution for a 3D DMFB and present a three-stage algorithm to realize a compact 3D PCR chip layout, which includes: (i) PCR thermal-loop optimization, (ii) 3D global placement based on Strong-Push-Weak-Pull (SPWP) model, and (iii) constraint-aware legalization. To avoid cross-contamination between different DNA samples, we also propose a Minimum-Cost-Maximum-Flow-based (MCMF-based) method for reservoir assignment. Simulation results for four laboratory protocols demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective for the design and optimization of a 3D chip for multiplexed real-time PCR.","author":["Zipeng Li","Tsung-Yi Ho","Krishnendu Chakrabarty"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 21","Issue 2","January 2016","Article No.: 25","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/2811259"],"date":"28 January 2016","ref":[{"text":"Jean Berthier. 2012.

Many of these applications are amenable to approximate execution. This application characteristic provides an opportunity to improve GPU performance and efficiency. Among approximation techniques, neural accelerators have been shown to provide significant performance and efficiency gains when augmenting CPU processors. However, the integration of neural accelerators within a GPU processor has remained unexplored. GPUs are, in a sense, many-core accelerators that exploit large degrees of data-level parallelism in the applications through the SIMT execution model. This paper aims to harmoniously bring neural and GPU accelerators together without hindering SIMT execution or adding excessive hardware overhead. We introduce a low overhead neurally accelerated architecture for GPUs, called NGPU, that enables scalable integration of neural accelerators for large number of GPU cores. This work also devises a mechanism that controls the tradeoff between the quality of results and the benefits from neural acceleration. Compared to the baseline GPU architecture, cycle-accurate simulation results for NGPU show a 2.4\u00d7 average speedup and a 2.8\u00d7 average energy reduction within 10% quality loss margin across a diverse set of benchmarks. The proposed quality control mechanism retains a 1.9\u00d7 average speedup and a 2.1\u00d7 energy reduction while reducing the degradation in the quality of results to 2.5%. These benefits are achieved by less than 1% area overhead.","author":["Amir Yazdanbakhsh","Jongse Park","Hardik Sharma","Pejman Lotfi-Kamran","Hadi Esmaeilzadeh"],"issue":["MICRO-48: Proceedings of the 48th International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2015","Pages   482\u2013493","https://doi.org/10.1145/2830772.2830810"],"date":"05 December 2015","ref":[{"text":"H.

More precisely, it computes either a small matrix exponential in full, the action of a large sparse matrix exponential on an operand vector, or the solution of a system of linear OBEs with  constant inhomogeneity. The backbone of the sparse routines consists of matrix-free Krylov subspace projection methods (Arnoldi and Lanczos processes), and that is why the toolkit is capable of coping with sparse matrices of large dimension. The software handles real and complex matrices and provides specific routines for symmetric and Hermitian matrices. The computation of matrix exponentials is a numerical issue of critical importance in the area of Markov chains and furthermore, the computed solution is subject to  probabilistic constraints. In addition to addressing general matrix exponentials, a distinct attention is assigned to the computation of transient states of Markov chains.","author":["Roger B.

These vulnerabilities can be created by improper designs or by the synthesis tool which introduces additional don't-care states and transitions during the optimization and synthesis process. An attacker can utilize these vulnerabilities to perform fault injection attacks or insert malicious hardware modifications (Trojan) to gain unauthorized access to some specific states. To our knowledge, no systematic approaches have been proposed to analyze these vulnerabilities in FSM. In this paper, we develop a framework named Analyzing Vulnerabilities in FSM (AVFSM) which extracts the state transition graph (including the don't-care states and transitions) from a gate-level netlist using a novel Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) based approach and quantifies the vulnerabilities of the design to fault injection and hardware Trojan insertion. We demonstrate the applicability of the AVFSM framework by analyzing the vulnerabilities in the FSM of AES and RSA encryption module. We also propose a low-cost mitigation technique to make FSM more secure against these attacks.","author":["Adib Nahiyan","Kan Xiao","Kun Yang","Yeir Jin","Domenic Forte","Mark Tehranipoor"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 89","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2897992"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"P.

In this paper, we propose a kernel density based sparse regression algorithm (KDSR) to accurately fit analog performance models where the modeling error is not simply Gaussian due to strong nonlinearity. The key idea of KDSR is to approximate the non-Gaussian likelihood function by using non-parametric kernel density estimation. Furthermore, we adopt Laplace distribution as our prior knowledge to enforce a sparse pattern for model coefficients. The unknown model coefficients are finally determined by using an EM type algorithm for maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation. Our proposed method can be viewed as an iterative and weighted sparse regression algorithm that aims to reduce the estimation bias for model coefficients due to outliers. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed KDSR method can achieve superior accuracy over the conventional sparse regression method.","author":["Chenlei Fang","Qicheng Huang","Fan Yang","Xuan Zeng","Dian Zhou","Xin Li"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 10","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898013"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"X.

The most critical and computationally intensive operation of these Ring-LWE based cryptosystems is polynomial multiplication. In this paper, we exploit the number theoretic transform to build a high-speed polynomial multiplier for the Ring-LWE based public key cryptosystems. We present a versatile pipelined polynomial multiplication architecture to calculate the product of two $n$-degree polynomials in about ((nlg n)/4 + n/2) clock cycles. In addition, we introduce several optimization techniques to reduce the required ROM storage. The experimental results on a Spartan-6 FPGA show that the proposed hardware architecture can achieve a speedup of on average 2.25 than the state of the art of high-speed design.

CNNs are composed of multiple filtering layers that perform 2D convolutions over input images. The intrinsic parallelism in such a computation kernel makes it suitable to be effectively accelerated on parallel hardware. In this paper we propose a highly flexible and scalable architectural template for acceleration of CNNs on FPGA devices, based on the cooperation between a set of software cores and a parallel convolution engine that communicate via a tightly coupled L1 shared scratchpad. Our accelerator structure, tested on a Xilinx Zynq XC-Z7045 device, delivers peak performance up to 80 GMAC/s, corresponding to 100 MMAC/s for each DSP slice in the programmable fabric. Thanks to the flexible architecture, convolution operations can be scheduled in order to reduce input/output bandwidth down to 8 bytes per cycle without degrading the performance of the accelerator in most of the meaningful use-cases.","author":["Paolo Meloni","Gianfranco Deriu","Francesco Conti","Igor Loi","Luigi Raffo","Luca Benini"],"issue":["CF '16: Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers","May 2016","Pages   376\u2013383","https://doi.org/10.1145/2903150.2911715"],"date":"16 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"L.

In response to this increasing storage and computational demand, we present a computer architecture for decision support database servers that utilizes \u201cintelligent\u201d disks (IDISKs). IDISKs utilize low-cost embedded general-purpose processing, main memory, and high-speed serial communication links on each disk. IDISKs are connected to each other via these serial links and high-speed crossbar switches, overcoming the I/O bus bottleneck of conventional systems. By off-loading computation from expensive desktop processors, IDISK systems may improve cost-performance. More importantly, the IDISK architecture allows the processing of the system to scale with increasing storage demand.","author":["Kimberly Keeton","David A. Patterson","Joseph M.

The noises may affect these applications that commonly acquire complementary representations from different views. Therefore, how to denoise corrupted views from multi-view data is of great importance for applications that integrate and analyze representations from different views. However, the heterogeneity among multi-view representations brings a significant challenge on denoising corrupted views. To address this challenge, we propose a general framework to jointly denoise corrupted views in this paper. Specifically, aiming at capturing the semantic complementarity and distributional similarity among different views, a novel Heterogeneous Linear Metric Learning (HLML) model with low-rank regularization, leave-one-out validation, and pseudo-metric constraints is proposed. Our method linearly maps multi-view data to a high-dimensional feature-homogeneous space that embeds the complementary information from different views. Furthermore, to remove the intra- and inter-view noises, we present a new Multi-view Semi-supervised Collaborative Denoising (MSCD) method with elementary transformation constraints and gradient energy competition to establish the complementary relationship among the heterogeneous representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods are effective and efficient.","author":["Lei Zhang","Shupeng Wang","Xiaoyu Zhang","Yong Wang","Binbin Li","Dinggang Shen","Shuiwang Ji"],"issue":["KDD '16: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2016","Pages   2045\u20132054","https://doi.org/10.1145/2939672.2939811"],"date":"13 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"N.

They are particularly attractive because of their ability to \"absorb\" great quantities of labeled data through millions of parameters. However, as model sizes increase, so do the storage and memory requirements of the classifiers, hindering many applications such as image and speech recognition on mobile phones and other devices. In this paper, we present a novel net- work architecture, Frequency-Sensitive Hashed Nets (FreshNets), which exploits inherent redundancy in both convolutional layers and fully-connected layers of a deep learning model, leading to dramatic savings in memory and storage consumption. Based on the key observation that the weights of learned convolutional filters are typically smooth and low-frequency, we first convert filter weights to the frequency domain with a discrete cosine transform (DCT) and use a low-cost hash function to randomly group frequency parameters into hash buckets. All parameters assigned the same hash bucket share a single value learned with standard back-propagation. To further reduce model size, we allocate fewer hash buckets to high-frequency components, which are generally less important. We evaluate FreshNets on eight data sets, and show that it leads to better compressed performance than several relevant baselines.","author":["Wenlin Chen","James Wilson","Stephen Tyree","Kilian Q.

Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) architectures and applications, where main memory bandwidth is a critical bottleneck, can benefit from the use of PIM. To this end, an application should be properly partitioned and scheduled to execute on either the main, powerful GPU cores that are far away from memory or the auxiliary, simple GPU cores that are close to memory (e.g., in the logic layer of 3D-stacked DRAM). This paper investigates two key code scheduling issues in such a GPU architecture that has PIM capabilities, to maximize performance and energy-efficiency: (1) how to automatically identify the code segments, or kernels, to be offloaded to the cores in memory, and (2) how to concurrently schedule multiple kernels on the main GPU cores and the auxiliary GPU cores in memory. We develop two new runtime techniques: (1) a regression-based affinity prediction model and mechanism that accurately identifies which kernels would benefit from PIM and offloads them to GPU cores in memory, and (2) a concurrent kernel management mechanism that uses the affinity prediction model, a new kernel execution time prediction model, and kernel dependency information to decide which kernels to schedule concurrently on main GPU cores and the GPU cores in memory. Our experimental evaluations across 25 GPU applications demonstrate that these two techniques can significantly improve both application performance (by 25% and 42%, respectively, on average) and energy efficiency (by 28% and 27%).","author":["Ashutosh Pattnaik","Xulong Tang","Adwait Jog","Onur Kayiran","Asit K.

Many emerging applications, ranging from image and speech recognition to natural language processing and information retrieval, rely heavily on deep learning techniques, especially the Neural Networks (NNs). NNs have led to great advances in recognition accuracy compared with other traditional methods in recent years. NN-based methods demand much more computation and memory resource, and therefore a number of NN accelerators have been proposed on CMOS-based platforms, such as FPGA and GPU [1]. However, it becomes more and more difficult to obtain substantial power efficiency and gains directly through the scaling down of traditional CMOS technique. Meanwhile, the large data amount in DL applications also meets an ever-increasing \"memory wall\" challenge because of the efficiency of von Neumann architecture. Consequently, there is a growing research interest of exploring emerging nano-devices and new computing architectures to further improve power efficiency [2].","author":["Yu Wang","Lixue Xia","Ming Cheng","Tianqi Tang","Boxun Li","Huazhong Yang"],"issue":["CASES '16: Proceedings of the International Conference on Compilers, Architectures and Synthesis for Embedded Systems","October 2016","Article No.: 9","Pages   1\u20132","https://doi.org/10.1145/2968455.2981124"],"date":"01 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"J.

A number of large industrial players, such as IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and NEC, are currently investing in exploiting the blockchain in order to enrich their portfolio of products. A number of researchers and practitioners speculate that the blockchain technology can change the way we see a number of online applications today. Although it is still early to tell for sure, it is expected that the blockchain will stimulate considerable changes to a large number of products and will positively impact the digital experience of many individuals around the globe. In this tutorial, we overview, detail, and analyze the security provisions of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain-effectively capturing recently reported attacks and threats in the system. Our contributions go beyond the mere analysis of reported vulnerabilities of Bitcoin; namely, we describe and evaluate a number of countermeasures to deter threats on the system-some of which have already been incorporated in the system. Recall that Bitcoin has been forked multiple times in order to fine-tune the consensus (i.e., the block generation time and the hash function), and the network parameters (e.g., the size of blocks). As such, the results reported in this tutorial are not only restricted to Bitcoin, but equally apply to a number of \"altcoins\" which are basically clones/forks of the Bitcoin source code. Given the increasing number of alternative blockchain proposals, this tutorial extracts the basic security lessons learnt from the Bitcoin system with the aim to foster better designs and analysis of next-generation secure blockchain currencies and technologies.","author":["Ghassan Karame"],"issue":["CCS '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2016","Pages   1861\u20131862","https://doi.org/10.1145/2976749.2976756"],"date":"24 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"Arthur Gervais, Ghassan Karame, Srdjan Capkun, and Vedran Capkun.

Unfortunately, some of these are criminal, e.g., money laundering, illicit marketplaces, and ransomware. Next-generation cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum will include rich scripting languages in support of smart contracts, programs that autonomously intermediate transactions. In this paper, we explore the risk of smart contracts fueling new criminal ecosystems. Specifically, we show how what we call criminal smart contracts (CSCs) can facilitate leakage of confidential information, theft of cryptographic keys, and various real-world crimes (murder, arson, terrorism). We show that CSCs for leakage of secrets (a la Wikileaks) are efficiently realizable in existing scripting languages such as that in Ethereum. We show that CSCs for theft of cryptographic keys can be achieved using primitives, such as Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge (SNARKs), that are already expressible in these languages and for which efficient supporting language extensions are anticipated. We show similarly that authenticated data feeds, an emerging feature of smart contract systems, can facilitate CSCs for real-world crimes (e.g., property crimes). Our results highlight the urgency of creating policy and technical safeguards against CSCs in order to realize the promise of smart contracts for beneficial goals.","author":["Ari Juels","Ahmed Kosba","Elaine Shi"],"issue":["CCS '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2016","Pages   283\u2013295","https://doi.org/10.1145/2976749.2978362"],"date":"24 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"http://www.smartcontract.com.","order":1},{"text":"http://koinify.com.","order":2},{"text":"https://github.com/darkwallet/darkleaks.","order":3},{"text":"Amazon EC2 pricing. http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/.","order":4},{"text":"Augur. http://www.augur.net/.","order":5},{"text":"Bitcoin ransomware now spreading via spam campaigns. http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-ransomware-now-spreading-via-spam-campaigns/.","order":6},{"text":"bitoinj. https://bitcoinj.github.io/.","order":7},{"text":"CRL issued bby Symantec Class 3 EV SSL CA - G3. http://ss.symcb.com/sr.crl.","order":8},{"text":"NIST randomness beacon. https://beacon.nist.gov/home.","order":9},{"text":"Serpent. https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Serpent.","order":10},{"text":"Skuchain. http://www.skuchain.com/.","order":11},{"text":"Verisign revoked certificate test page. https://test-sspev.verisign.com:2443/test-SPPEV-revoked-verisign.html.

Combining cloud systems with multimedia big data is a novel approach for Financial Service Institutions (FSIs) to diversify service offerings in an efficient manner. However, the security issue is still a great issue in which the service availability often conflicts with the security constraints when the service media channels are varied. This paper focuses on this problem and proposes a novel approach using the Semantic-Based Access Control (SBAC) techniques for acquiring secure financial services on multimedia big data in cloud computing. The proposed approach is entitled IntercroSsed Secure Big Multimedia Model (2SBM), which is designed to secure accesses between various media through the multiple cloud platforms. The main algorithms supporting the proposed model include the Ontology-Based Access Recognition (OBAR) Algorithm and the Semantic Information Matching (SIM) Algorithm. We implement an experimental evaluation to prove the correctness and adoptability of our proposed scheme.","author":["Yibin Li","Keke Gai","Zhong Ming","Hui Zhao","Meikang Qiu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications","Volume 12","Issue 4s","November 2016","Article No.: 67","pp   1\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/2978575"],"date":"15 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"A.

Despite the availability of a number of tools and frameworks to assess Linked Data Quality, the output of such tools is not suitable for machine consumption, and thus consumers can hardly compare and rank datasets in the order of fitness for use. This article describes a conceptual methodology for assessing Linked Datasets, and Luzzu; a framework for Linked Data Quality Assessment. Luzzu is based on four major components: (1) an extensible interface for defining new quality metrics; (2) an interoperable, ontology-driven back-end for representing quality metadata and quality problems that can be re-used within different semantic frameworks; (3) scalable dataset processors for data dumps, SPARQL endpoints, and big data infrastructures; and (4) a customisable ranking algorithm taking into account user-defined weights. We show that Luzzu scales linearly against the number of triples in a dataset. We also demonstrate the applicability of the Luzzu framework by evaluating and analysing a number of statistical datasets against a variety of metrics. This article contributes towards the definition of a holistic data quality lifecycle, in terms of the co-evolution of linked datasets, with the final aim of improving their quality.","author":["Jeremy Debattista","S\u00d6ren Auer","Christoph Lange"],"issue":["Journal of Data and Information Quality","Volume 8","Issue 1","November 2016","Article No.: 4","pp   1\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/2992786"],"date":"25 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"Riccardo Albertoni, Antoine Isaac, Christophe Gu\u00e9ret, Jeremy Debattista, Deirdre Lee, Nandana Mihindukulasooriya, and Amrapali Zaveri. 2015.

While HLS continues to evolve with a growing set of algorithms, methodologies, and tools to efficiently map software designs onto optimized hardware architectures, there continues to lack realistic benchmark applications with sufficient complexity and enforceable constraints. In this paper we present a case study of accelerating face detection based on the Viola Jones algorithm on a programmable SoC using a C-based HLS flow. We also share our insights in porting a software-based design into a synthesizable implementation with HLS-specific data structures and optimizations. Our design is able to achieve a frame rate of 30 frames per second which is suitable for realtime applications. Our performance and quality of results are comparable to those of many traditional RTL implementations.","author":["Nitish Kumar Srivastava","Steve Dai","Rajit Manohar","Zhiru Zhang"],"issue":["FPGA '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2017","Pages   195\u2013200","https://doi.org/10.1145/3020078.3021753"],"date":"22 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"SoftFloat, http://www.jhauser.us/arithmetic/SoftFloat.html.","order":1},{"text":"E.

To overcome the problem, we create a new conversational system to automatically generate responses for users requests on social media. Our system is integrated with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and is trained by nearly 1M Twitter conversations between users and agents from over 60 brands. The evaluation reveals that over 40% of the requests are emotional, and the system is about as good as human agents in showing empathy to help users cope with emotional situations. Results also show our system outperforms information retrieval system based on both human judgments and an automatic evaluation metric.","author":["Anbang Xu","Zhe Liu","Yufan Guo","Vibha Sinha","Rama Akkiraju"],"issue":["CHI '17: Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","May 2017","Pages   3506\u20133510","https://doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025496"],"date":"02 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"Natalya N.

However, BCs are computationally expensive and involve high bandwidth overhead and delays, which are not suitable for most IoT devices. This paper proposes a lightweight BC-based architecture for IoT that virtually eliminates the overheads of classic BC, while maintaining most of its security and privacy benefits. IoT devices benefit from a private immutable ledger, that acts similar to BC but is managed centrally, to optimize energy consumption. High resource devices create an overlay network to implement a publicly accessible distributed BC that ensures end-to-end security and privacy. The proposed architecture uses distributed trust to reduce the block validation processing time. We explore our approach in a smart home setting as a representative case study for broader IoT applications. Qualitative evaluation of the architecture under common threat models highlights its effectiveness in providing security and privacy for IoT applications. Simulations demonstrate that our method decreases packet and processing overhead significantly compared to the BC implementation used in Bitcoin.","author":["Ali Dorri","Salil S.

This paper presents the design of a frequency-domain accelerator for energy-efficient CNN training. With Fourier representations of parameters, we replace convolutions with simpler pointwise multiplications. To eliminate the Fourier transforms at every layer, we train the network entirely in the frequency domain using approximate frequency-domain nonlinear operations. We further reduce computation and memory requirements using sinc interpolation and Hermitian symmetry. The accelerator is designed and synthesized in 28nm CMOS, as well as prototyped in an FPGA. The simulation results show that the proposed accelerator significantly reduces training time and energy for a target recognition accuracy.","author":["Jong Hwan Ko","Burhan Mudassar","Taesik Na","Saibal Mukhopadhyay"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 59","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062228"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, LDPC read performance slowdown along with data retention largely weakens the access speed advantage of flash memories. This paper considers to apply the concept of refresh, that were used for flash lifetime improvement, to optimize flash read performance. Exploiting data read characteristics, this paper proposes LDR, a lightweight data refresh method, that aggressively corrects errors in read-hot pages with long read latency and reprograms error-free data into new pages. Experimental results show that LDR can achieve 29% read performance improvement with only 0.2% extra P/E cycles on average, which causes negligible overhead on flash lifetime.","author":["Yajuan Du","Qiao Li","Liang Shi","Deqing Zou","Hai Jin","Chun Jason Xue"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 23","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062309"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"MSR cambridge traces. http://iotta.snia.org/tracetypes/3.

Multicast snooping is unique because processors predict which caches should snoop each coherence transaction by specifying a multicast \"mask.\" Transactions are delivered with an ordered multicast network, such as an Isotach network, which eliminates the need for acknowledgment messages. Processors handle transactions as they would with a snooping protocol, while a simplified directory operates in parallel to check masks and gracefully handle incorrect ones (e.g., previous owner missing). Preliminary performance numbers with mostly SPLASH-2 benchmarks running on 32 processors show that we can limit multicasts to an average of 2-6 destinations (&lt;&lt; 32) and we can deliver 2-5 multicasts per network cycle (&gt;&gt; broadcast snooping's 1 per cycle). While these results do not include timing, they do provide encouragement that multicast snooping can obtain data directly (like broadcast snooping) but apply to larger systems (like directories).","author":["E.

These architectures offer potential for energy efficient computing if the application task is mapped to the right core. Realizing such potential is challenging due to the complex and evolving nature of hardware and applications. This paper presents an automatic approach to map OpenCL kernels onto heterogeneous multi-cores for a given optimization criterion \u2013 whether it is faster runtime, lower energy consumption or a trade-off between them. This is achieved by developing a machine learning based approach to predict which processor to use to run the OpenCL kernel and the host program, and at what frequency the processor should operate. Instead of hand-tuning a model for each optimization metric, we use machine learning to develop a unified framework that first automatically learns the optimization heuristic for each metric off-line, then uses the learned knowledge to schedule OpenCL kernels at runtime based on code and runtime information of the program. We apply our approach to a set of representative OpenCL benchmarks and evaluate it on an ARM big.LITTLE mobile platform. Our approach achieves over 93% of the performance delivered by a perfect predictor.We obtain, on average, 1.2x, 1.6x, and 1.8x improvement respectively for runtime, energy consumption and the energy delay product when compared to a comparative heterogeneous-aware OpenCL task mapping scheme.","author":["Ben Taylor","Vicent Sanz Marco","Zheng Wang"],"issue":["LCTES 2017: Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED Conference on Languages, Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems","June 2017","Pages   11\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/3078633.3081040"],"date":"21 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"H.

Monitoring with EDDIE involves receiving electromagnetic (EM) emanations that are emitted as a side effect of execution on the monitored system, and it relies on spikes in the EM spectrum that are produced as a result of periodic (e.g. loop) activity in the monitored execution. During training, EDDIE characterizes normal execution behavior in terms of peaks in the EM spectrum that are observed at various points in the program execution, but it does not need any characterization of the malware or other code that might later be injected. During monitoring, EDDIE identifies peaks in the observed EM spectrum, and compares these peaks to those learned during training. Since EDDIE requires no resources on the monitored machine and no changes to the monitored software, it is especially well suited for security monitoring of embedded and IoT devices. We evaluate EDDIE on a real IoT system and in a cycle-accurate simulator, and find that even relatively brief injected bursts of activity (a few milliseconds) are detected by EDDIE with high accuracy, and that it also accurately detects when even a few instructions are injected into an existing loop within the application.","author":["Alireza Nazari","Nader Sehatbakhsh","Monjur Alam","Alenka Zajic","Milos Prvulovic"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   333\u2013346","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080223"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"AARONIA. 2016.

Approximate storage can ease this demand by enabling denser storage at the expense of occasional errors. Unfortunately, even minor storage errors, such as bit flips, can result in major visual damage in encoded videos. Similarly, video encryption, widely employed for privacy and digital rights management, may create long dependencies between bits that show little or no tolerance to storage errors.In this paper we propose VideoApp, a novel and efficient methodology to compute bit-level reliability requirements for encoded videos by tracking visual and metadata dependencies within encoded bitstreams. We further show how VideoApp can be used to trade video quality for storage density in an optimal way. We integrate our methodology into a popular H.264 encoder to partition an encoded video stream into multiple streams that can receive different levels of error correction according to their reliability needs. When applied to a dense and highly error-prone multi-level cell storage substrate, our variable error correction mechanism reduces the error correction overhead by half under the most error-intolerant encoder settings, achieving quality/density points that neither compression nor approximation can achieve alone. Finally, we define the basic invariants needed to support encrypted approximate video storage. We present an analysis of block cipher modes of operation, showing that some are fully compatible with approximation, enabling approximate and secure video storage systems.","author":["Djordje Jevdjic","Karin Strauss","Luis Ceze","Henrique S.

However, in many real-world problems, large outliers and pervasive noise are commonplace, and one may not have access to clean training data as required by standard deep denoising autoencoders. Herein, we demonstrate novel extensions to deep autoencoders which not only maintain a deep autoencoders' ability to discover high quality, non-linear features but can also eliminate outliers and noise without access to any clean training data. Our model is inspired by Robust Principal Component Analysis, and we split the input data X into two parts, $X = L_{D} + S$, where $L_{D}$ can be effectively reconstructed by a deep autoencoder and $S$ contains the outliers and noise in the original data X. Since such splitting increases the robustness of standard deep autoencoders, we name our model a \"Robust Deep Autoencoder (RDA)\". Further, we present generalizations of our results to grouped sparsity norms which allow one to distinguish random anomalies from other types of structured corruptions, such as a collection of features being corrupted across many instances or a collection of instances having more corruptions than their fellows. Such \"Group Robust Deep Autoencoders (GRDA)\" give rise to novel anomaly detection approaches whose superior performance we demonstrate on a selection of benchmark problems.","author":["Chong Zhou","Randy C.

With many advantages, such as density and power consumption, NVM is carving out a place in the memory hierarchy and may eventually change our view of computer architecture. Many NVMs have emerged, such as Magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM), Phase Change random access memory (PCM), Resistive random access memory (ReRAM), and Ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM), each with its own peculiar properties and specific challenges. The scientific community has carried out a substantial amount of work on integrating those technologies in the memory hierarchy. As many companies are announcing the imminent mass production of NVMs, we think that it is time to have a step back and discuss the body of literature related to NVM integration. This article surveys state-of-the-art work on integrating NVM into the memory hierarchy. Specially, we introduce the four types of NVM, namely, MRAM, PCM, ReRAM, and FeRAM, and investigate different ways of integrating them into the memory hierarchy from the horizontal or vertical perspectives. Here, horizontal integration means that the new memory is placed at the same level as an existing one, while vertical integration means that the new memory is interleaved between two existing levels. In addition, we describe challenges and opportunities with each NVM technique.","author":["Jalil Boukhobza","St\u00e9phane Rubini","Renhai Chen","Zili Shao"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 23","Issue 2","January 2018","Article No.: 14","pp   1\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/3131848"],"date":"14 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"J.

Existing approaches usually study networks with a single type of proximity between nodes, which defines a single view of a network. However, in reality there usually exists multiple types of proximities between nodes, yielding networks with multiple views. This paper studies learning node representations for networks with multiple views, which aims to infer robust node representations across different views. We propose a multi-view representation learning approach, which promotes the collaboration of different views and lets them vote for the robust representations. During the voting process, an attention mechanism is introduced, which enables each node to focus on the most informative views. Experimental results on real-world networks show that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for network representation learning with a single view and other competitive approaches with multiple views.","author":["Meng Qu","Jian Tang","Jingbo Shang","Xiang Ren","Ming Zhang","Jiawei Han"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   1767\u20131776","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133021"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"D.

A conceptual extension of Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) and its formalization have been proposed and used to model UTS complexity. The scope is to identify the system functions and their interdependencies with a particular focus on those that have a relation and impact on people and communities. Network analysis techniques have been applied to the FRAM model to identify and estimate the most critical community-related functions. The notion of Variability Rate (VR) has been defined as the amount of output variability generated by an upstream function that can be tolerated/absorbed by a downstream function, without significantly increasing of its subsequent output variability. A fuzzy-based quantification of the VR based on expert judgment has been developed when quantitative data are not available. Our approach has been applied to a critical scenario as flash flooding considering two cases: when UTS has CC and IoE implemented or not. However, the method can be applied in different scenarios and critical infrastructures. The results show a remarkable VR enhancement if CC and IoE are deployed.","author":["Emanuele Bellini","Paolo Ceravolo","Paolo Nesi"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Internet Technology","Volume 18","Issue 1","December 2017","Article No.: 7","pp   1\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/3137572"],"date":"26 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Marco Bartolozzi, Pierfrancesco Bellini, Paolo Nesi, Gianni Pantaleo, and Luca Santi. 2015.

However, the harvested energy is intrinsically unstable. Thus, the program execution may be interrupted frequently. Although the development of non-volatile processors (NVP) can save and restore execution states, both hardware and software challenges exist for energy harvesting powered embedded systems. On the hardware side, existing power detector only signals the ``poor'' quality of the harvested power based on a preset threshold voltage. The inappropriate setting of this threshold will make the NVP based embedded system suffer from either unnecessary checkpointing or checkpointing failures. On the software side, not all tasks can be checkpointed. Once the power is off, these tasks will have to restart from the beginning. In this paper, a task scheduler is proposed to maximize task progress by prioritizing tasks which cannot be checkpointed when power is weak so that they can finish before the power outage. To assist task scheduling, three additional modules including voltage monitor, checkpointing handler, and routine handler, are proposed. Experimental results show increased overall task progress and reduced energy consumption.","author":["Chen Pan","Mimi Xie","Yongpan Liu","Yanzhi Wang","Chun Jason Xue","Yuangang Wang","Yiran Chen","Jingtong Hu"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 52","Issue 5","May 2017","pp   101\u2013110","https://doi.org/10.1145/3140582.3081038"],"date":"21 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Q.

This has been primarily achieved by aggressive improvements in parallel hardware as well as through sophisticated software frameworks like cuDNN and cuBLAS. However, recent enhancements to CPU-based hardware and software has the potential to significantly enhance the performance of CPU-based DL training. In this paper, we provide a complete performance landscape of CPU- and GPU-based DNN training. We characterize performance of DNN training for AlexNet and ResNet-50 for a wide-range of CPU and GPU architectures including the latest Intel Xeon Phi (Knights Landing) processors and NVIDIA Pascal GPUs. We also present multi-node DNN training performance results for AlexNet and ResNet-50 using Intel Machine Learning Scaling (MLSL) Library and Intel-Caffe. In addition, we provide a CPU vs. GPU comparison for multi-node training using OSU-Caffe and Intel-Caffe. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that dives deeper into the performance of DNN training in a holistic manner yet provides an in-depth look at layer-wise performance for different DNNs. We provide multiple key insights: 1) Convolutions account for the majority of time (up to 83% time) consumed in DNN training, 2) GPU-based training continues to deliver excellent performance (up to 18% better than KNL) across generations of GPU hardware and software, and 3) Recent CPU-based optimizations like MKL-DNN and OpenMP-based thread parallelism leads to excellent speed-ups over under-optimized designs (up to 3.2X improvement for AlexNet training).","author":["Ammar Ahmad Awan","Hari Subramoni","Dhabaleswar K.

We study the fundamental problem of repositioning N autonomous robots on a plane so that each robot is visible to all others (the Complete Visibility problem) on this model. We consider obstructed visibility under which a robot cannot see another robot if a third robot is positioned between then on the straight line connecting them. The literature solves this problem on the robots with lights model for point robots. In this paper, we study this problem, for the very first time, on the robots with lights model for fat robots, i.e., the robots which have physical extents. In particular, we present and analyze an algorithm for the fat robots of unit disc size extents that solves Complete Visibility in O(N) time using 9 colors in the fully synchronous setting avoiding robot collisions.","author":["Gokarna Sharma","Rusul Alsaedi","Costas Busch","Supratik Mukhopadhyay"],"issue":["ICDCN '18: Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Networking","January 2018","Article No.: 21","Pages   1\u20134","https://doi.org/10.1145/3154273.3154319"],"date":"04 January 2018","ref":[{"text":"Chrysovalandis Agathangelou, Chryssis Georgiou, and Marios Mavronicolas. 2013.

However, it is challenging for FPGA-based solutions to achieve a higher throughput than GPU counterparts. In this article, we demonstrate that FPGA acceleration can be a superior solution in terms of both throughput and energy efficiency when a CNN is trained with binary constraints on weights and activations. Specifically, we propose an optimized fully mapped FPGA accelerator architecture tailored for bitwise convolution and normalization that features massive spatial parallelism with deep pipelines stages. A key advantage of the FPGA accelerator is that its performance is insensitive to data batch size, while the performance of GPU acceleration varies largely depending on the batch size of the data. Experiment results show that the proposed accelerator architecture for binary CNNs running on a Virtex-7 FPGA is 8.3\u00d7 faster and 75\u00d7 more energy-efficient than a Titan X GPU for processing online individual requests in small batch sizes. For processing static data in large batch sizes, the proposed solution is on a par with a Titan X GPU in terms of throughput while delivering 9.5\u00d7 higher energy efficiency.","author":["Yixing Li","Zichuan Liu","Kai Xu","Hao Yu","Fengbo Ren"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 14","Issue 2","July 2018","Article No.: 18","pp   1\u201316","https://doi.org/10.1145/3154839"],"date":"25 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"C.

We show that our power-laws fit the real data very well resulting in correlation coefficients of 96% or higher.Our observations provide a novel perspective of the structure of the Internet. The power-laws describe concisely skewed distributions of graph properties such as the node outdegree.

We evaluate kernels designed with our approach on an FPGA accelerator board, demonstrating high performance and board utilization with enhanced programmer productivity. By following our guidelines, programmers can use HLS to develop efficient parallel algorithms for FPGA, scaling their implementations with increased resources on future hardware.","author":["Johannes de Fine Licht","Michaela Blott","Torsten Hoefler"],"issue":["PPoPP '18: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming","February 2018","Pages   403\u2013404","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178487.3178527"],"date":"10 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Uday Bondhugula, Vinayaka Bandishti, and Irshad Pananilath. 2017.

Past research has addressed the problem of extracting such embeddings by adopting methods from words to graphs, without defining a clearly comprehensible graph-related objective. Yet, as we show, the objectives used in past works implicitly utilize similarity measures among graph nodes. In this paper, we carry the similarity orientation of previous works to its logical conclusion; we propose VERtex Similarity Embeddings (VERSE), a simple, versatile, and memory-efficient method that derives graph embeddings explicitly calibrated to preserve the distributions of a selected vertex-to-vertex similarity measure. VERSE learns such embeddings by training a single-layer neural network. While its default, scalable version does so via sampling similarity information, we also develop a variant using the full information per vertex. Our experimental study on standard benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrates that VERSE, instantiated with diverse similarity measures, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and recall in major data mining tasks and supersedes them in time and space efficiency, while the scalable sampling-based variant achieves equally good result as the non-scalable full variant.","author":["Anton Tsitsulin","Davide Mottin","Panagiotis Karras","Emmanuel M\u00fcller"],"issue":["WWW '18: Proceedings of the 2018 World Wide Web Conference","April 2018","Pages   539\u2013548","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186120"],"date":"23 April 2018","ref":[{"text":"Sami Abu-El-Haija, Bryan Perozzi, and Rami Al-Rfou. 2017.

Their ubiquitous adoption is limited by the high computation and storage requirements of DNNs, especially for energy-constrained inference tasks at the edge using wearable and IoT devices. One promising approach to alleviate the computational challenges is implementing DNNs using low-precision fixed point (<16 bits) representation. However, the quantization error inherent in any Fixed Point (FxP) implementation limits the choice of bit-widths to maintain application-level accuracy. Prior efforts recommend increasing the network size and/or re-training the DNN to minimize loss due to quantization, albeit with limited success. Complementary to the above approaches, we present Compensated-DNN, wherein we propose to dynamically compensate the error introduced due to quantization during execution. To this end, we introduce a new fixed-point representation viz. Fixed Point with Error Compensation (FPEC). The bits in FPEC are split between computation bits vs. compensation bits. The computation bits use conventional FxP notation to represent the number at low-precision. On the other hand, the compensation bits (1 or 2 bits at most) explicitly capture an estimate (direction and magnitude) of the quantization error in the representation. For a given word length, since FPEC uses fewer computation bits compared to FxP representation, we achieve a near-quadratic improvement in energy in the multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations. The compensation bits are simultaneously used by a low-overhead sparse compensation scheme to estimate the error accrued during MAC operations, which is then added to the MAC output to minimize the impact of quantization. We build compensated-DNNs for 7 popular image recognition benchmarks with 0.05--20.5 million neurons and 0.01-15.5 billion connections. Based on gate-level analysis at 14nm technology, we achieve 2.65\u00d7-4.88\u00d7 and 1.13\u00d7-1.7\u00d7 improvement in energy compared to 16-bit and 8-bit FxP implementations respectively, while maintaining <0.5% loss in classification accuracy.","author":["Shubham Jain","Swagath Venkataramani","Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan","Jungwook Choi","Pierce Chuang","Leland Chang"],"issue":["DAC '18: Proceedings of the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2018","Article No.: 38","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3196012"],"date":"24 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"R.

While conventional CMOS-based computing platforms are hard to achieve higher energy efficiency. RRAM-based systems provide a promising solution to build efficient Training-In-Memory Engines (TIME). While the endurance of RRAM cells is limited, it's a severe issue as the weights of NN always need to be updated for thousands to millions of times during training. Gradient sparsification can address this problem by dropping off most of the smaller gradients but introduce unacceptable computation cost. We proposed an effective framework, SGS-ARS, including Structured Gradient Sparsification (SGS) and Aging-aware Row Swapping (ARS) scheme, to guarantee write balance across whole RRAM crossbars and prolong the lifetime of TIME. Our experiments demonstrate that 356\u00d7 lifetime extension is achieved when TIME is programmed to train ResNet-50 on Imagenet dataset with our SGS-ARS framework.","author":["Yi Cai","Yujun Lin","Lixue Xia","Xiaoming Chen","Song Han","Yu Wang","Huazhong Yang"],"issue":["DAC '18: Proceedings of the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2018","Article No.: 107","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3196071"],"date":"24 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Aji et al. 2017.

In this paper, we propose a novel approximate floating point multiplier which efficiently multiplies two floating numbers and yields a high precision product. RMAC approximates the costly mantissa multiplication to a simple addition between the mantissa of input operands. To tune the level of accuracy, RMAC looks at the first bit of the input mantissas as well as the first N bits of the result of addition to dynamically estimate the maximum multiplication error rate. Then, RMAC decides to either accept the approximate result or re-execute the exact multiplication. Depending on the value of N, the proposed RMAC can be configured to achieve different levels of accuracy. We integrate the proposed RMAC in AMD southern Island GPU, by replacing RMAC with the existing floating point units. We test the efficiency and accuracy of the enhanced GPU on a wide range of applications including multimedia and machine learning applications. Our evaluations show that a GPU enhanced by the proposed RMAC can achieve 5.2x energydelay product improvement as opposed to GPU using conventional FPUs while ensuring less than 2% quality loss. Comparing our approach with other state-of-the-art approximate multipliers shows that RMAC can achieve 3.1x faster and 1.8x more energy efficient computations while providing the same quality of service.","author":["Mohsen Imani","Ricardo Garcia","Saransh Gupta","Tajana Rosing"],"issue":["ISLPED '18: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","July 2018","Article No.: 12","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3218603.3218621"],"date":"23 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"A.

Although prior works build fast and energy-efficient CNN accelerators by greatly sacrificing test accuracy, mobile devices have to guarantee high CNN test accuracy for critical applications, e.g., unlocking phones by face recognitions. In this paper, we propose a 3D XPoint ReRAM-based process-in-memory architecture, 3DICT, to provide various test accuracies to applications with different priorities by lookup-based CNN tests that dynamically exploit the trade-off between test accuracy and latency. Compared to the state-of-the-art accelerators, on average, 3DICT improves the CNN test performance per Watt by 13% ~ 61X and guarantees 9-year endurance under various CNN test accuracy requirements.","author":["Qian Lou","Wujie Wen","Lei Jiang"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 53","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240767"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"R.

As developments in AR progress, field of view and sense of depth are one of the most crucial factors for rendering convincing virtual objects into real environments. We propose computer generated holography (CGH) that is able to reconstruct image with real world depth of field faithfully as rendering method. Previous studies have proposed various near-eye optic design such as the use of beamsplitter and Holographic Optical Element with 4f lens system. However pure beamsplitter design suffers from the narrow field of view while 4f lens system has lens aberration as well as minimal focusing issues that leads to smaller eyebox. Having a wide field of view that matches our eyes is crucial for having an immersive experience and often narrow field of view may even leads to nausea and negative impacts on comfortability. We propose a design that utilizes a Dihedral Corner Reflector Array and a novel beamsplitter embedded optics as our eyepiece. Our primary contribution is having a reasonably large eyebox while maintaining the simple optical design as well as rendering of virtual objects with depth of field in real time without any special optics or moving parts.","author":["Chun Wei Ooi","Naoya Muramatsu","Yoichi Ochiai"],"issue":["SA '18: SIGGRAPH Asia 2018 Technical Briefs","December 2018","Article No.: 31","Pages   1\u20134","https://doi.org/10.1145/3283254.3283288"],"date":"04 December 2018","ref":[{"text":"Kenichi Aoshima, Kenji Machida, Daisuke Kato, Tomoyuki Mishina, Kakeru Wada, Yongfu Cai, Hidekazu Kinjo, Kiyoshi Kuga, Hiroshi Kikuchi, Takayuki Ishibashi, and Naoki Shimidzu. 2015.

Despite a substantial amount of effort has been made to homogeneous (or heterogeneous) graph embedding, attributed graph embedding as well as graph neural networks, few of them can jointly consider heterogeneous structural (graph) information as well as heterogeneous contents information of each node effectively. In this paper, we propose HetGNN, a heterogeneous graph neural network model, to resolve this issue. Specifically, we first introduce a random walk with restart strategy to sample a fixed size of strongly correlated heterogeneous neighbors for each node and group them based upon node types. Next, we design a neural network architecture with two modules to aggregate feature information of those sampled neighboring nodes. The first module encodes \"deep\" feature interactions of heterogeneous contents and generates content embedding for each node. The second module aggregates content (attribute) embeddings of different neighboring groups (types) and further combines them by considering the impacts of different groups to obtain the ultimate node embedding. Finally, we leverage a graph context loss and a mini-batch gradient descent procedure to train the model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that HetGNN can outperform state-of-the-art baselines in various graph mining tasks, i.e., link prediction, recommendation, node classification & clustering and inductive node classification & clustering.","author":["Chuxu Zhang","Dongjin Song","Chao Huang","Ananthram Swami","Nitesh V.

Traditional methods like factorization machine (FM) cast it as a supervised learning problem, which assumes each interaction as an independent instance with side information encoded. Due to the overlook of the relations among instances or items (e.g., the director of a movie is also an actor of another movie), these methods are insufficient to distill the collaborative signal from the collective behaviors of users. In this work, we investigate the utility of knowledge graph (KG), which breaks down the independent interaction assumption by linking items with their attributes. We argue that in such a hybrid structure of KG and user-item graph, high-order relations --- which connect two items with one or multiple linked attributes --- are an essential factor for successful recommendation. We propose a new method named Knowledge Graph Attention Network (KGAT) which explicitly models the high-order connectivities in KG in an end-to-end fashion. It recursively propagates the embeddings from a node's neighbors (which can be users, items, or attributes) to refine the node's embedding, and employs an attention mechanism to discriminate the importance of the neighbors. Our KGAT is conceptually advantageous to existing KG-based recommendation methods, which either exploit high-order relations by extracting paths or implicitly modeling them with regularization. Empirical results on three public benchmarks show that KGAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like Neural FM and RippleNet. Further studies verify the efficacy of embedding propagation for high-order relation modeling and the interpretability benefits brought by the attention mechanism. We release the codes and datasets at https://github.com/xiangwang1223/knowledge_graph_attention_network.","author":["Xiang Wang","Xiangnan He","Yixin Cao","Meng Liu","Tat-Seng Chua"],"issue":["KDD '19: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2019","Pages   950\u2013958","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292500.3330989"],"date":"25 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"Qingyao Ai, Vahid Azizi, Xu Chen, and Yongfeng Zhang. 2018.

Lattice-based cryptography is a promising post-quantum cryptography family, both in terms of foundational properties as well as in its application to both traditional and emerging security problems such as encryption, digital signature, key exchange, and homomorphic encryption. While such techniques provide guarantees, in theory, their realization on contemporary computing platforms requires careful design choices and tradeoffs to manage both the diversity of computing platforms (e.g., high-performance to resource constrained), as well as the agility for deployment in the face of emerging and changing standards. In this work, we survey trends in lattice-based cryptographic schemes, some recent fundamental proposals for the use of lattices in computer security, challenges for their implementation in software and hardware, and emerging needs for their adoption. The survey means to be informative about the math to allow the reader to focus on the mechanics of the computation ultimately needed for mapping schemes on existing hardware or synthesizing part or all of a scheme on special-purpose har dware.","author":["Hamid Nejatollahi","Nikil Dutt","Sandip Ray","Francesco Regazzoni","Indranil Banerjee","Rosario Cammarota"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 51","Issue 6","February 2019","Article No.: 129","pp   1\u201341","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292548"],"date":"28 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Hamid Nejatollahi, Nikil Dutt, Sandip Ray, Francesco Regazzoni, Indranil Banerjee, and Rosario Cammarota. 2017.

In this context, the novel concept of fog computing as well as the combined fog-to-cloud computing paradigm is becoming essential to decentralize the cloud, while bringing the services closer to the end-system. This article surveys e application layer communication protocols to fulfill the IoT communication requirements, and their potential for implementation in fog- and cloud-based IoT systems. To this end, the article first briefly presents potential protocol candidates, including request-reply and publish-subscribe protocols. After that, the article surveys these protocols based on their main characteristics, as well as the main performance issues, including latency, energy consumption, and network throughput. These findings are thereafter used to place the protocols in each segment of the system (IoT, fog, cloud), and thus opens up the discussion on their choice, interoperability, and wider system integration. The survey is expected to be useful to system architects and protocol designers when choosing the communication protocols in an integrated IoT-to-fog-to-cloud system architecture.","author":["Jasenka Dizdarevi\u0107","Francisco Carpio","Admela Jukan","Xavi Masip-Bruin"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 51","Issue 6","February 2019","Article No.: 116","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292674"],"date":"28 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"O.

However, significant challenges remain with supporting efficient and scalable processing of queries with data linked with ontologies (ontological queries). Ontological query processing queries requires explicitly defined query patterns be expanded to capture implicit ones, based on available ontology inference axioms. However, in practice such as in the biomedical domain, the complexity of the ontological axioms results in significantly large query expansions which present day query processing infrastructure cannot support. In particular, it remains unclear how to effectively parallelize such queries. In this paper, we propose data and query transformations that enable inter-operator parallelism of ontological queries on Hadoop platforms. Our transformation techniques exploit ontological axioms, second order data types and operator rewritings to eliminate expensive query substructures for increased parallelizability. Comprehensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets show up to 25X performance improvement over existing approaches.","author":["Hyeongsik Kim","Abhisha Bhattacharyya","Kemafor Anyanwu"],"issue":["SC '19: Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2019","Article No.: 4","Pages   1\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/3295500.3356212"],"date":"17 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"[n. d.].

This parallel growth has influenced the increased application of traditional data mining techniques for knowledge discovery on spatial data. However, these techniques assume that the data is drawn from an independent and identical distribution whereas spatial data is inherently dependent and heterogeneous. This contradiction strongly suggests that a crass application of conventional data mining techniques to spatial data would be suboptimal. In this paper, we evaluate the relatedness of street networks using a transfer learning methodology within the formal contexts of spatial data. Adopting a statistical multi-measure, we analyze street networks from eight cities in an attempt to ascertain their similarities. We predict the street types using random forests and evaluate the accuracies as a function of transfer polarity. Positive transfer is when the transferred models perform better than the parent model or negative transfer when it is worse. With an overall average accuracy of 85%, our results show that it is possible to generalize machine learning models onto different domains and still produce excellent results. Also, we demonstrate that the improved or loss of model accuracy can be explained by the proportion of statistical similarity between the domains. This observation confirms that a measure of inter-domain similarity solely based on geo-political boundaries will be erroneous. The techniques we have described are a statistically sound foundation for analysis of similarities in the spatial context. It can be adopted towards understanding the extent of model generalization for spatial networks.","author":["Chidubem Iddianozie","Gavin McArdle"],"issue":["SAC '19: Proceedings of the 34th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing","April 2019","Pages   659\u2013666","https://doi.org/10.1145/3297280.3297342"],"date":"08 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"F Heinzle, KH Anders, and M Sester.

The softmax layer is one of the key component layers for completing multi-classification tasks. However, the softmax layer contains complex exponential and division operations, resulting in low accuracy and long critical paths in hardware accelerator design. In order to solve the above issues, we present a softmax hardware architecture with proper accuracy, good trade-off and strong expansibility. We summarize the classification rules of neural network and balance the calculation accuracy between resource consumption. On this basis, we proposed an exponential calculation unit based on the group lookup table, and improve a natural logarithmic calculation unit based on the Maclaurin series and the data preprocessing scheme matching them. The experimental results show that the softmax hardware architecture proposed in this paper can achieve the calculation accuracy of 3 decimal fraction and the classification accuracy of $99.01%$. Theoretically, it can accomplish the classification task of infinite categories.","author":["Gaoming Du","Chao Tian","Zhenmin Li","Duoli Zhang","Yongsheng Yin","Yiming Ouyang"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '19: Proceedings of the 2019 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2019","Pages   75\u201380","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299874.3317988"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Kota Ando. 2018.

However, characterizing the various approximate designs for a specific application under certain performance constraints becomes a new challenge. In this paper, approximate adders and multipliers are evaluated and compared for a better understanding of their characteristics when the implementations are optimized for performance or power. Although simple truncation can effectively reduce the hardware of an arithmetic circuit, it is shown that some other designs perform better in speed, power and power-delay product. For instance, many approximate adders have a higher performance than a truncated adder. A truncated multiplier is faster but consumes a higher power than most approximate designs for achieving a similar mean error magnitude. The logarithmic multipliers are very fast and power-efficient at a lower accuracy. Approximate multipliers can also be generated by an automated process to be very efficient while ensuring a sufficiently high accuracy.","author":["Honglan Jiang","Francisco J. H.

However, existing PIM architectures do not support high precision computation, e.g., in floating point precision, which is essential for training accurate CNN models. In addition, most of the existing PIM approaches require analog/mixed-signal circuits, which do not scale, exploiting insufficiently reliable multi-bit Non-Volatile Memory (NVM). In this paper, we propose FloatPIM, a fully-digital scalable PIM architecture that accelerates CNN in both training and testing phases. FloatPIM natively supports floating-point representation, thus enabling accurate CNN training. FloatPIM also enables fast communication between neighboring memory blocks to reduce internal data movement of the PIM architecture. We evaluate the efficiency of FloatPIM on ImageNet dataset using popular large-scale neural networks. Our evaluation shows that FloatPIM supporting floating point precision can achieve up to 5.1% higher classification accuracy as compared to existing PIM architectures with limited fixed-point precision. FloatPIM training is on average 303.2\u00d7 and 48.6\u00d7 (4.3\u00d7 and 15.8\u00d7) faster and more energy efficient as compared to GTX 1080 GPU (PipeLayer [1] PIM accelerator). For testing, FloatPIM also provides 324.8\u00d7 and 297.9\u00d7 (6.3\u00d7 and 21.6\u00d7) speedup and energy efficiency as compared to GPU (ISAAC [2] PIM accelerator) respectively.","author":["Mohsen Imani","Saransh Gupta","Yeseong Kim","Tajana Rosing"],"issue":["ISCA '19: Proceedings of the 46th International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2019","Pages   802\u2013815","https://doi.org/10.1145/3307650.3322237"],"date":"22 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"L.

Traditional approaches manually define features to characterize users' mobility homophily and social proximity, and show that mobility and social features can help friendship and location prediction tasks, respectively. However, these hand-crafted features not only require tedious human efforts, but also are difficult to generalize. In this paper, by revisiting user mobility and social relationships based on a large-scale LBSN dataset collected over a long-term period, we propose LBSN2Vec, a hypergraph embedding approach designed specifically for LBSN data for automatic feature learning. Specifically, LBSN data intrinsically forms a hypergraph including both user-user edges (friendships) and user-time-POI-semantic hyperedges (check-ins). Based on this hypergraph, we first propose a random-walk-with-stay scheme to jointly sample user check-ins and social relationships, and then learn node embeddings from the sampled (hyper)edges by preserving n-wise node proximity (n = 2 or 4). Our evaluation results show that LBSN2Vec both consistently and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art graph embedding methods on both friendship and location prediction tasks, with an average improvement of 32.95% and 25.32%, respectively. Moreover, using LBSN2Vec, we discover the asymmetric impact of mobility and social relationships on predicting each other, which can serve as guidelines for future research on friendship and location prediction in LBSNs.","author":["Dingqi Yang","Bingqing Qu","Jie Yang","Philippe Cudre-Mauroux"],"issue":["WWW '19: The World Wide Web Conference","May 2019","Pages   2147\u20132157","https://doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313635"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Lada A Adamic and Eytan Adar. 2003.

With new use cases of in-network computing using programmable switching ASICs, global time-synchronization in the data-plane is very much necessary for supporting distributed applications. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using programmable switching ASICs to design and implement a time synchronization protocol, DPTP, with the core logic running in the data-plane. We perform comprehensive measurement studies on the variable delay characteristics in the switches and NICs under different traffic conditions. Based on the measurement insights, we design and implement DPTP on a Barefoot Tofino switch using the P4 programming language. Our evaluation on a multi-switch testbed shows that DPTP can achieve median and 99th percentile synchronization error of 19 ns and 47 ns between 2 switches, 4-hops apart, in the presence of clock drifts and under heavy network load.","author":["Pravein Govindan Kannan","Raj Joshi","Mun Choon Chan"],"issue":["SOSR '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM Symposium on SDN Research","April 2019","Pages   8\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/3314148.3314353"],"date":"03 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"D.

It generally consists of three steps: medical archives recognition, feature extraction and text classification. In this paper, we focus on empowering the medical archives processing with knowledge graphs. We first build a semantic-rich medical knowledge graph. Then, we recognize texts from medical archives using several popular optical character recognition (OCR) engines, and extract keywords from texts using a knowledge graph based feature extraction algorithm. Third, we define a semantic measure based on knowledge graph to evaluate the similarity between medical texts, and perform the text classification task. This measure can value semantic relatedness between medical documents, to enhance the text classification. We use medical archives collected from real hospitals for validation. The results show that our algorithms can significantly outperform typical baselines that employs only term statistics.","author":["Xiaoli Wang","Rongzhen Wang","Zhifeng Bao","Jiayin Liang","Wei Lu"],"issue":["SIGIR'19: Proceedings of the 42nd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","July 2019","Pages   1141\u20131144","https://doi.org/10.1145/3331184.3331350"],"date":"18 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"N.

Trust can be improved once we understand how and why deep models carve out a particular form of decision boundary and thus make particular decisions. Robustness against adversarial examples is directly related to the decision boundary as adversarial examples are basically 'missed out' by the decision boundary between two classes. Investigating the decision boundary of deep neural networks, nevertheless, faces tremendous challenges. First, how we can generate instances near the decision boundary that are similar to real samples? Second, how we can leverage near decision boundary instances to characterize the behaviour of deep neural networks? Motivated to solve these challenges, we focus on investigating the decision boundary of deep neural network classifiers. In particular, we propose a novel approach to generate instances near decision boundary of pre-trained DNNs and then leverage these instances to characterize the behaviour of deep models.","author":["Hamid Karimi","Jiliang Tang"],"issue":["WSDM '20: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","January 2020","Pages   919\u2013920","https://doi.org/10.1145/3336191.3372186"],"date":"20 January 2020","ref":[{"text":"Hamid Karimi, Tyler Derr, Aaron Brookhouse, and Jiliang Tang.

Time-multiplexing the overlay allows it to change its behavior with a cycle-by-cycle execution of the application kernel, thus allowing better sharing of the limited FPGA hardware resource. However, most TM overlays suffer from large resource overheads, due to either the underlying processor-like architecture (for processor-based overlays) or due to the routing array and instruction storage requirements (for CGRA-like overlays). Reducing the area overhead for CGRA-like overlays, specifically that required for the routing network, and better utilizing the hard macros in the target FPGA are active areas of research.","author":["Xiangwei Li","Douglas L.

There, a key problem is the so-called cold start problem: when a request comes in and no idle container can be found for the execution of the target function, then a new container needs to provisioned. In that case, the request incurs an extra latency - the cold start latency. Recent work has largely focused on reducing the duration of cold starts. In this paper, we present three approaches, complementary to related work, that reduce the number of cold starts while treating the FaaS service as a black box. In the approaches, implemented as part of a lightweight choreography middleware, we use knowledge on the composition of functions to trigger cold starts and, thus, the provisioning of new containers before the application process invokes the respective function. In experiments on AWS Lambda and OpenWhisk, we could show that our approaches remove an average of about 40% (in some cases up to 80%) of all cold starts while causing only a small cost overhead.","author":["David Bermbach","Ahmet-Serdar Karakaya","Simon Buchholz"],"issue":["SAC '20: Proceedings of the 35th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing","March 2020","Pages   134\u2013143","https://doi.org/10.1145/3341105.3373909"],"date":"30 March 2020","ref":[{"text":"Istemi Ekin Akkus, Ruichuan Chen, Ivica Rimac, Manuel Stein, Klaus Satzke, Andre Beck, Paarijaat Aditya, and Volker Hilt. 2018. {SAND}: Towards High-Performance Serverless Computing.

This link heterogeneity builds a new network topology called signed heterogeneous networks. Meanwhile, network embeddings have emerged as convenient methods for conducting machine learning over networked data. Consequently, extending embedding methods for signed heterogeneous networks allows interesting analytical scenarios such as predicting the sign of sentiment links. Previous works mainly focus on heterogeneous network embedding discarding the sign information in the network. In this paper, we propose SiHet, a fast and scalable embedding method suited for Signed Heterogeneous networks. Our method extends classical network embedding algorithms through a new loss function and a sampling strategy which allows to integrate sign and social network information. Empirical evaluations on two real-world datasets demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency of SiHet compared to the state-of-the-art methods.","author":["Fatemeh Salehi Rizi","Michael Granitzer"],"issue":["SAC '20: Proceedings of the 35th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing","March 2020","Pages   1877\u20131880","https://doi.org/10.1145/3341105.3374048"],"date":"30 March 2020","ref":[{"text":"Dorwin Cartwright and Frank Harary. 1956.

This success rests crucially on gradient-descent optimization and the ability to \u201clearn\u201d parameters of a neural network by backpropagating observed errors. However, neural network architectures are growing increasingly sophisticated and diverse, which motivates an emerging quest for even more general forms of differentiable programming, where arbitrary parameterized computations can be trained by gradient descent. In this paper, we take a fresh look at automatic differentiation (AD) techniques, and especially aim to demystify the reverse-mode form of AD that generalizes backpropagation in neural networks. We uncover a tight connection between reverse-mode AD and delimited continuations, which permits implementing reverse-mode AD purely via operator overloading and without managing any auxiliary data structures. We further show how this formulation of AD can be fruitfully combined with multi-stage programming (staging), leading to an efficient implementation that combines the performance benefits of deep learning frameworks based on explicit reified computation graphs (e.g., TensorFlow) with the expressiveness of pure library approaches (e.g., PyTorch).","author":["Fei Wang","Daniel Zheng","James Decker","Xilun Wu","Gr\u00e9gory M.

Knowledge visualisation has untapped potential within the purview of knowledge communication. Even so, there is little evidence of knowledge visualisations being deployed. This might be due to a lack of evidence-based guidance to inform their creation. To improve this situation, we derived a number of \"lenses\" that can be used to reveal essential perspectives and feed into the visualisation production process. We propose a conceptual framework which incorporates these lenses to guide producers of knowledge visualisations. This framework uses the different lenses to reveal critical perspectives that need to be considered during the design process. We conclude by demonstrating how this framework could be used to produce a knowledge visualisation with maximum communicative power.","author":["Karen Renaud","Judy van Biljon"],"issue":["SAICSIT '19: Proceedings of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists 2019","September 2019","Article No.: 2","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3351108.3351111"],"date":"17 September 2019","ref":[{"text":"Andreas Abecker and Ludger van Elst. 2004.

Prefetching can often overlap memory latency with computation for array-based numeric applications. However, prefetching for pointer-intensive applications still remains a challenging problem. Prefetching linked data structures (LDS) is difficult because the address sequence of LDS traversal does not present the same arithmetic regularity as array-based applications and the data dependence of pointer dereferences can serialize the address generation process.In this paper, we propose a cooperative hardware/software mechanism to reduce memory access latencies for linked data structures. Instead of relying on the past address history to predict future accesses, we identify the load instructions that traverse the LDS, and execute them ahead of the actual computation. To overcome the serial nature of the LDS address generation, we attach a prefetch controller to each level of the memory hierarchy and push, rather than pull, data to the CPU. Our simulations, using four pointer-intensive applications, show that the push model can achieve between 4% and 30% larger reductions in execution time compared to the pull model.","author":["Chia-Lin Yang","Alvin R.

An accelerator micro architecture dictates the dataflow(s) that can be employed to execute layers in a DNN. Selecting a dataflow for a layer can have a large impact on utilization and energy efficiency, but there is a lack of understanding on the choices and consequences of dataflow, and of tools and methodologies to help architects explore the co-optimization design space. In this work, we first introduce a set of data-centric directives to concisely specify the DNN dataflow space in a compiler-friendly form. We then show how these directives can be analyzed to infer various forms of reuse and to exploit them using hardware capabilities. We codify this analysis into an analytical cost model, MAESTRO (Modeling Accelerator Efficiency via Patio-Temporal Reuse and Occupancy), that estimates various cost-benefit tradeoffs of a dataflow including execution time and energy efficiency for a DNN model and hardware configuration. We demonstrate the use of MAESTRO to drive a hardware design space exploration experiment, which searches across 480M designs to identify 2.5M valid designs at an average rate of 0.17M designs per second, including Pareto-optimal throughput- and energy-optimized design points.","author":["Hyoukjun Kwon","Prasanth Chatarasi","Michael Pellauer","Angshuman Parashar","Vivek Sarkar","Tushar Krishna"],"issue":["MICRO '52: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","October 2019","Pages   754\u2013768","https://doi.org/10.1145/3352460.3358252"],"date":"12 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"2017.

In particular, a novel NVDIMM-based heterogeneous storage performance model is proposed to effectively address bus contention issues caused by placing NVDIMMs on the memory bus. We also develop an NVDIMM-based lazy migration scheme to effectively minimize adverse effects caused by memory traffic interferences during storage data management processes. Finally, the NVDIMM-based architectural support for migration optimization is proposed to increase channel parallelism in the destination NVDIMMs and bypass buffer caches in the source NVDIMMs, so that the impact of memory traffic can be alleviated. We present detailed evaluation and analysis to quantify how well our techniques can enhance the I/O performances of big workloads via efficient heterogeneous storage hierarchy management. Our experimental results show that overall the proposed techniques yield up to 98% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art techniques.","author":["Renhai Chen","Zili Shao","Duo Liu","Zhiyong Feng","Tao Li"],"issue":["MICRO '52: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","October 2019","Pages   849\u2013860","https://doi.org/10.1145/3352460.3358266"],"date":"12 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Amir Ban. 1998.

However, the dramatically increasing number of devices and data traffic in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era are posing significant burdens on the capacity-limited Internet and uncontrollable service delay. It becomes difficult to meet the delay-sensitive and context-aware service requirements of IoT applications by using cloud computing alone. Facing these challenges, computing paradigms are shifting from the centralized cloud computing to distributed edge computing. Several new computing paradigms, including Transparent Computing, Mobile Edge Computing, Fog Computing, and Cloudlet, have emerged to leverage the distributed resources at network edge to provide timely and context-aware services. By integrating end devices, edge servers, and cloud, they form a hierarchical IoT architecture, i.e., End-Edge-Cloud orchestrated architecture to improve the performance of IoT systems. This article presents a comprehensive survey of these emerging computing paradigms from the perspective of end-edge-cloud orchestration. Specifically, we first introduce and compare the architectures and characteristics of different computing paradigms. Then, a comprehensive survey is presented to discuss state-of-the-art research in terms of computation offloading, caching, security, and privacy. Finally, some potential research directions are envisioned for fostering continuous research efforts.","author":["Ju Ren","Deyu Zhang","Shiwen He","Yaoxue Zhang","Tao Li"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 52","Issue 6","January 2020","Article No.: 125","pp   1\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/3362031"],"date":"16 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Mobile Edge Computing Introductory Technical White Paper. 2014.

The main two challenges SM is designed an algorithm reducing the computational complexity and detect the error at the receiving side to give the accurate result. The simulation result indicates that the Maximum Likelihood Detection algorithm gives the most optimal solution, but complexity increases with increase in the antenna index. In this paper Enhanced k-best sphere decoding algorithm by layer-ordering with constant complexity in the breadth-first strategy algorithm is proposed, Using 64 QAM modulation with eight nodes per layer, The Enhanced k-best SDA with constant extension nodes is obtained by simulation. When the number of extended nodes per node is greater than or equal to 2 system gives low latency.","author":["Hussain Shah","Li Danmei","Hai.

Existing approaches for MC are usually designed for general cases; however, we specially develop a novel method for solving the multiple-choice MC problem. We take the inspiration generative adversarial networks (GANs) and first propose an adversarial framework for multiple-choice oriented MC, named McGAN. Specifically, our approach is designed as a GAN-based method that unifies both generative and discriminative MC models. Working together, the generative model focuses on predicting relevant answer given a passage (text) and a question; the discriminative model focuses on predicting their relevancy given an answer-passage-question set. Based on the competition via adversarial training in a minimize-maximize game, the proposed method takes advantages from both models. To evaluate the performance, we test our McGAN model on three well-known datasets for multiple-choice MC. Our results show that McGAN can achieve a significant increase in accuracy compared to existing models based on all three datasets, and it consistently outperforms all tested baselines, including state-of-the-art techniques.","author":["Zhuang Liu","Keli Xiao","Bo Jin","Kaiyu Huang","Degen Huang","Yunxia Zhang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology","Volume 11","Issue 3","May 2020","Article No.: 25","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/3372120"],"date":"01 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, et al. 2016.

Many studies explore optimization methods (e.g., loop unrolling, local memory) to accelerate OpenCL programs running on FPGAs. These programs typically follow the default OpenCL execution model, where a kernel deploys multiple work-items arranged into work-groups. However, the default execution model is not always a good fit for an application mapped to the FPGA architecture, which is very different from the multithreaded architecture of GPUs, for which OpenCL was originally designed. In this work, we identify three other execution models that can better utilize the FPGA resources for the OpenCL applications that do not fit well into the default execution model. These three execution models are based on two OpenCL features devised for FPGA programming (namely, single work-item kernel and OpenCL channel). We observe that the selection of the right execution model determines the performance upper bound of a particular application, which can vary by two orders magnitude between the most suitable execution model and the most unsuitable one. However, there is no way to select the most suitable execution model other than empiricall exploring the optimization space for the four of them, which can be prohibitive. To help FPGA programmers identify the right execution model, we propose Boyi, a systematic framework that makes automatic decisions by analyzing OpenCL programming patterns in an application. After finding the right execution model with the help of Boyi, programmers can apply other conventional optimizations to reach the performance upper bound. Our experimental evaluation shows that Boyi can 1) accurately determine the right execution model, and 2) greatly reduce the exploration space of conventional optimization methods.","author":["Jiantong Jiang","Zeke Wang","Xue Liu","Juan G\u00f3mez-Luna","Nan Guan","Qingxu Deng","Wei Zhang","Onur Mutlu"],"issue":["FPGA '20: Proceedings of the 2020 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2020","Pages   299\u2013309","https://doi.org/10.1145/3373087.3375313"],"date":"23 February 2020","ref":[{"text":"Yi (husbandman). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_(husbandman).

Recently, a variety of research has focused on hardware acceleration of automata processing, especially via spatial architectures that directly map the patterns to massively parallel hardware elements, such as in FPGAs and in-memory solutions. We observed that all existing automata-acceleration architectures are designed based on fixed, 8-bit symbol processing, derived from ASCII processing. However, the alphabet size in pattern-matching applications varies from just a few up to billions of unique symbols. This makes it difficult to provide a universal and efficient mapping of this wide variety of automata applications to existing automata accelerators. In this paper, we present FlexAmata, a compiler solution for efficient adaption of applications with any alphabet size to existing pattern-matching accelerators. We demonstrate that this can increase automata processing efficiency in two ways. First, this improves resource utilization for applications with small alphabets and enables hardware acceleration for applications with very large alphabets (which otherwise would not map to hardware accelerators). Second, this enables the exploration of optimized bitwidth processing for future spatial hardware accelerators. We leverage FlexAmata and investigate the hardware implications of different bitwidth processing rates on the two state-of-the-art spatial accelerators, Cache Automaton (CA) and FPGAs. Our exploration across a wide range of automata benchmarks reveals that 4-bit processing rate on CA and 16-bit processing rate on FPGAs results in higher performance than the default 8-bit processing rate in these existing approaches.","author":["Elaheh Sadredini","Reza Rahimi","Marzieh Lenjani","Mircea Stan","Kevin Skadron"],"issue":["ASPLOS '20: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2020","Pages   219\u2013234","https://doi.org/10.1145/3373376.3378459"],"date":"09 March 2020","ref":[{"text":"Kubilay Atasu, Florian Doerfler, Jan van Lunteren, and Christoph Hagleitner. 2013.

To achieve this, the serverless sandbox system must address two challenges: strong isolation between function instances, and low startup latency to ensure user experience. While strong isolation can be provided by virtualization-based sandboxes, the initialization of sandbox and application causes non-negligible startup overhead. Conventional sandbox systems fall short in low-latency startup due to their application-agnostic nature: they can only reduce the latency of sandbox initialization through hypervisor and guest kernel customization, which is inadequate and does not mitigate the majority of startup overhead. This paper proposes Catalyzer, a serverless sandbox system design providing both strong isolation and extremely fast function startup. Instead of booting from scratch, Catalyzer restores a virtualization-based function instance from a well-formed checkpoint image and thereby skips the initialization on the critical path (init-less). Catalyzer boosts the restore performance by on-demand recovering both user-level memory state and system state. We also propose a new OS primitive, sfork (sandbox fork), to further reduce the startup latency by directly reusing the state of a running sandbox instance. Fundamentally, Catalyzer removes the initialization cost by reusing state, which enables general optimizations for diverse serverless functions. The evaluation shows that Catalyzer reduces startup latency by orders of magnitude, achieves < 1ms latency in the best case, and significantly reduces the end-to-end latency for real-world workloads. Catalyzer has been adopted by Ant Financial, and we also present lessons learned from industrial development.","author":["Dong Du","Tianyi Yu","Yubin Xia","Binyu Zang","Guanglu Yan","Chenggang Qin","Qixuan Wu","Haibo Chen"],"issue":["ASPLOS '20: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2020","Pages   467\u2013481","https://doi.org/10.1145/3373376.3378512"],"date":"09 March 2020","ref":[{"text":"[n.d.].

The synergy of a storied narrative embedded within a 3D virtual reconstruction context has high consumer appeal and edutainment value. We investigate if 360\u00b0 videos presented through virtual reality further contribute to user immersion for the application of preserving intangible cultural heritage. A case study then analyzes whether conventional desktop media is significantly different from virtual reality as a medium for immersion in intangible heritage contexts. The case study describes bridge diving at Stari Most, the old bridge in Mostar Bosnia. This application aims to present and preserve the bridge diving tradition at this site. The project describes the site and history along with cultural connections, and a series of quiz questions are presented after viewing all of the materials. Successful completion of the quiz allows a user to participate in a virtual bridge dive. The subjective evaluation provided evidence to suggest that our method is successful in preserving intangible heritage and communicating ideas in key areas of concern for this heritage that can be used to develop a preservation framework in the future. It was also possible to conclude that experience within the virtual reality framework did not affect effort expectancy for the web application, but the same experience significantly influenced the performance expectancy construct.","author":["Elmedin Selmanovi\u0107","Selma Rizvic","Carlo Harvey","Dusanka Boskovic","Vedad Hulusic","Malek Chahin","Sanda Sljivo"],"issue":["Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage","Volume 13","Issue 2","June 2020","Article No.: 13","pp   1\u201319","https://doi.org/10.1145/3377143"],"date":"30 May 2020","ref":[{"text":"3D CoForm. 2009. 3D CoForm Website.

This class includes many simple and direct algorithms for physical simulation, virtual-reality simulation, agent-based modeling, logic simulation, 2D and 3D image processing and rendering, and other volumetric data processing tasks. The range of applicability of such algorithms is completely dependant upon the lattice-sizes and processing speeds that are computationally feasible. Using embedded DRAM and a new technique for organizing SIMD memory and communications we can efficiently utilize 1 Tbit/sec of sustained memory bandwidth in each chip in an indefinitely scalable array of chips. This allows a 10,000-fold speedup per memory chip for these algorithms compared to the CAM-8 lattice gas computer, and is about one million times faster per memory chip for these calculations than a CM-2.","author":["Norman Margolus"],"issue":["ISCA '00: Proceedings of the 27th annual international symposium on Computer architecture","June 2000","Pages   149\u2013160","https://doi.org/10.1145/339647.339672"],"date":"01 May 2000","ref":[{"text":"C.

The approach is motivated by applications in image analysis and is based on the use of priors defined by stochastic grammars. We define a class of grammars that capture relationships between the objects in a scene and provide important contextual cues for statistical inference. The distribution over scenes defined by a probabilistic scene grammar can be represented by a graphical model, and this construction can be used for efficient inference with loopy belief propagation.We show experimental results with two applications. One application involves the reconstruction of binary contour maps. Another application involves detecting and localizing faces in images. In both applications, the same framework leads to robust inference algorithms that can effectively combine local information to reason about a scene.","author":["Jeroen Chua","Pedro F.

The routing resources in the FPGAs consist of segments of various lengths. Researchers have shown that the number of segments, instead of wirelength, used by a net is the most critical factor in controlling routing delay in an FPGA. Thus, the traditional measure of routing delay on the basis of geometric distance of a signal is not accurate. To consider wirelength and delay simultaneously, we study a model of timing-driven routing rees, arising from the special properties of FPGA routing architectures. Based on the solutions to the routing-tree problem, we present a routing algorithm that is able to utilize various routing segments with global considerations to meet timing constraints. Experimental  results show that our approach is very effective in reducing timing violations.","author":["Yao-Wen Chang","Kai Zhu","D. F.

The storage manager embodies three ideas: (1) large virtual storage, to contain all temporary data and permanent files for the active programs; (2) the innovation of database storage, which has implicit properties of access serializability and atomic update, similar to those of database transaction systems; and (3) access to all storage, including files, by the usual operations and types of a high-level programming language.The IBM RT PC implements the hardware architecture necessary for these storage facilities in its storage controller (MMU). The storage manager and language elements required, as well as subsystems and applications that use them, have been implemented and studied in a prototype operating system called CPR, that runs on the RT PC. Low cost and good performance are achieved in both hardware and software. The design is intended to be extensible across a wide performance/cost spectrum.","author":["Albert Chang","Mark F.

The impact of logic decomposition on delay and area of the technology mapping solutions is not well understood. In this paper, we present an algorithm named SLDMap that performs delay-minimized technology mapping on a large set of decompositions and simultaneously controls the mapping area under delay constraints. Our study leads to two conclusions: (1) For depth minimization, the best algorithms in conventional flow (dmig + CutMap) produce satisfactory results with a short runtime, even with a fixed decomposition; (2) When all the structural decompositions of the 6-bounded Boolean network are explored, SLDMap consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art separate flow (dmig + CutMap) by 12% in depth and 10% in area on average; it also consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art combined approach dogma by 8% in depth and 6% in area on average.","author":["Gang Chen","Jason Cong"],"issue":["FPGA '01: Proceedings of the 2001 ACM/SIGDA ninth international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2001","Pages   48\u201355","https://doi.org/10.1145/360276.360298"],"date":"01 February 2001","ref":[{"text":"J.

The method is general, and applies equally well to English, to PL/I, or to digital data. The system consists of an encoder, an analysis program, and a decoder. Two algorithms for encoding a string differ slightly from earlier proposals. The analysis program attempts to find an optimal set of codes for representing substrings of the file. Four new algorithms for this operation are described and compared. Various parameters in the algorithms are optimized to obtain a high degree of compression for sample texts.","author":["Frank Rubin"],"issue":["Communications of the ACM","Volume 19","Issue 11","Nov. 1976","pp   617\u2013623","https://doi.org/10.1145/360363.360368"],"date":"01 November 1976","ref":[{"text":"Huffman, D.A.

For these applications, the memory allocator is often a bottleneck that severely limits program performance and scalability on multiprocessor systems. Previous allocators suffer from problems that include poor performance and scalability, and heap organizations that introduce false sharing. Worse, many allocators exhibit a dramatic increase in memory consumption when confronted with a producer-consumer pattern of object allocation and freeing. This increase in memory consumption can range from a factor of P (the number of processors) to unbounded memory consumption.This paper introduces Hoard, a fast, highly scalable allocator that largely avoids false sharing and is memory efficient. Hoard is the first allocator to simultaneously solve the above problems. Hoard combines one global heap and per-processor heaps with a novel discipline that provably bounds memory consumption and has very low synchronization costs in the common case. Our results on eleven programs demonstrate that Hoard yields low average fragmentation and improves overall program performance over the standard Solaris allocator by up to a factor of 60 on 14 processors, and up to a factor of 18 over the next best allocator we tested.","author":["Emery D.

Because hardware resources for branch-predictor tables are invariably limited, it is not possible to hold all relevant branch history for all active branches at the same time, especially for large workloads consisting of multiple processes and operating-system code. The problem that results, commonly referred to as aliasing in the branch-predictor tables, is in many ways similar to the misses that occur in finite-sized hardware caches.In this paper we propose a new classification for branch aliasing based on the three-Cs model for caches, and show that conflict aliasing is a significant source of mispredictions. Unfortunately, the obvious method for removing conflicts --- adding tags and associativity to the predictor tables --- is not a cost-effective solution.To address this problem, we propose the skewed branch predictor, a multi-bank, tag-less branch predictor, designed specifically to reduce the impact of conflict aliasing. Through both analytical and simulation models, we show that the skewed branch predictor removes a substantial portion of conflict aliasing by introducing redundancy to the branch-predictor tables. Although this redundancy increases capacity aliasing compared to a standard one-bank structure of comparable size, our simulations show that the reduction in conflict aliasing overcomes this effect to yield a gain in prediction accuracy. Alternatively, we show that a skewed organization can achieve the same prediction accuracy as a standard one-bank organization but with half the storage requirements.","author":["Pierre Michaud","Andr\u00e9 Seznec","Richard Uhlig"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 25","Issue 2","May 1997","pp   292\u2013303","https://doi.org/10.1145/384286.264211"],"date":"01 May 1997","ref":[{"text":"P.-Y.

A program on such machines consists of many sequential program segments, each executed by a single processor. These segments interact as they access shared variables. Access to memory is asynchronous, and memory accesses are not necessarily executed in the order they were issued. An execution is correct if it is sequentially consistent: It should seem as if all the instructions were executed sequentially, in an order obtained by interleaving the instruction streams of the processors. Sequential consistency can be enforced by delaying each access to shared memory until the previous access of the same processor has terminated. For performance reasons, however, we want to allow several accesses by the same processor to proceed concurrently. Our analysis finds a minimal set of delays that enforces sequential consistency. The analysis extends to interprocessor synchronization constraints and to code where blocks of operations have to execute atomically. We use a conflict graph similar to that used to schedule transactions in distributed databases.

Vast repositories of information are available on practically every possible topic. In such cases, it is valuable to perform topical resource discovery effectively. Consequently, several new ideas have been proposed in recent years; among them a key technique is focused crawling which is able to crawl particular topical portions of the World Wide Web quickly, without having to explore all web pages. In this paper, we propose the novel concept of intelligent crawling which actually learns characteristics of the linkage structure of the World Wide Web while performing the crawling. Specifically, the intelligent crawler uses the inlinking web page content, candidate URL structure, or other behaviors of the inlinking web pages or siblings in order to estimate the probability that a candidate is useful for a given crawl. This is a much more general framework than the focused crawling technique which is based on a pre-defined understanding of the topical structure of the web. The techniques discussed in this paper are applicable for crawling web pages which satisfy arbitrary user-defined predicates such as topical queries, keyword queries, or any combinations of the above. Unlike focused crawling, it is not necessary to provide representative topical examples, since the crawler can learn its way into the appropriate topic. We refer to this technique as intelligent crawling because of its adaptive nature in adjusting to the web page linkage structure. We discuss how to intelligently select features which are most useful for a given crawl. The learning crawler is capable of reusing the knowledge gained in a given crawl in order to provide more efficient crawling for closely related predicates.","author":["Charu C.

In this paper, we propose a new data clustering method based on partitioning the underlying bipartite graph. The partition is constructed by minimizing a normalized sum of edge weights between unmatched pairs of vertices of the bipartite graph. We show that an approximate solution to the minimization problem can be obtained by computing a partial singular value decomposition (SVD) of the associated edge weight matrix of the bipartite graph. We point out the connection of our clustering algorithm to correspondence analysis used in multivariate analysis. We also briefly discuss the issue of assigning data objects to multiple clusters. In the experimental results, we apply our clustering algorithm to the problem of document clustering to illustrate its effectiveness and efficiency.","author":["Hongyuan Zha","Xiaofeng He","Chris Ding","Horst Simon","Ming Gu"],"issue":["CIKM '01: Proceedings of the tenth international conference on Information and knowledge management","October 2001","Pages   25\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/502585.502591"],"date":"05 October 2001","ref":[{"text":"R.

In tuning the performance of their hardware implementation, designers manually apply loop transformations such as loop unrolling. designers manually apply loop transformations. For example, loop unrolling is used to expose instruction-level parallelism at the expense of more hardware resources for concurrent operator evaluation. Because unrolling also increases the amount of data a computation requires, too much unrolling can lead to a memory bound implementation where resources are idle. To negotiate inherent hardware space-time trade-offs, designers must engage in an iterative refinement cycle, at each step manually applying transformations and evaluating their impact. This process is not only error-prone and tedious but also prohibitively expensive given the large search spaces and with long synthesis times. This paper describes an automated approach to hardware design space exploration, through a collaboration between parallelizing compiler technology and high-level synthesis tools. We present a compiler algorithm that automatically explores the large design spaces resulting from the application of several program transformations commonly used in application-specific hardware designs. Our approach uses synthesis estimation techniques to quantitatively evaluate alternate designs for a loop nest computation. We have implemented this design space exploration algorithm in the context of a compilation and synthesis system called DEFACTO, and present results of this implementation on five multimedia kernels. Our algorithm derives an implementation that closely matches the performance of the fastest design in the design space, and among implementations with comparable performance, selects the smallest design. We search on average only 0.3% of the design space. This technology thus significantly raises the level of abstraction for hardware design and explores a design space much larger than is feasible for a human designer.","author":["Byoungro So","Mary W.

This unprecedented degree of parallelism will undoubtedly expose scalability limitations in existing applications, where scalability is the ability of a parallel algorithm on a parallel architecture to effectively utilize an increasing number of processors. Users will need precise and automated techniques for detecting the cause of limited scalability. This paper addresses this dilemma. First, we argue that users face numerous challenges in understanding application scalability: managing substantial amounts of experiment data, extracting useful trends from this data, and reconciling performance information with their applications design. Second, we propose a solution to automate this data analysis problem by applying fundamental statistical techniques to scalability experiment data. Finally, we evaluate our operational prototype on several applications, and show that statistical techniques offer an effective strategy for assessing application scalability. In particular, we find that non-parametric correlation of the number of tasks to the ratio of the time for communication operations to overall communication time provides a reliable measure for identifying communication operations that scale poorly.","author":["Jeffrey S.

This paper explores how to support energy as a first-class operating system resource. Energy, because of its global system nature, presents challenges beyond those of conventional resource management. To meet these challenges we propose the Currentcy Model that unifies energy accounting over diverse hardware components and enables fair allocation of available energy among applications. Our particular goal is to extend battery lifetime by limiting the average discharge rate and to share this limited resource among competing task according to user preferences. To demonstrate how our framework supports explicit control over the battery resource we implemented ECOSystem, a modified Linux, that incorporates our currentcy model. Experimental results show that ECOSystem accurately accounts for the energy consumed by asynchronous device operation, can achieve a target battery lifetime, and proportionally shares the limited energy resource among competing tasks.","author":["Heng Zeng","Carla S.

When the compiler cannot color the register conflict graph with a number of colors equal to the number of available machine registers, it must add code to spill and reload registers to and from storage. Previously the compiler produced spill code whose quality sometimes left much to be desired, and the ad hoe techniques used took considerable amounts of compile time. We have now discovered how to extend the graph coloring approach so that it naturally solves the spilling problem. Spill decisions are now made on the basis of the register conflict graph and cost estimates of the value of keeping the result of a computation in a register rather than in storage. This new approach produces better object code and takes much less compile time.","author":["G. J.

State space abstraction, having been essential for verifying designs of industrial complexity, is typically a manual process, requiring considerable creativity and insight.In this article, we present an automatic iterative abstraction-refinement methodology that extends symbolic model checking. In our method, the initial abstract model is generated by an automatic analysis of the control structures in the program to be verified. Abstract models may admit erroneous (or \"spurious\") counterexamples. We devise new symbolic techniques that analyze such counterexamples and refine the abstract model correspondingly. We describe aSMV, a prototype implementation of our methodology in NuSMV. Practical experiments including a large Fujitsu IP core design with about 500 latches and 10000 lines of SMV code confirm the effectiveness of our approach.","author":["Edmund Clarke","Orna Grumberg","Somesh Jha","Yuan Lu","Helmut Veith"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 50","Issue 5","September 2003","pp   752\u2013794","https://doi.org/10.1145/876638.876643"],"date":"01 September 2003","ref":[{"text":"Abdulla, P.

Simulating the full execution of a single industry standard benchmark at this level of detail takes on the order of months to complete. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that to properly perform an architectural evaluation requires multiple benchmarks to be evaluated across many separate runs. To address this issue we recently created a tool called SimPoint that automatically finds a small set of Simulation Points to represent the complete execution of a program for efficient and accurate simulation. In this paper we describe how to use the SimPoint tool, and introduce an improved SimPoint algorithm designed to significantly reduce the simulation time required when the simulation environment relies upon fast-forwarding.","author":["Erez Perelman","Greg Hamerly","Michael Van Biesbrouck","Timothy Sherwood","Brad Calder"],"issue":["ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review","Volume 31","Issue 1","June 2003","pp   318\u2013319","https://doi.org/10.1145/885651.781076"],"date":"10 June 2003","ref":[{"text":"T.

This paper describes the characterization of interconnect power in a state-of-the-art high-performance microprocessor designed for power efficiency. The analysis showed that interconnect power is over 50% of the dynamic power. Over 90% of the interconnect power is consumed by only 10% of the interconnections. Relations of interconnect power to wire length distribution and hierarchy level of nets were examined. In light of the results, a router's algorithms were modified, to use larger wire spacing and minimal length routing for the high power consuming interconnects. The power-aware router algorithm was tested on synthesized blocks, demonstrating average saving of 14% in the dynamic power consumption without timing degradation or area increase. The results demonstrate the obtainable benefits of tuning physical design algorithms to save power.","author":["Nir Magen","Avinoam Kolodny","Uri Weiser","Nachum Shamir"],"issue":["SLIP '04: Proceedings of the 2004 international workshop on System level interconnect prediction","February 2004","Pages   7\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/966747.966750"],"date":"14 February 2004","ref":[{"text":"Borkar, S.

Most existing proposals for software watermarking have the shortcoming that the mark can be destroyed via fairly straightforward semantics-preserving code transformations. This paper introduces path-based watermarking, a new approach to software watermarking based on the dynamic branching behavior of programs. The advantage of this technique is that error-correcting and tamper-proofing techniques can be used to make path-based watermarks resilient against a wide variety of attacks. Experimental results, using both Java bytecode and IA-32 native code, indicate that even relatively large watermarks can be embedded into programs at modest cost.","author":["C. Collberg","E.

In particular, the availability of multiple-cores, the abundance of main memory, the lack of user stalls, and the dominant use of stored procedures are factors that portend a clean-slate redesign of RDBMSs. This previous work showed that such a redesign has the potential to outperform legacy OLTP databases by a significant factor. These results, however, were obtained using a bare-bones prototype that was developed just to demonstrate the potential of such a system. We have since set out to design a more complete execution platform, and to implement some of the ideas presented in the original paper. Our demonstration presented here provides insight on the development of a distributed main memory OLTP database and allows for the further study of the challenges inherent in this operating environment.","author":["Robert Kallman","Hideaki Kimura","Jonathan Natkins","Andrew Pavlo","Alexander Rasin","Stanley Zdonik","Evan P.

It is one of the most heavily studied problems in data stream mining, dating back to the 1980s. Many applications rely directly or indirectly on finding the frequent items, and implementations are in use in large scale industrial systems. However, there has not been much comparison of the different methods under uniform experimental conditions. It is common to find papers touching on this topic in which important related work is mischaracterized, overlooked, or reinvented.In this paper, we aim to present the most important algorithms for this problem in a common framework. We have created baseline implementations of the algorithms, and used these to perform a thorough experimental study of their properties. We give empirical evidence that there is considerable variation in the performance of frequent items algorithms. The best methods can be implemented to find frequent items with high accuracy using only tens of kilobytes of memory, at rates of millions of items per second on cheap modern hardware.","author":["Graham Cormode","Marios Hadjieleftheriou"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 1","Issue 2","August 2008","pp   1530\u20131541","https://doi.org/10.14778/1454159.1454225"],"date":"01 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"N.

With the emergence of cloud computing, the use of an analytical query processing infrastructure (e.g., Amazon EC2) can be directly mapped to monetary value. MapReduce has been a popular framework in the context of cloud computing, designed to serve long running queries (jobs) which can be processed in batch mode. Taking into account that different jobs often perform similar work, there are many opportunities for sharing. In principle, sharing similar work reduces the overall amount of work, which can lead to reducing monetary charges incurred while utilizing the processing infrastructure. In this paper we propose a sharing framework tailored to MapReduce.Our framework, MRShare, transforms a batch of queries into a new batch that will be executed more efficiently, by merging jobs into groups and evaluating each group as a single query. Based on our cost model for MapReduce, we define an optimization problem and we provide a solution that derives the optimal grouping of queries. Experiments in our prototype, built on top of Hadoop, demonstrate the overall effectiveness of our approach and substantial savings.","author":["Tomasz Nykiel","Michalis Potamias","Chaitanya Mishra","George Kollios","Nick Koudas"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   494\u2013505","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920906"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"Amazon EC2. http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/.","order":1},{"text":"Blogscope. http://www.blogscope.net/.","order":2},{"text":"Hadoop project. http://hadoop.apache.org/.","order":3},{"text":"Saving energy in datacenters. http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/datacenters/.","order":4},{"text":"A.

Although there is a substantial body of related work exploring how to select an appropriate set of MVs and indexes for a given workload, none of this work has explored the effect of correlated attributes (e.g., attributes encoding related geographic information) on designs. Our tool identifies a set of MVs and secondary indexes such that correlations between the clustered attributes of the MVs and the secondary indexes are enhanced, which can dramatically improve query performance. It uses a form of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) called ILP Feedback to pick the best set of MVs and indexes for given database size constraints. We compare our tool with a state-of-the-art commercial database designer on two workloads, APB-1 and SSB (Star Schema Benchmark---similar to TPC-H). Our results show that a correlation-aware database designer can improve query performance up to 6 times within the same space budget when compared to a commercial database designer.","author":["Hideaki Kimura","George Huo","Alexander Rasin","Samuel Madden","Stanley B.

This general problem has applications in many domains that can utilize human intelligence, including curation of hierarchies, debugging workflows, image segmentation and categorization, interactive search and filter synthesis. To our knowledge, this work provides the first formal algorithmic study of the optimization of human computation for this problem. We study various dimensions of the problem space, providing algorithms and complexity results. We also compare the performance of our algorithm against other algorithms, for the problem of webpage categorization on a real taxonomy. Our framework and algorithms can be used in the design of an optimizer for crowd-sourcing platforms such as Mechanical Turk.","author":["Aditya Parameswaran","Anish Das Sarma","Hector Garcia-Molina","Neoklis Polyzotis","Jennifer Widom"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 4","Issue 5","February 2011","pp   267\u2013278","https://doi.org/10.14778/1952376.1952377"],"date":"01 February 2011","ref":[{"text":"A.

The availability of documents in multiple languages also opens up new opportunities for querying structured Wikipedia content, and in particular, to enable answers that straddle different languages. As a step towards supporting such queries, in this paper, we propose a method for identifying mappings between attributes from infoboxes that come from pages in different languages. Our approach finds mappings in a completely automated fashion. Because it does not require training data, it is scalable: not only can it be used to find mappings between many language pairs, but it is also effective for languages that are under-represented and lack sufficient training samples. Another important benefit of our approach is that it does not depend on syntactic similarity between attribute names, and thus, it can be applied to language pairs that have distinct morphologies. We have performed an extensive experimental evaluation using a corpus consisting of pages in Portuguese, Vietnamese, and English. The results show that not only does our approach obtain high precision and recall, but it also outperforms state-of-the-art techniques. We also present a case study which demonstrates that the multilingual mappings we derive lead to substantial improvements in answer quality and coverage for structured queries over Wikipedia content.","author":["Thanh Nguyen","Viviane Moreira","Huong Nguyen","Hoa Nguyen","Juliana Freire"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 5","Issue 2","October 2011","pp   133\u2013144","https://doi.org/10.14778/2078324.2078329"],"date":"01 October 2011","ref":[{"text":"E.

Applications using large RDF data demand efficient data partitioning solutions for supporting RDF data access on a cluster of compute nodes. In this paper we present a novel semantic hash partitioning approach and implement a Semantic HAsh Partitioning-Enabled distributed RDF data management system, called Shape. This paper makes three original contributions. First, the semantic hash partitioning approach we propose extends the simple hash partitioning method through direction-based triple groups and direction-based triple replications. The latter enhances the former by controlled data replication through intelligent utilization of data access locality, such that queries over big RDF graphs can be processed with zero or very small amount of inter-machine communication cost. Second, we generate locality-optimized query execution plans that are more efficient than popular multi-node RDF data management systems by effectively minimizing the inter-machine communication cost for query processing. Third but not the least, we provide a suite of locality-aware optimization techniques to further reduce the partition size and cut down on the inter-machine communication cost during distributed query processing. Experimental results show that our system scales well and can process big RDF datasets more efficiently than existing approaches.","author":["Kisung Lee","Ling Liu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 14","September 2013","pp   1894\u20131905","https://doi.org/10.14778/2556549.2556571"],"date":"01 September 2013","ref":[{"text":"About FacetedDBLP. http://dblp.l3s.de/dblp++.php.","order":1},{"text":"BTC 2012. http://km.aifb.kit.edu/projects/btc-2012/.","order":2},{"text":"Linking Open Data. http://www.w3.org/wiki/SweoIG /TaskForces/CommunityProjects/LinkingOpenData.","order":3},{"text":"METIS. http://www.cs.umn.edu/~metis.","order":4},{"text":"RDF. http://www.w3.org/RDF/.","order":5},{"text":"SPARQL. http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/.","order":6},{"text":"O.

In addition, they argue that determinism yields performance benefits due to (1) the introduction of deadlock avoidance techniques, (2) the reduction (or elimination) of distributed commit protocols, and (3) light-weight locking. However, these performance benefits are not universally applicable, and there exist several disadvantages of determinism, including (1) the additional overhead of processing transactions for which it is not known in advance what data will be accessed, (2) an inability to abort transactions arbitrarily (e.g., in the case of database or partition overload), and (3) the increased latency required by a preprocessing layer that ensures that the same input is sent to every replica. This paper presents a thorough experimental study that carefully investigates both the advantages and disadvantages of determinism, in order to give a database user a more complete understanding of which database to use for a given database workload and cluster configuration.","author":["Kun Ren","Alexander Thomson","Daniel J.

However, real-world graphs from different domains have very different characteristics, which often create bottlenecks in vertex-centric parallel graph computation. We identify three such important characteristics from a wide spectrum of real-world graphs, namely (1)skewed degree distribution, (2)large diameter, and (3)(relatively) high density. Among them, only (1) has been studied by existing systems, but many real-world power-law graphs also exhibit the characteristics of (2) and (3). In this paper, we propose a block-centric framework, called Blogel, which naturally handles all the three adverse graph characteristics. Blogel programmers may think like a block and develop efficient algorithms for various graph problems. We propose parallel algorithms to partition an arbitrary graph into blocks efficiently, and block-centric programs are then run over these blocks. Our experiments on large real-world graphs verified that Blogel is able to achieve orders of magnitude performance improvements over the state-of-the-art distributed graph computing systems.","author":["Da Yan","James Cheng","Yi Lu","Wilfred Ng"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 14","October 2014","pp   1981\u20131992","https://doi.org/10.14778/2733085.2733103"],"date":"01 October 2014","ref":[{"text":"C.

Many applications today call for the management and query capabilities directly on graphs. Real time graph streams, as seen in road networks, social and communication networks, and web requests, are such applications. Event pattern matching requires the awareness of graph structures, which is different from traditional complex event processing. It also requires a focus on the dynamicity of the graph, time order constraints in patterns, and online query processing, which deviates significantly from previous work on subgraph matching as well. We study the semantics and efficient online algorithms for this important and intriguing problem, and evaluate our approaches with extensive experiments over real world datasets in four different domains.","author":["Chunyao Song","Tingjian Ge","Cindy Chen","Jie Wang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 4","December 2014","pp   413\u2013424","https://doi.org/10.14778/2735496.2735504"],"date":"01 December 2014","ref":[{"text":"C.

In practice it is often also of interest how metrics change over time, e.g., to find trends. For this purpose, algorithms must be executed for multiple graph snapshots.We present Single Algorithm Multiple Snapshots (SAMS), a novel approach to execute algorithms concurrently for multiple graph snapshots. SAMS automatically transforms graph algorithms to leverage similarities between the analyzed graph snapshots. The automatic transformation interleaves algorithm executions on multiple snapshots, synergistically shares their graph accesses and traversals, and optimizes the algorithm's data layout. Thus, SAMS can amortize the cost of random data accesses and improve memory bandwidth utilization---two main cost factors in graph analytics. We extensively evaluate SAMS using six well-known algorithms and multiple synthetic as well as real-world graph datasets. Our measurements show that in multi-snapshot analyses, SAMS offers runtime improvements of up to two orders of magnitude over traditional snapshot-at-a-time execution.","author":["Manuel Then","Timo Kersten","Stephan G\u00fcnnemann","Alfons Kemper","Thomas Neumann"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 8","April 2017","pp   877\u2013888","https://doi.org/10.14778/3090163.3090166"],"date":"01 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"J.

Our work has two major goals: to enable SPHINX to adapt to changes in microphone and acoustical environment, and to improve the performance of SPHINX when it is trained and tested using a desk-top microphone. This talk will describe some of our work in acoustical pre-processing techniques, specifically spectral normalization and spectral subtraction performed using an efficient pair of algorithms that operate primarily in the cepstral domain. The effects of these signal processing algorithms on the recognition accuracy of the Sphinx speech recognition system was compared using speech simultaneously recorded from two types of microphones: the standard close-talking Sennheiser HMD224 microphone and the desk-top Crown PZM6fs microphone. A naturally-elicited alphanumeric speech database was used. In initial results using the stereo alphanumeric database, we found that both the spectral subtraction and spectral normalization algorithms were able to provide very substantial improvements in recognition accuracy when the system was trained on the close-talking microphone and tested on the desk-top microphone, or vice versa. Improving the recognition accuracy of the system when trained and tested on the desk-top microphone remains a difficult problem requiring more sophisticated noise suppression techniques.","author":["Richard M.

Successful examples include subword models with many smoothing techniques. In comparison with subword models, subphonetic modeling may provide a finer level of details. We propose to model subphonetic events with Markov states and treat the state in phonetic hidden Markov models as our basic sub-phonetic unit --- senone. A word model is a concatenation of state-dependent senones and senones can be shared across different word models. Senones not only allow parameter sharing, but also enable pronunciation optimization and new word learning, where the phonetic baseform is replaced by the senonic baseform. In this paper, we report preliminary subphonetic modeling results, which not only significantly reduced the word error rate for speaker-independent continuous speech recognition but also demonstrated a novel application for new word learning.","author":["Mei-Yuh Hwang","Xuedong Huang"],"issue":["HLT '91: Proceedings of the workshop on Speech and Natural Language","February 1992","Pages   174\u2013179","https://doi.org/10.3115/1075527.1075566"],"date":"23 February 1992","ref":[{"text":"Schwartz, R., Chow, Y., Kimball, O., Roucos, S., Krasner, M., and Makhoul, J.

Second, the ordering of target words in such systems does not respect linguistic phrase boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose to use automatically learned rewrite patterns to preprocess the source sentences so that they have a word order similar to that of the target language. Our system is a hybrid one. The basic model is statistical, but we use broad-coverage rule-based parsers in two ways - during training for learning rewrite patterns, and at runtime for reordering the source sentences.

For example, words such as good, beautiful, and wonderful are considered as positive words; whereas words such as bad, ugly, and sad are considered negative words. We treat polarity detection as a semi-supervised label propagation problem in a graph. In the graph, each node represents a word whose polarity is to be determined. Each weighted edge encodes a relation that exists between two words. Each node (word) can have two labels: positive or negative. We study this framework in two different resource availability scenarios using WordNet and OpenOffice thesaurus when WordNet is not available. We report our results on three different languages: English, French, and Hindi. Our results indicate that label propagation improves significantly over the baseline and other semi-supervised learning methods like Mincuts and Randomized Mincuts for this task.","author":["Tao Li","Yi Zhang","Vikas Sindhwani"],"issue":["ACL '09: Proceedings of the Joint Conference of the 47th Annual Meeting of the ACL and the 4th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing of the AFNLP: Volume 1 - Volume 1","August 2009","Pages   244\u2013252"],"date":"02 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"J.

Adaptor grammars are a framework for defining a variety of hierarchical nonparametric Bayesian models. This paper investigates some of the choices that arise in formulating adaptor grammars and associated inference procedures, and shows that they can have a dramatic impact on performance in an unsupervised word segmentation task. With appropriate adaptor grammars and inference procedures we achieve an 87% word token f-score on the standard Brent version of the Bernstein-Ratner corpus, which is an error reduction of over 35% over the best previously reported results for this corpus.","author":["Mark Johnson","Sharon Goldwater"],"issue":["NAACL '09: Proceedings of Human Language Technologies: The 2009 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics","May 2009","Pages   317\u2013325"],"date":"31 May 2009","ref":[{"text":"N.

Based on a theory of \"emergent literacy\", this paper describes a toy -- TellTale -- designed to let young children create, share and edit oral language in a way similar to how they will eventually create written language. Two user studies were conducted. The first suggests that paired children of different SES use different social and linguistic strategies to establish cohesion and that purely syntactic measures of narrative coherence are not sensitive enough to describe children's collaborative language play. A second pilot study investigated how groups of children used TellTale. Although results are not conclusive, TellTale also seems to be an engaging interface for group authorship.","author":["Mike Ananny"],"issue":["CSCL '02: Proceedings of the Conference on Computer Support for Collaborative Learning: Foundations for a CSCL Community","January 2002","Pages   595\u2013596"],"date":"07 January 2002","ref":[{"text":"Ananny, M.&amp;J.

The video analytics of traditional approaches for detection, tracking and pattern recognition of moving objects used only in the cloud. This approach suffered from high latency and more network bandwidth to transfer data into the cloud. We address this problem by using edge computing devices between IoT devices and the cloud. We propose a new framework for scalable object detection, tracking and pattern recognition of moving objects that relies on dimensionality reduction with edge computing architecture. We also propose a scalable object detection and tracking method based on You Only Look Once (YOLO) method. The experiment demonstrates that our proposed method will save network bandwidth and processing time. The performance of object detection and tracking model is greater than 96%. This shows that our method has greater performance than existing models.","author":["Dipak Pudasaini","Abdolreza Abhari"],"issue":["SpringSim '20: Proceedings of the 2020 Spring Simulation Conference","May 2020","Article No.: 17","Pages   1\u201311"],"date":"19 May 2020","ref":[{"text":"Abhari, A., S.
