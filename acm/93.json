The process typically involves segmenting images into regions and tracking these regions across image sequences. Neither of these tasks can be performed reliably in practice; consequently, colorization requires considerable user intervention and remains a tedious, time-consuming, and expensive task.In this paper we present a simple colorization method that requires neither precise image segmentation, nor accurate region tracking. Our method is based on a simple premise; neighboring pixels in space-time that have similar intensities should have similar colors. We formalize this premise using a quadratic cost function and obtain an optimization problem that can be solved efficiently using standard techniques. In our approach an artist only needs to annotate the image with a few color scribbles, and the indicated colors are automatically propagated in both space and time to produce a fully colorized image or sequence. We demonstrate that high quality colorizations of stills and movie clips may be obtained from a relatively modest amount of user input.","author":["Anat Levin","Dani Lischinski","Yair Weiss"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 23","Issue 3","August 2004","pp   689\u2013694","https://doi.org/10.1145/1015706.1015780"],"date":"01 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"BURNS, G.

Its flexibility is achieved primarily through the use of inheritance and design patterns (object-oriented programming). Performance is obtained by using templates that enable generation of efficient code for sections critical to performance (generic programming). The framework encapsulates important optimizations that can be used by developers, such as parallelism in the force computation. Its design is based on domain analysis of numerical integrators for molecular dynamics (MD) and of fast solvers for the force computation, particularly due to electrostatic interactions. Several new and efficient algorithms are implemented in ProtoMol. Finally, it is shown that ProtoMol's sequential performance is excellent when compared to a leading MD program, and that it scales well for moderate number of processors.

However, the query results may be erroneous due to concurrent source updates. State-of-the-art maintenance strategies typically apply compensations to resolve such conflicts and assume all source schemata remain stable over time. In a loosely coupled dynamic environment, the sources may autonomously change not only their data but also their schema or semantics. Consequently, either the maintenance or the compensation queries may be broken. Unlike compensation-based approaches found in the literature, we instead model the complete materialized view maintenance process as a view maintenance transaction (VM_Transaction). This way, the anomaly problem can be rephrased as the serializability of VM_Transactions. To achieve VM_Transaction serializability, we propose a multiversion concurrency control algorithm, called TxnWrap, which is shown to be the appropriate design for loosely coupled environments with autonomous data sources. TxnWrap is complementary to the maintenance algorithms proposed in the literature, since it removes concurrency issues from consideration allowing the designer to focus on the maintenance logic. We show several optimizations of TxnWrap, in particular, (1) space optimizations on versioned data materialization and (2) parallel maintenance scheduling. With these optimizations, TxnWrap even outperforms state-of-the-art view maintenance solutions in terms of refresh time. Further, several design choices of TxnWrap are studied each having its respective advantages for certain environmental settings. A correctness proof based on transaction theory for TxnWrap is also provided. Last, we have implemented TxnWrap. The experimental results confirm that TxnWrap achieves predictable performance under a varying rate of concurrency.","author":["Songting Chen","Bin Liu","Elke A.

Organizing the computation into streams and exploiting the resulting locality using a register hierarchy enables a stream architecture to reduce the memory bandwidth required by representative applications by an order of magnitude or more. Hence a processing node with a fixed bandwidth (expensive) can support an order of magnitude more arithmetic units (inexpensive). This in turn allows a given level of performance to be achieved with fewer nodes (a 1-PFLOPS machine, for example, with just 8,192 nodes) resulting in greater reliability, and simpler system management. We sketch the design of Merrimac, a streaming scientific computer that can be scaled from a $20K 2 TFLOPS workstation to a $20M 2 PFLOPS supercomputer and present the results of some initial application experiments on this architecture.","author":["William J.

The essence of the new approach is the addition of a set of design and timing constraints which encodes the author's signature. The constraints are selected in such a way that they result in a minimal hardware overhead while embedding a unique signature that is difficult to remove and forge. Techniques are applicable in conjunction with an arbitrary behavioral synthesis task such as scheduling, assignment, allocation, transformation, and template matching.On a large set of design examples, studies indicate the effectiveness of the new approach that results in signature data that is highly resilient, difficult to detect and remove, and yet is easy to verify and can be embedded in designs with very low hardware overhead. For example, the probability that the same design with the embedded signature is obtained by any other designers by themselves is less than 1 in 10102, and no register overhead was incurred. The probability of tampering, the probability that part of the embedded signature can be removed by random attempts, is shown to be extremely low, and the watermark is additionally protected from such tampering with error-correcting codes.","author":["Farinaz Koushanfar","Inki Hong","Miodrag Potkonjak"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 10","Issue 3","July 2005","pp   523\u2013545","https://doi.org/10.1145/1080334.1080338"],"date":"01 July 2005","ref":[{"text":"Anderson, R. and Kuhn, M. 1996.

These measurements are generated continuously and in a very high fluctuating data rates. Examples include sensor networks, web logs, and computer network traffic. The storage, querying and mining of such data sets are highly computationally challenging tasks. Mining data streams is concerned with extracting knowledge structures represented in models and patterns in non stopping streams of information. The research in data stream mining has gained a high attraction due to the importance of its applications and the increasing generation of streaming information. Applications of data stream analysis can vary from critical scientific and astronomical applications to important business and financial ones. Algorithms, systems and frameworks that address streaming challenges have been developed over the past three years. In this review paper, we present the state-of-the-art in this growing vital field.","author":["Mohamed Medhat Gaber","Arkady Zaslavsky","Shonali Krishnaswamy"],"issue":["ACM SIGMOD Record","Volume 34","Issue 2","June 2005","pp   18\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/1083784.1083789"],"date":"01 June 2005","ref":[{"text":"C.

For example, cluster-based retrieval has been studied since the 60s and has recently produced good results in the language model framework. An approach to building topic models based on a formal generative model of documents, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), is heavily cited in the machine learning literature, but its feasibility and effectiveness in information retrieval is mostly unknown. In this paper, we study how to efficiently use LDA to improve ad-hoc retrieval. We propose an LDA-based document model within the language modeling framework, and evaluate it on several TREC collections. Gibbs sampling is employed to conduct approximate inference in LDA and the computational complexity is analyzed. We show that improvements over retrieval using cluster-based models can be obtained with reasonable efficiency.","author":["Xing Wei","W.

We study policies for setting the speed of the processor for both of the goals of minimizing the energy used and the maximum temperature attained. The theoretical study of speed scaling policies to manage energy was initiated in a seminal paper by Yao et al. [1995], and we adopt their setting. We assume that the power required to run at speed s is P(s) = s\u03b1 for some constant \u03b1 > 1. We assume a collection of tasks, each with a release time, a deadline, and an arbitrary amount of work that must be done between the release time and the deadline. Yao et al. [1995] gave an offline greedy algorithm YDS to compute the minimum energy schedule. They further proposed two online algorithms Average Rate (AVR) and Optimal Available (OA), and showed that AVR is 2\u03b1 \u2212 1 \u03b1\u03b1-competitive with respect to energy. We provide a tight \u03b1\u03b1 bound on the competitive ratio of OA with respect to energy.We initiate the study of speed scaling to manage temperature. We assume that the environment has a fixed ambient temperature and that the device cools according to Newton's law of cooling. We observe that the maximum temperature can be approximated within a factor of two by the maximum energy used over any interval of length 1/b, where b is the cooling parameter of the device. We define a speed scaling policy to be cooling-oblivious if it is simultaneously constant-competitive with respect to temperature for all cooling parameters. We then observe that cooling-oblivious algorithms are also constant-competitive with respect to energy, maximum speed and maximum power. We show that YDS is a cooling-oblivious algorithm. In contrast, we show that the online algorithms OA and AVR are not cooling-oblivious. We then propose a new online algorithm that we call BKP. We show that BKP is cooling-oblivious. We further show that BKP is e-competitive with respect to the maximum speed, and that no deterministic online algorithm can have a better competitive ratio. BKP also has a lower competitive ratio for energy than OA for \u03b1 \u22655.Finally, we show that the optimal temperature schedule can be computed offline in polynomial-time using the Ellipsoid algorithm.","author":["Nikhil Bansal","Tracy Kimbrel","Kirk Pruhs"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 54","Issue 1","March 2007","Article No.: 3","pp   1\u201339","https://doi.org/10.1145/1206035.1206038"],"date":"01 March 2007","ref":[{"text":"Apple. 2005.

In this paper we present a new image completion algorithm powered by a huge database of photographs gathered from the Web. The algorithm patches up holes in images by finding similar image regions in the database that are not only seamless but also semantically valid. Our chief insight is that while the space of images is effectively infinite, the space of semantically differentiable scenes is actually not that large. For many image completion tasks we are able to find similar scenes which contain image fragments that will convincingly complete the image. Our algorithm is entirely data-driven, requiring no annotations or labelling by the user. Unlike existing image completion methods, our algorithm can generate a diverse set of results for each input image and we allow users to select among them. We demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over existing image completion approaches.","author":["James Hays","Alexei A.

Based on this framework, we present a novel design to reconstruct the 4D light field from a 2D camera image without any additional refractive elements as required by previous light field cameras. The patterned mask attenuates light rays inside the camera instead of bending them, and the attenuation recoverably encodes the rays on the 2D sensor. Our mask-equipped camera focuses just as a traditional camera to capture conventional 2D photos at full sensor resolution, but the raw pixel values also hold a modulated 4D light field. The light field can be recovered by rearranging the tiles of the 2D Fourier transform of sensor values into 4D planes, and computing the inverse Fourier transform. In addition, one can also recover the full resolution image information for the in-focus parts of the scene.We also show how a broadband mask placed at the lens enables us to compute refocused images at full sensor resolution for layered Lambertian scenes. This partial encoding of 4D ray-space data enables editing of image contents by depth, yet does not require computational recovery of the complete 4D light field.","author":["Ashok Veeraraghavan","Ramesh Raskar","Amit Agrawal","Ankit Mohan","Jack Tumblin"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 26","Issue 3","July 2007","pp   69\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.1145/1276377.1276463"],"date":"29 July 2007","ref":[{"text":"Accorsi, R., Gasparini, F., and Lanza, R.

For the first time the technique exploits the capacitive coupling effect in a floating-body PD/SOI device to dynamically boost the virtual array supply voltage during Read operation, thus improving the Read performance, Read/half-select stability, and Vmin. This enables significant reduction of the standby cell power and circuit active power in a single supply methodology. The performance and parametric yield improvements in the presence of variability are analyzed/validated using precise and fast Monte Carlo statistical circuit simulations with mixture importance sampling. Fabricated column-based 65nm PD/SOI SRAM circuits are confirmed with simulations and physical analysis and are shown to operate at 0.4 V. to 0.5V.","author":["Rajiv Joshi","Rouwaida Kanj","Keunwoo Kim","Richard Williams","Ching-Te Chuang"],"issue":["ISLPED '07: Proceedings of the 2007 international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2007","Pages   8\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/1283780.1283784"],"date":"27 August 2007","ref":[{"text":"Y.

For a typical data center, storage accounts for 27% of energy consumption. Conventional server-class RAIDs cannot easily reduce power because loads are balanced to use all disks, even for light loads.We have built the power-aware RAID (PARAID), which reduces energy use of commodity server-class disks without specialized hardware. PARAID uses a skewed striping pattern to adapt to the system load by varying the number of powered disks. By spinning disks down during light loads, PARAID can reduce power consumption, while still meeting performance demands, by matching the number of powered disks to the system load. Reliability is achieved by limiting disk power cycles and using different RAID encoding schemes. Based on our five-disk prototype, PARAID uses up to 34% less power than conventional RAIDs while achieving similar performance and reliability.","author":["Charles Weddle","Mathew Oldham","Jin Qian","An-I Andy Wang","Peter Reiher","Geoff Kuenning"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 3","Issue 3","October 2007","pp   13\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.1145/1288783.1289721"],"date":"01 October 2007","ref":[{"text":"Adb-el-Malek, M., Courtright II, W.

Objections to its use fall into two main categories: first, that clustering is too slow for large corpora (with running time often quadratic in the number of documents); and second, that clustering does not appreciably improve retrieval.\nWe argue that these problems arise only when clustering is used in an attempt to improve conventional search techniques. However, looking at clustering as an information access tool in its own right obviates these objections, and provides a powerful new access paradigm. We present a document browsing technique that employs document clustering as its primary operation. We also present fast (linear time) clustering algorithms which support this interactive browsing paradigm.","author":["Douglass R. Cutting","David R. Karger","Jan O. Pedersen","John W.

The first uses a pipelining approach and achieves speedups of 1.3x on two processing cores. The second uses a parallel moves approach and achieves speedups of 2.2x on four cores. Unlike all previous parallel moves algorithms, ours is deterministic and always gives the same answer as the serial version of the algorithm, without any significant reduction in performance. We also describe a process to quantify multi-core performance effects, such as memory subsystem limitations and explicit synchronization overhead, and fully describe these effects on a CAD tool for the first time. Memory limitations alone are found to cost up to 35% of total runtime. Unlike previous algorithms, our algorithms have negligible explicit synchronization overhead. These results are relevant to both CAD designers and to any developers seeking to parallelize existing software.","author":["Adrian Ludwin","Vaughn Betz","Ketan Padalia"],"issue":["FPGA '08: Proceedings of the 16th international ACM/SIGDA symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2008","Pages   14\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/1344671.1344676"],"date":"24 February 2008","ref":[{"text":"H.

Motivated by this need recently we have seen several new algorithms to tackle this problem based on the (frequent) pattern mining paradigm. A limitation of most of these methods is that they are highly sensitive to parameter settings, rely on exhaustive enumeration with exponential time complexity, and often fail to help the users understand the underlying distribution of components embedded within the host graph. In this article we propose an approximate algorithm, to mine and visualize cohesive subgraphs (dense sub components) within a large graph. The approach, refereed to as Cohesive Subgraph Visualization (CSV) relies on a novel mapping strategy that maps edges and nodes to a multi-dimensional space wherein dense areas in the mapped space correspond to cohesive subgraphs. The algorithm then walks through the dense regions in the mapped space to output a visual plot that effectively captures the overall dense sub-component distribution of the graph. Unlike extant algorithms with exponential complexity, CSV has a complexity of O(V2logV) when fixing the parameter mapping dimension, where V corresponds to the number of vertices in the graph, although for many real datasets the performance is typically sub-quadratic. We demonstrate the utility of CSV as a stand-alone tool for visual graph exploration and as a pre-filtering step to significantly scale up exact subgraph mining algorithms such as CLAN.","author":["Nan Wang","Srinivasan Parthasarathy","Kian-Lee Tan","Anthony K.

In this paper, we propose a simple, efficient, and effective discriminative parameter learning method, called Discriminative Frequency Estimate (DFE), which learns parameters by discriminatively computing frequencies from data. Empirical studies show that the DFE algorithm integrates the advantages of both generative and discriminative learning: it performs as well as the state-of-the-art discriminative parameter learning method ELR in accuracy, but is significantly more efficient.","author":["Jiang Su","Harry Zhang","Charles X.

Basic operations such as droplet dispensing, mixing, dilution, localized heating, and incubation can be carried out using a two-dimensional array of electrodes and nanoliter volumes of liquid. The number of independent input pins used to control the electrodes in such microfluidic \"biochips\" is an important cost-driver, especially for disposable PCB devices that are being developed for clinical and point-of-care diagnostics. However, most prior work on biochip design-automation has assumed independent control of the electrodes using a large number of input pins. Another limitation of prior work is that the mapping of control pins to electrodes is only applicable for a specific bioassay. We present a broadcast-addressing-based design technique for pin-constrained multi-functional biochips. The proposed method provides high throughput for bioassays and it reduces the number of control pins by identifying and connecting control pins with \"compatible\" actuation sequences. The proposed method is evaluated using a multifunctional chip designed to execute a set of multiplexed bioassays, the polymerase chain reaction, and a protein dilution assay.","author":["Tao Xu","Krishnendu Chakrabarty"],"issue":["DAC '08: Proceedings of the 45th annual Design Automation Conference","June 2008","Pages   173\u2013178","https://doi.org/10.1145/1391469.1391514"],"date":"08 June 2008","ref":[{"text":"Fair, R.

The fundamental idea behind Morse theory is that of combining the topological exploration of a shape with quantitative measurement of geometrical properties provided by a real function defined on the shape. The added value of approaches based on Morse theory is in the possibility of adopting different functions as shape descriptors according to the properties and invariants that one wishes to analyze. In this sense, Morse theory allows one to construct a general framework for shape characterization, parametrized with respect to the mapping function used, and possibly the space associated with the shape. The mapping function plays the role of a lens through which we look at the properties of the shape, and different functions provide different insights.In the last decade, an increasing number of methods that are rooted in Morse theory and make use of properties of real-valued functions for describing shapes have been proposed in the literature. The methods proposed range from approaches which use the configuration of contours for encoding topographic surfaces to more recent work on size theory and persistent homology. All these have been developed over the years with a specific target domain and it is not trivial to systematize this work and understand the links, similarities, and differences among the different methods. Moreover, different terms have been used to denote the same mathematical constructs, which often overwhelm the understanding of the underlying common framework.The aim of this survey is to provide a clear vision of what has been developed so far, focusing on methods that make use of theoretical frameworks that are developed for classes of real functions rather than for a single function, even if they are applied in a restricted manner. The term geometrical-topological used in the title is meant to underline that both levels of information content are relevant for the applications of shape descriptions: geometrical, or metrical, properties and attributes are crucial for characterizing specific instances of features, while topological properties are necessary to abstract and classify shapes according to invariant aspects of their geometry. The approaches surveyed will be discussed in detail, with respect to theory, computation, and application. Several properties of the shape descriptors will be analyzed and compared. We believe this is a crucial step to exploit fully the potential of such approaches in many applications, as well as to identify important areas of future research.","author":["S. Biasotti","L.

Especially the availability of nodes, the sensor coverage, and the connectivity have been included in discussions on network lifetime. Even quality of service measures can be reduced to lifetime considerations. A great number of algorithms and methods were proposed to increase the lifetime of a sensor network\u2014while their evaluations were always based on a particular definition of network lifetime. Motivated by the great differences in existing definitions of sensor network lifetime that are used in relevant publications, we reviewed the state of the art in lifetime definitions, their differences, advantages, and limitations. This survey was the starting point for our work towards a generic definition of sensor network lifetime for use in analytic evaluations as well as in simulation models\u2014focusing on a formal and concise definition of accumulated network lifetime and total network lifetime. Our definition incorporates the components of existing lifetime definitions, and introduces some additional measures. One new concept is the ability to express the service disruption tolerance of a network. Another new concept is the notion of time-integration: in many cases, it is sufficient if a requirement is fulfilled over a certain period of time, instead of at every point in time. In addition, we combine coverage and connectivity to form a single requirement called connected coverage. We show that connected coverage is different from requiring noncombined coverage and connectivity. Finally, our definition also supports the concept of graceful degradation by providing means of estimating the degree of compliance with the application requirements. We demonstrate the applicability of our definition based on the surveyed lifetime definitions as well as using some example scenarios to explain the various aspects influencing sensor network lifetime.","author":["Isabel Dietrich","Falko Dressler"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks","Volume 5","Issue 1","February 2009","Article No.: 5","pp   1\u201339","https://doi.org/10.1145/1464420.1464425"],"date":"11 February 2009","ref":[{"text":"Akkaya, K. and Younis, M. 2005.

Also, efficient search mechanisms are needed to handle large data bases within concurrent processing and on-line response limits. The implementation of these requirements results in software complexities and inefficiencies in the following way. Pointer mechanisms for mapping structures and providing fast access paths have to be implemented by software and data.

Unfortunately, concurrent programs are prone to bugs. Among different types of concurrency bugs, atomicity violation bugs are common and important. Existing techniques to detect atomicity violation bugs suffer from one limitation: requiring bugs to manifest during monitored runs, which is an open problem in concurrent program testing.This paper makes two contributions. First, it studies the interleaving characteristics of the common practice in concurrent program testing (i.e., running a program over and over) to understand why atomicity violation bugs are hard to expose. Second, it proposes CTrigger to effectively and efficiently expose atomicity violation bugs in large programs. CTrigger focuses on a special type of interleavings (i.e., unserializable interleavings) that are inherently correlated to atomicity violation bugs, and uses trace analysis to systematically identify (likely) feasible unserializable interleavings with low occurrence-probability. CTrigger then uses minimum execution perturbation to exercise low-probability interleavings and expose difficult-to-catch atomicity violation.We evaluate CTrigger with real-world atomicity violation bugs from four sever/desktop applications (Apache, MySQL, Mozilla, and PBZIP2) and three SPLASH2 applications on 8-core machines. CTrigger efficiently exposes the tested bugs within 1--235 seconds, two to four orders of magnitude faster than stress testing. Without CTrigger, some of these bugs do not manifest even after 7 full days of stress testing. In addition, without deterministic replay support, once a bug is exposed, CTrigger can help programmers reliably reproduce it for diagnosis. Our tested bugs are reproduced by CTrigger mostly within 5 seconds, 300 to over 60000 times faster than stress testing.","author":["Soyeon Park","Shan Lu","Yuanyuan Zhou"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 44","Issue 3","March 2009","pp   25\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/1508284.1508249"],"date":"07 March 2009","ref":[{"text":"P.

Prior work on dynamic race detectors includes fast but imprecise race detectors that report false alarms, as well as slow but precise race detectors that never report false alarms. The latter typically use expensive vector clock operations that require time linear in the number of program threads.This paper exploits the insight that the full generality of vector clocks is unnecessary in most cases. That is, we can replace heavyweight vector clocks with an adaptive lightweight representation that, for almost all operations of the target program, requires only constant space and supports constant-time operations. This representation change significantly improves time and space performance, with no loss in precision.Experimental results on Java benchmarks including the Eclipse development environment show that our FastTrack race detector is an order of magnitude faster than a traditional vector-clock race detector, and roughly twice as fast as the high-performance DJIT+ algorithm. FastTrack is even comparable in speed to Eraser on our Java benchmarks, while never reporting false alarms.","author":["Cormac Flanagan","Stephen N.

Recent advances in silicon nanophotonics create new opportunities for on-chip networks. To efficiently exploit the benefits of nanophotonics, we propose Firefly - a hybrid, hierarchical network architecture. Firefly consists of clusters of nodes that are connected using conventional, electrical signaling while the inter-cluster communication is done using nanophotonics - exploiting the benefits of electrical signaling for short, local communication while nanophotonics is used only for global communication to realize an efficient on-chip network. Crossbar architecture is used for inter-cluster communication. However, to avoid global arbitration, the crossbar is partitioned into multiple, logical crossbars and their arbitration is localized. Our evaluations show that Firefly improves the performance by up to 57% compared to an all-electrical concentrated mesh (CMESH) topology on adversarial traffic patterns and up to 54% compared to an all-optical crossbar (OP XBAR) on traffic patterns with locality. If the energy-delay-product is compared, Firefly improves the efficiency of the on-chip network by up to 51% and 38% compared to CMESH and OP XBAR, respectively.","author":["Yan Pan","Prabhat Kumar","John Kim","Gokhan Memik","Yu Zhang","Alok Choudhary"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 37","Issue 3","June 2009","pp   429\u2013440","https://doi.org/10.1145/1555815.1555808"],"date":"20 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"A.

Our architecture can achieve quality scalability using dynamic partial reconfiguration. This is important for some critical applications that need continuous hardware servicing. Our scalable architecture has three features. First, the architecture can perform DCT computations for eight different zones, that is, from 1 \u00d7 1 DCT to 8\u00d7 8 DCT. Second, the architecture can change the configuration of processing elements to trade off the precisions of DCT coefficients with computational complexity. Third, unused PEs for DCT can be used for motion estimation computations. Using dynamic partial reconfiguration with 2.3MB bitstreams, 80 distinct hardware architectures can be implemented. We show the experimental results and comparisons between different configurations using both partial reconfiguration and nonpartial reconfiguration process. The detailed trade-offs among visual quality, power consumption, processing clock cycles, and reconfiguration overhead are analyzed in the article.","author":["Jian Huang","Matthew Parris","Jooheung Lee","Ronald F.

The enforcement of a basic safety property, control-flow integrity (CFI), can prevent such attacks from arbitrarily controlling program behavior. CFI enforcement is simple and its guarantees can be established formally, even with respect to powerful adversaries. Moreover, CFI enforcement is practical: It is compatible with existing software and can be done efficiently using software rewriting in commodity systems. Finally, CFI provides a useful foundation for enforcing further security policies, as we demonstrate with efficient software implementations of a protected shadow call stack and of access control for memory regions.","author":["Mart\u00edn Abadi","Mihai Budiu","\u00dalfar Erlingsson","Jay Ligatti"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information and System Security","Volume 13","Issue 1","October 2009","Article No.: 4","pp   1\u201340","https://doi.org/10.1145/1609956.1609960"],"date":"06 November 2009","ref":[{"text":"Abadi, M. 1998.

This novel approach consists of two distinguishing aspects: (i) the design and implementation of embedded systems, using components which are susceptible to perturbations from various sources and (ii) a design methodology which consists of an exploration of a design space which characterizes the trade-off between quality of output and cost, to implement high performance and low energy embedded systems. In contrast with other work, our design methodology does not attempt to correct the errors introduced by components which are susceptible to perturbations, instead we design \"good enough\" systems. Our work has the potential to address challenges and impediments to Moore's law arising from material properties and manufacturing difficulties, which dictate that we shift from the current-day deterministic design paradigm to statistical and probabilistic designs of the future. In this paper, we provide a broad overview of our work on probabilistic and approximate design, present novel results in approximate arithmetic and its impact on digital signal processing algorithms, and sketch future directions for research.","author":["Krishna V.

This is because of the multi-level storage capability that makes them excellent candidates for high density memory devices. However, cost of writing or programming Flash memories is an order of magnitude higher than traditional memories. In this paper, we design an algorithm to reduce both average write energy and latency in Flash memories. We achieve this by reducing the number of expensive '01' and '10' bit-patterns during error control coding. We show that the algorithm does not change the error correction capability and moreover improves endurance. Simulations results on representative bit-stream traces show that the use of the proposed algorithm saves, on average, 33% of write energy and 31% of latency of Intel MLC NOR Flash memory, and improves the endurance by 24%.","author":["Veera Papirla","Chaitali Chakrabarti"],"issue":["DAC '09: Proceedings of the 46th Annual Design Automation Conference","July 2009","Pages   658\u2013663","https://doi.org/10.1145/1629911.1630085"],"date":"26 July 2009","ref":[{"text":"T.

Unfortunately, multithreaded applications are susceptible to numerous errors, including deadlocks, race conditions, atomicity violations, and order violations. These errors are notoriously difficult for programmers to debug.This paper presents Grace, a software-only runtime system that eliminates concurrency errors for a class of multithreaded programs: those based on fork-join parallelism. By turning threads into processes, leveraging virtual memory protection, and imposing a sequential commit protocol, Grace provides programmers with the appearance of deterministic, sequential execution, while taking advantage of available processing cores to run code concurrently and efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate Grace's effectiveness: with modest code changes across a suite of computationally-intensive benchmarks (1-16 lines), Grace can achieve high scalability and performance while preventing concurrency errors.","author":["Emery D.

Achieving this FFT performance requires a coordinated combination of computation and communication techniques that leverage Anton's underlying hardware mechanisms. Most significantly, Anton's communication subsystem provides over 300 gigabits per second of bandwidth per node, message latency in the hundreds of nanoseconds, and support for word-level writes and single-ended communication. In addition, Anton's general-purpose computation system incorporates primitives that support the efficient parallelization of small 1D FFTs. Although Anton was designed specifically for molecular dynamics simulations, a number of the hardware primitives and software implementation techniques described in this paper may also be applicable to the acceleration of FFTs on general-purpose high-performance machines.","author":["Cliff Young","Joseph A.

The basic idea of LRU-K is to keep track of the times of the last K references to popular database pages, using this information to statistically estimate the interarrival times of references on a page by page basis. Although the LRU-K approach performs optimal statistical inference under relatively standard assumptions, it is fairly simple and incurs little bookkeeping overhead. As we demonstrate with simulation experiments, the LRU-K algorithm surpasses conventional buffering algorithms in discriminating between frequently and infrequently referenced pages. In fact, LRU-K can approach the behavior of buffering algorithms in which page sets with known access frequencies are manually assigned to different buffer pools of specifically tuned sizes. Unlike such customized buffering algorithms however, the LRU-K method is self-tuning, and does not rely on external hints about workload characteristics. Furthermore, the LRU-K algorithm adapts in real time to changing patterns of access.","author":["Elizabeth J. O'Neil","Patrick E.

We propose scalable effort hardware design as an approach to tap the reservoir of algorithmic resilience and translate it into highly efficient hardware implementations The basic tenet of the scalable effort design approach is to identify mechanisms at each level of design abstraction (circuit, architecture and algorithm) that can be used to vary the computational effort expended towards generation of the correct (exact) result, and expose them as control knobs in the implementation. These scaling mechanisms can be utilized to achieve improved energy efficiency while maintaining an acceptable (and often, near identical) level of quality of the overall result. A second major tenet of the scalable effort design approach is that fully exploiting the potential of algorithmic resilience requires synergistic cross-layer optimization of scaling mechanisms identified at different levels of design abstraction. We have implemented an energy-efficient SVM classification chip based on the proposed scalable effort design approach. We present results from post-layout simulations and demonstrate that scalable effort hardware can achieve large energy reductions (1.2X-2.2X with no impact on classification accuracy, and 2.2X-4.1X with modest reductions in accuracy) across various sets. Our results also establish that cross-layer optimization leads to much improved energy vs. quality tradeoffs compared to each of the individual techniques.","author":["Vinay K.

We develop an approach to measure, analyze, and optimize the performance of GPU programs in terms of memory access, computation, and control overhead. We find that CR enjoys linear algorithm complexity but suffers from more algorithmic steps and bank conflicts, while PCR and RD have fewer algorithmic steps but do more work each step. To combine the benefits of the basic algorithms, we propose hybrid CR+PCR and CR+RD algorithms, which improve the performance of PCR, RD and CR by 21%, 31% and 61% respectively. Our GPU solvers achieve up to a 28x speedup over a sequential LAPACK solver, and a 12x speedup over a multi-threaded CPU solver.","author":["Yao Zhang","Jonathan Cohen","John D.

Because PCM is byte-addressable and exhibits access times in the nanosecond range, it can be used in main memory designs. In fact, PCM has higher density and lower idle power consumption than DRAM. Unfortunately, PCM is also slower than DRAM and has limited endurance. For these reasons, researchers have proposed memory systems that combine a small amount of DRAM and a large amount of PCM. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid design that features a hardware-driven page placement policy. The policy relies on the memory controller (MC) to monitor access patterns, migrate pages between DRAM and PCM, and translate the memory addresses coming from the cores. Periodically, the operating system updates its page mappings based on the translation information used by the MC. Detailed simulations of 27 workloads show that our system is more robust and exhibits lower energy-delay2 than state-of-the-art hybrid systems.","author":["Luiz E.

A relevant aspect, which has received little attention in the literature, is the impact of the memory space occupied by the population in the performance of the algorithm, due to limited capacity of several memory spaces in the GPUs. In this paper we analyze the differences in performance of a binary Genetic Algorithm implemented on a GPU using a boolean data type or packing multiple bits into a non boolean data type. Our study considers the influence on the performance of single point and double point crossover for solving the classical One-Max problem. The results obtained show that packing bits for storing binary strings can reduce the execution time up to 50%.","author":["Mart\u00edn Pedemonte","Enrique Alba","Francisco Luna"],"issue":["GECCO '11: Proceedings of the 13th annual conference companion on Genetic and evolutionary computation","July 2011","Pages   439\u2013446","https://doi.org/10.1145/2001858.2002031"],"date":"12 July 2011","ref":[{"text":"R.

Traditionally, voltage scaling has been used to reduce both dynamic and leakage power in caches. However, aggressive voltage reduction causes process-variation-induced failures in cache SRAM arrays, which compromise cache reliability. In this paper, we propose Flexible Fault-Tolerant Cache (FFT-Cache) that uses a flexible defect map to configure its architecture to achieve significant reduction in energy consumption through aggressive voltage scaling, while maintaining high error reliability. FFT-Cache uses a portion of faulty cache blocks as redundancy -- using block-level or line-level replication within or between sets to tolerate other faulty caches lines and blocks. Our configuration algorithm categorizes the cache lines based on degree of conflict of their blocks to reduce the granularity of redundancy replacement. FFT-Cache thereby sacrifices a minimal number of cache lines to avoid impacting performance while tolerating the maximum amount of defects. Our experimental results on SPEC2K benchmarks demonstrate that the operational voltage can be reduced down to 375mV, which achieves up to 80% reduction in dynamic power and up to 48% reduction in leakage power with small performance impact and area overhead.","author":["Abbas BanaiyanMofrad","Houman Homayoun","Nikil Dutt"],"issue":["CASES '11: Proceedings of the 14th international conference on Compilers, architectures and synthesis for embedded systems","October 2011","Pages   95\u2013104","https://doi.org/10.1145/2038698.2038715"],"date":"09 October 2011","ref":[{"text":"A.

Despite this impact, there has been relatively little work on optimizing the performance of these data transfers, with networking researchers traditionally focusing on per-flow traffic management. We address this limitation by proposing a global management architecture and a set of algorithms that (1) improve the transfer times of common communication patterns, such as broadcast and shuffle, and (2) allow scheduling policies at the transfer level, such as prioritizing a transfer over other transfers. Using a prototype implementation, we show that our solution improves broadcast completion times by up to 4.5X compared to the status quo in Hadoop. We also show that transfer-level scheduling can reduce the completion time of high-priority transfers by 1.7X.","author":["Mosharaf Chowdhury","Matei Zaharia","Justin Ma","Michael I.

Within each frontal matrix, LAPACK and the multithreaded BLAS enable the method to obtain high performance on multicore architectures. Parallelism across different frontal matrices is handled with Intel's Threading Building Blocks library. The symbolic analysis and ordering phase pre-eliminates singletons by permuting the input matrix A into the form [R11 R12; 0 A22] where R11 is upper triangular with diagonal entries above a given tolerance. Next, the fill-reducing ordering, column elimination tree, and frontal matrix structures are found without requiring the formation of the pattern of ATA. Approximate rank-detection is performed within each frontal matrix using Heath's method. While Heath's method is not always exact, it has the advantage of not requiring column pivoting and thus does not interfere with the fill-reducing ordering. For sufficiently large problems, the resulting sparse QR factorization obtains a substantial fraction of the theoretical peak performance of a multicore computer.","author":["Timothy A.

However, the complexity of scaling to such large machines and problem sizes has so far prevented the emergence of generic software libraries that support such computations, although these would lower the threshold of entry and enable many more applications to benefit from large-scale computing.We are concerned with providing this functionality for mesh-adaptive finite element computations. We assume the existence of an \u201coracle\u201d that implements the generation and modification of an adaptive mesh distributed across many processors, and that responds to queries about its structure. Based on querying the oracle, we develop scalable algorithms and data structures for generic finite element methods. Specifically, we consider the parallel distribution of mesh data, global enumeration of degrees of freedom, constraints, and postprocessing. Our algorithms remove the bottlenecks that typically limit large-scale adaptive finite element analyses.We demonstrate scalability of complete finite element workflows on up to 16,384 processors. An implementation of the proposed algorithms, based on the open source software p4est as mesh oracle, is provided under an open source license through the widely used deal.II finite element software library.","author":["Wolfgang Bangerth","Carsten Burstedde","Timo Heister","Martin Kronbichler"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software","Volume 38","Issue 2","December 2011","Article No.: 14","pp   1\u201328","https://doi.org/10.1145/2049673.2049678"],"date":"05 January 2012","ref":[{"text":"Ainsworth, M. and Oden, J.

This article describes and illustrates the use of a new version of the toolset that includes four new features: first, it supports a broad range of single-driver routing architectures, which have superior architectural and electrical properties over the prior multidriver approach (and which is now employed in the majority of FPGAs sold). Second, it can now model, for placement and routing a heterogeneous selection of hard logic blocks. This is a key (but not final) step toward the incluion of blocks such as memory and multipliers. Third, we provide optimized electrical models for a wide range of architectures in different process technologies, including a range of area-delay trade-offs for each single architecture. Finally, to maintain robustness and support future development the release includes a set of regression tests for the software.To illustrate the use of the new features, we explore several architectural issues: the FPGA area efficiency versus logic block granularity, the effect of single-driver routing, and a simple use of the heterogeneity to explore the impact of hard multipliers on wiring track count.","author":["Jason Luu","Ian Kuon","Peter Jamieson","Ted Campbell","Andy Ye","Wei Mark Fang","Kenneth Kent","Jonathan Rose"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 4","Issue 4","December 2011","Article No.: 32","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/2068716.2068718"],"date":"28 December 2011","ref":[{"text":"Ahmed, E. and Rose, J. 2004.

We theoretically analyze the dynamic behavior of a two-input nanophotonic switch composed of three quantum dots based on a density matrix formalism while assuming arrival-time differences, or skew, between the inputs. The analysis reveals that the nanophotonic switch is resistant to a skew longer than the input signal duration, and the tolerance to skew is asymmetric with respect to the two inputs. The skew dependence is also experimentally examined based on near-field spectroscopy of InGaAs quantum dots, showing good agreement with the theory. Elucidating the dynamic properties of nanophotonics, together with the associated spatial and energy dissipation attributes at the nanometer scale, will provide critical insights for novel system architectures.","author":["Makoto Naruse","Ferdinand Peper","Kouichi Akahane","Naokatsu Yamamoto","Tadashi Kawazoe","Naoya Tate","Motoichi Ohtsu"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 8","Issue 1","February 2012","Article No.: 4","pp   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2093145.2093149"],"date":"01 February 2012","ref":[{"text":"1998.

Their basic structure and their basic operations are well understood including search, insertion, and deletion. However, implementation of transactional guarantees such as all-or-nothing failure atomicity and durability in spite of media and system failures seems to be difficult. High-performance techniques such as pseudo-deleted records, allocation-only logging, and transaction processing during crash recovery are widely used in commercial B-tree implementations but not widely understood. This survey collects many of these techniques as a reference for students, researchers, system architects, and software developers. Central in this discussion are physical data independence, separation of logical database contents and physical representation, and the concepts of user transactions and system transactions. Many of the techniques discussed are applicable beyond B-trees.","author":["Goetz Graefe"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Database Systems","Volume 37","Issue 1","February 2012","Article No.: 1","pp   1\u201335","https://doi.org/10.1145/2109196.2109197"],"date":"06 March 2012","ref":[{"text":"Bayer, B. and McCreight, E.

It is also representative of a class of parallel computations whose memory accesses and work distribution are both irregular and data-dependent. Recent work has demonstrated the plausibility of GPU sparse graph traversal, but has tended to focus on asymptotically inefficient algorithms that perform poorly on graphs with non-trivial diameter. We present a BFS parallelization focused on fine-grained task management constructed from efficient prefix sum that achieves an asymptotically optimal O(|V|+|E|) work complexity. Our implementation delivers excellent performance on diverse graphs, achieving traversal rates in excess of 3.3 billion and 8.3 billion traversed edges per second using single and quad-GPU configurations, respectively.

Yet, access to this information via reasoning and querying is sometimes difficult, due to LOD's size, partial data inconsistencies and inherent noisiness. Machine Learning offers an alternative approach to exploiting LOD's data with the advantages that Machine Learning algorithms are typically robust to both noise and data inconsistencies and are able to efficiently utilize non-deterministic dependencies in the data. From a Machine Learning point of view, LOD is challenging due to its relational nature and its scale. Here, we present an efficient approach to relational learning on LOD data, based on the factorization of a sparse tensor that scales to data consisting of millions of entities, hundreds of relations and billions of known facts. Furthermore, we show how ontological knowledge can be incorporated in the factorization to improve learning results and how computation can be distributed across multiple nodes. We demonstrate that our approach is able to factorize the YAGO~2 core ontology and globally predict statements for this large knowledge base using a single dual-core desktop computer. Furthermore, we show experimentally that our approach achieves good results in several relational learning tasks that are relevant to Linked Data. Once a factorization has been computed, our model is able to predict efficiently, and without any additional training, the likelihood of any of the 4.3 \u22c5 1014 possible triples in the YAGO~2 core ontology.","author":["Maximilian Nickel","Volker Tresp","Hans-Peter Kriegel"],"issue":["WWW '12: Proceedings of the 21st international conference on World Wide Web","April 2012","Pages   271\u2013280","https://doi.org/10.1145/2187836.2187874"],"date":"16 April 2012","ref":[{"text":"M.

However, STT-RAM suffers from high write latency and energy which has impeded its widespread adoption. To this end, we look at trading-off STT-RAM's non-volatility property (data-retention-time) to overcome these problems. We formulate the relationship between retention-time and write-latency, and find optimal retention-time for architecting an efficient cache hierarchy using STT-RAM.

We describe an ISA extension that provides approximate operations and storage, which give the hardware freedom to save energy at the cost of accuracy. We then propose Truffle, a microarchitecture design that efficiently supports the ISA extensions. The basis of our design is dual-voltage operation, with a high voltage for precise operations and a low voltage for approximate operations. The key aspect of the microarchitecture is its dependence on the instruction stream to determine when to use the low voltage. We evaluate the power savings potential of in-order and out-of-order Truffle configurations and explore the resulting quality of service degradation. We evaluate several applications and demonstrate energy savings up to 43%.","author":["Hadi Esmaeilzadeh","Adrian Sampson","Luis Ceze","Doug Burger"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 47","Issue 4","April 2012","pp   301\u2013312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2248487.2151008"],"date":"03 March 2012","ref":[{"text":"Alpha Architecture Handbook, Version 3.

Two problems are raised by this goal: The codification of graphic design criteria in a form that can be used by the presentation tool, and the generation of a wide variety of designs so that the presentation tool can accommodate a wide variety of information. The approach described in this paper is based on the view that graphical presentations are sentences of graphical languages. The graphic design issues are codified as expressiveness and effectiveness criteria for graphical languages. Expressiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language can express the desired information. Effectiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language exploits the capabilities of the output medium and the human visual system. A wide variety of designs can be systematically generated by using a composition algebra that composes a small set of primitive graphical languages. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to implement a prototype presentation tool called APT (A Presentation Tool), which is based on the composition algebra and the graphic design criteria.","author":["Jock Mackinlay"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 5","Issue 2","April 1986","pp   110\u2013141","https://doi.org/10.1145/22949.22950"],"date":"01 April 1986","ref":[{"text":"BEACH, R.J.

A major problem that has challenged this vision is that backscatter communication is neither reliable nor efficient. Backscatter nodes cannot sense each other, and hence tend to suffer from colliding transmissions. Further, they are ineffective at adapting the bit rate to channel conditions, and thus miss opportunities to increase throughput, or transmit above capacity causing errors. This paper introduces a new approach to backscatter communication. The key idea is to treat all nodes as if they were a single virtual sender. One can then view collisions as a code across the bits transmitted by the nodes. By ensuring only a few nodes collide at any time, we make collisions act as a sparse code and decode them using a new customized compressive sensing algorithm. Further, we can make these collisions act as a rateless code to automatically adapt the bit rate to channel quality --i.e., nodes can keep colliding until the base station has collected enough collisions to decode. Results from a network of backscatter nodes communicating with a USRP backscatter base station demonstrate that the new design produces a 3.5\u00d7 throughput gain, and due to its rateless code, reduces message loss rate in challenging scenarios from 50% to zero.","author":["Jue Wang","Haitham Hassanieh","Dina Katabi","Piotr Indyk"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 42","Issue 4","October 2012","pp   61\u201372","https://doi.org/10.1145/2377677.2377685"],"date":"13 August 2012","ref":[{"text":"Alien Technology Inc.

Existing tools that check configuration files and data-plane state operate offline at timescales of seconds to hours, and cannot detect or prevent bugs as they arise.Is it possible to check network-wide invariants in real time, as the network state evolves? The key challenge here is to achieve extremely low latency during the checks so that network performance is not affected. In this paper, we present a preliminary design, VeriFlow, which suggests that this goal is achievable. VeriFlow is a layer between a software-defined networking controller and network devices that checks for network-wide invariant violations dynamically as each forwarding rule is inserted. Based on an implementation using a Mininet OpenFlow network and Route Views trace data, we find that VeriFlow can perform rigorous checking within hundreds of microseconds per rule insertion.","author":["Ahmed Khurshid","Wenxuan Zhou","Matthew Caesar","P.

In this paper we are interested in flow-based biochips, in which the flow of liquid is manipulated using integrated microvalves. By combining several microvalves, more complex units, such as micropumps, switches, mixers, and multiplexers, can be built. The manufacturing technology, soft lithography, used for the flow-based biochips is advancing faster than Moore's law, resulting in increased architectural complexity. However, the designers are still using full-custom and bottom-up, manual techniques in order to design and implement these chips. As the chips become larger and the applications become more complex, the manual methodologies will not scale, becoming highly inadequate. Therefore, for the first time to our knowledge,we propose a top-down architectural synthesis methodology for the flow-based biochips. Starting from a given biochemical application and a microfluidic component library, we are interested in synthesizing a biochip architecture, i.e., performing component allocation from the library based on the biochemical application, generating the biochip schematic (netlist) and then performing physical synthesis (deciding the placement of the microfluidic components on the chip and performing routing of the microfluidic channels), such that the application completion time is minimized. We evaluate our proposed approach by synthesizing architectures for real-life applications as well as synthetic benchmarks.","author":["Wajid Hassan Minhass","Paul Pop","Jan Madsen","Felician Stefan Blaga"],"issue":["CASES '12: Proceedings of the 2012 international conference on Compilers, architectures and synthesis for embedded systems","October 2012","Pages   181\u2013190","https://doi.org/10.1145/2380403.2380437"],"date":"07 October 2012","ref":[{"text":"AutoCAD Products. http://usa.autodesk.com/autocad-products/.","order":1},{"text":"Designing your own device: Basic design rules. http://www.stanford.edu/group/foundry/.","order":2},{"text":"mLSI Biochips. https://sites.google.com/site/mlsibiochips/.","order":3},{"text":"N.

Traditional methods tend to treat a program as a blackbox. In this paper, we show that through program analysis, we can expose the internals of sample executions so that the process can become more selective and focused. In particular, we develop a sampling runtime that can selectively sample in input error bounds to expose discontinuity in output functions. It identifies all the program factors that can potentially lead to discontinuity and hash the values of such factors during execution in a cost-effective way. The hash values are used to guide the sampling process. Our results show that the technique is very effective for real-world programs. It can achieve the precision of a high sampling rate with the cost of a lower sampling rate.","author":["Tao Bao","Yunhui Zheng","Xiangyu Zhang"],"issue":["OOPSLA '12: Proceedings of the ACM international conference on Object oriented programming systems languages and applications","October 2012","Pages   897\u2013914","https://doi.org/10.1145/2384616.2384681"],"date":"19 October 2012","ref":[{"text":"H.

Here, an application can dynamically claim, execute, and release the resources in three phases: resource acquisition (invade), program loading/configuration and execution (infect), and release (retreat). Resource invasion is governed by dedicated decentralized hardware controllers, called invasion controllers (ictrls), which are integrated into each processing element (PE). Several invasion strategies for claiming linearly connected or rectangular regions of processing resources are implemented. The key idea is to exploit the decentralized resource management inherent to invasive computing for power savings by enabling applications themselves to control the power for processing resources and invasion controllers using a hierarchical power-gating approach. We propose analytical models for estimating various components of energy consumption for faster design space exploration and compare them with the results obtained from a cycle-accurate C++ simulator of the processor array. In order to find optimal design trade-offs, various parameters like (a) energy consumption, (b) hardware cost, and (c) timing overheads are compared for different sizes of power domains. Experimental results show significant energy savings (up to 73%) for selected characteristical algorithms and different resource utilizations. In addition, we demonstrate the accuracy of our proposed analytical model. Here, estimation errors less than 3.6% can be reported.","author":["Vahid Lari","Shravan Muddasani","Srinivas Boppu","Frank Hannig","Moritz Schmid","J\u00fcrgen Teich"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 18","Issue 1","January 2013","Article No.: 2","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2390191.2390193"],"date":"16 January 2013","ref":[{"text":"Baumgarte, V., Ehlers, G., May, F., N\u00fcckel, A., Vorbach, M., and Weinhardt, M. 2003.

In practice, however, its effective flow is conditioned on various technical and social factors. In this paper, drawing on ethnographic work primarily with a bio-informatics research team in China, we report on meanings of scientific software sharing as embedded in social practices of learning, apprenticeship, membership, publication, and reputation. We illustrate that while free flow is important, boundary management is equally important for the effective travel of software to its appropriate destinations. Our study highlights a number of issues that are important to consider for effectively supporting sharing and collaboration in science.","author":["Xing Huang","Xianghua Ding","Charlotte P.

This survey summarizes, organizes, and integrates a decade of research on power-aware enterprise storage systems. All of the existing power-reduction techniques are classified according to the disk-power factor and storage-stack layer addressed. A majority of power-reduction techniques is based on dynamic power management. We also consider alternative methods that reduce disk access time, conserve space, or exploit energy-efficient storage hardware. For every energy-conservation technique, the fundamental trade-offs between power, capacity, performance, and dependability are uncovered. With this survey, we intend to stimulate integration of different power-reduction techniques in new energy-efficient file and storage systems.","author":["Tom Bostoen","Sape Mullender","Yolande Berbers"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 45","Issue 3","June 2013","Article No.: 33","pp   1\u201338","https://doi.org/10.1145/2480741.2480750"],"date":"03 July 2013","ref":[{"text":"Allalouf, M., Arbitman, Y., Factor, M., Kat, R.

They consume as much as 10% of execution cycles on TLB misses, even using large pages. On the other hand, we find that these workloads use read-write permission on most pages, are provisioned not to swap, and rarely benefit from the full flexibility of page-based virtual memory. To remove the TLB miss overhead for big-memory workloads, we propose mapping part of a process's linear virtual address space with a direct segment, while page mapping the rest of the virtual address space. Direct segments use minimal hardware---base, limit and offset registers per core---to map contiguous virtual memory regions directly to contiguous physical memory. They eliminate the possibility of TLB misses for key data structures such as database buffer pools and in-memory key-value stores. Memory mapped by a direct segment may be converted back to paging when needed. We prototype direct-segment software support for x86-64 in Linux and emulate direct-segment hardware. For our workloads, direct segments eliminate almost all TLB misses and reduce the execution time wasted on TLB misses to less than 0.5%.","author":["Arkaprava Basu","Jayneel Gandhi","Jichuan Chang","Mark D.

Existing DRAM cache designs fall into one of two categories --- block-based and page-based. The former organize data in conventional blocks (e.g., 64B), ensuring low off-chip bandwidth utilization, but co-locate tags and data in the stacked DRAM, incurring high lookup latency. Furthermore, such designs suffer from low hit ratios due to poor temporal locality. In contrast, page-based caches, which manage data at larger granularity (e.g., 4KB pages), allow for reduced tag array overhead and fast lookup, and leverage high spatial locality at the cost of moving large amounts of data on and off the chip. This paper introduces Footprint Cache, an efficient die-stacked DRAM cache design for server processors. Footprint Cache allocates data at the granularity of pages, but identifies and fetches only those blocks within a page that will be touched during the page's residency in the cache --- i.e., the page's footprint. In doing so, Footprint Cache eliminates the excessive off-chip traffic associated with page-based designs, while preserving their high hit ratio, small tag array overhead, and low lookup latency. Cycle-accurate simulation results of a 16-core server with up to 512MB Footprint Cache indicate a 57% performance improvement over a baseline chip without a die-stacked cache. Compared to a state-of-the-art block-based design, our design improves performance by 13% while reducing dynamic energy of stacked DRAM by 24%.","author":["Djordje Jevdjic","Stavros Volos","Babak Falsafi"],"issue":["ISCA '13: Proceedings of the 40th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2013","Pages   404\u2013415","https://doi.org/10.1145/2485922.2485957"],"date":"23 June 2013","ref":[{"text":"J.

Consequently, large amounts of RDF data are constantly being made available across the planet. While experts can easily gather information from this wealth of data by using the W3C standard query language SPARQL, most lay users lack the expertise necessary to proficiently interact with these applications. Consequently, non-expert users usually have to rely on forms, query builders, question answering or keyword search tools to access RDF data. However, these tools have so far been unable to explicate the queries they generate to lay users, making it difficult for these users to i) assess the correctness of the query generated out of their input, and ii) to adapt their queries or iii) to choose in an informed manner between possible interpretations of their input. This paper addresses this drawback by presenting SPARQL2NL, a generic approach that allows verbalizing SPARQL queries, i.e., converting them into natural language. Our framework can be integrated into applications where lay users are required to understand SPARQL or to generate SPARQL queries in a direct (forms, query builders) or an indirect (keyword search, question answering) manner. We evaluate our approach on the DBpedia question set provided by QALD-2 within a survey setting with both SPARQL experts and lay users. The results of the 115 filled surveys show that SPARQL2NL can generate complete and easily understandable natural language descriptions. In addition, our results suggest that even SPARQL experts can process the natural language representation of SPARQL queries computed by our approach more efficiently than the corresponding SPARQL queries. Moreover, non-experts are enabled to reliably understand the content of SPARQL queries.","author":["Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo","Lorenz B\u00fchmann","Christina Unger","Jens Lehmann","Daniel Gerber"],"issue":["WWW '13: Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on World Wide Web","May 2013","Pages   977\u2013988","https://doi.org/10.1145/2488388.2488473"],"date":"13 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"G.

However, existing chipkill-correct solutions incur high power or storage overheads, or both because they use dedicated error-correction resources per codeword to perform error correction. This requires high overhead for correction and results in high overhead for error detection. We propose a novel chipkill-correct solution, multi-line error correction, that uses resources shared across multiple lines in memory for error correction to reduce the overhead of both error detection and correction. Our evaluations show that the proposed solution reduces memory power by a mean of 27%, and up to 38% with respect to commercial solutions, at a cost of 0.4% increase in storage overhead and minimal impact on reliability.","author":["Xun Jian","Henry Duwe","John Sartori","Vilas Sridharan","Rakesh Kumar"],"issue":["SC '13: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2013","Article No.: 24","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2503210.2503243"],"date":"17 November 2013","ref":[{"text":"\"AMD, BIOS and Kernel Developer's Guide for AMD NPT Family 0Fh Processors,\" 2007. {Online}.

Therefore, further attention to the faults experienced by such computing systems is warranted. In this paper, we present a study of DRAM and SRAM faults in large high-performance computing systems. Our goal is to understand the factors that influence faults in production settings. We examine the impact of aging on DRAM, finding a marked shift from permanent to transient faults in the first two years of DRAM lifetime. We examine the impact of DRAM vendor, finding that fault rates vary by more than 4x among vendors. We examine the physical location of faults in a DRAM device and in a data center; contrary to prior studies, we find no correlations with either. Finally, we study the impact of altitude and rack placement on SRAM faults, finding that, as expected, altitude has a substantial impact on SRAM faults, and that top of rack placement correlates with 20% higher fault rate.","author":["Vilas Sridharan","Jon Stearley","Nathan DeBardeleben","Sean Blanchard","Sudhanva Gurumurthi"],"issue":["SC '13: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2013","Article No.: 22","Pages   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/2503210.2503257"],"date":"17 November 2013","ref":[{"text":"Flux calculator. http://seutest.com/cgi-bin/FluxCalculator.cgi.","order":1},{"text":"AMD64 architecture programmer's manual revision 3.17, 2011.","order":2},{"text":"A.

However, application developers are left to deal with the complexities associated with choosing the storage services at which any object is replicated and maintaining consistency across these replicas. In this paper, we present SPANStore, a key-value store that exports a unified view of storage services in geographically distributed data centers. To minimize an application provider's cost, we combine three key principles. First, SPANStore spans multiple cloud providers to increase the geographical density of data centers and to minimize cost by exploiting pricing discrepancies across providers. Second, by estimating application workload at the right granularity, SPANStore judiciously trades off greater geo-distributed replication necessary to satisfy latency goals with the higher storage and data propagation costs this entails in order to satisfy fault tolerance and consistency requirements. Finally, SPANStore minimizes the use of compute resources to implement tasks such as two-phase locking and data propagation, which are necessary to offer a global view of the storage services that it builds upon. Our evaluation of SPANStore shows that it can lower costs by over 10x in several scenarios, in comparison with alternative solutions that either use a single storage provider or replicate every object to every data center from which it is accessed.","author":["Zhe Wu","Michael Butkiewicz","Dorian Perkins","Ethan Katz-Bassett","Harsha V.

The streaming language supported is called FPGA Brook and is based on the existing Brook language. It allows system designers to express applications in a way that exposes parallelism, which can be exploited through hardware implementation. FPGA Brook supports replication, allowing parts of an application to be implemented as multiple hardware units operating in parallel. Hardware units are interconnected through FIFO buffers which use the small memory modules available in FPGAs. The FPGA Brook automated design flow uses a source-to-source compiler, developed as a part of this work, and combines it with a commercial behavioral synthesis tool to generate the hardware implementation. A suite of benchmark applications was developed in FPGA Brook and implemented using our design flow. Experimental results indicate that performance of many applications scales well with replication. Our benchmark applications also achieve significantly better results than corresponding implementations using a commercial behavioral synthesis tool. We conclude that using an automated design flow for implementation of streaming applications in FPGAs is a promising methodology.","author":["Franjo Plavec","Zvonko Vranesic","Stephen Brown"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 6","Issue 4","December 2013","Article No.: 16","pp   1\u201337","https://doi.org/10.1145/2535932"],"date":"01 December 2013","ref":[{"text":"Altera. 2012a.

Quizz operates by asking users to complete short quizzes on specific topics; as a user answers the quiz questions, Quizz estimates the user's competence. To acquire new knowledge, Quizz also incorporates questions for which we do not have a known answer; the answers given by competent users provide useful signals for selecting the correct answers for these questions. Quizz actively tries to identify knowledgeable users on the Internet by running advertising campaigns, effectively leveraging the targeting capabilities of existing, publicly available, ad placement services. Quizz quantifies the contributions of the users using information theory and sends feedback to the advertisingsystem about each user. The feedback allows the ad targeting mechanism to further optimize ad placement. Our experiments, which involve over ten thousand users, confirm that we can crowdsource knowledge curation for niche and specialized topics, as the advertising network can automatically identify users with the desired expertise and interest in the given topic. We present controlled experiments that examine the effect of various incentive mechanisms, highlighting the need for having short-term rewards as goals, which incentivize the users to contribute. Finally, our cost-quality analysis indicates that the cost of our approach is below that of hiring workers through paid-crowdsourcing platforms, while offering the additional advantage of giving access to billions of potential users all over the planet, and being able to reach users with specialized expertise that is not typically available through existing labor marketplaces.","author":["Panagiotis G.

By using the convolution-max pooling operation, local contextual information at the word n-gram level is modeled first. Then, salient local fea-tures in a word sequence are combined to form a global feature vector. Finally, the high-level semantic information of the word sequence is extracted to form a global vector representation. The proposed models are trained on clickthrough data by maximizing the conditional likelihood of clicked documents given a query, us-ing stochastic gradient ascent. The new models are evaluated on a Web document ranking task using a large-scale, real-world data set. Results show that our model significantly outperforms other se-mantic models, which were state-of-the-art in retrieval performance prior to this work.","author":["Yelong Shen","Xiaodong He","Jianfeng Gao","Li Deng","Gr\u00e9goire Mesnil"],"issue":["WWW '14 Companion: Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web","April 2014","Pages   373\u2013374","https://doi.org/10.1145/2567948.2577348"],"date":"07 April 2014","ref":[{"text":"Collobert, R., Weston, J., Bottou, L., Karlen, M., Kavukcuoglu, K., and Kuksa, P., 2011.

A high query throughput and a low query latency are essential for the success of a database system. Lately, research focused on exploiting hardware features like superscalar execution units, SIMD, or multiple cores to speed up processing. Apart from these software optimizations for given hardware, even tailor-made processing circuits running on FPGAs are built to run mostly stateless query plans with incredibly high throughput. A similar idea, which was already considered three decades ago, is to build tailor-made hardware like a database processor. Despite their superior performance, such application-specific processors were not considered to be beneficial because general-purpose processors eventually always caught up so that the high development costs did not pay off. In this paper, we show that the development of a database processor is much more feasible nowadays through the availability of customizable processors. We illustrate exemplarily how to create an instruction set extension for set-oriented database primitives. The resulting application-specific processor provides not only a high performance but it also enables very energy-efficient processing. Our processor requires in various configurations more than 960x less energy than a high-end x86 processor while providing the same performance.","author":["Oliver Arnold","Sebastian Haas","Gerhard Fettweis","Benjamin Schlegel","Thomas Kissinger","Wolfgang Lehner"],"issue":["SIGMOD '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","June 2014","Pages   767\u2013778","https://doi.org/10.1145/2588555.2593677"],"date":"18 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"ARC Inc. 750D Core Architecture Manual, 2005.","order":1},{"text":"H.

Although fault tolerance and platform independence make Hadoop MapReduce the most popular choice for many users, it still has huge performance improvement potentials. Recently, RDMA-based design of Hadoop MapReduce has alleviated major performance bottlenecks with the implementation of many novel design features such as in-memory merge, prefetching and caching of map outputs, and overlapping of merge and reduce phases. Although these features reduce the overall execution time for MapReduce jobs compared to the default framework, further improvement is possible if shuffle and merge phases can also be overlapped with the map phase during job execution. In this paper, we propose HOMR (a Hybrid approach to exploit maximum Overlapping in MapReduce), that incorporates not only the features implemented in RDMA-based design, but also exploits maximum possible overlapping among all different phases compared to current best approaches. Our solution introduces two key concepts: Greedy Shuffle Algorithm and On-demand Shuffle Adjustment, both of which are essential to achieve significant performance benefits over the default MapReduce framework. Architecture of HOMR is generalized enough to provide performance efficiency both over different Sockets interface as well as previous RDMA-based designs over InfiniBand. Performance evaluations show that HOMR with RDMA over InfiniBand can achieve performance benefits of 54% and 56% compared to default Hadoop over IPoIB (IP over InfiniBand) and 10GigE, respectively. Compared to the previous best RDMA-based designs, this benefit is 29%. HOMR over Sockets also achieves a maximum of 38-40% benefit compared to default Hadoop over Sockets interface. We also evaluate our design with real-world workloads like SWIM and PUMA, and observe benefits of up to 16% and 18%, respectively, over the previous best-case RDMA-based design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to achieve maximum possible overlapping for MapReduce framework.","author":["Md Wasi-ur- Rahman","Xiaoyi Lu","Nusrat Sharmin Islam","Dhabaleswar K.

Moving computation closer to memory presents an opportunity to reduce both energy and data movement overheads. We explore the use of 3D die stacking to move memory-intensive computations closer to memory. This approach to processing in memory addresses some drawbacks of prior research on in-memory computing and is commercially viable in the foreseeable future. Because 3D stacking provides increased bandwidth, we study throughput-oriented computing using programmable GPU compute units across a broad range of benchmarks, including graph and HPC applications. We also introduce a methodology for rapid design space exploration by analytically predicting performance and energy of in-memory processors based on metrics obtained from execution on today's GPU hardware. Our results show that, on average, viable PIM configurations show moderate performance losses (27%) in return for significant energy efficiency improvements (76\\% reduction in EDP) relative to a representative mainstream GPU at 22nm technology. At 16nm technology, on average, viable PIM configurations are performance competitive with a representative mainstream GPU (7% speedup) and provide even greater energy efficiency improvements (85\\% reduction in EDP).","author":["Dongping Zhang","Nuwan Jayasena","Alexander Lyashevsky","Joseph L.

Existing approaches use either manually curated KBs like Freebase or KBs automatically extracted from unstructured text. In this paper, we present OQA, the first approach to leverage both curated and extracted KBs. A key technical challenge is designing systems that are robust to the high variability in both natural language questions and massive KBs. OQA achieves robustness by decomposing the full Open QA problem into smaller sub-problems including question paraphrasing and query reformulation. OQA solves these sub-problems by mining millions of rules from an unlabeled question corpus and across multiple KBs. OQA then learns to integrate these rules by performing discriminative training on question-answer pairs using a latent-variable structured perceptron algorithm. We evaluate OQA on three benchmark question sets and demonstrate that it achieves up to twice the precision and recall of a state-of-the-art Open QA system.","author":["Anthony Fader","Luke Zettlemoyer","Oren Etzioni"],"issue":["KDD '14: Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2014","Pages   1156\u20131165","https://doi.org/10.1145/2623330.2623677"],"date":"24 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"M.

In particular, process variation can transform a homogeneous many-core platform into a heterogeneous system where the task mapping is NP-hard problem. In this paper, we propose a mapping algorithm that selects the appropriate task mapping along with voltage and frequency assignment for a cluster of cores. The mapping algorithm, which is based on simulated annealing, determines cluster voltages and core frequencies to minimize energy consumption and EDP under process variation. We examine the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm on a fully placed and routed 128-core biomedical accelerator in 45 nm when running various applications including compressive sensing, seizure detection and ultrasound spectral Doppler and linear regression. The results indicate that exposing frequency and power variation to the mapping algorithm results in up to 22% (on average 11%) energy saving and 31% (on average19%) EDP improvement.","author":["Mohammad Khavari Tavana","Amey Kulkarni","Abbas Rahimi","Tinoosh Mohsenin","Houman Homayoun"],"issue":["ISLPED '14: Proceedings of the 2014 international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2014","Pages   275\u2013278","https://doi.org/10.1145/2627369.2627654"],"date":"11 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"P.

In the multilevel paradigm,a sequence of successively coarser hypergraphs is constructed. Abisection of the smallest hypergraph is computed and it is used toobtain a bisection of the original hypergraph by successively projectingand refining the bisection to the next level finer hypergraph.We evaluate the performance both in terms of the size of the hyper-edgecut on the bisection as well as run time on a number of VLSIcircuits. Our experiments show that our multilevel hypergraph partitioningalgorithm produces high quality partitioning in relativelysmall amount of time. The quality of the partitionings produced byour scheme are on the average 4% to 23% better than those producedby other state-of-the-art schemes. Furthermore, our partitioning algorithmissignificantly faster, often requiring 4 to 15 times less timethan that required by the other schemes. Our multilevel hypergraphpartitioning algorithm scales very well for large hypergraphs. Hypergraphswith over 100,000 vertices can be bisected in a few minuteson today's workstations. Also, on the large hypergraphs, ourscheme outperforms other schemes (in hyperedge cut) quite consistentlywith larger margins (9% to 30%).","author":["George Karypis","Rajat Aggarwal","Vipin Kumar","Shashi Shekhar"],"issue":["DAC '97: Proceedings of the 34th annual Design Automation Conference","June 1997","Pages   526\u2013529","https://doi.org/10.1145/266021.266273"],"date":"13 June 1997","ref":[{"text":"C.

In this work we use the Open Computing Language (OpenCL) to implement high-speed data compression (Gzip) on a field-programmable gate-arrays (FPGA). We show how we make use of a heavily-pipelined custom hardware implementation to achieve the high throughput of ~3 GB/s with more than 2x compression ratio over standard compression benchmarks. When compared against a highly-tuned CPU implementation, the performance-per-watt of our OpenCL FPGA implementation is 12x better and compression ratio is on-par. Additionally, we compare our implementation to a hand-coded commercial implementation of Gzip to quantify the gap between a high-level language like OpenCL, and a hardware description language like Verilog. OpenCL performance is 5.3% lower than Verilog, and area is 2% more logic and 25% more of the FPGA's available memory resources but the productivity gains are significant.","author":["Mohamed S.

Alternately, the performance of software can sometimes be improved by using special purpose hardware to implement tasks which do appear on the critical path. Whatever the motivation, most modern systems are composed of both hardware and software components. Given the importance of the connection between hardware and software in these systems, it is surprising how little automated and machine-checkable support there is for co-design space exploration. This paper presents the Connectal framework, which enables the development of hardware accelerators for software applications by generating hardware/software interface implementations from abstract Interface Design Language (IDL) specifications. Connectal generates stubs to support asynchronous remote method invocation from software to software, hardware to software, software to hardware, and hardware to hardware. For high-bandwidth communication, the Connectal framework provides comprehensive support for shared memory between hardware and software components, removing the repetitive work of processor bus interfacing from project tasks. This framework is released as open software under an MIT license, making it available for use in any projects.","author":["Myron King","Jamey Hicks","John Ankcorn"],"issue":["FPGA '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2015","Pages   13\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/2684746.2689064"],"date":"22 February 2015","ref":[{"text":"Bluespec Inc., http://www.bluespec.com.","order":1},{"text":"J.

It is an open question how future server architectures should evolve to enable this emerging class of applications, and the lack of an open-source IPA workload is an obstacle in addressing this question. In this paper, we present the design of Sirius, an open end-to-end IPA web-service application that accepts queries in the form of voice and images, and responds with natural language. We then use this workload to investigate the implications of four points in the design space of future accelerator-based server architectures spanning traditional CPUs, GPUs, manycore throughput co-processors, and FPGAs. To investigate future server designs for Sirius, we decompose Sirius into a suite of 7 benchmarks (Sirius Suite) comprising the computationally intensive bottlenecks of Sirius. We port Sirius Suite to a spectrum of accelerator platforms and use the performance and power trade-offs across these platforms to perform a total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis of various server design points. In our study, we find that accelerators are critical for the future scalability of IPA services. Our results show that GPU- and FPGA-accelerated servers improve the query latency on average by 10x and 16x. For a given throughput, GPU- and FPGA-accelerated servers can reduce the TCO of datacenters by 2.6x and 1.4x, respectively.","author":["Johann Hauswald","Michael A.

It links subsequent requests and temporary stateful information together, enabling a rich and interactive user experience. Unfortunately, the de facto standard cookie-based session management mechanism is imperfect, which is why session management vulnerabilities rank second in the OWASP top 10 of web application vulnerabilities [18]. While improved session management mechanisms have been proposed, none of them achieves compatibility with currently deployed applications or infrastructure components such as web caches. We propose SecSess, a lightweight session management mechanism that addresses common session management vulnerabilities by ensuring a session remains under control of the parties that established it. SecSess is fully interchangeable with the currently deployed cookie-based session management, and can be gradually deployed to clients and servers through an opt-in mechanism. Evaluation of our proof-of-concept implementation shows that SecSess introduces only a minimal performance and networking overhead. Furthermore, we empirically show that SecSess is effectively compatible with commonly used web caches, in contrast to alternative approaches.","author":["Philippe De Ryck","Lieven Desmet","Frank Piessens","Wouter Joosen"],"issue":["SAC '15: Proceedings of the 30th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing","April 2015","Pages   2171\u20132176","https://doi.org/10.1145/2695664.2695764"],"date":"13 April 2015","ref":[{"text":"B.

Based on the analogy between placement instance and electrostatic system, we develop a novel placement density function eDensity, which models every object as positive charge and the density cost as the potential energy of the electrostatic system. The electric potential and field distribution are coupled with density using a well-defined Poisson's equation, which is numerically solved by spectral methods based on fast Fourier transform (FFT). Instead of using the conjugate gradient (CG) nonlinear solver in previous placers, we propose to use Nesterov's method which achieves faster convergence. The efficiency bottleneck on line search is resolved by predicting the steplength using a closed-form equation of Lipschitz constant. The placement performance is validated through experiments on the ISPD 2005 and ISPD 2006 benchmark suites, where ePlace outperforms all state-of-the-art placers (Capo10.5, FastPlace3.0, RQL, MAPLE, ComPLx, BonnPlace, POLAR, APlace3, NTUPlace3, mPL6) with much shorter wirelength and shorter or comparable runtime. On average, of all the ISPD 2005 benchmarks, ePlace outperforms the leading placer BonnPlace with 2.83% shorter wirelength and runs 3.05\u00d7 faster; and on average, of all the ISPD 2006 benchmarks, ePlace outperforms the leading placer MAPLE with 4.59% shorter wirelength and runs 2.84\u00d7 faster.","author":["Jingwei Lu","Pengwen Chen","Chin-Chih Chang","Lu Sha","Dennis Jen-Hsin Huang","Chin-Chi Teng","Chung-Kuan Cheng"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 20","Issue 2","February 2015","Article No.: 17","pp   1\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/2699873"],"date":"02 March 2015","ref":[{"text":"S.

This article mainly addresses the following three types of OOV: unseen dictionary words, named entities, and suffix-derived words, none of which are handled well by current approaches. The results show that our approach can effectively improve the performance of the first two types with positive interaction in F-score. Additionally, we also analyze reason that suffix information is not helpful. After integrating the proposed generative model with the corresponding discriminative approach, our evaluation on various corpora---including SIGHAN-2005, CIPS-SIGHAN-2010, and the Chinese Treebank (CTB)---shows that our integrated approach achieves the best performance reported in the literature on all testing sets when additional information and resources are allowed.","author":["Xiaoqing Li","Chengqing Zong","Keh-yih Su"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing","Volume 14","Issue 3","June 2015","Article No.: 12","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/2699940"],"date":"12 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"Baroni, M. 2009.

However, with considerable variations in the write-time characteristics of individual memristors, conventional fixed-pulse write schemes cannot guarantee reliable completion of the write operations and waste significant amount of energy.We propose an adaptive write scheme that adaptively adjusts the write pulses to address such variations in memristive arrays, resulting in 7\u00d7--11\u00d7 average energy saving in our case studies. Our scheme embeds an online monitor to detect the completion of a write operation and takes into account the parasitic effect of line-shared devices in access-transistor-free crossbars. This feature also helps shorten the test time of memory march algorithms by eliminating the need of a verifying read right after a write, which is commonly employed in the test sequences of march algorithms.","author":["Amirali Ghofrani","Miguel-angel lastras-monta\u00f1o","Siddharth Gaba","Melika Payvand","Wei Lu","Luke Theogarajan","Kwang-Ting Cheng"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 12","Issue 1","July 2015","Article No.: 3","pp   1\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/2717313"],"date":"03 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"F.

Unlike any other service, a crowdsourcing platform is in fact a marketplace subject to human factors that affect its performance, both in terms of speed and quality. Indeed, such factors shape the dynamics of the crowdsourcing market. For example, a known behavior of such markets is that increasing the reward of a set of tasks would lead to faster results. However, it is still unclear how different dimensions interact with each other: reward, task type, market competition, requester reputation, etc. In this paper, we adopt a data-driven approach to (A) perform a long-term analysis of a popular micro-task crowdsourcing platform and understand the evolution of its main actors (workers, requesters, and platform). (B) We leverage the main findings of our five year log analysis to propose features used in a predictive model aiming at determining the expected performance of any batch at a specific point in time. We show that the number of tasks left in a batch and how recent the batch is are two key features of the prediction. (C) Finally, we conduct an analysis of the demand (new tasks posted by the requesters) and supply (number of tasks completed by the workforce) and show how they affect task prices on the marketplace.","author":["Djellel Eddine Difallah","Michele Catasta","Gianluca Demartini","Panagiotis G.

However, the traditional Linux-based operating system is unable to exploit this heterogeneity since existing kernel load balancing and scheduling approaches lack support for aggressively heterogeneous architectural configurations (e.g. beyond two core types). In this paper we present SmartBalance: a sensing-driven closed-loop load balancer for aggressively heterogeneous MPSoCs that performs load balancing using a sense-predict-balance paradigm. SmartBalance can efficiently manage the chip resources while opportunistically exploiting the workload variations and performance-power trade-offs of different core types. When compared to the standard vanilla Linux kernel load balancer, our per-thread and per-core performance-power-aware scheme shows an improvement in energy efficiency (throughput/Watt) of over 50% for benchmarks from the PARSEC benchmark suite executing on a heterogeneous MPSoC with 4 different core types and over 20% w.r.t. state-of-the-art ARM's global task scheduling (GTS) scheme for octa-core big.Little architecture.","author":["Santanu Sarma","T.

They provide high performance such as fast write/read speed, low power and good endurance (e.g. >1012) beyond Flash memories. However the conventional access architecture based on 1 transistor + 1 memory cell limits its storage density as the selection transistor should be large enough to ensure enough Current for the switching operation, This paper describes a design of crossbar architecture based on 2R complementary Resistive switching memory cell, This architecture allows fewer selection transistors, and minimum contacts between memory cells and CMOS control circuits, The complementary cell and parallel data sensing mitigate the impact of sneak Currents in the crossbar architecture, We performed transient simulations based on two memory technologies: STT-MRAM and OxRRAM to validate the functionality of this design by using CMOS 65 nm design kit and memory compact models.","author":["W.

These displays present an additive combination of images at a discrete set of optical distances, allowing the viewer to focus at different distances in the simulated scene. Our proposed technique extends the capabilities of multi-plane displays to general scenes with occlusions and non-Lambertian effects by using a model of defocus in the eye of the viewer. Requiring no explicit knowledge of the scene geometry, our technique uses an optimization algorithm to compute the images to be displayed on the presentation planes so that the retinal images when accommodating to different distances match the corresponding retinal images of the input scene as closely as possible. We demonstrate the utility of the technique using imagery acquired from both synthetic and real-world scenes, and analyze the system's characteristics including bounds on achievable resolution.","author":["Rahul Narain","Rachel A.

In conventional design, higher levels of synthesis produce a netlist, from which layout synthesis builds a mask specification for manufacturing. Timing analysis is built into a feedback loop to detect timing violations which are then used to update specifications to synthesis. Such iteration is undesirable, and for very high performance designs, infeasible. The problem is likely to become much worse with future generations of technology. To achieve a non-iterative design flow, we propose that early synthesis stages should use \u201cwireplanning\u201d to distribute delays over the functional elements and interconnect, and layout synthesis should use its degrees of freedom to realize those delays. In this paper we attempt to quantify this problem for future technologies and propose some solutions for a \u201cconstant delay\u201d methodology.","author":["Ralph H. J. M. Otten","Robert K.

Conventional CF-based methods use the ratings given to items by users as the sole source of information for learning to make recommendation. However, the ratings are often very sparse in many applications, causing CF-based methods to degrade significantly in their recommendation performance. To address this sparsity problem, auxiliary information such as item content information may be utilized. Collaborative topic regression (CTR) is an appealing recent method taking this approach which tightly couples the two components that learn from two different sources of information. Nevertheless, the latent representation learned by CTR may not be very effective when the auxiliary information is very sparse. To address this problem, we generalize recently advances in deep learning from i.i.d. input to non-i.i.d. (CF-based) input and propose in this paper a hierarchical Bayesian model called collaborative deep learning (CDL), which jointly performs deep representation learning for the content information and collaborative filtering for the ratings (feedback) matrix. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets from different domains show that CDL can significantly advance the state of the art.","author":["Hao Wang","Naiyan Wang","Dit-Yan Yeung"],"issue":["KDD '15: Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2015","Pages   1235\u20131244","https://doi.org/10.1145/2783258.2783273"],"date":"10 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"D.

Previous studies have shown potential for cueing to improve upper limb rehabilitation, although these have been conducted in clinical settings. In this paper we describe CueS, a wrist worn cueing device which prompts the wearer to move their upper limb more frequently in their day to day lives. We conducted two, week-long 'in the wild' deployments of CueS with seven participants to obtain reflections and experiences around using the device. All participants reported increased general activity levels from wearing CueS and objective data showed increased levels of activity following cue provision. We reflect upon the potential of wearable cueing devices for upper limb rehabilitation after stroke.","author":["Amey Holden","R\u00f3is\u00edn McNaney","Madeline Balaam","Robin Thompson","Nils Hammerla","Thomas Ploetz","Dan Jackson","Christopher Price","Lianne Brkic","Patrick Olivier"],"issue":["British HCI '15: Proceedings of the 2015 British HCI Conference","July 2015","Pages   18\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2783446.2783576"],"date":"13 July 2015","ref":[{"text":"Bowman Alankus, G. et al.

Standard TCP/IP stacks cannot meet these requirements, but Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) can. On IP-routed datacenter networks, RDMA is deployed using RoCEv2 protocol, which relies on Priority-based Flow Control (PFC) to enable a drop-free network. However, PFC can lead to poor application performance due to problems like head-of-line blocking and unfairness. To alleviates these problems, we introduce DCQCN, an end-to-end congestion control scheme for RoCEv2. To optimize DCQCN performance, we build a fluid model, and provide guidelines for tuning switch buffer thresholds, and other protocol parameters. Using a 3-tier Clos network testbed, we show that DCQCN dramatically improves throughput and fairness of RoCEv2 RDMA traffic. DCQCN is implemented in Mellanox NICs, and is being deployed in Microsoft's datacenters.","author":["Yibo Zhu","Haggai Eran","Daniel Firestone","Chuanxiong Guo","Marina Lipshteyn","Yehonatan Liron","Jitendra Padhye","Shachar Raindel","Mohamad Haj Yahia","Ming Zhang"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Conference on Special Interest Group on Data Communication","August 2015","Pages   523\u2013536","https://doi.org/10.1145/2785956.2787484"],"date":"17 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"M.

Thus, good FinFET delay and power models are urgently needed to facilitate FinFET IC design at the upcoming technology nodes. Another urgent problem that needs to be addressed with continued technology scaling is how to analyze circuit performance and power consumption under process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Such variations arise due to limitations of lithography that lead to variations in the physical dimensions of the device or due to environmental variations. In this article, we propose a delay/power modeling framework for analysis of FinFET logic circuits under PVT variations. We present models for FinFET logic gates and three FinFET SRAM cells. We use GenFin, which is a genetic algorithm based statistical circuit-level delay/power optimizer, to produce the models for functional units (FUs) employed in a processor. We compare the impact of PVT variations at the 22nm and 14nm FinFET technology nodes. We evaluate cache performance for various cache capacities and temperatures as well as that of FUs. Our device simulation results show that the 3\u03c3/\u03bc spread for 14nm circuits is, on average, 38.5% higher in dynamic power and 21.4% higher in logarithm of leakage power relative to 22nm FinFET circuits. However, the delay spread depends on the circuit.","author":["Aoxiang Tang","Xun Gao","Lung-Yen Chen","Niraj K.

In order to take advantage of the local GPUs and the low-latency high-throughput interconnects that link them, programmers need to meticulously adapt parallel applications with respect to load balancing, boundary conditions and device synchronization. This paper presents MAPS-Multi, an automatic multi-GPU partitioning framework that distributes the workload based on the underlying memory access patterns. The framework consists of host- and device-level APIs that allow programs to efficiently run on a variety of GPU and multi-GPU architectures. The framework implements several layers of code optimization, device abstraction, and automatic inference of inter-GPU memory exchanges. The paper demonstrates that the performance of MAPS-Multi achieves near-linear scaling on fundamental computational operations, as well as real-world applications in deep learning and multivariate analysis.","author":["Tal Ben-Nun","Ely Levy","Amnon Barak","Eri Rubin"],"issue":["SC '15: Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2015","Article No.: 19","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2807591.2807611"],"date":"15 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"M.

Despite its importance, still much remains to be determined regarding how faults disseminate or at what rate do they impact HPC applications. The understanding of where and how fast faults propagate could lead to more efficient implementation of application-driven error detection and recovery. In this work, we propose a fault propagation framework to analyze how faults propagate in MPI applications and to understand their vulnerability to faults. We employ a combination of compiler-level code transformation and instrumentation, along with a runtime checker. Using the information provided by our framework, we employ machine learning technique to derive application fault propagation models that can be used to estimate the number of corrupted memory locations at runtime.","author":["Rizwan A.

Nevertheless, the WNoC systems encounter high failure rates due to problems pertaining to integration and manufacturing of wireless interconnection in nano-domain technology. As a result, the permanent failures may lead to the formation of any shape of faulty regions in the interconnection network, which can break down the whole system. This issue is not investigated in previous studies on WNoC architectures. Our solution advocates the adoption of communication structures with both node and link on disjoint paths. On the other hand, the imposed costs of WNoC design must be reasonable. Hence, a novel approach to design an optimized fault-tolerant hybrid hierarchical WNoC architecture for enhancing performance as well as minimizing system costs is proposed. The experimental results indicate that the robustness of this newly proposed design is significantly enhanced in comparison with its the fault-tolerant wire-based counterparts in the presence of various faulty regions under both synthetic and application-specific traffic patterns.","author":["Abbas Dehghani","Kamal Jamshidi"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 12","Issue 4","July 2016","Article No.: 45","pp   1\u201337","https://doi.org/10.1145/2814572"],"date":"15 March 2016","ref":[{"text":"N.

In this article, emerging technologies are investigated by leveraging their unique properties for applications in the hardware security domain. Security, for the first time, will be treated as one design metric for emerging nano-architecture. Five example circuit structures including camouflaging gates, polymorphic gates, current/voltage-based circuit protectors, and current-based XOR logic are designed to show the high efficiency of silicon nanowire FETs and graphene SymFET in applications such as circuit protection and IP piracy prevention. Simulation results indicate that highly efficient and secure circuit structures can be achieved via the use of non-CMOS devices.","author":["Yu Bi","Kaveh Shamsi","Jiann-Shiun Yuan","Pierre-Emmanuel Gaillardon","Giovanni De Micheli","Xunzhao Yin","X.

To overcome these limitations, system designers are exploring alternative solutions that combine DRAM and emerging NVRAM technologies. Previous work on heterogeneous memories focuses, mainly, on two system designs: PCache, a hierarchical, inclusive memory system, and HRank, a flat, non-inclusive memory system. We demonstrate that neither of these designs can universally achieve high performance and energy efficiency across a suite of HPC workloads. In this work, we investigate the impact of a number of multi-level memory designs on the performance, power, and energy consumption of applications. To achieve this goal and overcome the limited number of available tools to study heterogeneous memories, we created HMsim, an infrastructure that enables n-level, heterogeneous memory studies by leveraging existing memory simulators. We, then, propose HpMC, a new memory controller design that combines the best aspects of existing management policies to improve performance and energy. Our energy-aware memory management system dynamically switches between PCache and HRank based on the temporal locality of applications. Our results show that HpMC reduces energy consumption from 13% to 45% compared to PCache and HRank, while providing the same bandwidth and higher capacity than a conventional DRAM system.","author":["ChunYi Su","David Roberts","Edgar A.

However, poor write performance is one of the most critical problems for practical applications of MLC PRAM. In this article, we present two schemes to improve write performance by controlling the target resistance distribution of MLC PRAM cells. First, we propose multiple RESET/SET operations that relax the target resistance bands of intermediate logic levels with additional RESET/SET operations, which reduces the program time of intermediate logic levels, thereby improving write performance. Second, we propose a two-step write scheme consisting of lightweight write and idle-time completion write that exploits the fact that hot dirty data tend to be overwritten in a short time period and the MLC PRAM often has long idle times. Experimental results show that the multiple RESET/SET and two-step write schemes result in an average IPC improvement of 15.7% and 10.4%, respectively, on a hybrid DRAM/PRAM main memory subsystem. Furthermore, their integrated solution results in an average IPC improvement of 23.2% (up to 46.4%).","author":["Youngsik Kim","Sungjoo Yoo","Sunggu Lee"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 21","Issue 2","January 2016","Article No.: 23","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/2820610"],"date":"28 January 2016","ref":[{"text":"J.

However, extracting accurate inferences from raw sensor data is challenging within the noisy and complex environments where these systems are deployed. Deep Learning -- is one of the most promising approaches for overcoming this challenge, and achieving more robust and reliable inference. Techniques developed within this rapidly evolving area of machine learning are now state-of-the-art for many inference tasks (such as, audio sensing and computer vision) commonly needed by IoT and wearable applications. But currently deep learning algorithms are seldom used in mobile/IoT class hardware because they often impose debilitating levels of system overhead (e.g., memory, computation and energy). Efforts to address this barrier to deep learning adoption are slowed by our lack of a systematic understanding of how these algorithms behave at inference time on resource constrained hardware. In this paper, we present the first -- albeit preliminary -- measurement study of common deep learning models (such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Deep Neural Networks) on representative mobile and embedded platforms. The aim of this investigation is to begin to build knowledge of the performance characteristics, resource requirements and the execution bottlenecks for deep learning models when being used to recognize categories of behavior and context. The results and insights of this study, lay an empirical foundation for the development of optimization methods and execution environments that enable deep learning to be more readily integrated into next-generation IoT, smartphones and wearable systems.","author":["Nicholas D.

Different from traditional academic search systems that focus on document (paper) search, AMiner aims to provide a systematic modeling approach for researchers (authors), ultimately to gain a deep understanding of the big (heterogeneous) network formed by authors, papers they have published, and venues they published those papers. The system extracts researchers' profiles automatically from the Web and integrates the researcher profiles with publication papers after name disambiguation. For now, the system has collected a big scholar data with more than 130,000,000 researcher profiles and 100,000,000 papers from multiple publication databases. We also developed an approach named COSNET to connect AMiner with several professional social networks such as LinkedIn and VideoLectures, which significantly enriches the metadata of the scholarly data. Based on the integrated big scholar data, we devise a unified topic modeling approach for modeling the different entities (authors, papers, venues) simultaneously and provide a topic-level expertise search by leveraging the modeling results. In addition, AMiner offers a set of researcher-centered functions including social influence analysis, influence visualization, collaboration recommendation, relationship mining, similarity analysis and community evolution. The system has been put into operation since 2006 and has attracted more than 7,000,000 independent IP accesses from over 200 countries/regions.","author":["Jie Tang"],"issue":["WSDM '16: Proceedings of the Ninth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2016","Pages   467","https://doi.org/10.1145/2835776.2835849"],"date":"08 February 2016","ref":[{"text":"L.

The SDSoC Development Environment is a heterogeneous design environment for implementing embedded systems using the Zynq SoC and MPSoC. It enables the broader community of embedded software developers to leverage the power of hardware and software programmable devices, entirely from a higher-level of abstraction. The SDSoC environment provides a greatly simplified embedded C/C++ application programming experience including an easy-to-use Eclipse IDE and a comprehensive development platform. SDSoC includes a full-system optimizing C/C++ compiler, system-level profiling and hardware/software event tracing, automated software acceleration in programming logic, automated generation of SW-HW connectivity, and integration with libraries to speed programing. The SDSoC compiler transforms programs into complete hardware/software systems based on user-specified target platform and functions within the program to compile into programmable hardware logic. Hardware accelerators communicate with the CPU and external memory through an automatically-generated, application-specific data motion network comprised of DMAs, interconnects and other standard IP blocks. The SDSoC Environment also provides flows for customer and 3rd party developers to enable their platforms and integrate RTL IPs as C-callable libraries. It builds upon customer-proven design tools from Xilinx including Vivado Design Suite, Vivado High-level Synthesis and SDK. In this presentation, we will introduce the motivation and basic concepts behind SDSoC, describe its capabilities and the user-flow, and provide a brief demonstration of the tool using an example.","author":["Vinod Kathail","James Hwang","Welson Sun","Yogesh Chobe","Tom Shui","Jorge Carrillo"],"issue":["FPGA '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2016","Pages   4","https://doi.org/10.1145/2847263.2847284"],"date":"21 February 2016"},{"_id":"10.1145/285243.285248","doi":"10.1145/285243.285248","title":"Best-effort versus reservations: a simple comparative analysis","abstract":"Using a simple analytical model, this paper addresses the following question: Should the Internet retain its best-effort-only architecture, or should it adopt one that is reservation-capable? We characterize the differences between reservation-capable and best-effort-only networks in terms of application performance and total welfare. Our analysis does not yield a definitive answer to the question we pose, since it would necessarily depend on unknowable factors such as the future cost of network bandwidth and the nature of the future traffic load. However, our model does reveal some interesting phenomena. First, in some circumstances, the amount of incremental bandwidth needed to make a best-effort-only network perform as well as a reservation capable one diverges as capacity increases. Second, in some circumstances reservation-capable networks retain significant advantages over best-effort-only networks, no matter how cheap bandwidth becomes. Lastly, we find bounds on the maximum performance advantage a reservation-capable network can achieve over best-effort architectures.","author":["Lee Breslau","Scott Shenker"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 28","Issue 4","Oct. 1998","pp   3\u201316","https://doi.org/10.1145/285243.285248"],"date":"01 October 1998","ref":[{"text":"Jan Beran, Robert Sherman, Murad S.

In this context, several works have investigated how to design persistent trees in SCM as a fundamental building block for these novel systems. However, these trees are significantly slower than DRAM-based counterparts since trees are latency-sensitive and SCM exhibits higher latencies than DRAM. In this paper we propose a novel hybrid SCM-DRAM persistent and concurrent B-Tree, named Fingerprinting Persistent Tree (FPTree) that achieves similar performance to DRAM-based counterparts. In this novel design, leaf nodes are persisted in SCM while inner nodes are placed in DRAM and rebuilt upon recovery. The FPTree uses Fingerprinting, a technique that limits the expected number of in-leaf probed keys to one. In addition, we propose a hybrid concurrency scheme for the FPTree that is partially based on Hardware Transactional Memory. We conduct a thorough performance evaluation and show that the FPTree outperforms state-of-the-art persistent trees with different SCM latencies by up to a factor of 8.2. Moreover, we show that the FPTree scales very well on a machine with 88 logical cores. Finally, we integrate the evaluated trees in memcached and a prototype database. We show that the FPTree incurs an almost negligible performance overhead over using fully transient data structures, while significantly outperforming other persistent trees.","author":["Ismail Oukid","Johan Lasperas","Anisoara Nica","Thomas Willhalm","Wolfgang Lehner"],"issue":["SIGMOD '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data","June 2016","Pages   371\u2013386","https://doi.org/10.1145/2882903.2915251"],"date":"14 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"SR.

Therefore, OpenCL compilers employ static analyses to identify non-divergent control flow and memory accesses in order to produce faster code. However, divergence is often input-dependent, hence can be observed for some, but not all inputs. In these cases, vectorizing compilers have to generate slow code because divergence can occur at run time. In this paper, we use a polyhedral abstraction to partition the input space of an OpenCL kernel. For each partition, divergence analysis produces more precise results i.e., it can classify more code parts as non-divergent. Consequently, specializing the kernel for the input space partitions allows for generating better SIMD code because of less divergence. We implemented our technique in an OpenCL driver for the AVX instruction set and evaluate it on a range of OpenCL benchmarks. We observe speed ups of up to 9x for irregular kernels over a state-of-the-art vectorizing OpenCL driver.","author":["Simon Moll","Johannes Doerfert","Sebastian Hack"],"issue":["CC 2016: Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Compiler Construction","March 2016","Pages   251\u2013260","https://doi.org/10.1145/2892208.2892217"],"date":"17 March 2016","ref":[{"text":"J.

To further prolong the lifetime of a PCM device, there exist a number of techniques that can be grouped in two categories: 1) reducing the write rate to PCM cells, and 2) handling cell failures when faults occur. Our experiments confirm that during write operations, an extensive non-uniformity in bit ips is exhibited. To reduce this non-uniformity, we present byte-level shifting scheme (BLESS) which reduces write pressure over hot cells of blocks.

However, today's DMFBs suffer from several limitations: (i) constraints on droplet size and the inability to vary droplet volume in a fine-grained manner; (ii) the lack of integrated sensors for real-time detection; (iii) the need for special fabrication processes and reliability/yield concerns. To overcome the above problems, DMFBs based on a micro-electrode-dot-array (MEDA) architecture have recently been demonstrated. However, due to the inherent differences between today's DMFBs and MEDA, existing synthesis solutions cannot be utilized for MEDA-based biochips. We present the first biochip synthesis approach that can be used for MEDA. The proposed synthesis method targets operation scheduling, module placement, routing of droplets of various sizes, and diagonal movement of droplets in a two-dimensional array. Simulation results using benchmarks and experimental results using a fabricated MEDA biochip demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed co-optimization technique.","author":["Zipeng Li","Kelvin Yi-Tse Lai","Po-Hsien Yu","Tsung-Yi Ho","Krishnendu Chakrabarty","Chen-Yi Lee"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 146","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898028"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"R.

However, practical encryption algorithms demonstrate strong diffusion characteristics that increase cell flips, resulting in increased write energy/latency and reduced lifetime of NVMs. State-of-the-art security solutions have focused on reducing the encryption penalty (increased write energy/latency and reduced memory lifetime) in single-level cell (SLC) NVMs; however, the realization of low encryption penalty solutions for multi-/triple-level cell (MLC/TLC) secure NVMs remains an open area of research. This work synergistically integrates zero-based partial writes with XOR-based energy masking to realize Smartly EnCRypted Energy efficienT, i.e., SECRET MLC/TLC NVMs, without compromising the security of the underlying encryption technique. Our simulations on an MLC (TLC) resistive RAM (RRAM) architecture across SPEC CPU2006 workloads demonstrate that for 6.25% (7.84%) memory overhead, SECRET reduces write energy by 80% (63%), latency by 37% (49%), and improves memory lifetime by 63% (56%) over conventional advanced encryption standard-based (AES-based) counter mode encryption.","author":["Shivam Swami","Joydeep Rakshit","Kartik Mohanram"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 166","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898087"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":", 2011.","order":1},{"text":"B.

However, with technology advancements, multi-port memories are facing severe challenges due to their bit-cell leakage and scalability, as well as reliability issues due to increase in design complexity. In this paper, we design a novel multi-port memory architecture in which we employ emerging Spin Orbit Torque (SOT) magnetic devices as a storing component because of its several beneficial attributes such as non-volatility, scalability, zero-leakage, almost infinite endurance, low access latency, low area and immunity to soft-errors. Moreover, due to separate read and write current paths in these devices, simultaneous read and write operations can be performed on the same cell while maintaining data integrity. In our proposed architecture, we have demonstrated that with this characteristic of SOT, the read-write contention can be resolved inherently at the device-level, which can simplify the overall multi-port design. Experimental results show that our proposed multi-port design has low access latency, and high energy efficiency with negligible area overhead.","author":["Rajendra Bishnoi","Fabian Oboril","Mehdi B.

Cross-modal hashing, which enables efficient retrieval of images in response to text queries or vice versa, has received increasing attention recently. Most existing work on cross-modal hashing does not capture the spatial dependency of images and temporal dynamics of text sentences for learning powerful feature representations and cross-modal embeddings that mitigate the heterogeneity of different modalities. This paper presents a new Deep Visual-Semantic Hashing (DVSH) model that generates compact hash codes of images and sentences in an end-to-end deep learning architecture, which capture the intrinsic cross-modal correspondences between visual data and natural language. DVSH is a hybrid deep architecture that constitutes a visual-semantic fusion network for learning joint embedding space of images and text sentences, and two modality-specific hashing networks for learning hash functions to generate compact binary codes. Our architecture effectively unifies joint multimodal embedding and cross-modal hashing, which is based on a novel combination of Convolutional Neural Networks over images, Recurrent Neural Networks over sentences, and a structured max-margin objective that integrates all things together to enable learning of similarity-preserving and high-quality hash codes. Extensive empirical evidence shows that our DVSH approach yields state of the art results in cross-modal retrieval experiments on image-sentences datasets, i.e. standard IAPR TC-12 and large-scale Microsoft COCO.","author":["Yue Cao","Mingsheng Long","Jianmin Wang","Qiang Yang","Philip S.

Approximation is useful only if its impact on application output quality is acceptable to the users. However, there is a lack of systematic solutions and studies that explore users' perspective on the effects of approximation. In this paper, we seek to provide one such solution for the developers to probe and discover the boundary of quality loss that most users will deem acceptable. We propose AxGames, a crowdsourced solution that enables developers to readily infer a statistical common ground from the general public through three entertaining games. The users engage in these games by betting on their opinion about the quality loss of the final output while the AxGames framework collects statistics about their perceptions. The framework then statistically analyzes the results to determine the acceptable levels of quality for a pair of (application, approximation technique). The three games are designed such that they effectively capture quality requirements with various tradeoffs and contexts. To evaluate AxGames, we examine seven diverse applications that produce user perceptible outputs and cover a wide range of domains, including image processing, optical character recognition, speech to text conversion, and audio processing. We recruit 700 participants/users through Amazon's Mechanical Turk to play the games that collect statistics about their perception on different levels of quality. Subsequently, the AxGames framework uses the Clopper-Pearson exact method, which computes a binomial proportion confidence interval, to analyze the collected statistics for each level of quality. Using this analysis, AxGames can statistically project the quality level that satisfies a given percentage of users. The developers can use these statistical projections to tune the level of approximation based on the user experience. We find that the level of acceptable quality loss significantly varies across applications. For instance, to satisfy 90% of users, the level of acceptable quality loss is 2% for one application (image processing) and 26% for another (audio processing). Moreover, the pattern with which the crowd responds to approximation takes significantly different shape and form depending on the class of applications.

Significant benefits, in terms of energy-efficiency and performance, are reported for in-memory arithmetic circuits, neural networks, CAM, cache hierarchy and even fully programmable processors. In contrast, design automation tools supporting the development of such designs are still in a nascent phase. By leveraging the native stateful logic operation capability of ReRAM devices, several logic synthesis flows have been reported. In this paper, we complement these flows with a detailed study on the technology mapping phase for ReRAM devices. We provide a delay-optimal solution for technology mapping without area constraint and propose further heuristics to achieve device count reduction and to support delay optimization under the constraint of parallel instruction dispatch. We report at least 3x less delay compared to the na\u00efve technology mapping adopted in recent studies. The proposed heuristics achieve 56% on average reduction in device count. Finally, a range of performance trade-offs is identified by applying the constraint of parallel instruction dispatch without noticeable degradation of delay.","author":["Debjyoti Bhattacharjee","Anupam Chattopadhyay"],"issue":["ICCAD '16: Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2016","Article No.: 119","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967020"],"date":"07 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"L.

An image processing pipeline can be viewed as a graph of interconnected stages that processes images successively. Each stage typically performs a point-wise, stencil, or other more complex operations on image pixels. Recent efforts have led to the development of domain-specific languages (DSL) and optimization frameworks for image processing pipelines. In this paper, we develop an approach to map image processing pipelines expressed in the PolyMage DSL to efficient parallel FPGA designs. Our approach exploits reuse and available memory bandwidth (or chip resources) maximally. When compared to Darkroom, a state-of-the-art approach to compile high-level DSL to FPGAs, our approach (a) leads to designs that deliver significantly higher throughput, and (b) supports a greater variety of filters. Furthermore, the designs we generate obtain an improvement even over pre-optimized FPGA implementations provided by vendor libraries for some of the benchmarks.","author":["Nitin Chugh","Vinay Vasista","Suresh Purini","Uday Bondhugula"],"issue":["PACT '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation","September 2016","Pages   327\u2013338","https://doi.org/10.1145/2967938.2967969"],"date":"11 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"C.

Previous solutions look at data generated by human activities, such as night time lights and phone calls, for population estimation. However, these mechanisms cannot achieve both real-time and fine-grained population estimation because the data sampling rate is low and spatial granularity chosen is improper. We address these two problems by leveraging a key insight --- people frequently use data plan on cellphones and leave mobility signatures on cellular networks. Therefore, we are able to exploit these cellular signatures for real-time population estimation. Extracting population information from cellular data records is not easy because the number of users recorded by a cellular tower is not equal to the population covered by the tower, and mobile users' behavior is spatially and temporally different, where static estimating model does not work. We exploit context-aware city segmentation and dynamic population estimation model to address these challenges. We show that the population estimation error is reduced by 22.5% on a cellular dataset that includes 1 million users.","author":["Fengli Xu","Pengyu Zhang","Yong Li"],"issue":["UbiComp '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing","September 2016","Pages   1064\u20131075","https://doi.org/10.1145/2971648.2971673"],"date":"12 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"Marta C Gonzalez, Cesar A Hidalgo, and Albert-Laszlo Barabasi.

In this paper, we present a word representation scheme that incorporates authorship information. While maintaining similarity among related words in the induced distributed space, our word vectors can be effectively used for some text classification tasks too. We build on a log-bilinear document model (lbDm), which extracts document features, and word vectors based on word co-occurrence counts. First, we propose a log-bilinear author model (lbAm), which contains an additional author matrix. We show that by directly learning author feature vectors, as opposed to document vectors, we can learn better word representations for the authorship attribution task. Furthermore, authorship information has been found to be useful for sentiment classification. We enrich the author model with a sentiment tensor, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this hybrid model (lbHm) through our experiments on a movie review-classification dataset.","author":["Javid Ebrahimi","Dejing Dou"],"issue":["CIKM '16: Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2016","Pages   1925\u20131928","https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983875"],"date":"24 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"Physical activity and health: A report of the Surgeon General.

Evidenced by Microsoft's FPGA deployment in its Bing search engine and Intel's 16.7 billion acquisition of Altera, integrating FPGAs into datacenters is considered one of the most promising approaches to sustain future datacenter growth. However, it is quite challenging for existing big data computing systems---like Apache Spark and Hadoop---to access the performance and energy benefits of FPGA accelerators. In this paper we design and implement Blaze to provide programming and runtime support for enabling easy and efficient deployments of FPGA accelerators in datacenters. In particular, Blaze abstracts FPGA accelerators as a service (FaaS) and provides a set of clean programming APIs for big data processing applications to easily utilize those accelerators. Our Blaze runtime implements an FaaS framework to efficiently share FPGA accelerators among multiple heterogeneous threads on a single node, and extends Hadoop YARN with accelerator-centric scheduling to efficiently share them among multiple computing tasks in the cluster. Experimental results using four representative big data applications demonstrate that Blaze greatly reduces the programming efforts to access FPGA accelerators in systems like Apache Spark and YARN, and improves the system throughput by 1.7\u00d7 to 3\u00d7 (and energy efficiency by 1.5\u00d7 to 2.7\u00d7) compared to a conventional CPU-only cluster.","author":["Muhuan Huang","Di Wu","Cody Hao Yu","Zhenman Fang","Matteo Interlandi","Tyson Condie","Jason Cong"],"issue":["SoCC '16: Proceedings of the Seventh ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing","October 2016","Pages   456\u2013469","https://doi.org/10.1145/2987550.2987569"],"date":"05 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"Apache Hadoop. https://hadoop.apache.org.

As computer architectures evolve toward heterogeneous multi-cores composed of a mix of cores and hardware accelerators, designing hardware accelerators for ML techniques can simultaneously achieve high efficiency and broad application scope.While efficient computational primitives are important for a hardware accelerator, inefficient memory transfers can potentially void the throughput, energy, or cost advantages of accelerators, that is, an Amdahl's law effect, and thus, they should become a first-order concern, just like in processors, rather than an element factored in accelerator design on a second step. In this article, we introduce a series of hardware accelerators (i.e., the DianNao family) designed for ML (especially neural networks), with a special emphasis on the impact of memory on accelerator design, performance, and energy. We show that, on a number of representative neural network layers, it is possible to achieve a speedup of 450.65x over a GPU, and reduce the energy by 150.31x on average for a 64-chip DaDianNao system (a member of the DianNao family).<!-- END_PAGE_1 -->","author":["Yunji Chen","Tianshi Chen","Zhiwei Xu","Ninghui Sun","Olivier Temam"],"issue":["Communications of the ACM","Volume 59","Issue 11","November 2016","pp   105\u2013112","https://doi.org/10.1145/2996864"],"date":"28 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"Cadambi, S., Durdanovic, I., Jakkula, V., Sankaradass, M., Cosatto, E., Chakradhar, S., Graf, H.P.

Since Caffe2C generates a single C code which includes everything needed to execute the trained CNN, csCaffe2C makes it easy to run CNN-based applications on any kinds of mobile devices and embedding devices without GPUs. Moreover, Caffe2C achieves faster execution speed compared to the existing Caffe for iOS/Android and the OpenCV iOS/Android DNN class. The reasons are as follows: (1) directly converting of trained CNN models to C codes, (2) efficient use of NEON/BLAS with multithreading, and (3) performing pre-computation as much as possible in the computation of CNNs. In addition, in this paper, we demonstrate the availability of Caffe2C by showing four kinds of CNN-base object recognition mobile applications.","author":["Ryosuke Tanno","Keiji Yanai"],"issue":["MOBIQUITOUS 2016: Adjunct Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing Networking and Services","November 2016","Pages   159\u2013164","https://doi.org/10.1145/3004010.3004025"],"date":"28 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"M.

Because of this, GPUs are widely used for accelerating DNNs. Current FPGAs offer superior energy efficiency (Ops/Watt), but they do not offer the performance of today's GPUs on DNNs. In this paper, we look at upcoming FPGA technology advances, the rapid pace of innovation in DNN algorithms, and consider whether future high-performance FPGAs will outperform GPUs for next-generation DNNs. The upcoming Intel\u00ae 14-nm Stratix? 10 FPGAs will have thousands of hard floating-point units (DSPs) and on-chip RAMs (M20K memory blocks). They will also have high bandwidth memories (HBMs) and improved frequency (HyperFlex? core architecture). This combination of features brings FPGA raw floating point performance within striking distance of GPUs. Meanwhile, DNNs are quickly evolving. For example, recent innovations that exploit sparsity (e.g., pruning) and compact data types (e.g., 1-2 bit) result in major leaps in algorithmic efficiency. However, these innovations introduce irregular parallelism on custom data types, which are difficult for GPUs to handle but would be a great fit for FPGA's extreme customizability. This paper evaluates a selection of emerging DNN algorithms on two generations of Intel FPGAs (Arria'10, Stratix'10) against the latest highest performance Titan X Pascal GPU. We created a customizable DNN accelerator template for FPGAs and used it in our evaluations. First, we study various GEMM operations for next-generation DNNs. Our results show that Stratix 10 FPGA is 10%, 50%, and 5.4x better in performance (TOP/sec) than Titan X Pascal GPU on GEMM operations for pruned, Int6, and binarized DNNs, respectively. Then, we present a detailed case study on accelerating Ternary ResNet which relies on sparse GEMM on 2-bit weights (i.e., weights constrained to 0,+1,-1) and full-precision neurons. The Ternary ResNet accuracy is within ~1% of the full-precision ResNet which won the 2015 ImageNet competition. On Ternary-ResNet, the Stratix 10 FPGA can deliver 60% better performance over Titan X Pascal GPU, while being 2.3x better in performance/watt. Our results indicate that FPGAs may become the platform of choice for accelerating next-generation DNNs.","author":["Eriko Nurvitadhi","Ganesh Venkatesh","Jaewoong Sim","Debbie Marr","Randy Huang","Jason Ong Gee Hock","Yeong Tat Liew","Krishnan Srivatsan","Duncan Moss","Suchit Subhaschandra","Guy Boudoukh"],"issue":["FPGA '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2017","Pages   5\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/3020078.3021740"],"date":"22 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"M.

However, it cannot effectively handle infrequent data-dependent structural and data hazards because they are conservatively assumed to always occur in the synthesized pipeline. To enable high-throughput pipelining of irregular loops, we study the problem of augmenting HLS with application-specific dynamic hazard resolution, and examine its implications on scheduling and quality of results. We propose to generate an aggressive pipeline at compile-time while resolving hazards with memory port arbitration and squash-and-replay at run-time.

A promising trend is to exploit the recent improvements in memory, storage media, and networks for sustaining high performance and low cost. While past work explores using memory or SSDs as local storage or combine local with network-attached storage in cluster computing, this work focuses on managing multiple storage tiers in a distributed setting. We present OctopusFS, a novel distributed file system that is aware of heterogeneous storage media (e.g., memory, SSDs, HDDs, NAS) with different capacities and performance characteristics. The system offers a variety of pluggable policies for automating data management across the storage tiers and cluster nodes. The policies employ multi-objective optimization techniques for making intelligent data management decisions based on the requirements of fault tolerance, data and load balancing, and throughput maximization. At the same time, the storage media are explicitly exposed to users and applications, allowing them to choose the distribution and placement of replicas in the cluster based on their own performance and fault tolerance requirements. Our extensive evaluation shows the immediate benefits of using OctopusFS with data-intensive processing systems, such as Hadoop and Spark, in terms of both increased performance and better cluster utilization.","author":["Elena Kakoulli","Herodotos Herodotou"],"issue":["SIGMOD '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data","May 2017","Pages   65\u201378","https://doi.org/10.1145/3035918.3064023"],"date":"09 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

An agent (a learning machine) is trained to perform a task from demonstrations by learning a mapping between observations and actions. The idea of teaching by imitation has been around for many years; however, the field is gaining attention recently due to advances in computing and sensing as well as rising demand for intelligent applications. The paradigm of learning by imitation is gaining popularity because it facilitates teaching complex tasks with minimal expert knowledge of the tasks. Generic imitation learning methods could potentially reduce the problem of teaching a task to that of providing demonstrations, without the need for explicit programming or designing reward functions specific to the task. Modern sensors are able to collect and transmit high volumes of data rapidly, and processors with high computational power allow fast processing that maps the sensory data to actions in a timely manner. This opens the door for many potential AI applications that require real-time perception and reaction such as humanoid robots, self-driving vehicles, human computer interaction, and computer games, to name a few. However, specialized algorithms are needed to effectively and robustly learn models as learning by imitation poses its own set of challenges. In this article, we survey imitation learning methods and present design options in different steps of the learning process. We introduce a background and motivation for the field as well as highlight challenges specific to the imitation problem. Methods for designing and evaluating imitation learning tasks are categorized and reviewed. Special attention is given to learning methods in robotics and games as these domains are the most popular in the literature and provide a wide array of problems and methodologies. We extensively discuss combining imitation learning approaches using different sources and methods, as well as incorporating other motion learning methods to enhance imitation. We also discuss the potential impact on industry, present major applications, and highlight current and future research directions.","author":["Ahmed Hussein","Mohamed Medhat Gaber","Eyad Elyan","Chrisina Jayne"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 50","Issue 2","June 2017","Article No.: 21","pp   1\u201335","https://doi.org/10.1145/3054912"],"date":"06 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"Pieter Abbeel, Adam Coates, Morgan Quigley, and Andrew Y.

To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel extension to the SDF model, called SDF/L graph, specifying the loop structures explicitly in a hierarchical fashion. With a given SDF/L graph specification and the mapping and scheduling information, an application can be automatically parallelized on a multicore system. The enhanced expression capability by the proposed extension is verified with two applications, k-means clustering and deep neural network application.","author":["Hyesun Hong","Hyunok Oh","Soonhoi Ha"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 39","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062260"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Sander Stuijk, Marc Geilen, Bart Theelen, and Twan Basten.

State-of-the-art CNN models for large-scale applications are computation intensive and memory expensive and, hence, are mainly processed on high-performance processors like server CPUs and GPUs. However, there is an increasing demand of high-accuracy or real-time object detection tasks in large-scale clusters or embedded systems, which requires energy-efficient accelerators because of the green computation requirement or the limited battery restriction. Due to the advantages of energy efficiency and reconfigurability, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have been widely explored as CNN accelerators. In this article, we present an in-depth analysis of computation complexity and the memory footprint of each CNN layer type. Then a scalable parallel framework is proposed that exploits four levels of parallelism in hardware acceleration. We further put forward a systematic design space exploration methodology to search for the optimal solution that maximizes accelerator throughput under the FPGA constraints such as on-chip memory, computational resources, external memory bandwidth, and clock frequency. Finally, we demonstrate the methodology by optimizing three representative CNNs (LeNet, AlexNet, and VGG-S) on a Xilinx VC709 board. The average performance of the three accelerators is 424.7, 445.6, and 473.4GOP/s under 100MHz working frequency, which outperforms the CPU and previous work significantly.","author":["Zhiqiang Liu","Yong Dou","Jingfei Jiang","Jinwei Xu","Shijie Li","Yongmei Zhou","Yingnan Xu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 10","Issue 3","July 2017","Article No.: 17","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079758"],"date":"19 July 2017","ref":[{"text":"Ossama Abdel-Hamid, Abdel-Rahman Mohamed, Hui Jiang, Li Deng, Gerald Penn, and Dong Yu. 2014.

In the radix-4 type of page tables used in x86 architectures, a TLB-miss necessitates up to 24 memory references for one guest to host translation. While dedicated page walk caches and such recent enhancements eliminate many of these memory references, our measurements on the Intel Skylake processors indicate that many programs in virtualized mode of execution still spend hundreds of cycles for translations that do not hit in the TLBs. This paper presents an innovative scheme to reduce the cost of address translations by using a very large Translation Lookaside Buffer that is part of memory, the POM-TLB. In the POM-TLB, only one access is required instead of up to 24 accesses required in commonly used 2D walks with radix-4 type of page tables. Even if many of the 24 accesses may hit in the page walk caches, the aggregated cost of the many hits plus the overhead of occasional misses from page walk caches still exceeds the cost of one access to the POM-TLB. Since the POM-TLB is part of the memory space, TLB entries (as opposed to multiple page table entries) can be cached in large L2 and L3 data caches, yielding significant benefits. Through detailed evaluation running SPEC, PARSEC and graph workloads, we demonstrate that the proposed POM-TLB improves performance by approximately 10% on average. The improvement is more than 16% for 5 of the benchmarks. It is further seen that a POM-TLB of 16MB size can eliminate nearly all TLB misses in 8-core systems.","author":["Jee Ho Ryoo","Nagendra Gulur","Shuang Song","Lizy K.

If we are to realize the dream of ubiquitous computing promised by the Internet of Things, processors must shed large, heavy, expensive, and high maintenance batteries and, instead, harvest energy from their environment. One challenge with this transition is that harvested energy is insufficient for continuous operation. Unfortunately, existing programs fail miserably when executed intermittently. This paper presents Clank: lightweight architectural support for correct and efficient execution of long-running applications on harvested energy---without programmer intervention or extreme hardware modifications. Clank is a set of hardware buffers and memory-access monitors that dynamically maintain idempotency. Essentially, Clank dynamically decomposes program execution into a stream of restartable sub-executions connected via lightweight checkpoints. To validate Clank's ability to correctly stretch program execution across frequent, random power cycles, and to explore the associated hardware and software overheads, we implement Clank in Verilog, formally verify it, and then add it to an ARM Cortex M0+ processor which we use to run a set of 23 embedded systems benchmarks. Experiments show run-time overheads as low as 2.5%, with run-time overheads of 6% for a version of Clank that adds 1.7% hardware. Clank minimizes checkpoints so much that re-execution time becomes the dominate contributor to run-time overhead.","author":["Matthew Hicks"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   228\u2013240","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080238"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"ARM. 2016.

Sample use cases include policy-based bandwidth allocation to flow aggregates, rate-based congestion control algorithms, and packet pacing to avoid bursty transmissions that can overwhelm router buffers. Driven by the need to scale to millions of flows and to apply complex policies, traffic shaping is moving from network switches into the end hosts, typically implemented in software in the kernel networking stack. In this paper, we show that the performance overhead of end-host traffic shaping is substantial limits overall system scalability as we move to thousands of individual traffic classes per server. Measurements from production servers show that shaping at hosts consumes considerable CPU and memory, unnecessarily drops packets, suffers from head of line blocking and inaccuracy, and does not provide backpressure up the stack. We present Carousel, a framework that scales to tens of thousands of policies and flows per server, built from the synthesis of three key ideas: i) a single queue shaper using time as the basis for releasing packets, ii) fine-grained, just-in-time freeing of resources in higher layers coupled to actual packet departures, and iii) one shaper per CPU core, with lock-free coordination. Our production experience in serving video traffic at a Cloud service provider shows that Carousel shapes traffic accurately while improving overall machine CPU utilization by 8% (an improvement of 20% in the CPU utilization attributed to networking) relative to state-of-art deployments. It also conforms 10 times more accurately to target rates, and consumes two orders of magnitude less memory than existing approaches.","author":["Ahmed Saeed","Nandita Dukkipati","Vytautas Valancius","Vinh The Lam","Carlo Contavalli","Amin Vahdat"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '17: Proceedings of the Conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication","August 2017","Pages   404\u2013417","https://doi.org/10.1145/3098822.3098852"],"date":"07 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"2002. pfifo-tc: PFIFO Qdisc.

To be effective, they should allow bug triagers to easily understand and reproduce the potential reported bugs, by clearly describing the Observed Behavior (OB), the Steps to Reproduce (S2R), and the Expected Behavior (EB). Unfortunately, while considered extremely useful, reporters often miss such pieces of information in bug reports and, to date, there is no effective way to automatically check and enforce their presence. We manually analyzed nearly 3k bug reports to understand to what extent OB, EB, and S2R are reported in bug reports and what discourse patterns reporters use to describe such information. We found that (i) while most reports contain OB (i.e., 93.5%), only 35.2% and 51.4% explicitly describe EB and S2R, respectively; and (ii) reporters recurrently use 154 discourse patterns to describe such content. Based on these findings, we designed and evaluated an automated approach to detect the absence (or presence) of EB and S2R in bug descriptions. With its best setting, our approach is able to detect missing EB (S2R) with 85.9% (69.2%) average precision and 93.2% (83%) average recall. Our approach intends to improve bug descriptions quality by alerting reporters about missing EB and S2R at reporting time.","author":["Oscar Chaparro","Jing Lu","Fiorella Zampetti","Laura Moreno","Massimiliano Di Penta","Andrian Marcus","Gabriele Bavota","Vincent Ng"],"issue":["ESEC/FSE 2017: Proceedings of the 2017 11th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering","August 2017","Pages   396\u2013407","https://doi.org/10.1145/3106237.3106285"],"date":"21 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"2016.

As qubits are very sensitive to noise, they rely on continuous error correction to maintain the correct state. Current proposals rely on software-managed error correction and require large instruction bandwidth, which must scale in proportion to the number of qubits. While such a design may be reasonable for small-scale quantum computers, we show that instruction bandwidth tends to become a critical bottleneck for scaling quantum computers. In this paper, we show that 99.999% of the instructions in the instruction stream of a typical quantum workload stem from error correction. Using this observation, we propose QuEST (<u>Q</u>uantum <u>E</u>rror-Correction <u>S</u>ubs<u>t</u>rate), an architecture that delegates the task of quantum error correction to the hardware. QuEST uses a dedicated programmable micro-coded engine to continuously replay the instruction stream associated with error correction. The instruction bandwidth requirement of QuEST scales in proportion to the number of active qubits (typically << 0.1%) rather than the total number of qubits. We analyze the effectiveness of QuEST with area and thermal constraints and propose a scalable microarchitecture using typical Quantum Error Correction Code (QECC) execution patterns. Our evaluations show that QuEST reduces instruction bandwidth demand of several key workloads by five orders of magnitude while ensuring deterministic instruction delivery. Apart from error correction, we also observe a large instruction bandwidth requirement for fault tolerant quantum instructions (magic state distillation). We extend QuEST to manage these instructions in hardware and provide additional reduction in bandwidth. With QuEST, we reduce the total instruction bandwidth by eight orders of magnitude.","author":["Swamit S. Tannu","Zachary A. Myers","Prashant J. Nair","Douglas M. Carmean","Moinuddin K.

However, because of extreme computing resource requirements, DCNN need to be implemented by hardware accelerator. In this paper, we present an FPGA-based accelerator design techniques of DCNN for handwritten Hangul character recognition engine. We achieved about 11.9ms recognition time per character with Xilinx FPGA accelerator. Our design optimization was performed with Xilinx HLS and SDAccel environment targeting Kintex XCKU115 FPGA from Xilinx. Our design outperforms CPU in terms of execution time 6.25 times, and GPGPU in terms of energy efficiency 4.7 times and cooling cost for the computing servers by 17 times. We think the research results imply deep learning with FPGA accelerator will be alternative to GPGPU solutions for real-time applications, especially in data centers or sever farms.","author":["Hanwool Park","Changdae Lee","Hakkyung Lee","Yechan Yoo","Yoonjin Park","Injung Kim","Kang Yi"],"issue":["CASES '17: Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on Compilers, Architectures and Synthesis for Embedded Systems Companion","October 2017","Article No.: 11","Pages   1\u20132","https://doi.org/10.1145/3125501.3125522"],"date":"15 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Bengio, Y, \"Learning deep architectures for A.I.\", Found. and Tredn in Machine Learning, Vol 2, No 1, 2009","order":1},{"text":"I.-J.

With high-level synthesis (HLS), designers can easily obtain several performance-cost trade-off implementations for each component of a complex hardware accelerator. However, navigating this design space in search of the Pareto-optimal implementations at the system level is a hard optimization task. We present COSMOS, an automatic methodology for the design-space exploration (DSE) of complex accelerators, that coordinates both HLS and memory optimization tools in a compositional way. First, thanks to the co-design of datapath and memory, COSMOS produces a large set of Pareto-optimal implementations for each component of the accelerator. Then, COSMOS leverages compositional design techniques to quickly converge to the desired trade-off point between cost and performance at the system level. When applied to the system-level design (SLD) of an accelerator for wide-area motion imagery (WAMI), COSMOS explores the design space as completely as an exhaustive search, but it reduces the number of invocations to the HLS tool by up to 14.6\u00d7.","author":["Luca Piccolboni","Paolo Mantovani","Giuseppe Di Guglielmo","Luca P.

Online voting imposes new challenges on recommendation, because the propagation of votings heavily depends on the structure of social networks as well as the content of votings. In this paper, we investigate how to utilize these two factors in a comprehensive manner when doing voting recommendation. First, due to the fact that existing text mining methods such as topic model and semantic model cannot well process the content of votings that is typically short and ambiguous, we propose a novel Topic-Enhanced Word Embedding (TEWE) method to learn word and document representation by jointly considering their topics and semantics. Then we propose our Joint Topic-Semantic-aware social Matrix Factorization (JTS-MF) model for voting recommendation. JTS-MF model calculates similarity among users and votings by combining their TEWE representation and structural information of social networks, and preserves this topic-semantic-social similarity during matrix factorization. To evaluate the performance of TEWE representation and JTS-MF model, we conduct extensive experiments on real online voting dataset. The results prove the efficacy of our approach against several state-of-the-art baselines.","author":["Hongwei Wang","Jia Wang","Miao Zhao","Jiannong Cao","Minyi Guo"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   347\u2013356","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132889"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"David M.

Most previous research in KG completion has focused on the problem of inferring missing entities and missing relation types between entities. However, in addition to these, many KGs also suffer from missing entity types (i.e. the category labels for entities, such as /music/artist). Entity types are a critical enabler for many NLP tasks that use KGs as a reference source, and inferring missing entity types remains an important outstanding obstacle in the field of KG completion. Inspired by recent work to build a contextual KG embedding model, we propose a novel approach to address the entity type prediction problem. We compare the performance of our method with several state-of-the-art KG embedding methods, and show that our approach gives higher prediction accuracy compared to baseline algorithms on two real-world datasets. Our approach also produces consistently high accuracy when inferring entities and relation types, as well as the primary task of inferring entity types. This is in contrast to many of the baseline methods that specialize in one prediction task or another. We achieve this while preserving linear scalability with the number of entity types.

To our knowledge, however, existing concretely efficient MPC constructions are only for up to three parties. In this paper we design and implement a new actively secure 5PC protocol tolerating two corruptions that requires 8 rounds of interaction, only uses fast symmetric-key operations, and incurs 60% less communication than the passively secure state-of-the-art solution from the work of Ben-Efraim, Lindell, and Omri [CCS 2016]. For example, securely evaluating the AES circuit when the parties are in different regions of the U.S. and Europe only takes 1.8s which is 2.6x faster than the passively secure 5PC in the same environment. Instrumental for our efficiency gains (less interaction, only symmetric key primitives) is a new 4-party primitive we call Attested OT, which in addition to Sender and Receiver involves two additional \"assistant parties\" who will attest to the respective inputs of both parties, and which might be of broader applicability in practically relevant MPC scenarios. Finally, we also show how to generalize our construction to n parties with similar efficiency properties where the corruption threshold is t \u2248 \u221an, and propose a combinatorial problem which, if solved optimally, can yield even better corruption thresholds for the same cost.","author":["Nishanth Chandran","Juan A.

This has triggered the development of DL frameworks like Caffe, Torch, TensorFlow, and CNTK. However, most DL frameworks have been limited to a single node. In order to scale out DL frameworks and bring HPC capabilities to the DL arena, we propose, S-Caffe; a scalable and distributed Caffe adaptation for modern multi-GPU clusters. With an in-depth analysis of new requirements brought forward by the DL frameworks and limitations of current communication runtimes, we present a co-design of the Caffe framework and the MVAPICH2-GDR MPI runtime. Using the co-design methodology, we modify Caffe's workflow to maximize the overlap of computation and communication with multi-stage data propagation and gradient aggregation schemes. We bring DL-Awareness to the MPI runtime by proposing a hierarchical reduction design that benefits from CUDA-Aware features and provides up to a massive 133x speedup over OpenMPI and 2.6x speedup over MVAPICH2 for 160 GPUs. S-Caffe successfully scales up to 160 K-80 GPUs for GoogLeNet (ImageNet) with a speedup of 2.5x over 32 GPUs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that scales up to 160 GPUs. Furthermore, even for single node training, S-Caffe shows an improvement of 14\\% and 9\\% over Nvidia's optimized Caffe for 8 and 16 GPUs, respectively. In addition, S-Caffe achieves up to 1395 samples per second for the AlexNet model, which is comparable to the performance of Microsoft CNTK.","author":["Ammar Ahmad Awan","Khaled Hamidouche","Jahanzeb Maqbool Hashmi","Dhabaleswar K.

However, untrustworthy users give fraudulent ratings for excessive monetary gains. In this paper, we present REV2, a system to identify such fraudulent users. We propose three interdependent intrinsic quality metrics---fairness of a user, reliability of a rating and goodness of a product. The fairness and reliability quantify the trustworthiness of a user and rating, respectively, and goodness quantifies the quality of a product. Intuitively, a user is fair if it provides reliable scores that are close to the goodness of products. We propose six axioms to establish the interdependency between the scores, and then, formulate a mutually recursive definition that satisfies these axioms. We extend the formulation to address cold start problem and incorporate behavior properties. We develop the REV2 algorithm to calculate these intrinsic quality scores for all users, ratings, and products. We show that this algorithm is guaranteed to converge and has linear time complexity. By conducting extensive experiments on five rating datasets, we show that REV2 outperforms nine existing algorithms in detecting fair and unfair users. We reported the 150 most unfair users in the Flipkart network to their review fraud investigators, and 127 users were identified as being fraudulent(84.6% accuracy). The REV2 algorithm is being deployed at Flipkart.","author":["Srijan Kumar","Bryan Hooi","Disha Makhija","Mohit Kumar","Christos Faloutsos","V.S.

The robot\u00bbs overall system and its unique multi-modal interface are discussed first. Then, the result of an early stage evaluation of robot\u00bbs designed behaviors is explained. Finally, a primary function - the robot suspending all interactions for a period by hiding its head and limbs inside the shell - is proposed to restrain children\u00bbs robot abusing. The results show that the function, with an appropriate operating time, effectively reduces children\u00bbs robot abusing while maintaining their engagement with the robot.","author":["Hyunjin Ku","Jason J.

However, graph processing on traditional architectures issues many random and irregular memory accesses, leading to a huge number of data movements and the consumption of very large amounts of energy. To minimize the waste of memory bandwidth, we investigate utilizing processing-in-memory (PIM), combined with non-volatile metal-oxide resistive random access memory (ReRAM), to improve both computation and I/O performance.We propose a new ReRAM-based processing-in-memory architecture called RPBFS, in which graph data can be persistently stored and processed in place. We study the problem of graph traversal, and we design an efficient graph traversal algorithm in RPBFS. Benefiting from low data movement overhead and high bank-level parallel computation, RPBFS shows a significant performance improvement compared with both the CPU-based and the GPU-based BFS implementations. On a suite of real-world graphs, our architecture yields a speedup in graph traversal performance of up to 33.8\u00d7, and achieves a reduction in energy over conventional systems of up to 142.8\u00d7.","author":["Lei Han","Zhaoyan Shen","Duo Liu","Zili Shao","H.

Liveness is gaining attention among industrial and open-source communities; several IDEs offer high degrees of liveness. While several studies looked at how programmers work during software evolution tasks, none of them consider live environments. We conduct such a study based on an analysis of 17 programming sessions of practitioners using Pharo, a mature Live Programming environment. The study is complemented by a survey and subsequent analysis of 16 programming sessions in additional languages, e.g., JavaScript. We document the approaches taken by developers during their work. We find that some liveness features are extensively used, and have an impact on the way developers navigate source code and objects in their work.","author":["Juraj Kubelka","Romain Robbes","Alexandre Bergel"],"issue":["ICSE '18: Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Software Engineering","May 2018","Pages   1090\u20131101","https://doi.org/10.1145/3180155.3180200"],"date":"27 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"K.

Through empirical evidence, both models have been proven to be effective in a wide variety of machine learning tasks such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and text classification. Conventionally, like most neural networks, both of the aforementioned RNN variants employ the Softmax function as its final output layer for its prediction, and the cross-entropy function for computing its loss. In this paper, we present an amendment to this norm by introducing linear support vector machine (SVM) as the replacement for Softmax in the final output layer of a GRU model. Furthermore, the cross-entropy function shall be replaced with a margin-based function. While there have been similar studies, this proposal is primarily intended for binary classification on intrusion detection using the 2013 network traffic data from the honeypot systems of Kyoto University. Results show that the GRU-SVM model performs relatively higher than the conventional GRU-Softmax model. The proposed model reached a training accuracy of \u224881.54% and a testing accuracy of \u224884.15%, while the latter was able to reach a training accuracy of \u224863.07% and a testing accuracy of \u224870.75%. In addition, the juxtaposition of these two final output layers indicate that the SVM would outperform Softmax in prediction time - a theoretical implication which was supported by the actual training and testing time in the study.","author":["Abien Fred M.

On average, across several image classification CNNs and for a configuration that can perform the equivalent of 128 16b \u00d7 16b multiply-accumulate operations per cycle LM outperforms a state-of-the-art bit-parallel accelerator [3] by 3.19\u00d7 without any loss in accuracy while being 2.59\u00d7 more energy efficient.

Our approach is to use large batch size, powered by the Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (LARS) algorithm, for efficient usage of massive computing resources. Our approach is generic, as we empirically evaluate the effectiveness on two neural networks: AlexNet and ResNet-50 trained with the ImageNet-1k dataset while preserving the state-of-the-art test accuracy. Compared to the baseline of a previous study from a group of researchers at Facebook, our approach shows higher test accuracy on batch sizes that are larger than 16K. Using 2,048 Intel Xeon Platinum 8160 processors, we reduce the 100-epoch AlexNet training time from hours to 11 minutes. With 2,048 Intel Xeon Phi 7250 Processors, we reduce the 90-epoch ResNet-50 training time from hours to 20 minutes. Our implementation is open source and has been released in the Intel distribution of Caffe v1.0.7.","author":["Yang You","Zhao Zhang","Cho-Jui Hsieh","James Demmel","Kurt Keutzer"],"issue":["ICPP 2018: Proceedings of the 47th International Conference on Parallel Processing","August 2018","Article No.: 1","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3225058.3225069"],"date":"13 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"Takuya Akiba, Shuji Suzuki, and Keisuke Fukuda. 2017.

Towards this end, many cloud operators have started deploying hardware accelerators, like FPGAs, to increase the performance of computational intensive tasks but increasing the programming complexity to utilize these accelerators. VINEYARD has developed an efficient framework that allows the seamless deployment and utilization of hardware accelerators in the cloud without increasing the programming complexity and offering the flexibility of software packages. This paper presents the main components that have been developed in this framework such as the runtime system, the virtualization and the central accelerators\u00e2\u0102\u0179 repository. The proposed platform has been demonstrated into 2 real use cases; neurocomputing applications and machine learning algorithms. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme can achieve up to 25x speedup without increasing the programming complexity of these applications and it also demonstrates how it can be used for large suite of applications.","author":["Christoforos Kachris","Dimitrios Soudris","Stelios Mavridis","Manolis Pavlidakis","Christi Symeonidou","Christos Kozanitis","Angelos Bilas","Damon Fenacci","Sharatchandra Varma Bogaraju","Hans Vandierendonck","Dimitrios S.

Nevertheless, the latency-sensitive nature of memory-resident services makes seamless integration of SCM in servers questionable. In this paper, we ask the question of how best to introduce SCM for such servers to improve overall performance/cost over existing DRAM-only architectures. We first show that even with the most optimistic latency projections for SCM, the higher memory access latency results in prohibitive performance degradation. However, we find that deployment of a modestly sized high-bandwidth 3D stacked DRAM cache makes the performance of an SCM-mostly memory system competitive. The high degree of spatial locality that memory-resident services exhibit not only simplifies the DRAM cache's design as page-based, but also enables the amortization of increased SCM access latencies and the mitigation of SCM's read/write latency disparity. We identify the set of memory hierarchy design parameters that plays a key role in the performance and cost of a memory system combining an SCM technology and a 3D stacked DRAM cache. We then introduce a methodology to drive provisioning for each of these design parameters under a target performance/cost goal. Finally, we use our methodology to derive concrete results for specific SCM technologies. With PCM as a case study, we show that a two bits/cell technology hits the performance/cost sweet spot, reducing the memory subsystem cost by 40% while keeping performance within 3% of the best performing DRAM-only system, whereas single-level and triple-level cell organizations are impractical for use as memory replacements.","author":["Dmitrii Ustiugov","Alexandros Daglis","Javier Picorel","Mark Sutherland","Edouard Bugnion","Babak Falsafi","Dionisios Pnevmatikatos"],"issue":["MEMSYS '18: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Memory Systems","October 2018","Pages   3\u201316","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240302.3240310"],"date":"01 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Neha Agarwal and Thomas F.

To extract effective features for these analysis tasks, network embedding automatically learns a low-dimensional vector representation for each node, such that the meaningful topological proximity is well preserved. While the embedding algorithms on pure topological structure have attracted considerable attention, in practice, nodes are often abundantly accompanied with other types of meaningful information, such as node attributes, second-order proximity, and link directionality. A general framework for incorporating the heterogeneous information into network embedding could be potentially helpful in learning better vector representations. However, it remains a challenging task to jointly embed the geometrical structure and a distinct type of information due to the heterogeneity. In addition, the real-world networks often contain a large number of nodes, which put demands on the scalability of the embedding algorithms. To bridge the gap, in this article, we propose a general embedding framework named Heterogeneous Information Learning in Large-scale networks (HILL) to accelerate the joint learning. It enables the simultaneous node proximity assessing process to be done in a distributed manner by decomposing the complex modeling and optimization into many simple and independent sub-problems. We validate the significant correlation between the heterogeneous information and topological structure, and illustrate the generalizability of HILL by applying it to perform attributed network embedding and second-order proximity learning. A variation is proposed for link directionality modeling. Experimental results on real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HILL.","author":["Xiao Huang","Jundong Li","Na Zou","Xia Hu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data","Volume 12","Issue 6","October 2018","Article No.: 70","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/3241063"],"date":"01 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Amr Ahmed, Nino Shervashidze, Shravan Narayanamurthy, Vanja Josifovski, and Alexander J.

To tackle the food safety issues from the technical aspect, people need a trusted food traceability system that can track and monitor the whole lifespan of food production, including the processes of food raw material cultivation/breeding, processing, transporting, warehousing, and selling etc. In this paper, we propose a trusted, self-organized, open and ecological food traceability system based on blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which involves all parties of a smart agriculture ecosystem, even if they may not trust each other. We use IoT devices to replace manual recording and verification as many as possible, which can reduce the human intervention to the system effectively. Furthermore, we plan to use the smart contract technology to help the law-executor to find problems and process them timely.","author":["Jun Lin","Zhiqi Shen","Anting Zhang","Yueting Chai"],"issue":["ICCSE'18: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Crowd Science and Engineering","July 2018","Article No.: 3","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3265689.3265692"],"date":"28 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"X.

In many cases, performing computations on uncertain data as if it were exact leads to incorrect results. Unfortunately, developing applications for processing uncertain data is a major challenge from both the mathematical and performance perspectives. This paper proposes and evaluates an approach for tackling this challenge in DAG-based data processing systems. We present a framework for uncertainty propagation (UP) that allows developers to modify precise implementations of DAG nodes to process uncertain inputs with modest effort. We implement this framework in a system called UP-MapReduce, and use it to modify ten applications, including AI/ML, image processing and trend analysis applications to process uncertain data. Our evaluation shows that UP-MapReduce propagates uncertainties with high accuracy and, in many cases, low performance overheads. For example, a social network trend analysis application that combines data sampling with UP can reduce execution time by 2.3x when the user can tolerate a maximum relative error of 5% in the final answer. These results demonstrate that our UP framework presents a compelling approach for handling uncertain data in DAG processing.","author":["Ioannis Manousakis","\u00cd\u00f1igo Goiri","Ricardo Bianchini","Sandro Rigo","Thu D.

When applying HIN to the recommendation, there are two problems: how to extract features from meta paths and how to properly fuse these features to further improve recommendations. Some recent work has employed deep neural network to learn user and item representation, and attention mechanism has been explored to integrate information for recommendation. Inspired by these work, in this paper, we propose Heterogeneous Neural Attentive Factorization Machine(HNAFM) to solve above problems. Specifically, we first calculate the commuting matrices based on meta paths and use multilayer perceptrons to learn user and item features. A hierarchical attention mechanism is employed to find the meta path that best describes user's preference and item's property. Comprehensive experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed HNAFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art rating prediction methods.","author":["Liang Chen","Yang Liu","Zibin Zheng","Philip Yu"],"issue":["CIKM '18: Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2018","Pages   833\u2013842","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271759"],"date":"17 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

It helps end users more efficiently and more easily access the substantial and valuable knowledge in the KG, without knowing its data structures. QA-KG is a nontrivial problem since capturing the semantic meaning of natural language is difficult for a machine. Meanwhile, many knowledge graph embedding methods have been proposed. The key idea is to represent each predicate/entity as a low-dimensional vector, such that the relation information in the KG could be preserved. The learned vectors could benefit various applications such as KG completion and recommender systems. In this paper, we explore to use them to handle the QA-KG problem. However, this remains a challenging task since a predicate could be expressed in different ways in natural language questions. Also, the ambiguity of entity names and partial names makes the number of possible answers large. To bridge the gap, we propose an effective Knowledge Embedding based Question Answering (KEQA) framework. We focus on answering the most common types of questions, i.e., simple questions, in which each question could be answered by the machine straightforwardly if its single head entity and single predicate are correctly identified. To answer a simple question, instead of inferring its head entity and predicate directly, KEQA targets at jointly recovering the question's head entity, predicate, and tail entity representations in the KG embedding spaces. Based on a carefully-designed joint distance metric, the three learned vectors' closest fact in the KG is returned as the answer. Experiments on a widely-adopted benchmark demonstrate that the proposed KEQA outperforms the state-of-the-art QA-KG methods.","author":["Xiao Huang","Jingyuan Zhang","Dingcheng Li","Ping Li"],"issue":["WSDM '19: Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","January 2019","Pages   105\u2013113","https://doi.org/10.1145/3289600.3290956"],"date":"30 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2015.

To speed up LSTM inference, previous research proposes weight pruning techniques to reduce computational cost. Unfortunately, irregular computation and memory accesses in unrestricted sparse LSTM limit the realizable parallelism, especially when implemented on FPGA. To address this issue, some researchers propose block-based sparsity patterns to increase the regularity of sparse weight matrices, but these approaches suffer from deteriorated prediction accuracy. This work presents Bank-Balanced Sparsity (BBS), a novel sparsity pattern that can maintain model accuracy at a high sparsity level while still enable an efficient FPGA implementation. BBS partitions each weight matrix row into banks for parallel computing, while adopts fine-grained pruning inside each bank to maintain model accuracy. We develop a 3-step software-hardware co-optimization approach to apply BBS in real FPGA hardware. First, we propose a bank-balanced pruning method to induce the BBS pattern on weight matrices. Then we introduce a decoding-free sparse matrix format, Compressed Sparse Banks (CSB), that transparently exposes inter-bank parallelism in BBS to hardware. Finally, we design an FPGA accelerator that takes advantage of BBS to eliminate irregular computation and memory accesses. Implemented on Intel Arria-10 FPGA, the BBS accelerator can achieve 750.9 GOPs on sparse LSTM networks with a batch size of 1. Compared to state-of-the-art FPGA accelerators for LSTM with different compression techniques, the BBS accelerator achieves 2.3 ~ 3.7x improvement on energy efficiency and 7.0 ~ 34.4x reduction on latency with negligible loss of model accuracy.","author":["Shijie Cao","Chen Zhang","Zhuliang Yao","Wencong Xiao","Lanshun Nie","Dechen Zhan","Yunxin Liu","Ming Wu","Lintao Zhang"],"issue":["FPGA '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2019","Pages   63\u201372","https://doi.org/10.1145/3289602.3293898"],"date":"20 February 2019","ref":[{"text":"2018.

As such knowledge graphs represent an attractive source of information that could help improve recommender systems. However, existing approaches in this domain rely on manual feature engineering and do not allow for an end-to-end training. Here we propose Knowledge-aware Graph Neural Networks with Label Smoothness regularization (KGNN-LS) to provide better recommendations. Conceptually, our approach computes user-specific item embeddings by first applying a trainable function that identifies important knowledge graph relationships for a given user. This way we transform the knowledge graph into a user-specific weighted graph and then apply a graph neural network to compute personalized item embeddings. To provide better inductive bias, we rely on label smoothness assumption, which posits that adjacent items in the knowledge graph are likely to have similar user relevance labels/scores. Label smoothness provides regularization over the edge weights and we prove that it is equivalent to a label propagation scheme on a graph. We also develop an efficient implementation that shows strong scalability with respect to the knowledge graph size. Experiments on four datasets show that our method outperforms state of the art baselines. KGNN-LS also achieves strong performance in cold-start scenarios where user-item interactions are sparse.","author":["Hongwei Wang","Fuzheng Zhang","Mengdi Zhang","Jure Leskovec","Miao Zhao","Wenjie Li","Zhongyuan Wang"],"issue":["KDD '19: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2019","Pages   968\u2013977","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292500.3330836"],"date":"25 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"Shumeet Baluja, Rohan Seth, D Sivakumar, Yushi Jing, Jay Yagnik, Shankar Kumar, Deepak Ravichandran, and Mohamed Aly. 2008.

Representation learning presents an attractive opportunity to model the dynamic evolution of users and items, where each user/item can be embedded in a Euclidean space and its evolution can be modeled by an embedding trajectory in this space. However, existing dynamic embedding methods generate embeddings only when users take actions and do not explicitly model the future trajectory of the user/item in the embedding space. Here we propose JODIE, a coupled recurrent neural network model that learns the embedding trajectories of users and items. JODIE employs two recurrent neural networks to update the embedding of a user and an item at every interaction. Crucially, JODIE also models the future embedding trajectory of a user/item. To this end, it introduces a novel projection operator that learns to estimate the embedding of the user at any time in the future. These estimated embeddings are then used to predict future user-item interactions. To make the method scalable, we develop a t-Batch algorithm that creates time-consistent batches and leads to 9x faster training. We conduct six experiments to validate JODIE on two prediction tasks---future interaction prediction and state change prediction---using four real-world datasets. We show that JODIE outperforms six state-of-the-art algorithms in these tasks by at least 20% in predicting future interactions and 12% in state change prediction.","author":["Srijan Kumar","Xikun Zhang","Jure Leskovec"],"issue":["KDD '19: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2019","Pages   1269\u20131278","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292500.3330895"],"date":"25 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"Kdd cup 2015. https://biendata.com/competition/kddcup2015/data/.","order":1},{"text":"Reddit data dump. http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/.","order":2},{"text":"Wikipedia edit history dump. https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dumps.","order":3},{"text":"D.

Generally, very high dimensional medical images are down-sampled by using interpolation techniques before feeding them to deep learning models that are ImageNet compliant and accept only low-resolution images of size 224 x 224 px. This popular technique may lead to the loss of key information thus hampering the classification. Significant pathological features in medical images typically being small sized and highly affected. To combat this problem, we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) based classification approach which learns to reduce the resolution of the image using an autoencoder and at the same time classify it using another network, while both the tasks are trained jointly. This algorithm guides the model to learn essential representations from high-resolution images for classification along with reconstruction. We have used the publicly available dataset of chest x-rays to evaluate this approach and have outperformed state-of-the-art on test data. Besides, we have experimented with the effects of different augmentation approaches in this dataset and report baselines using some well known ImageNet class of CNNs.","author":["Ekagra Ranjan","Soumava Paul","Siddharth Kapoor","Aupendu Kar","Ramanathan Sethuraman","Debdoot Sheet"],"issue":["ICVGIP 2018: Proceedings of the 11th Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing","December 2018","Article No.: 55","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3293353.3293408"],"date":"03 May 2020","ref":[{"text":"Ivo M Baltruschat, Hannes Nickisch, Michael Grass, Tobias Knopp, and Axel Saalbach. 2018.

Regrettably, to efficiently search the metadata within these files remains challenging due to the sheer size of the datasets. Existing solutions extract the metadata and store it in external database management systems (DBMS) to locate desired data. However, this practice introduces significant overhead and complexity in extraction and querying. In this research, we propose a novel <u>M</u>etadata <u>I</u>ndexing and <u>Q</u>uerying <u>S</u>ervice (MIQS), which removes the external DBMS and utilizes in-memory index to achieve efficient metadata searching. MIQS follows the self-contained data management paradigm and provides portable and schema-free metadata indexing and querying functionalities for self-describing file formats. We have evaluated MIQS with the state-of-the-art MongoDB-based metadata indexing solution. MIQS achieved up to 99% time reduction in index construction and up to 172kx search performance improvement with up to 75% reduction in memory footprint.","author":["Wei Zhang","Suren Byna","Houjun Tang","Brody Williams","Yong Chen"],"issue":["SC '19: Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2019","Article No.: 5","Pages   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/3295500.3356146"],"date":"17 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"2018.

Dynamically remapping logical qubits to physical qubits in the compiler is needed to enable the two-qubit gates in the algorithm, which introduces additional operations and inevitably reduces the fidelity of the algorithm. Previous solutions in finding such remapping suffer from high complexity, poor initial mapping quality, and limited flexibility and control. To address these drawbacks mentioned above, this paper proposes a SWAP-based Bidirectional heuristic search algorithm (SABRE), which is applicable to NISQ devices with arbitrary connections between qubits. By optimizing every search attempt, globally optimizing the initial mapping using a novel reverse traversal technique, introducing the decay effect to enable the trade-off between the depth and the number of gates of the entire algorithm, SABRE outperforms the best known algorithm with exponential speedup and comparable or better results on various benchmarks.","author":["Gushu Li","Yufei Ding","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["ASPLOS '19: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","April 2019","Pages   1001\u20131014","https://doi.org/10.1145/3297858.3304023"],"date":"04 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"Mohammad AlFailakawi, Imtiaz Ahmad, and Suha Hamdan. 2014.

Multiplication is the key arithmetic in these applications and an approximate multiplier has the potential to reduce both power and area. In this study, first, we propose the approximate and, then, the accurate compression method for an 8-bit multiplier. The proposed compression method single handedly reduces eight rows of partial products into three and, then, thoroughly processes the rows into two. Comparison of the conventional Wallace tree multiplier demonstrates that the proposed approximate multiplier with the compression reduces power and area by 73.7% and 60.3%, respectively. In addition, compared with two existing low-power approximate multipliers, the proposed multiplier achieves higher reductions than these state-of-the-art multipliers relative to power, area, and delay, with undegraded accuracy. These improvements can be also found from the results of a popular CNN application.","author":["Tongxin Yang","Tomoaki Ukezono","Toshinori Sato"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '19: Proceedings of the 2019 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2019","Pages   39\u201344","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299874.3317975"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"S.

Specifically, they do not rely on any assumptions about the distribution and can generate real-like samples from latent space in a simple manner. This powerful property allows GANs to be applied to various applications such as image synthesis, image attribute editing, image translation, domain adaptation, and other academic fields. In this article, we discuss the details of GANs for those readers who are familiar with, but do not comprehend GANs deeply or who wish to view GANs from various perspectives. In addition, we explain how GANs operates and the fundamental meaning of various objective functions that have been suggested recently. We then focus on how the GAN can be combined with an autoencoder framework. Finally, we enumerate the GAN variants that are applied to various tasks and other fields for those who are interested in exploiting GANs for their research.","author":["Yongjun Hong","Uiwon Hwang","Jaeyoon Yoo","Sungroh Yoon"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 52","Issue 1","January 2020","Article No.: 10","pp   1\u201343","https://doi.org/10.1145/3301282"],"date":"13 February 2019","ref":[{"text":"Pieter Abbeel and Andrew Y.

As opposed to Von Neumann machines, brain-inspired processors aim at bringing closer the memory and the computational elements to efficiently evaluate machine learning algorithms. Recently, spiking neural networks, a generation of cognitive algorithms employing computational primitives mimicking neuron and synapse operational principles, have become an important part of deep learning. They are expected to improve the computational performance and efficiency of neural networks, but they are best suited for hardware able to support their temporal dynamics. In this survey, we present the state of the art of hardware implementations of spiking neural networks and the current trends in algorithm elaboration from model selection to training mechanisms. The scope of existing solutions is extensive; we thus present the general framework and study on a case-by-case basis the relevant particularities. We describe the strategies employed to leverage the characteristics of these event-driven algorithms at the hardware level and discuss their related advantages and challenges.","author":["Maxence Bouvier","Alexandre Valentian","Thomas Mesquida","Francois Rummens","Marina Reyboz","Elisa Vianello","Edith Beigne"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 15","Issue 2","June 2019","Article No.: 22","pp   1\u201335","https://doi.org/10.1145/3304103"],"date":"05 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"S.

These advantages of GNNs provide great potential to advance social recommendation since data in social recommender systems can be represented as user-user social graph and user-item graph; and learning latent factors of users and items is the key. However, building social recommender systems based on GNNs faces challenges. For example, the user-item graph encodes both interactions and their associated opinions; social relations have heterogeneous strengths; users involve in two graphs (e.g., the user-user social graph and the user-item graph). To address the three aforementioned challenges simultaneously, in this paper, we present a novel graph neural network framework (GraphRec) for social recommendations. In particular, we provide a principled approach to jointly capture interactions and opinions in the user-item graph and propose the framework GraphRec, which coherently models two graphs and heterogeneous strengths. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework GraphRec.","author":["Wenqi Fan","Yao Ma","Qing Li","Yuan He","Eric Zhao","Jiliang Tang","Dawei Yin"],"issue":["WWW '19: The World Wide Web Conference","May 2019","Pages   417\u2013426","https://doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313488"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Rianne van den Berg, Thomas N Kipf, and Max Welling. 2017.

To foster their pervasive adoption in applications where low latency, privacy issues and data bandwidth are paramount, the current trend is to perform inference tasks at the edge. This requires deployment of DL algorithms on low-energy and resource-constrained computing nodes, often heterogenous and parallel, that are usually more complex to program and to manage without adequate support and experience. In this paper, we present ALOHA, an integrated tool flow that tries to facilitate the design of DL applications and their porting on embedded heterogenous architectures. The proposed tool flow aims at automating different design steps and reducing development costs. ALOHA considers hardware-related variables and security, power efficiency, and adaptivity aspects during the whole development process, from pre-training hyperparameter optimization and algorithm configuration to deployment.","author":["Paolo Meloni","Daniela Loi","Paola Busia","Gianfranco Deriu","Andy D.

However, when migrating these input techniques to augmented reality, it is both unclear what the relative performance of different techniques will be given the immersive nature of the environment, and it is unclear how viewport-based versus world-based pointing methods will impact performance. To better understand the impact of device and viewing perspectives on pointing in augmented reality, we present the results of two controlled experiments comparing pointing conditions that leverage various smartphone- and smartwatch-based external display pointing techniques and examine viewport-based versus world-based target acquisition paradigms. Our results demonstrate that viewport-based techniques offer faster selection and that both smartwatch- and smartphone-based pointing techniques represent high-performance options for performing distant target acquisition tasks in augmented reality.","author":["Yuan Chen","Keiko Katsuragawa","Edward Lank"],"issue":["CHI '20: Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","April 2020","Pages   1\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376592"],"date":"21 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"Ferran Argelaguet and Carlos Andujar. 2013.

In this paper, targeting multiplication circuits, i.e., the energy-hungry counterpart of hardware accelerators, an extensive exploration of the error--energy trade-off, when combining arithmetic-level approximation techniques, is performed for the first time. Arithmetic-aware approximations deliver significant energy reductions, while allowing to control the error values with discipline by setting accordingly a configuration parameter. Inspired from the promising results of prior works with one configuration parameter, we propose 5 hybrid design families for approximate and energy-friendly hardware multipliers, consisting of two independent parameters to tune the approximation levels. Interestingly, the resolution of the state-of-the-art Pareto diagram is improved, giving the flexibility to achieve better energy gains for a specific error constraint imposed by the system. Moreover, we outperform prior works in the field of approximate multipliers by up to 60% energy reduction, and thus, we define the new Pareto front.","author":["Vasileios Leon","Konstantinos Asimakopoulos","Sotirios Xydis","Dimitrios Soudris","Kiamal Pekmestzi"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 160","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317793"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"S.

In this paper, we propose a simultaneous FPGA/DNN co-design methodology with both bottom-up and top-down approaches: a bottom-up hardware-oriented DNN model search for high accuracy, and a top-down FPGA accelerator design considering DNN-specific characteristics. We also build an automatic co-design flow, including an Auto-DNN engine to perform hardware-oriented DNN model search, as well as an Auto-HLS engine to generate synthesizable C code of the FPGA accelerator for explored DNNs. We demonstrate our co-design approach on an object detection task using PYNQ-Z1 FPGA. Results show that our proposed DNN model and accelerator outperform the state-of-the-art FPGA designs in all aspects including Intersection-over-Union (IoU) (6.2% higher), frames per second (FPS) (2.48\u00d7 higher), power consumption (40% lower), and energy efficiency (2.5\u00d7 higher).

Prior generations based their security and privacy principally on symmetric key cryptography. The Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) and its successors contain a shared key used to authenticate the User Equipment (UE) to the network, and vice versa. However 5G is shifting its core network over to a microservices, cloud-first architecture and is heavily leveraging protocols like TLS and OAuth2.0 to authenticate and authorize transactions. As a result, it is shifting to a PKI-based trust model. This shift is happening just as quantum computing threatens to unravel the security of traditional ciphers such as RSA and ECC. In this paper we highlight the need to advance the 3GPP 5G standards and NIST post-quantum cryptography standards in tandem, with the goal of launching a \"quantum ready\" 5G core network.","author":["T.

To protect data privacy, existing FL approaches adopt (k,n)-threshold secret sharing schemes, based on the semi-honest assumption for clients, to enable secure multiparty computation in local model update exchange which deals with random client dropouts at the cost of increasing data size. These approaches adopt the semi-honest assumption for clients, therefore they are vulnerable to malicious clients. In this work, we propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving federated learning (BC-based PPFL) framework, which leverages the immutability and decentralized trust properties of blockchain to provide provenance of model updates. Our proof-of-concept implementation of BC-based PPFL demonstrates it is practical for secure aggregation of local model updates in the federated setting.","author":["Sana Awan","Fengjun Li","Bo Luo","Mei Liu"],"issue":["CCS '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","November 2019","Pages   2561\u20132563","https://doi.org/10.1145/3319535.3363256"],"date":"06 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"Juan Benet.

We present trends in DNN architectures and the resulting implications on parallelization strategies. We then review and model the different types of concurrency in DNNs: from the single operator, through parallelism in network inference and training, to distributed deep learning.

For the construction of computer science knowledge graph, a small amount of important specialized words in computer science are collected manually, and then these words are extended based on Baidu Baike (baike.baidu.com). Thus we get about 3000 specialized words (called entries). The similarity between two entries is calculated based on the Normalized Google Distance (NGD). Once the similarity is greater than a setting value, a link between the two entries is created. Finally the knowledge graph is constructed by these words and links between them. Here the relation type of link is ignored for simplicity. Furthermore the graph visualization is implemented by a tool called sigma.js, and an application for learning guidance is developed by J2EE. Through the application, students can get a visualized overview of computer science major and make a learning plan efficiently. Moreover the application and method of knowledge graph construction can be applied for other majors easily.","author":["Yu Li","Jingjing Zhao","Liping Yang","Yong Zhang"],"issue":["ICBDE'19: Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Big Data and Education","March 2019","Pages   43\u201347","https://doi.org/10.1145/3322134.3322153"],"date":"30 March 2019","ref":[{"text":"LAEKIN J H, SIMON H A.Why a Diagram is (Sometimes) Worth Ten Thous-and Words{J}.

The cloud receives the applications as a form of a workflow, consisting of a set of interdependent tasks, to solve the large-scale scientific or enterprise problems. Workflow scheduling in the cloud environment has been studied extensively over the years, and this article provides a comprehensive review of the approaches. This article analyses the characteristics of various workflow scheduling techniques and classifies them based on their objectives and execution model. In addition, the recent technological developments and paradigms such as serverless computing and Fog computing are creating new requirements/opportunities for workflow scheduling in a distributed environment. The serverless infrastructures are mainly designed for processing background tasks such as Internet-of-Things (IoT), web applications, or event-driven applications. To address the ever-increasing demands of resources and to overcome the drawbacks of the cloud-centric IoT, the Fog computing paradigm has been developed. This article also discusses workflow scheduling in the context of these emerging trends of cloud computing.","author":["Mainak Adhikari","Tarachand Amgoth","Satish Narayana Srirama"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 52","Issue 4","September 2019","Article No.: 68","pp   1\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/3325097"],"date":"30 August 2019","ref":[{"text":"Alex Abramovici, William E.

When FPGA is used as an accelerator attached to the host CPU, there can be many configurations such as network topology to construct FPGA cluster. Sustained data transfer bandwidth between FPGA memory and CPU memory on a distant node is one of the most important factors to decide a topology of FPGA cluster. In order to explore the best topology, a quantitative evaluation of bandwidth is required. We conducted bandwidth measurement on two host nodes; both nodes are connected via 100Gbps InfiniBand cable and one host node has PCIe Gen3 x8-based FPGA accelerator card. We implemented a Direct Memory Access (DMA) function on an FPGA-attached node and a software bridged data transfer function to transfer data between two nodes. The result shows that DMA function and software bridged data transfer function achieve 82.2% and 69.6% of the theoretical bandwidth of PCIe Gen3 x8, a bottleneck of data transfer path, respectively.","author":["Takaaki Miyajima","Tomoya Hirao","Naoya Miyamoto","Jeongdo Son","Kentaro Sano"],"issue":["HEART 2019: Proceedings of the 10th International Symposium on Highly-Efficient Accelerators and Reconfigurable Technologies","June 2019","Article No.: 11","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3337801.3337808"],"date":"06 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"{n.d.}.

However, traditional gait rehabilitations are usually performed under the supervision of rehabilitation specialists, meaning the patients can not receive adequate care continuously. In this paper, we propose IMU-Kinect, a novel system to remotely and continuously monitor the gait rehabilitation via the wearable kit. This system consists of a wearable hardware platform and a user-friendly software application. The hardware platform is composed of four Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), which are attached on the shanks and thighs of the human body. The software application is able to estimate the rotation and displacement of these sensors, then reconstruct the gait movements and calculate the gait parameters according to the geometric model of human lower limbs. Based on IMU-Kinect system, the users of gait rehabilitation just need to walk normally by wearing the IMU-Kinect kit, and then the rehabilitation specialists can analyze the status of postoperative recovery by remotely viewing the animations about users' gait movements and charts of the general gait parameters. Extend experiments in real environment show that our system can efficiently track the gait movements with 9% rotation and displacement error.","author":["Peicheng Yang","Lei Xie","Chuyu Wang","Sanglu Lu"],"issue":["UbiComp/ISWC '19 Adjunct: Adjunct Proceedings of the 2019 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and Proceedings of the 2019 ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers","September 2019","Pages   350\u2013353","https://doi.org/10.1145/3341162.3343766"],"date":"09 September 2019","ref":[{"text":"Omid Alemi. 2016.

This poses a challenging computational problem. On the other hand, the human visual system can consume only a tiny fraction of this video stream due to the drastic acuity loss in the peripheral vision. Foveated rendering and compression can save computations by reducing the image quality in the peripheral vision. However, this can cause noticeable artifacts in the periphery, or, if done conservatively, would provide only modest savings. In this work, we explore a novel foveated reconstruction method that employs the recent advances in generative adversarial neural networks. We reconstruct a plausible peripheral video from a small fraction of pixels provided every frame. The reconstruction is done by finding the closest matching video to this sparse input stream of pixels on the learned manifold of natural videos. Our method is more efficient than the state-of-the-art foveated rendering, while providing the visual experience with no noticeable quality degradation. We conducted a user study to validate our reconstruction method and compare it against existing foveated rendering and video compression techniques. Our method is fast enough to drive gaze-contingent head-mounted displays in real time on modern hardware. We plan to publish the trained network to establish a new quality bar for foveated rendering and compression as well as encourage follow-up research.","author":["Anton S.

Inspired by the success of graph convolutional networks (GCN) in modeling graph data, we propose a unified GCN framework, named TransGCN, to address this task, in which relation and entity embeddings are learned simultaneously. To handle heterogeneous relations in KGs, we introduce a novel way of representing heterogeneous neighborhood by introducing transformation assumptions on the relationship between the subject, the relation, and the object of a triple. Specifically, a relation is treated as a transformation operator transforming a head entity to a tail entity. Both translation assumption in TransE and rotation assumption in RotatE are explored in our framework. Additionally, instead of only learning entity embeddings in the convolution-based encoder while learning relation embeddings in the decoder as done by the state-of-art models, e.g., R-GCN, the TransGCN framework trains relation embeddings and entity embeddings simultaneously during the graph convolution operation, thus having fewer parameters compared with R-GCN. Experiments show that our models outperform the-state-of-arts methods on both FB15K-237 and WN18RR.","author":["Ling Cai","Bo Yan","Gengchen Mai","Krzysztof Janowicz","Rui Zhu"],"issue":["K-CAP '19: Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Knowledge Capture","September 2019","Pages   131\u2013138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3360901.3364441"],"date":"23 September 2019","ref":[{"text":"Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Alberto Garcia-Duran, Jason Weston, and Oksana Yakhnenko. 2013.

We conduct extensive field tests on 5G performance in diverse urban environments. We systematically analyze the handoff mechanisms in 5G and their impact on network performance. We explore the feasibility of using location and possibly other environmental information to predict the network performance. We also study the app performance (web browsing and HTTP download) over 5G. Our study consumes more than 15 TB of cellular data. Conducted when 5G just made its debut, it provides a \u201cbaseline\u201d for studying how 5G performance evolves, and identifies key research directions on improving 5G users\u2019 experience in a cross-layer manner.

However, system support for FPGAs in the context of the cloud environment is still in its infancy with two major limitations, i.e., the inefficient runtime management due to the tight coupling between compilation and resource allocation, and the high programming complexity when exploiting scale-out acceleration. The root cause is that FPGA resources are not virtualized. In this paper, we propose a full-stack solution, namely ViTAL, to address the aforementioned limitations by virtualizing FPGA resources. Specifically, ViTAL provides a homogeneous abstraction to decouple the compilation and resource allocation. Applications are offline compiled onto the abstraction, while the resource allocation is dynamically determined at runtime. Enabled by a latency-insensitive communication interface, applications can be mapped flexibly onto either one FPGA or multiple FPGAs to maximize the resource utilization and the aggregated system throughput. Meanwhile, ViTAL creates an illusion of a single and large FPGA to users, thereby reducing the programming complexity and supporting scale-out acceleration. Moreover, ViTAL also provides virtualization support for peripheral components (e.g., on-board DRAM and Ethernet), as well as protection and isolation support to ensure a secure execution in the multi-user cloud environment. We evaluate ViTAL on a real system - an FPGA cluster composed of the latest Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGAs (XCVU37P). The results show that, compared with the existing management method, ViTAL enables fine-grained resource sharing and reduces the response time by 82% on average (improving Quality-of-Service) with a marginal virtualization overhead. Moreover, ViTAL also reduces the response time by 25% compared to AmorphOS (operating in high-throughput mode), a recently proposed FPGA virtualization method.","author":["Yue Zha","Jing Li"],"issue":["ASPLOS '20: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2020","Pages   845\u2013858","https://doi.org/10.1145/3373376.3378491"],"date":"09 March 2020","ref":[{"text":"Amazon. 2016.

Several works have been devoted to this area, either directly or indirectly as characteristics of big data processing, i.e., Velocity and Volume. Given the current industry needs, there are many challenges to be addressed before existing methods can be efficiently applied to real-world problems. In this work, we focus on elucidating the connections among the current stateof- the-art on related fields; and clarifying open challenges in both academia and industry. We treat with special care topics that were not thoroughly investigated in past position and survey papers. This work aims to evoke discussion and elucidate the current research opportunities, highlighting the relationship of different subareas and suggesting courses of action when possible.","author":["Heitor Murilo Gomes","Jesse Read","Albert Bifet","Jean Paul Barddal","Jo\u00e3o Gama"],"issue":["ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter","Volume 21","Issue 2","December 2019","pp   6\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/3373464.3373470"],"date":"26 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"Z.

Several emerging memory technologies are promising as the replacements of SRAM or DRAM. Among them, STT-MRAM can be used to replace SRAM as the last-level cache (LLC). However, it suffers from high write energy and latency. In this article, we investigate data patterns written from SRAM-based upper-level cache to STT-MRAM-based LLC to explore the write energy reduction potential. Depending on the data layout within a cache line, redundant bits can be identified and eliminated from write back operations to save STT-MRAM write energy. We also propose a dynamic profiling method to accommodate different application characteristics. The extensive simulation results show that write energy can be saved by 37.05% \u223c 38.89% for static profiling and 19.76% \u223c 34.29% for dynamic profiling.","author":["Jiacheng Ni","Keren Liu","Bi Wu","Weisheng Zhao","Yuanqing Cheng","Xiaolong Zhang","Ying Wang"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 16","Issue 3","July 2020","Article No.: 29","pp   1\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/3381860"],"date":"19 May 2020","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, it is vulnerable to faults due to the immature RRAM fabrication process. We propose an efficient fault tolerance method for RCS; the proposed method, referred to as extended-ABFT (X-ABFT), is inspired by algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT). We utilize row checksums and test-input vectors to extract signatures for fault detection and error correction. We present a solution to alleviate the overflow problem caused by the limited number of voltage levels for the test-input signals. Simulation results show that for a Hopfield classifier with faults in 5% of its RRAM cells, X-ABFT allows us to achieve nearly the same classification accuracy as in the fault-free case.","author":["Mengyun Liu","Lixue Xia","Yu Wang","Krishnendu Chakrabarty"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 25","Issue 3","May 2020","Article No.: 29","pp   1\u201331","https://doi.org/10.1145/3386360"],"date":"07 May 2020","ref":[{"text":"Hiroyuki Akinaga and Hisashi Shima. 2010.

Firstly, the decay model, transportation model, lateral spread model and encounter model are established. Then, the acceptable minimum safety level is obtained by applying the Monte-Carlo approach of ICAO's wake separation standard based on the statistical data of meteorological and aircraft type of the typical airport. Finally, the minimum lateral spacing model is established, and simulation and analysis are performed. Results show that the greater the initial vortex intensity of the leading aircraft, the greater the minimum required lateral spacing. The lateral spacing of 760m given in the current regulations is safe, which can ensure that the following aircraft would not be affected by the vortex of the leading aircraft. The distribution of aircraft types in the airport traffic flow and meteorological conditions (crosswind is the main factor) have an impact on the minimum required lateral spacing. For the Closely Spaced Parallel Runways, a detailed analysis of the specific conditions of the airport can be carried out to reduce the minimum required lateral spacing.","author":["Li Jingwei","Wei Zhiqiang"],"issue":["ICASIT 2020: Proceedings of the 2020 International Conference on Aviation Safety and Information Technology","October 2020","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3434581.3434582"],"date":"14 October 2020","ref":[{"text":"ICAO Doc 9643, AN/941 Manual on Simultaneous Operations on Parallel or Near-Parallel Instrument Runways (SOIR), First Edition, ICAO 2004.","order":1},{"text":"Runway spacing required for segregated parallel approaches/departures, ICAO SASP-WG/29-WP28, May 2017.","order":2},{"text":"\"Vortex wake turbulence flight tests conducted during 1970\" FAA Report No FAA-FS-71-1.","order":3},{"text":"\"Aircraft wake turbulence avoidance\" William A.

With limited budget we cannot imagine using only storage class memory, which leads to the use of a heterogeneous tiered storage hierarchy. In order to make the most efficient use of the high performance tier in this storage hierarchy, we need to be able to place user data on the right tier and at the right time. In this paper, we assume a 2-tier storage hierarchy with a high performance tier and a high capacity archival tier. Files are placed on the high performance tier at creation time and moved to capacity tier once their lifetime expires (that is once they are no more accessed). The main contribution of this paper lies in the design of a file lifetime prediction model solely based on its path based on the use of Convolutional Neural Network. Results show that our solution strikes a good trade-off between accuracy and under-estimation. Compared to previous work, our model made it possible to reach an accuracy close to previous work (around 98.60% compared to 98.84%) while reducing the underestimations by almost 10x to reach 2.21% (compared to 21.86%). The reduction in underestimations is crucial as it avoids misplacing files in the capacity tier while they are still in use.","author":["Luis Thomas","Sebastien Gougeaud","St\u00e9phane Rubini","Philippe Deniel","Jalil Boukhobza"],"issue":["CHEOPS '21: Proceedings of the Workshop on Challenges and Opportunities of Efficient and Performant Storage Systems","April 2021","Article No.: 2","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/3439839.3458733"],"date":"26 April 2021","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, Manjunath Kudlur, Josh Levenberg, Rajat Monga, Sherry Moore, Derek G Murray, Benoit Steiner, Paul Tucker, Vijay Vasudevan, Pete Warden, Martin Wicke, Yuan Yu, and Xiaoqiang Zheng. 2016.

The rapid progress on the development of diverse AC techniques allows us to apply approximate computing to many computation-intensive applications. However, the utilization of AC techniques could bring in new unique security threats to computing systems. This work does a survey on existing circuit-, architecture-, and compiler-level approximate mechanisms/algorithms, with special emphasis on potential security vulnerabilities. Qualitative and quantitative analyses are performed to assess the impact of the new security threats on AC systems. Moreover, this work proposes four unique visionary attack models, which systematically cover the attacks that build covert channels, compensate approximation errors, terminate normal error resilience mechanisms, and propagate additional errors. To thwart those attacks, this work further offers the guideline of countermeasure designs. Several case studies are provided to illustrate the implementation of the suggested countermeasures.","author":["Pruthvy Yellu","Landon Buell","Miguel Mark","Michel A.

After some opening remarks, we motivate and contrast various graph-based data models, as well as languages used to query and validate knowledge graphs. We explain how knowledge can be represented and extracted using a combination of deductive and inductive techniques. We conclude with high-level future research directions for knowledge graphs.","author":["Aidan Hogan","Eva Blomqvist","Michael Cochez","Claudia D\u2019amato","Gerard De Melo","Claudio Gutierrez","Sabrina Kirrane","Jos\u00e9 Emilio Labra Gayo","Roberto Navigli","Sebastian Neumaier","Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo","Axel Polleres","Sabbir M.

Many such systems exist, ranging from computer-aided design (CAD) systems for chip design that display both the logical structure and the actual geometry of the integrated circuit to overview-plus-detail systems that show both an overview for context and a zoomed-in-view for detail. Designers of these systems must make a variety of design decisions, ranging from determining layout to constructing sophisticated coordination mechanisms. Surprisingly, little work has been done to characterize these systems or to express guidelines for their design. Based on a workshop discussion of multiple views, and based on our own design and implementation experience with these systems, we present eight guidelines for the design of multiple view systems.","author":["Michelle Q.

Experimental results on a number of memory-intensive designs demonstrate that our memory mapping approach generates a wide variety of cost-effective designs, often counter-intuitive ones, based on a user-given cost function, the target library, and the mapping algorithm used.","author":["Pradip K.

Structure-building actions associated with the arcs of the grammar network allow for the reordering, restructuring, and copying of constituents necessary to produce deep-structure representations of the type normally obtained from a transformational analysis, and conditions on the arcs allow for a powerful selectivity which can rule out meaningless analyses and take advantage of semantic information to guide the parsing. The advantages of this model for natural language analysis are discussed in detail and illustrated by examples.

Like Scheme, Multilisp is oriented toward symbolic computation. Unlike some parallel programming languages, Multilisp incorporates constructs for causing side effects and for explicitly introducing parallelism. The potential complexity of dealing with side effects in a parallel context is mitigated by the nature of the parallelism constructs and by support for abstract data types: a recommended Multilisp programming style is presented which, if followed, should lead to highly parallel, easily understandable programs.Multilisp is being implemented on the 32-processor Concert multiprocessor; however, it is ultimately intended for use on larger multiprocessors. The current implementation, called Concert Multilisp, is complete enough to run the Multilisp compiler itself and has been run on Concert prototypes including up to eight processors. Concert Multilisp uses novel techniques for task scheduling and garbage collection. The task scheduler helps control excessive resource utilization by means of an unfair scheduling policy; the garbage collector uses a multiprocessor algorithm based on the incremental garbage collector of Baker.","author":["Robert H.

Past techniques for on-the-fly datarace detection either sacrificed precision for performance, leading to many false positive datarace reports, or maintained precision but incurred significant overheads in the range of 3x to 30x. In contrast, our approach results in very few false positives and runtime overhead in the 13% to 42% range, making it both efficient and precise. This performance improvement is the result of a unique combination of complementary static and dynamic optimization techniques.","author":["Jong-Deok Choi","Keunwoo Lee","Alexey Loginov","Robert O'Callahan","Vivek Sarkar","Manu Sridharan"],"issue":["PLDI '02: Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN 2002 conference on Programming language design and implementation","June 2002","Pages   258\u2013269","https://doi.org/10.1145/512529.512560"],"date":"17 May 2002","ref":[{"text":"A.

Most processors designed today include power management features that provide processor operating points which can be used in power management algorithms. However, existing power management algorithms implicitly assume that lower performance points are more energy efficient than higher performance points. Our empirical observations indicate that for many systems, this assumption is not valid.We introduce a new concept called critical power slope to explain and capture the power-performance characteristics of systems with power management features. We evaluate three systems - a clock throttled Pentium laptop, a frequency scaled PowerPC platform, and a voltage scaled system to demonstrate the benefits of our approach. Our evaluation is based on empirical measurements of the first two systems, and publicly available data for the third. Using critical power slope, we explain why on the Pentium-based system, it is energy efficient to run only at the highest frequency, while on the PowerPC-based system, it is energy efficient to run at the lowest frequency point. We confirm our results by measuring the behavior of a web serving benchmark. Furthermore, we extend the critical power slope concept to understand the benefits of voltage scaling when combined with frequency scaling. We show that in some cases, it may be energy efficient not to reduce voltage below a certain point.","author":["Akihiko Miyoshi","Charles Lefurgy","Eric Van Hensbergen","Ram Rajamony","Raj Rajkumar"],"issue":["ICS '02: Proceedings of the 16th international conference on Supercomputing","June 2002","Pages   35\u201344","https://doi.org/10.1145/514191.514200"],"date":"22 June 2002","ref":[{"text":"Advanced Configuration and Power Interface Specification, 2001. http://www.teleport.com/~acpi/spec.htm.]]","order":1},{"text":"P.

Over 100 variants of five major feature selection criteria were examined using four well-known classification algorithms: a Naive Bayesian (NB) approach, a Rocchio-style classifier, a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) method and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) system. Two benchmark collections were chosen as the testbeds: Reuters-21578 and small portion of Reuters Corpus Version 1 (RCV1), making the new results comparable to published results. We found that feature selection methods based on chi2 statistics consistently outperformed those based on other criteria (including information gain) for all four classifiers and both data collections, and that a further increase in performance was obtained by combining uncorrelated and high-performing feature selection methods.The results we obtained using only 3% of the available features are among the best reported, including results obtained with the full feature set.","author":["Monica Rogati","Yiming Yang"],"issue":["CIKM '02: Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on Information and knowledge management","November 2002","Pages   659\u2013661","https://doi.org/10.1145/584792.584911"],"date":"04 November 2002","ref":[{"text":"L.

Currently, decision makers do not always have the real time information they need; GIS analysts produce maps at the request of individual decision makers, often leading to overlapping requests with slow delivery times. In order to overcome these limitations, a paradigm shift in interface design for GIS is needed. The research reported upon here attempts to overcome analyst-driven, menu-controlled, keyboard and mouse operated GIS by designing a multimodal, multi-user GIS interface that puts geospatial data directly in the hands of decision makers. A large screen display is used for data visualization, and collaborative, multi-user interactions in emergency management are supported through voice and gesture recognition. Speech and gesture recognition is coupled with a knowledge-based dialogue management system for storing and retrieving geospatial data. This paper describes the first prototype and the insights gained for human-centered multimodal GIS interface design.","author":["Ingmar Rauschert","Pyush Agrawal","Rajeev Sharma","Sven Fuhrmann","Isaac Brewer","Alan MacEachren"],"issue":["GIS '02: Proceedings of the 10th ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems","November 2002","Pages   119\u2013124","https://doi.org/10.1145/585147.585172"],"date":"08 November 2002","ref":[{"text":"IBM ViaVoice Speech SDK, IBM, Inc., http://www-3.ibm.com/software/speech.","order":1},{"text":"Brewer, I., MacEachren, A.M., Abdo, H., Gundrum, J. and Otto, G., Collaborative Geographic Visualization: Enabling shared understanding of environmental processes. in IEEE Information Visualization Symposium, (Salt Lake City, Utah, 2000).","doi":"10.5555/857190.857679","order":2},{"text":"Cohen, P.R., Johnston, M., McGee, D., Oviatt, S., Pittman, J., Smith, I., Chen, L. and Clow, J., QuickSet: Multimodal interaction for distributed applications. in Proceedings of the Fifth International Multimedia Conference (Multimedia '97), (1997), ACM Press, 31--40.","doi":"10.1145/266180.266328","order":3},{"text":"Egenhofer, M.

A circuit trades off sub-threshold leakage with band-to-band tunneling leakage at the source/drain junctions to determine the optimal substrate bias for different technology generations and under process variations. Using optimal body bias results in 43% and 42% savings in leakage for predictive 70nm and 50nm NMOS devices, respectively. This technique also reduces the effects of die-to-die and intra-die process variations in transistor length and supply voltage by 43% and 60%, respectively, in 50nm NMOS devices, resulting in improved yield.","author":["Cassondra Neau","Kaushik Roy"],"issue":["ISLPED '03: Proceedings of the 2003 international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2003","Pages   116\u2013121","https://doi.org/10.1145/871506.871537"],"date":"25 August 2003","ref":[{"text":"T.

In particular, the focus is on the acceleration of techniques for solving sets of algebraic equations as they occur in numerical simulation. We introduce a framework for the implementation of linear algebra operators on programmable graphics processors (GPUs), thus providing the building blocks for the design of more complex numerical algorithms. In particular, we propose a stream model for arithmetic operations on vectors and matrices that exploits the intrinsic parallelism and efficient communication on modern GPUs. Besides performance gains due to improved numerical computations, graphics algorithms benefit from this model in that the transfer of computation results to the graphics processor for display is avoided. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by implementing direct solvers for sparse matrices, and by applying these solvers to multi-dimensional finite difference equations, i.e. the 2D wave equation and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.","author":["Jens Kr\u00fcger","R\u00fcdiger Westermann"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 22","Issue 3","July 2003","pp   908\u2013916","https://doi.org/10.1145/882262.882363"],"date":"01 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"ANDERSON, E., BAI, Z., BISCHOF, C., BLACKFORD, S., DEMMEL, J., DONGARRA, J., DU CROZ, J., GREENBAUM, A., HAMMARLING, S., MCKENNEY, A., AND SORENSEN, D. 1999.

Additional overhead is small. OCB refines a scheme, IAPM, suggested by Charanjit Jutla. Desirable properties of OCB include the ability to encrypt a bit string of arbitrary length into a ciphertext of minimal length, cheap offset calculations, cheap key setup, a single underlying cryptographic key, no extended-precision addition, a nearly optimal number of block-cipher calls, and no requirement for a random IV. We prove OCB secure, quantifying the adversary's ability to violate the mode's privacy or authenticity in terms of the quality of its block cipher as a pseudorandom permutation (PRP) or as a strong PRP, respectively.","author":["Phillip Rogaway","Mihir Bellare","John Black"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information and System Security","Volume 6","Issue 3","August 2003","pp   365\u2013403","https://doi.org/10.1145/937527.937529"],"date":"01 August 2003","ref":[{"text":"An, J. and Bellare, M. 2001.

In software pipelining, iterations of a loop in the source program are continuously initiated at constant intervals, before the preceding iterations complete. The advantage of software pipelining is that optimal performance can be achieved with compact object code.This paper extends previous results of software pipelining in two ways: First, this paper shows that by using an improved algorithm, near-optimal performance can be obtained without specialized hardware. Second, we propose a hierarchical reduction scheme whereby entire control constructs are reduced to an object similar to an operation in a basic block. With this scheme, all innermost loops, including those containing conditional statements, can be software pipelined. It also diminishes the start-up cost of loops with small number of iterations. Hierarchical reduction complements the software pipelining technique, permitting a consistent performance improvement be obtained.The techniques proposed have been validated by an implementation of a compiler for Warp, a systolic array consisting of 10 VLIW processors. This compiler has been used for developing a large number of applications in the areas of image, signal and scientific processing.","author":["M.

This paper presents an analysis, both quantitative and qualitative, at the architecture level of the components of this speedup. Obviously, the spatial parallelism that can be exploited on the FPGA is a big component. By itself, however, it does not account for the whole speedup.In this paper we experimentally analyze the remaining components of the speedup. We compare the performance of image processing application programs executing in hardware on a Xilinx Virtex E2000 FPGA to that on three general-purpose processor platforms: MIPS, Pentium III and VLIW. The question we set out to answer is what is the inherent advantage of a hardware implementation over a von Neumann platform. On the one hand, the clock frequency of general-purpose processors is about 20 times that of typical FPGA implementations. On the other hand, the iteration level parallelism on the FPGA is one to two orders of magnitude that on the CPUs. In addition to these two factors, we identify the efficiency advantage of FPGAs as an important factor and show that it ranges from 6 to 47 on our test benchmarks. We also identify some of the components of this factor: the streaming of data from memory, the overlap of control and data flow and the elimination of some instruction on the FPGA. The results provide a deeper understanding of the tradeoff between system complexity and performance when designing Configurable SoC as well as designing software for CSoC. They also help understand the one to two orders of magnitude in speedup of FPGAs over CPU after accounting for clock frequencies.","author":["Zhi Guo","Walid Najjar","Frank Vahid","Kees Vissers"],"issue":["FPGA '04: Proceedings of the 2004 ACM/SIGDA 12th international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2004","Pages   162\u2013170","https://doi.org/10.1145/968280.968304"],"date":"22 February 2004","ref":[{"text":"J.

As a result, users can now rent computing nodes on large commercial clusters through several vendors, such as Amazon and rackspace. However, despite the attention paid by Cloud providers, performance unpredictability is a major issue in Cloud computing for (1) database researchers performing wall clock experiments, and (2) database applications providing service-level agreements. In this paper, we carry out a study of the performance variance of the most widely used Cloud infrastructure (Amazon EC2) from different perspectives. We use established microbenchmarks to measure performance variance in CPU, I/O, and network. And, we use a multi-node MapReduce application to quantify the impact on real dataintensive applications. We collected data for an entire month and compare it with the results obtained on a local cluster. Our results show that EC2 performance varies a lot and often falls into two bands having a large performance gap in-between --- which is somewhat surprising. We observe in our experiments that these two bands correspond to the different virtual system types provided by Amazon. Moreover, we analyze results considering different availability zones, points in time, and locations. This analysis indicates that, among others, the choice of availability zone also influences the performance variability. A major conclusion of our work is that the variance on EC2 is currently so high that wall clock experiments may only be performed with considerable care. To this end, we provide some hints to users.","author":["J\u00f6rg Schad","Jens Dittrich","Jorge-Arnulfo Quian\u00e9-Ruiz"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   460\u2013471","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920902"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"3tera, http://www.3tera.com.","order":1},{"text":"Amazon AWS, http://aws.amazon.com.","order":2},{"text":"Amazon Forum, http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?threadid=16912.","order":3},{"text":"Bonnie, http://www.textuality.com/bonnie/intro.html.","order":4},{"text":"CloudClimate, http://www.cloudclimate.com.","order":5},{"text":"CloudKick, https://www.cloudkick.com.","order":6},{"text":"CloudWatch, http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch.","order":7},{"text":"Iperf, http://iperf.sourceforge.net/.","order":8},{"text":"MRCloud, http://infosys.cs.uni-saarland.de/MRCloud.php.","order":9},{"text":"Rackspace, http://www.rackspacecloud.com.","order":10},{"text":"Ubench, http://phystech.com/download/ubench.html.","order":11},{"text":"M.

For columns accessed as a part of analytical queries (e.g., via sequential scans), narrow partitions perform better, because, when scanning a single column, cache locality is improved if the values of that column are stored contiguously. In contrast, for columns accessed as a part of OLTP-style queries, wider partitions perform better, because such transactions frequently insert, delete, update, or access many of the fields of a row, and co-locating those fields leads to better cache locality. Using a highly accurate model of cache misses, HYRISE is able to predict the performance of different partitionings, and to automatically select the best partitioning using an automated database design algorithm. We show that, on a realistic workload derived from customer applications, HYRISE can achieve a 20% to 400% performance improvement over pure all-column or all-row designs, and that it is both more scalable and produces better designs than previous vertical partitioning approaches for main memory systems.","author":["Martin Grund","Jens Kr\u00fcger","Hasso Plattner","Alexander Zeier","Philippe Cudre-Mauroux","Samuel Madden"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 4","Issue 2","November 2010","pp   105\u2013116","https://doi.org/10.14778/1921071.1921077"],"date":"01 November 2010","ref":[{"text":"D.

Recent proposals alleviate locking and logging bottlenecks in the system, leaving page latching as the next potential problem. To tackle the page latching problem, we propose physiological partitioning (PLP). The PLP design applies logical-only partitioning, maintaining the desired properties of shared-everything designs, and introduces a multi-rooted B+Tree index structure (MRBTree) which enables the partitioning of the accesses at the physical page level. Logical partitioning and MRBTrees together ensure that all accesses to a given index page come from a single thread and, hence, can be entirely latch-free; an extended design makes heap page accesses thread-private as well. Eliminating page latching allows us to simplify key code paths in the system such as B+Tree operations leading to more efficient and maintainable code. Profiling a prototype PLP system running on different multicore machines shows that it acquires 85% and 68% fewer contentious critical sections, respectively, than an optimized conventional design and one based on logical-only partitioning. PLP also improves performance up to 40% and 18%, respectively, over the existing systems.","author":["Ippokratis Pandis","Pinar T\u00f6z\u00fcn","Ryan Johnson","Anastasia Ailamaki"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 4","Issue 10","July 2011","pp   610\u2013621","https://doi.org/10.14778/2021017.2021019"],"date":"01 July 2011","ref":[{"text":"R.

However, we can hardly find that GPUs have been truly adopted in major warehousing production systems. Preparing to merge GPUs to the warehousing systems, we have identified and addressed several critical issues in a three-dimensional study of warehousing queries on GPUs by varying query characteristics, software techniques, and GPU hardware configurations. We also propose an analytical model to understand and predict the query performance on GPUs. Based on our study, we present our performance insights for warehousing query execution on GPUs. The objective of our work is to provide a comprehensive guidance for GPU architects, software system designers, and database practitioners to narrow the speed gap between the GPU kernel execution (the fast mode) and data transfer to prepare GPU execution (the slow mode) for high performance in processing data warehousing queries.

Performance is critical, as data scientists need to execute graph programs many times with varying parameters. The need for a high-level, high-performance programming model has inspired much research on graph programming frameworks.In this paper, we show that the important class of computationally light graph applications - applications that perform little computation per vertex - has severe scalability problems across multiple cores as these applications hit an early \"memory wall\" that limits their speedup. We propose a novel block-oriented computation model, in which computation is iterated locally over blocks of highly connected nodes, significantly improving the amount of computation per cache miss. Following this model, we describe the design and implementation of a block-aware graph processing runtime that keeps the familiar vertex-centric programming paradigm while reaping the benefits of block-oriented execution. Our experiments show that block-oriented execution significantly improves the performance of our framework for several graph applications.","author":["Wenlei Xie","Guozhang Wang","David Bindel","Alan Demers","Johannes Gehrke"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 14","September 2013","pp   2014\u20132025","https://doi.org/10.14778/2556549.2556581"],"date":"01 September 2013","ref":[{"text":"R.

Most existing work assumes a database of many small graphs, but modern applications, such as social networks, citation graphs, or protein-protein interactions in bioinformatics, are modeled as a single large graph. In this paper we present GraMi, a novel framework for frequent subgraph mining in a single large graph. GraMi undertakes a novel approach that only finds the minimal set of instances to satisfy the frequency threshold and avoids the costly enumeration of all instances required by previous approaches. We accompany our approach with a heuristic and optimizations that significantly improve performance. Additionally, we present an extension of GraMi that mines frequent patterns. Compared to subgraphs, patterns offer a more powerful version of matching that captures transitive interactions between graph nodes (like friend of a friend) which are very common in modern applications. Finally, we present CGraMi, a version supporting structural and semantic constraints, and AGraMi, an approximate version producing results with no false positives. Our experiments on real data demonstrate that our framework is up to 2 orders of magnitude faster and discovers more interesting patterns than existing approaches.","author":["Mohammed Elseidy","Ehab Abdelhamid","Spiros Skiadopoulos","Panos Kalnis"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 7","March 2014","pp   517\u2013528","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732286.2732289"],"date":"01 March 2014","ref":[{"text":"B.

OLTP workloads typically exhibit skewed access patterns where some records are hot (frequently accessed) but many records are cold (infrequently or never accessed). It is still more economical to store the coldest records on secondary storage such as flash. This paper introduces Siberia, a framework for managing cold data in the Microsoft Hekaton main-memory database engine. We discuss how to migrate cold data to secondary storage while providing an interface to the user to manipulate both hot and cold data that hides the actual data location. We describe how queries of different isolation levels can read and modify data stored in both hot and cold stores without restriction while minimizing number of accesses to cold storage. We also show how records can be migrated between hot and cold stores while the DBMS is online and active. Experiments reveal that for cold data access rates appropriate for main-memory optimized databases, we incur an acceptable 7-14% throughput loss.","author":["Ahmed Eldawy","Justin Levandoski","Per-\u00c5ke Larson"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 11","July 2014","pp   931\u2013942","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732967.2732968"],"date":"01 September 2013","ref":[{"text":"B.

A major consequence of resource sharing is that the performance of one tenant can be adversely affected by resource demands of other co-located tenants. One such resource that is essential for good performance of a tenant's workload is buffer pool memory. In this paper, we study the problem of how to effectively share buffer pool memory in multi-tenant relational DaaS. We first develop an SLA framework that defines and enforces accountability of the service provider to the tenant even when buffer pool memory is not statically reserved on behalf of the tenant. Next, we present a novel buffer pool page replacement algorithm (MT-LRU) that builds upon theoretical concepts from weighted online caching, and is designed for multi-tenant scenarios involving SLAs and overbooking. MT-LRU generalizes the LRU-K algorithm which is commonly used in relational database systems. We have prototyped our techniques inside a commercial DaaS engine and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution.","author":["Vivek Narasayya","Ishai Menache","Mohit Singh","Feng Li","Manoj Syamala","Surajit Chaudhuri"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 7","February 2015","pp   726\u2013737","https://doi.org/10.14778/2752939.2752942"],"date":"01 February 2015","ref":[{"text":"Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). http://aws.amazon.com/rds.","order":1},{"text":"N.

In this paper, we introduce a novel (unsupervised) anomaly detection framework which can be used to detect anomalies in a streaming fashion by making only one pass over the data while utilizing limited storage. We adapt ideas from matrix sketching to maintain, in a streaming model, a set of few orthogonal vectors that form a good approximate basis for all the observed data. Using this constructed orthogonal basis, anomalies in new incoming data are detected based on a simple reconstruction error test. We theoretically prove that our algorithm compares favorably with an offline approach based on expensive global singular value decomposition (SVD) updates. Additionally, we apply ideas from randomized low-rank matrix approximations to further speedup the algorithm.

DRAM-based KVS provides fast key-value access, but its scalability is limited by the cost, power and space needed by the machine cluster to support a large amount of DRAM. This paper offers a 10X to 100X cheaper solution based on flash storage and hardware accelerators. In BlueCache key-value pairs are stored in flash storage and all KVS operations, including the flash controller are directly implemented in hardware. Furthermore, BlueCache includes a fast interconnect between flash controllers to provide a scalable solution. We show that BlueCache has 4.18X higher throughput and consumes 25X less power than a flash-backed KVS software implementation on x86 servers. We further show that BlueCache can outperform DRAM-based KVS when the latter has more than 7.4% misses for a read-intensive aplication. BlueCache is an attractive solution for both rack-level appliances and data-center-scale key-value cache.","author":["Shuotao Xu","Sungjin Lee","Sang-Woo Jun","Ming Liu","Jamey Hicks","Arvind"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 4","November 2016","pp   301\u2013312","https://doi.org/10.14778/3025111.3025113"],"date":"01 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"A Hash Function for Hash Table Lookup. http://goo.gl/VDzzLb.","order":1},{"text":"Bluespec Inc. http://www.bluespec.com.","order":2},{"text":"Netflix EVCache. http://goo.gl/9zoxJ6.","order":3},{"text":"Nvidia GeForce GTX 780 Specifications. http://goo.gl/6Yhlv6.","order":4},{"text":"Redis. http://redis.io.","order":5},{"text":"Samsung 850 PRO. http://goo.gl/vjPj7V.","order":6},{"text":"Samsung 950 PRO. http://goo.gl/DCwQpd.","order":7},{"text":"Samsung M393A2G40DB0-CPB. http://goo.gl/BOL4ye.","order":8},{"text":"Samsung DDR4 SDRAM. http://goo.gl/LO1ExG, June 2013.","order":9},{"text":"D.

As a consequence, there is generally a delay between the time a transaction performs a write and the time later transactions are permitted to read it. This delayed write visibility can significantly impact the performance of serializable database systems by reducing concurrency among conflicting transactions.This paper makes the observation that delayed write visibility stems from the fact that database systems can arbitrarily abort transactions at any point during their execution. Accordingly, we make the case for database systems which only abort transactions under a restricted set of conditions, thereby enabling a new recoverability mechanism, early write visibility, which safely makes transactions' writes visible prior to the end of their execution. We design a new serializable concurrency control protocol, piece-wise visibility (PWV), with the explicit goal of enabling early write visibility. We evaluate PWV against state-of-the-art serializable protocols and a highly optimized implementation of read committed, and find that PWV can outperform serializable protocols by an order of magnitude and read committed by 3X on high contention workloads.","author":["Jose M.

In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analytical study of the queries formulated by end-users and harvested from large and up-to-date query logs from a wide variety of RDF data sources. As opposed to previous studies, ours is the first assessment on a voluminous query corpus, spanning over several years and covering many representative SPARQL endpoints. Apart from the syntactical structure of the queries, that exhibits already interesting results on this generalized corpus, we drill deeper in the structural characteristics related to the graph and hypergraph representation of queries. We outline the most common shapes of queries when visually displayed as undirected graphs, and characterize their (hyper-)tree width. Moreover, we analyze the evolution of queries over time, by introducing the novel concept of a streak, i.e., a sequence of queries that appear as subsequent modifications of a seed query. Our study offers several fresh insights on the already rich query features of real SPARQL queries formulated by real users, and brings us to draw a number of conclusions and pinpoint future directions for SPARQL query evaluation, query optimization, tuning, and benchmarking.","author":["Angela Bonifati","Wim Martens","Thomas Timm"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 2","October 2017","pp   149\u2013161","https://doi.org/10.14778/3149193.3149196"],"date":"01 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"C.

Using the HCRC Map Task Corpus as our data source, we describe models for predicting these locations using only limited processing and features of the user's speech that are commonly available, and which therefore could be used as a low-cost improvement for current systems. The baseline model inserts continuers after a predetermined number of words. One further model correlates back-channel continuers with pause duration, while a second predicts their occurrence using trigram POS frequencies. Combining these two models gives the best results.","author":["Nicola Cathcart","Jean Carletta","Ewan Klein"],"issue":["EACL '03: Proceedings of the tenth conference on European chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics - Volume 1","April 2003","Pages   51\u201358","https://doi.org/10.3115/1067807.1067816"],"date":"12 April 2003","ref":[{"text":"A.

In this paper we show that, for Chinese, the relationship between segmentation and retrieval performance is in fact nonmonotonic; that is, at around 70% word segmentation accuracy an over-segmentation phenomenon begins to occur which leads to a reduction in information retrieval performance. We demonstrate this effect by presenting an empirical investigation of information retrieval on Chinese TREC data, using a wide variety of word segmentation algorithms with word segmentation accuracies ranging from 44% to 95%. It appears that the main reason for the drop in retrieval performance is that correct compounds and collocations are preserved by accurate segmenters, while they are broken up by less accurate (but reasonable) segmenters, to a surprising advantage. This suggests that words themselves might be too broad a notion to conveniently capture the general semantic meaning of Chinese text.","author":["Fuchun Peng","Xiangji Huang","Dale Schuurmans","Nick Cercone"],"issue":["COLING '02: Proceedings of the 19th international conference on Computational linguistics - Volume 1","August 2002","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.3115/1072228.1072376"],"date":"24 August 2002","ref":[{"text":"Beaulieu, M. and Gatford, M. and Huang, X. and Robertson, S. and Walker, S. and Williams, P. 1997.

The algorithm is a minimum mean square error estimation tailored for a filter-bank front-end. It introduces a significant improvement over similar published algorithms by incorporating a better statistical model for the filter-bank log-energies, and by attempting to jointly estimate the log-energies vector rather than individual components. The algorithm was tested with SRI's recognizer trained on the official speaker-independent \"Resource management task\" clean speech database. When tested with additive white gaussian noise, the noise reduction achieved by the algorithm is equivalent to a 13 dB SNR improvement. When tested with desktop microphone recordings, the error rate at 13 dB SNR is only 40% higher than that with close-talking microphone at 31 dB SNR.","author":["Adoram Erell","Mitch Weintraub"],"issue":["HLT '89: Proceedings of the workshop on Speech and Natural Language","October 1989","Pages   319\u2013324","https://doi.org/10.3115/1075434.1075489"],"date":"15 October 1989","ref":[{"text":"S.

In this paper, we present a simple rule-based part of speech tagger which automatically acquires its rules and tags with accuracy comparable to stochastic taggers. The rule-based tagger has many advantages over these taggers, including: a vast reduction in stored information required, the perspicuity of a small set of meaningful rules, ease of finding and implementing improvements to the tagger, and better portability from one tag set, corpus genre or language to another. Perhaps the biggest contribution of this work is in demonstrating that the stochastic method is not the only viable method for part of speech tagging. The fact that a simple rule-based tagger that automatically learns its rules can perform so well should offer encouragement for researchers to further explore rule-based tagging, searching for a better and more expressive set of rule templates and other variations on the simple but effective theme described below.","author":["Eric Brill"],"issue":["HLT '91: Proceedings of the workshop on Speech and Natural Language","February 1992","Pages   112\u2013116","https://doi.org/10.3115/1075527.1075553"],"date":"23 February 1992","ref":[{"text":"Church, K.

We demonstrate that, though the N-Best Paradigm works quite well up to vocabularies of 5,000 words, it begins to break down with 20,000 words and long sentences.

A semantic concordance is being constructed to use in studies of sense resolution in context (semantic disambiguation). The Brown Corpus is the text and WordNet is the lexicon. Semantic tags (pointers to WordNet synsets) are inserted in the text manually using an interface, ConText, that was designed to facilitate the task.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes to use a set of general morphological rules to broaden the coverage and on the other hand, the rules are appended with different linguistic and statistical constraints to increase the precision of the representation. To disambiguate rule applications and reduce the complexity of the rule matching, a bottom-up merging algorithm for extraction is proposed, which merges possible morphemes recursively by consulting above the general rules and dynamically decides which rule should be applied first according to the priorities of the rules. Effects of different priority strategies are compared in our experiment, and experimental results show that the performance of proposed method is very promising.","author":["Wei-Yun Ma","Keh-Jiann Chen"],"issue":["SIGHAN '03: Proceedings of the second SIGHAN workshop on Chinese language processing - Volume 17","July 2003","Pages   31\u201338","https://doi.org/10.3115/1119250.1119255"],"date":"11 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"Chen, H.

Experimental results show that our exploitation of generic patterns substantially increases system recall with small effect on overall precision.","author":["Patrick Pantel","Marco Pennacchiotti"],"issue":["ACL-44: Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics and the 44th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics","July 2006","Pages   113\u2013120","https://doi.org/10.3115/1220175.1220190"],"date":"17 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"Berland, M. and E.

Error analysis of both taggers is done to identify frequent confusions in tagging. Based on the analysis of tagging, and syntactic structure of Urdu, a more refined tagset is derived. The existing tagged corpora are tagged with the new tagset to develop a single corpus of 230K words and the TnT tagger is retrained. The results show improvement in tagging accuracy for individual corpora to 94.2% and also for the merged corpus to 91%.
