The resulting test time of the system is evaluated considering the number of reused processors, the number of external interfaces, and power dissipation.

The poor data locality of sparse matrices significantly reduces the performance of SpMXV on general-purpose processors, which rely heavily on the cache hierarchy to achieve high performance. The abundant hardware resources on current FPGAs provide new opportunities to improve the performance of SpMXV. In this paper, we propose an FPGA-based design for SpMXV. Our design accepts sparse matrices in Compressed Row Storage format, and makes no assumptions about the sparsity structure of the input matrix. The design employs IEEE-754 format double-precision floating-point multipliers/adders, and performs multiple floating-point operations as well as I/O operations in parallel. The performance of our design for SpMXV is evaluated using various sparse matrices from the scientific computing community, with the Xilinx Virtex-II Pro XC2VP70 as the target device. The MFLOPS performance increases with the hardware resources on the device as well as the available memory bandwidth. For example, when the memory bandwidth is 8 GB/s, our design achieves over 350 MFLOPS for all the test matrices. It demonstrates significant speedup over general-purpose processors particularly for matrices with very irregular sparsity structure. Besides solving SpMXV problem, our design provides a parameterized and flexible tree-based design for floating-point applications on FPGAs.","author":["Ling Zhuo","Viktor K.

To ensure adequate performance users must either prevent overload of disk resources, or use real-time algorithms that rely on intricate knowledge of disk internals to meet deadline requirements. We have developed Hierarchical Disk Sharing (HDS) to allow disks to be fully utilized while sustaining a bandwidth reservation, without requiring detailed knowledge of the drive internals. HDS uses a hierarchy of token bucket filters to isolate disk access among clients and groups of clients, and to allow for reclaiming of unused bandwidth. We discuss the design of HDS and present our implementation in a Linux block device driver, demonstrating the effectiveness (and limitations) of this approach.","author":["Joel C.

In this paper, we discuss the applications of an existing compact thermal model that models both die and package temperature details. As an example, a thermally self-consistent leakage power calculation of a POWER4-like microprocessor design is presented. We then demonstrate the importance of including detailed package information in the thermal model by several examples considering the impact of thermal interface material (TIM), which glues the die to the heat spreader. The fact that detailed package information is needed to build an accurate compact thermal model implies a design flow, in which the chip- and package-level compact thermal model acts as a convenient medium for more productive collaborations among circuit designers, computer architects and package designers, leading to early and efficient evaluations of different design tradeoffs for an optimal design from a thermal point of view","author":["Wei Huang","Eric Humenay","Kevin Skadron","Mircea R.

We propose to incorporate prior knowledge of cluster membership for document cluster analysis and develop a novel semi-supervised document clustering model. The method models a set of documents with weighted graph in which each document is represented as a vertex, and each edge connecting a pair of vertices is weighted with the similarity value of the two corresponding documents. The prior knowledge indicates pairs of documents that known to belong to the same cluster. Then, the prior knowledge is transformed into a set of constraints. The document clustering task is accomplished by finding the best cuts of the graph under the constraints. We apply the model to the Normalized Cut method to demonstrate the idea and concept. Our experimental evaluations show that the proposed document clustering model reveals remarkable performance improvements with very limited training samples, and hence is a very effective semi-supervised classification tool.","author":["Xiang Ji","Wei Xu"],"issue":["SIGIR '06: Proceedings of the 29th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval","August 2006","Pages   405\u2013412","https://doi.org/10.1145/1148170.1148241"],"date":"06 August 2006","ref":[{"text":"S.

This motivates designers to adopt on-chip network-based communication infrastructures and three-dimensional (3D) designs where multiple device layers are stacked together. Considering the current trends towards increasing use of chip multiprocessing, it is timely to consider 3D chip multiprocessor design and memory networking issues, especially in the context of data management in large L2 caches. The overall goal of this paper is to study the challenges for L2 design and management in 3D chip multiprocessors. Our first contribution is to propose a router architecture and a topology design that makes use of a network architecture embedded into the L2 cache memory. Our second contribution is to demonstrate, through extensive experiments, that a 3D L2 memory architecture generates much better results than the conventional two-dimensional (2D) designs under different number of layers and vertical (inter-wafer) connections. In particular, our experiments show that a 3D architecture with no dynamic data migration generates better performance than a 2D architecture that employs data migration. This also helps reduce power consumption in L2 due to a reduced number of data movements.","author":["Feihui Li","Chrysostomos Nicopoulos","Thomas Richardson","Yuan Xie","Vijaykrishnan Narayanan","Mahmut Kandemir"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 34","Issue 2","May 2006","pp   130\u2013141","https://doi.org/10.1145/1150019.1136497"],"date":"01 May 2006","ref":[{"text":"{1} V.

In order to minimize discharge power on a read bitline, a majority-logic decides if input data are inverted in a write cycle, so that \"1\"s are in the majority. In video data, since more significant bits of adjacent pixel data are fortunately lopsided to either \"0\" or \"1\" with higher probability, the data bits in the pixels are reordered in each digit group to exploit the majority logic. The speed and area overheads are 4% and 11% in a 90-nm process technology, respectively. The proposed SRAM achieves 53% power reduction on the bitlines, and saves 43% of a total power when considered as an H.264 reconstructed-image memory.","author":["Hidehiro Fujiwara","Koji Nii","Junichi Miyakoshi","Yuichiro Murachi","Yasuhiro Morita","Hiroshi Kawaguchi","Masahiko Yoshimoto"],"issue":["ISLPED '06: Proceedings of the 2006 international symposium on Low power electronics and design","October 2006","Pages   61\u201366","https://doi.org/10.1145/1165573.1165589"],"date":"04 October 2006","ref":[{"text":"International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors 2005, http://www.itrs.net/Common/2005ITRS/Home2005.htm.","order":1},{"text":"J.

Toward this end, existing approaches have almost solely focussed on the individual behaviour of customers. Call graphs, that is, graphs induced by people calling each other, can allow telecom operators to better understand the interaction behaviour of their customers, and potentially provide major insights for designing effective incentives.In this paper, we use the Call Detail Records of a mobile operator from four geographically disparate regions to construct call graphs, and analyse their structural properties. Our findings provide business insights and help devise strategies for Mobile Telecom operators. Another goal of this paper is to identify the shape of such graphs. In order to do so, we extend the well-known reachability analysis approach with some of our own techniques to reveal the shape of such massive graphs. Based on our analysis, we introduce the Treasure-Hunt model to describe the shape of mobile call graphs. The proposed techniques are general enough for analysing any large graph. Finally, how well the proposed model captures the shape of other mobile call graphs needs to be the subject of future studies.","author":["Amit A.

This abstract framework allows one to cleanly express practical DPLL algorithms and to formally reason about them in a simple way. Its properties, such as soundness, completeness or termination, immediately carry over to the modern DPLL implementations with features such as backjumping or clause learning.We then extend the framework to Satisfiability Modulo background Theories (SMT) and use it to model several variants of the so-called lazy approach for SMT. In particular, we use it to introduce a few variants of a new, efficient and modular approach for SMT based on a general DPLL(X) engine, whose parameter X can be instantiated with a specialized solver SolverT for a given theory T, thus producing a DPLL(T) system. We describe the high-level design of DPLL(X) and its cooperation with SolverT, discuss the role of theory propagation, and describe different DPLL(T) strategies for some theories arising in industrial applications.Our extensive experimental evidence, summarized in this article, shows that DPLL(T) systems can significantly outperform the other state-of-the-art tools, frequently even in orders of magnitude, and have better scaling properties.","author":["Robert Nieuwenhuis","Albert Oliveras","Cesare Tinelli"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 53","Issue 6","November 2006","pp   937\u2013977","https://doi.org/10.1145/1217856.1217859"],"date":"01 November 2006","ref":[{"text":"Alur, R. 1999.

Until now, several flash file systems have been developed considering the physical characteristics of NAND flash. However, previous flash file systems still have a high performance overhead and a scalability problem of the mounting time and the memory usage because, in most case, the metadata is written with several words at a single update even though the writes in NAND flash must be performed in terms of page, which is typically 2 KiB. The proposed flash file system called PFFS uses PRAM to mitigate the limitation of NAND flash. The PRAM is a next generation non-volatile memory and good for dealing with word level read/write of a small size of data. PFFS hence separates the metadata from the regular data in a file system and saves them into PRAM. Consequently, the PFFS manages all the files and directories in the PRAM and outperforms other flash file systems. The experimental results show that the performance of PFFS is 25% better than YAFFS2 for small-file writes while matching YAFFS2 performance for large writes and the mouting time and the memory usage of PFFS are O(1).","author":["Youngwoo Park","Seung-Ho Lim","Chul Lee","Kyu Ho Park"],"issue":["SAC '08: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM symposium on Applied computing","March 2008","Pages   1498\u20131503","https://doi.org/10.1145/1363686.1364038"],"date":"16 March 2008","ref":[{"text":"K1S5616BCM Data Sheet. http://www.samsung.com.","order":1},{"text":"K9F2G08UOA Data Sheet. http://www.samsung.com.","order":2},{"text":"YAFFS A Flash file system for embedded use. http://www.yaffs.net/.","order":3},{"text":"An-I A.

This is leading to high power consumption and operating temperature in DRAM chips. As a result, temperature management has become a real and pressing issue in high performance DRAM systems. Traditional low power techniques are not suitable for high performance DRAM systems with high bandwidth. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a customized DRAM low power technique based on Page Hit Aware Write Buffer (PHA-WB). Our proposed approach reduces DRAM system power consumption and temperature without any performance penalty. Our experiments show that a system with a 64-entry PHA-WB could reduce the total DRAM power consumption by up to 22.0% (9.6% on average). The peak and average temperature reductions are 6.1\u00b0C and 2.1\u00b0C, respectively.","author":["Song Liu","Seda Ogrenci Memik","Yu Zhang","Gokhan Memik"],"issue":["DAC '08: Proceedings of the 45th annual Design Automation Conference","June 2008","Pages   878\u2013883","https://doi.org/10.1145/1391469.1391691"],"date":"08 June 2008","ref":[{"text":"Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation.

Main-memory access has therefore become a performance bottleneck for many computer applications; a phenomenon that is widely known as the \"memory wall.\" In this paper, we report how research around the MonetDB database system has led to a redesign of database architecture in order to take advantage of modern hardware, and in particular to avoid hitting the memory wall. This encompasses (i) a redesign of the query execution model to better exploit pipelined CPU architectures and CPU instruction caches; (ii) the use of columnar rather than row-wise data storage to better exploit CPU data caches; (iii) the design of new cache-conscious query processing algorithms; and (iv) the design and automatic calibration of memory cost models to choose and tune these cache-conscious algorithms in the query optimizer.","author":["Peter A.

We describe new C++ language extensions, a production-quality optimizing C++ compiler that translates and optimizes these extensions, and a high-performance STM runtime library. The transactional language constructs support C++ language features including classes, inheritance, virtual functions, exception handling, and templates. The compiler automatically instruments the program for transactional execution and optimizes TM overheads. The runtime library implements multiple execution modes and implements a novel STM algorithm that supports both optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control. The runtime switches a transaction's execution mode dynamically to improve performance and to handle calls to precompiled functions and I/O libraries. We present experimental results on 8 cores (two quad-core CPUs) running a set of 20 non-trivial parallel programs. Our measurements show that our system scales well as the numbers of cores increases and that our compiler and runtime optimizations improve scalability.","author":["Yang Ni","Adam Welc","Ali-Reza Adl-Tabatabai","Moshe Bach","Sion Berkowits","James Cownie","Robert Geva","Sergey Kozhukow","Ravi Narayanaswamy","Jeffrey Olivier","Serguei Preis","Bratin Saha","Ady Tal","Xinmin Tian"],"issue":["OOPSLA '08: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGPLAN conference on Object-oriented programming systems languages and applications","October 2008","Pages   195\u2013212","https://doi.org/10.1145/1449764.1449780"],"date":"19 October 2008","ref":[{"text":"M.

Most existing flash translation layer (FTL) schemes are, however, ill-suited for such systems because they were optimized for storage write patterns of embedded systems only. In this paper, we propose a new flash management technique called LAST which is optimized for access characteristics of general-purpose computing systems. By exploiting the locality of storage access patterns, LAST reduces the garbage collection overhead significantly, thus increasing the I/O performance of flash-based storage devices. Our experimental results show that the proposed technique reduces the garbage collection overhead by 54% over the existing flash memory management techniques.","author":["Sungjin Lee","Dongkun Shin","Young-Jin Kim","Jihong Kim"],"issue":["ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","Volume 42","Issue 6","October 2008","pp   36\u201342","https://doi.org/10.1145/1453775.1453783"],"date":"01 October 2008","ref":[{"text":"S.

This paper presents the twisted GFSR (TGFSR) algorithm, a slightly but essentially modified version of the GFSR, which solves all the above problems without loss of merit.

Unlike hard disks, flash devices are free from any mechanical moving parts, have no seek or rotational delays and consume lower power. However, the internal idiosyncrasies of flash technology make its performance highly dependent on workload characteristics. The poor performance of random writes has been a cause of major concern, which needs to be addressed to better utilize the potential of flash in enterprise-scale environments. We examine one of the important causes of this poor performance: the design of the Flash Translation Layer (FTL), which performs the virtual-to-physical address translations and hides the erase-before-write characteristics of flash. We propose a complete paradigm shift in the design of the core FTL engine from the existing techniques with our Demand-based Flash Translation Layer (DFTL), which selectively caches page-level address mappings. We develop a flash simulation framework called FlashSim. Our experimental evaluation with realistic enterprise-scale workloads endorses the utility of DFTL in enterprise-scale storage systems by demonstrating: (i) improved performance, (ii) reduced garbage collection overhead and (iii) better overload behavior compared to state-of-the-art FTL schemes. For example, a predominantly random-write dominant I/O trace from an OLTP application running at a large financial institution shows a 78% improvement in average response time (due to a 3-fold reduction in operations of the garbage collector), compared to a state-of-the-art FTL scheme. Even for the well-known read-dominant TPC-H benchmark, for which DFTL introduces additional overheads, we improve system response time by 56%.","author":["Aayush Gupta","Youngjae Kim","Bhuvan Urgaonkar"],"issue":["ASPLOS XIV: Proceedings of the 14th international conference on Architectural support for programming languages and operating systems","March 2009","Pages   229\u2013240","https://doi.org/10.1145/1508244.1508271"],"date":"07 March 2009","ref":[{"text":"Amir Ban.

In this article, we address systematically the formal study of the database aspects of SPARQL, concentrating in its graph pattern matching facility. We provide a compositional semantics for the core part of SPARQL, and study the complexity of the evaluation of several fragments of the language. Among other complexity results, we show that the evaluation of general SPARQL patterns is PSPACE-complete. We identify a large class of SPARQL patterns, defined by imposing a simple and natural syntactic restriction, where the query evaluation problem can be solved more efficiently. This restriction gives rise to the class of well-designed patterns. We show that the evaluation problem is coNP-complete for well-designed patterns. Moreover, we provide several rewriting rules for well-designed patterns whose application may have a considerable impact in the cost of evaluating SPARQL queries.","author":["Jorge P\u00e9rez","Marcelo Arenas","Claudio Gutierrez"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Database Systems","Volume 34","Issue 3","August 2009","Article No.: 16","pp   1\u201345","https://doi.org/10.1145/1567274.1567278"],"date":"03 September 2009","ref":[{"text":"Abiteboul, S., Hull, R., and Vianu, V. 1995.

The fundamental premise of our approach lies in the fact that all computations are not equally significant in shaping the output response of video systems. We use a statistical technique to intelligently identify these significant/not-so-significant computations at the algorithmic level and subsequently change the underlying architecture such that the significant computations are computed in an error free manner under voltage over-scaling. Furthermore, our design includes an adaptive quality compensation (AQC) block which \"tunes\" the algorithm and architecture depending on the magnitude of voltage over-scaling and severity of process variations. Simulation results show average power savings of ~ 33% for the proposed architecture when compared to conventional implementation in the 90 nm CMOS technology. The maximum output quality loss in terms of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) was ~ 1 dB without incurring any throughput penalty.","author":["Debabrata Mohapatra","Georgios Karakonstantis","Kaushik Roy"],"issue":["ISLPED '09: Proceedings of the 2009 ACM/IEEE international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2009","Pages   195\u2013200","https://doi.org/10.1145/1594233.1594282"],"date":"19 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"J.

As architects, we aim to find ways to overcome these idiosyncrasies while exploiting flash memory's useful characteristics. To be successful, we must understand the trade-offs between the performance, cost (in both power and dollars), and reliability of flash memory. In addition, we must understand how different usage patterns affect these characteristics. Flash manufacturers provide conservative guidelines about these metrics, and this lack of detail makes it difficult to design systems that fully exploit flash memory's capabilities. We have empirically characterized flash memory technology from five manufacturers by directly measuring the performance, power, and reliability. We demonstrate that performance varies significantly between vendors, devices, and from publicly available datasheets. We also demonstrate and quantify some unexpected device characteristics and show how we can use them to improve responsiveness and energy consumption of solid state disks by 44% and 13%, respectively, as well as increase flash device lifetime by 5.2x.","author":["Laura M.

The basic idea of LRU-K is to keep track of the times of the last K references to popular database pages, using this information to statistically estimate the interarrival times of references on a page by page basis. Although the LRU-K approach performs optimal statistical inference under relatively standard assumptions, it is fairly simple and incurs little bookkeeping overhead. As we demonstrate with simulation experiments, the LRU-K algorithm surpasses conventional buffering algorithms in discriminating between frequently and infrequently referenced pages. In fact, LRU-K can approach the behavior of buffering algorithms in which page sets with known access frequencies are manually assigned to different buffer pools of specifically tuned sizes. Unlike such customized buffering algorithms however, the LRU-K method is self-tuning, and does not rely on external hints about workload characteristics. Furthermore, the LRU-K algorithm adapts in real time to changing patterns of access.","author":["Elizabeth J. O'Neil","Patrick E.

As these systems become more common, it is important to be able to compare and contrast architectural designs and programming systems in a fair and open forum. To this end, we have designed the Scalable HeterOgeneous Computing benchmark suite (SHOC). SHOC's initial focus is on systems containing graphics processing units (GPUs) and multi-core processors, and on the new OpenCL programming standard. SHOC is a spectrum of programs that test the performance and stability of these scalable heterogeneous computing systems. At the lowest level, SHOC uses microbenchmarks to assess architectural features of the system. At higher levels, SHOC uses application kernels to determine system-wide performance including many system features such as intranode and internode communication among devices. SHOC includes benchmark implementations in both OpenCL and CUDA in order to provide a comparison of these programming models.","author":["Anthony Danalis","Gabriel Marin","Collin McCurdy","Jeremy S.

From the database perspective, a good solution needs to have two properties: (i) it can be easily incorporated in a relational database, and (ii) its query cost should increase sublinearly with the dataset size, regardless of the data and query distributions. Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is a well-known methodology fulfilling both requirements, but its current implementations either incur expensive space and query cost, or abandon its theoretical guarantee on the quality of query results.Motivated by this, we improve LSH by proposing an access method called the Locality-Sensitive B-tree (LSB-tree) to enable fast, accurate, high-dimensional NN search in relational databases. The combination of several LSB-trees forms a LSB-forest that has strong quality guarantees, but improves dramatically the efficiency of the previous LSH implementation having the same guarantees. In practice, the LSB-tree itself is also an effective index which consumes linear space, supports efficient updates, and provides accurate query results. In our experiments, the LSB-tree was faster than: (i) iDistance (a famous technique for exact NN search) by two orders of magnitude, and (ii) MedRank (a recent approximate method with nontrivial quality guarantees) by one order of magnitude, and meanwhile returned much better results.As a second step, we extend our LSB technique to solve another classic problem, called Closest Pair (CP) search, in high-dimensional space. The long-term challenge for this problem has been to achieve subquadratic running time at very high dimensionalities, which fails most of the existing solutions. We show that, using a LSB-forest, CP search can be accomplished in (worst-case) time significantly lower than the quadratic complexity, yet still ensuring very good quality. In practice, accurate answers can be found using just two LSB-trees, thus giving a substantial reduction in the space and running time. In our experiments, our technique was faster: (i) than distance browsing (a well-known method for solving the problem exactly) by several orders of magnitude, and (ii) than D-shift (an approximate approach with theoretical guarantees in low-dimensional space) by one order of magnitude, and at the same time, outputs better results.","author":["Yufei Tao","Ke Yi","Cheng Sheng","Panos Kalnis"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Database Systems","Volume 35","Issue 3","July 2010","Article No.: 20","pp   1\u201346","https://doi.org/10.1145/1806907.1806912"],"date":"30 July 2010","ref":[{"text":"Andoni, A. and Indyk, P. 2006.

One important type of data analysis done with MapReduce is log processing, in which a click-stream or an event log is filtered, aggregated, or mined for patterns. As part of this analysis, the log often needs to be joined with reference data such as information about users. Although there have been many studies examining join algorithms in parallel and distributed DBMSs, the MapReduce framework is cumbersome for joins. MapReduce programmers often use simple but inefficient algorithms to perform joins. In this paper, we describe crucial implementation details of a number of well-known join strategies in MapReduce, and present a comprehensive experimental comparison of these join techniques on a 100-node Hadoop cluster. Our results provide insights that are unique to the MapReduce platform and offer guidance on when to use a particular join algorithm on this platform.","author":["Spyros Blanas","Jignesh M.

Two key observations drive the design of a new architecture for CNN. First, CNN workloads exhibit a widely varying mix of three types of parallelism: parallelism within a convolution operation, intra-output parallelism where multiple input sources (features) are combined to create a single output, and inter-output parallelism where multiple, independent outputs (features) are computed simultaneously. Workloads differ significantly across different CNN applications, and across different layers of a CNN. Second, the number of processing elements in an architecture continues to scale (as per Moore's law) much faster than off-chip memory bandwidth (or pin-count) of chips. Based on these two observations, we show that for a given number of processing elements and off-chip memory bandwidth, a new CNN hardware architecture that dynamically configures the hardware on-the-fly to match the specific mix of parallelism in a given workload gives the best throughput performance. Our CNN compiler automatically translates high abstraction network specification into a parallel microprogram (a sequence of low-level VLIW instructions) that is mapped, scheduled and executed by the coprocessor. Compared to a 2.3 GHz quad-core, dual socket Intel Xeon, 1.35 GHz C870 GPU, and a 200 MHz FPGA implementation, our 120 MHz dynamically configurable architecture is 4x to 8x faster. This is the first CNN architecture to achieve real-time video stream processing (25 to 30 frames per second) on a wide range of object detection and recognition tasks.","author":["Srimat Chakradhar","Murugan Sankaradas","Venkata Jakkula","Srihari Cadambi"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 38","Issue 3","June 2010","pp   247\u2013257","https://doi.org/10.1145/1816038.1815993"],"date":"19 June 2010","ref":[{"text":"LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P.

Compared to other non-volatile memory alternatives, PCM is more matured to production, and has a faster read latency and potentially higher storage density. The main roadblock precluding PCM from being used, in particular, in the main memory hierarchy, is its limited write endurance. To address this issue, recent studies proposed to either reduce PCM's write frequency or use wear-leveling to evenly distribute writes. Although these techniques can extend the lifetime of PCM, most of them will not prevent deliberately designed malicious codes from wearing it out quickly. Furthermore, all the prior techniques did not consider the circumstances of a compromised OS and its security implication to the overall PCM design. A compromised OS will allow adversaries to manipulate processes and exploit side channels to accelerate wear-out.In this paper, we argue that a PCM design not only has to consider normal wear-out under normal application behavior, most importantly, it must take the worst-case scenario into account with the presence of malicious exploits and a compromised OS to address the durability and security issues simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel, low-cost hardware mechanism called Security Refresh to avoid information leak by constantly migrating their physical locations inside the PCM, obfuscating the actual data placement from users and system software. It uses a dynamic randomized address mapping scheme that swaps data using random keys upon each refresh due. The hardware overhead is tiny without using any table. The best lifetime we can achieve under the worst-case malicious attack is more than six years. Also, our scheme incurs around 1% performance degradation for normal program operations.","author":["Nak Hee Seong","Dong Hyuk Woo","Hsien-Hsin S.

A key component of our algorithm is a BVH (bounding volume hierarchy) based on 4D hyper-trapezoids that project into 3D OBBs (oriented bounding boxes) in spatial dimensions. This acceleration structure is able to provide tight bounding volumes for scene geometries, and is thus efficient in pruning intersection tests during ray traversal. More importantly, it can exploit the natural coherence on the time dimension in motion blurred scenes. The structure can be quickly constructed by utilizing the micropolygon grids generated during micropolygon tessellation. Ray tracing of defocused and motion blurred scenes is efficiently performed by traversing the structure. Both the BVH construction and ray traversal are easily implemented on GPUs and integrated into a GPU-based micropolygon renderer. In our experiments, our ray tracer performs up to an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-art rasterizers while consistently delivering an image quality equivalent to a maximum-quality rasterizer. We also demonstrate that the ray tracing algorithm can be extended to handle a variety of effects, such as secondary ray effects and transparency.","author":["Qiming Hou","Hao Qin","Wenyao Li","Baining Guo","Kun Zhou"],"issue":["SIGGRAPH '10: ACM SIGGRAPH 2010 papers","July 2010","Article No.: 64","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/1833349.1778801"],"date":"26 July 2010","ref":[{"text":"Aila, T., and Laine, S. 2009.

Given a set of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) of a PUF, our attacks construct a computer algorithm which behaves indistinguishably from the original PUF on almost all CRPs. This algorithm can subsequently impersonate the PUF, and can be cloned and distributed arbitrarily. This breaks the security of essentially all applications and protocols that are based on the respective PUF. The PUFs we attacked successfully include standard Arbited PUFs and Ring Oscillator PUFs of arbitrary sizes, and XO Arbiter PUFs, Lightweight Secure PUFs, and Feed-Forward Arbiter PUFs of up to a given size and complexity. Our attacks are based upon various machine learning techniques including Logistic Regression and Evolution Strategies. Our work leads to new design requirements for secure electrical PUFs, and will be useful to PUF designers and attackers alike.","author":["Ulrich R\u00fchrmair","Frank Sehnke","Jan S\u00f6lter","Gideon Dror","Srinivas Devadas","J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber"],"issue":["CCS '10: Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Computer and communications security","October 2010","Pages   237\u2013249","https://doi.org/10.1145/1866307.1866335"],"date":"04 October 2010","ref":[{"text":"}}R.

These memory devices enable fast user-mode access to persistence, allowing regular in-memory data structures to survive system crashes. In this paper, we present Mnemosyne, a simple interface for programming with persistent memory. Mnemosyne addresses two challenges: how to create and manage such memory, and how to ensure consistency in the presence of failures. Without additional mechanisms, a system failure may leave data structures in SCM in an invalid state, crashing the program the next time it starts. In Mnemosyne, programmers declare global persistent data with the keyword \"pstatic\" or allocate it dynamically. Mnemosyne provides primitives for directly modifying persistent variables and supports consistent updates through a lightweight transaction mechanism. Compared to past work on disk-based persistent memory, Mnemosyne reduces latency to storage by writing data directly to memory at the granularity of an update rather than writing memory pages back to disk through the file system. In tests emulating the performance characteristics of forthcoming SCMs, we show that Mnemosyne can persist data as fast as 3 microseconds. Furthermore, it provides a 35 percent performance increase when applied in the OpenLDAP directory server. In microbenchmark studies we find that Mnemosyne can be up to 1400% faster than alternative persistence strategies, such as Berkeley DB or Boost serialization, that are designed for disks.","author":["Haris Volos","Andres Jaan Tack","Michael M.

By showing forethought before action and expressing a reaction to the task outcome (success or failure), we prototyped a set of human-robot interaction behaviors. In a 2 (forethought vs. none: between) x 2 (reaction to outcome vs. none: between) x 2 (success vs. failure task outcome: within) experiment, we tested the influences of forethought and reaction upon people's perceptions of the robot and the robot's readability. In this online video prototype experiment (N=273), we have found support for the hypothesis that perceptions of robots are influenced by robots showing forethought, the task outcome (success or failure), and showing goal-oriented reactions to those task outcomes.

Most of the traditional WSN architectures consist of static nodes which are densely deployed over a sensing area. Recently, several WSN architectures based on mobile elements (MEs) have been proposed. Most of them exploit mobility to address the problem of data collection in WSNs. In this article we first define WSNs with MEs and provide a comprehensive taxonomy of their architectures, based on the role of the MEs. Then we present an overview of the data collection process in such a scenario, and identify the corresponding issues and challenges. On the basis of these issues, we provide an extensive survey of the related literature. Finally, we compare the underlying approaches and solutions, with hints to open problems and future research directions.","author":["Mario Di Francesco","Sajal K.

The target network topology is a variant Mesh-of-Trees (MoT), combining a binary fan-out network (i.e. routing) and a binary fan-in network (i.e. arbitration) for each source-sink pair. The key feature of the new arbitration node is that it dynamically reconfigures based on the traffic it receives, entering a special \"single-channel-bias\" mode when the other channel has no recent activity. Arbitration is totally bypassed on the critical path, resulting in significantly lower node latency and, in high-traffic scenarios, improved throughput. The router nodes were implemented in IBM 90nm technology using ARM standard cells. SPICE simulations indicate that the bi-modal arbitration node provided significant reductions in latency (41.6%), and increased throughput (19.8%, in high-traffic single-channel scenarios), when in biased mode. Node reconfiguration required at most 338 ps. Simulations were then performed on two distinct MoT indirect networks, \"baseline\" and \"adaptive\" (the latter incorporating the new bi-modal node), on eight diverse synthetic benchmarks, using mixes of random and deterministic traffic. Improvements in system latency up to 19.8% and throughput up to 27.8% were obtained using the adaptive network. Overall end-to-end latencies, through 6 router nodes and 5 hops, of 1.8-2.8 ns (at 25% load) and throughputs of 0.27-1.8 Gigaflits/s (at saturation rate) were also observed.","author":["Gennette Gill","Sumedh S.

This includes a continuous separating axis test that can conservatively check whether two volume meshes overlap during a given time interval. In addition, we present efficient methods to eliminate redundant elementary tests between the features (e.g., vertices, edges, and faces) of volume elements (e.g., tetrahedra, hexahedra, triangular prisms, etc.). Our approach is applicable to various deforming meshes, including those with changing topologies, and efficiently computes the first time of contact. We are able to perform inter-object and intra-object collision queries in models represented with tens of thousands of volume elements at interactive rates on a single CPU core. Moreover, we observe more than an order of magnitude performance improvement over prior methods.","author":["Min Tang","Dinesh Manocha","Sung-Eui Yoon","Peng Du","Jae-Pil Heo","Ruo-Feng Tong"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 30","Issue 5","October 2011","Article No.: 111","pp   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/2019627.2019630"],"date":"22 October 2011","ref":[{"text":"ABAQUS. 2003.

For example, given two large graphs from the same domain, how can we use information in one to do classification in the other (i.e., perform across-network classification or transfer learning on graphs)? Also, if one of the graphs is anonymized, how can we use information in one to de-anonymize the other? The key step in all such graph mining tasks is to find effective node features. We propose ReFeX (Recursive Feature eXtraction), a novel algorithm, that recursively combines local (node-based) features with neighborhood (egonet-based) features; and outputs regional features -- capturing \"behavioral\" information. We demonstrate how these powerful regional features can be used in within-network and across-network classification and de-anonymization tasks -- without relying on homophily, or the availability of class labels. The contributions of our work are as follows: (a) ReFeX is scalable and (b) it is effective, capturing regional (\"behavioral\") information in large graphs. We report experiments on real graphs from various domains with over 1M edges, where ReFeX outperforms its competitors on typical graph mining tasks like network classification and de-anonymization.","author":["Keith Henderson","Brian Gallagher","Lei Li","Leman Akoglu","Tina Eliassi-Rad","Hanghang Tong","Christos Faloutsos"],"issue":["KDD '11: Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2011","Pages   663\u2013671","https://doi.org/10.1145/2020408.2020512"],"date":"21 August 2011","ref":[{"text":"L.

By incorporating knowledge about the temporal behavior of such multi-mode systems, it is possible to share hardware by means of partial reconfiguration, and thus, reduce costs and improve performance. In this paper, we specify the temporal behavior of the functionality by applying known models based on state machines. In addition, we introduce an architectural model that allows to express the characteristics of nowadays partially reconfigurable architectures, focusing on FPGAs. We develop a symbolic encoding of this novel system specification, which allows to perform a unified system synthesis for allocation, binding, placement of partially reconfigurable modules, and routing the on-chip communication. The proposed encoding enables the use of sophisticated optimization techniques, coupling a SAT solver with a Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm. The proposed methodology is highly applicable for building multi-mode systems on advanced reconfigurable technology. We demonstrate this by experiments on test-cases from the image processing domain applying state-of-the-art technology. The results show the superiority of the presented approach in terms of run-time and quality of the found solutions compared to existing system synthesis approaches.","author":["Stefan Wildermann","Felix Reimann","Daniel Ziener","J\u00fcrgen Teich"],"issue":["CODES+ISSS '11: Proceedings of the seventh IEEE/ACM/IFIP international conference on Hardware/software codesign and system synthesis","October 2011","Pages   129\u2013138","https://doi.org/10.1145/2039370.2039393"],"date":"09 October 2011","ref":[{"text":"M.

However, it faces a number of issues to achieve the best performance from the underlying system. These include a serialization barrier that delays the reduce phase, repetitive merges and disk access, and lack of capability to leverage latest high speed interconnects. We describe Hadoop-A, an acceleration framework that optimizes Hadoop with plugin components implemented in C++ for fast data movement, overcoming its existing limitations. A novel network-levitated merge algorithm is introduced to merge data without repetition and disk access. In addition, a full pipeline is designed to overlap the shuffle, merge and reduce phases. Our experimental results show that Hadoop-A doubles the data processing throughput of Hadoop, and reduces CPU utilization by more than 36%.","author":["Yandong Wang","Xinyu Que","Weikuan Yu","Dror Goldenberg","Dhiraj Sehgal"],"issue":["SC '11: Proceedings of 2011 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2011","Article No.: 57","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2063384.2063461"],"date":"12 November 2011","ref":[{"text":"Apache Hadoop Project. http://hadoop.apache.org/.","order":1},{"text":"Open Fabrics Alliance. http://www.openfabrics.org.","order":2},{"text":"Test-TCP. http://www.pcausa.com/Utilities/pcattcp.htm.","order":3},{"text":"The Public Netperf Homepage. http://www.netperf.org/netperf/NetperfPage.html.","order":4},{"text":"Tyson Condie, Neil Conway, Peter Alvaro, Joseph M.

Different from the traditional approach where buffered updates and transaction logs are completely separated, they are integrated in the new logging scheme.

Our main result is an elegant, easy-to-implement, optimal, deterministic algorithm for external sorting with D disk drives. This result answers in the affirmative the open problem posed by Vitter and Shriver of whether an optimal algorithm exists that is deterministic. Our measure of performance is the number of parallel input/output (I/O) operations, in which each of the D disks can simultaneously transfer a block of B contiguous records. We assume that internal memory can hold M records. Our algorithm sorts N records in the optimal bound of \u03b8((N/BD) log(N/B)/    log(M/B)) deterministically, and thus improves upon Vitter and Shriver's optimal randomized algorithm as well as the well-known deterministic but nonoptimal technique of disk striping.

Many problems in distributed systems can be cast in terms of the problem of detecting global states. For instance, the global state detection algorithm helps to solve an important class of problems: stable property detection. A stable property is one that persists: once a stable property becomes true it remains true thereafter. Examples of stable properties are \u201ccomputation has terminated,\u201d \u201c the system is deadlocked\u201d and \u201call tokens in a token ring have disappeared.\u201d The stable property detection problem is that of devising algorithms to detect a given stable property.

Conventional JSCD schemes, adopting low-density parity check (LDPC) codes for multimedia devices, typically operate at a fixed-time decoding loop, regardless of the quality of data received. We present a JSCD scheme that achieves reduction in power through minimum energy decoding and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). Consequently, up to 39% power reduction is achieved in Foreman, Akiyo, and Mobile video streams without performance degradation in reconstructed video quality.","author":["Yoon Seok Yang","Gwan Choi"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 11","Issue 2","July 2012","Article No.: 30","pp   1\u201321","https://doi.org/10.1145/2220336.2220342"],"date":"01 July 2012","ref":[{"text":"2010.

A single program is divided into a collection of tasks by a combination of software and hardware. The tasks are distributed to a number of parallel processing units which reside within a processor complex. Each of these units fetches and executes instructions belonging to its assigned task. The appearance of a single logical register file is maintained with a copy in each parallel processing unit. Register results are dynamically routed among the many parallel processing units with the help of compiler-generated masks. Memory accesses may occur speculatively without knowledge of preceding loads or stores. Addresses are disambiguated dynamically, many in parallel, and processing waits only for true data dependences.This paper presents the philosophy of the multiscalar paradigm, the structure of multiscalar programs, and the hardware architecture of a multiscalar processor. The paper also discusses performance issues in the multiscalar model, and compares the multiscalar paradigm with other paradigms. Experimental results evaluating the performance of a sample of multiscalar organizations are also presented.","author":["Gurindar S. Sohi","Scott E. Breach","T. N.

Managing all these computations demands for a workflow and scheduling system. In this paper, we identify four indispensable qualities that a Hadoop workflow management system must fulfill namely Scalability, Security, Multi-tenancy, and Operability. We find that conventional workflow management tools lack at least one of these qualities, and therefore present Apache Oozie, a workflow management system specialized for Hadoop. We discuss the architecture of Oozie, share our production experience over the last few years at Yahoo, and evaluate Oozie's scalability and performance.","author":["Mohammad Islam","Angelo K.

Examples of interest include retinal implants for vision restoration and on-the-fly feature extraction. This work addresses the design of image-processing circuits using stochastic computing techniques. We show how stochastic circuits can be integrated at the pixel level with image sensors, thus supporting efficient real-time (pre)processing of images. We present the design of several representative circuits, which demonstrate that stochastic designs can be significantly smaller, faster, more power-efficient, and more noise-tolerant than conventional ones. Furthermore, the stochastic designs naturally produce images with progressive quality improvement.","author":["Armin Alaghi","Cheng Li","John P.

But slow growth in cell resistance with time, resistance drift, can cause transient errors in MLC-PCM. Drift errors increase with time, and prior work suggests refresh before the cell loses data. The need for refresh makes MLC-PCM volatile, taking away a key advantage. Based on the observation that most drift errors occur in a particular state in four-level-cell PCM, we propose to change from four levels to three levels, eliminating the most vulnerable state. This simple change lowers cell drift error rates by many orders of magnitude: three-level-cell PCM can retain data without power for more than ten years. With optimized encoding/decoding and a wearout tolerance mechanism, we can narrow the capacity gap between three-level and four-level cells. These techniques together enable low-cost, high-performance, genuinely nonvolatile MLC-PCM.","author":["Doe Hyun Yoon","Jichuan Chang","Robert S. Schreiber","Norman P.

Facebook's image-management infrastructure is complex and geographically distributed. It includes browser caches on end-user systems, Edge Caches at ~20 PoPs, an Origin Cache, and for some kinds of images, additional caching via Akamai. The underlying image storage layer is widely distributed, and includes multiple data centers. We instrumented every Facebook-controlled layer of the stack and sampled the resulting event stream to obtain traces covering over 77 million requests for more than 1 million unique photos. This permits us to study traffic patterns, cache access patterns, geolocation of clients and servers, and to explore correlation between properties of the content and accesses. Our results (1) quantify the overall traffic percentages served by different layers: 65.5% browser cache, 20.0% Edge Cache, 4.6% Origin Cache, and 9.9% Backend storage, (2) reveal that a significant portion of photo requests are routed to remote PoPs and data centers as a consequence both of load-balancing and peering policy, (3) demonstrate the potential performance benefits of coordinating Edge Caches and adopting S4LRU eviction algorithms at both Edge and Origin layers, and (4) show that the popularity of photos is highly dependent on content age and conditionally dependent on the social-networking metrics we considered.","author":["Qi Huang","Ken Birman","Robbert van Renesse","Wyatt Lloyd","Sanjeev Kumar","Harry C.

But done simplistically, these re-configurations can also cause severe, transient congestion because different switches may apply updates at different times. We develop a novel technique that leverages a small amount of scratch capacity on links to apply updates in a provably congestion-free manner, without making any assumptions about the order and timing of updates at individual switches. Further, to scale to large networks in the face of limited forwarding table capacity, SWAN greedily selects a small set of entries that can best satisfy current demand. It updates this set without disrupting traffic by leveraging a small amount of scratch capacity in forwarding tables. Experiments using a testbed prototype and data-driven simulations of two production networks show that SWAN carries 60% more traffic than the current practice.","author":["Chi-Yao Hong","Srikanth Kandula","Ratul Mahajan","Ming Zhang","Vijay Gill","Mohan Nanduri","Roger Wattenhofer"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 43","Issue 4","October 2013","pp   15\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/2534169.2486012"],"date":"27 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"M.

In this context, memristor are often considered as best candidate to implement efficiently synapses in hardware neural networks. In this article, we analyze the impact of memristor parameter variability. We build an analytical model of the global reliability at the crossbar level. It is based on a supervised learning method with multilayer and redundancy extensions. Comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations of small neural network validate our analytical model. It can be used to extrapolate directly the reliability of large-scale neural system. Our extrapolations show that high defect rate and important parameter variability can be handle efficiency with a moderate amount of redundancy.","author":["Djaafar Chabi","Damien Querlioz","Weisheng Zhao","Jacques-Olivier Klein"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 10","Issue 1","January 2014","Article No.: 5","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/2539123"],"date":"13 January 2014","ref":[{"text":"Agnus G. et al. 2010. 2-terminal carbon nanotube programmable devices for adaptive architectures.

Yet despite their seemingly huge size, these knowledge bases are greatly incomplete. For example, over 70% of people included in Freebase have no known place of birth, and 99% have no known ethnicity. In this paper, we propose a way to leverage existing Web-search-based question-answering technology to fill in the gaps in knowledge bases in a targeted way. In particular, for each entity attribute, we learn the best set of queries to ask, such that the answer snippets returned by the search engine are most likely to contain the correct value for that attribute. For example, if we want to find Frank Zappa's mother, we could ask the query `who is the mother of Frank Zappa'. However, this is likely to return `The Mothers of Invention', which was the name of his band. Our system learns that it should (in this case) add disambiguating terms, such as Zappa's place of birth, in order to make it more likely that the search results contain snippets mentioning his mother. Our system also learns how many different queries to ask for each attribute, since in some cases, asking too many can hurt accuracy (by introducing false positives). We discuss how to aggregate candidate answers across multiple queries, ultimately returning probabilistic predictions for possible values for each attribute. Finally, we evaluate our system and show that it is able to extract a large number of facts with high confidence.","author":["Robert West","Evgeniy Gabrilovich","Kevin Murphy","Shaohua Sun","Rahul Gupta","Dekang Lin"],"issue":["WWW '14: Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World wide web","April 2014","Pages   515\u2013526","https://doi.org/10.1145/2566486.2568032"],"date":"07 April 2014","ref":[{"text":"K.

Many of these scientific datasets are arrays, and are stored in file formats such as HDF5 and NetCDF. Although scientific data management systems, such as SciDB, are designed to manipulate arrays, there are challenges in integrating these systems into existing analysis workflows. Major barriers include the expensive task of preparing and loading data before querying, and converting the final results to a format that is understood by the existing post-processing and visualization tools. As a consequence, integrating a data management system into an existing scientific data analysis workflow is time-consuming and requires extensive user involvement. In this paper, we present the design of a new scientific data analysis system that efficiently processes queries directly over data stored in the HDF5 file format. This design choice eliminates the tedious and error-prone data loading process, and makes the query results readily available to the next processing steps of the analysis workflow. Our design leverages the increasing main memory capacities found in supercomputers through bitmap indexing and in-memory query execution. In addition, query processing over the HDF5 data format can be effortlessly parallelized to utilize the ample concurrency available in large-scale supercomputers and modern parallel file systems. We evaluate the performance of our system on a large supercomputing system and experiment with both a synthetic dataset and a real cosmology observation dataset. Our system frequently outperforms the relational database system that the cosmology team currently uses, and is more than 10X faster than Hive when processing data in parallel. Overall, by eliminating the data loading step, our query processing system is more effective in supporting in situ scientific analysis workflows.","author":["Spyros Blanas","Kesheng Wu","Surendra Byna","Bin Dong","Arie Shoshani"],"issue":["SIGMOD '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","June 2014","Pages   385\u2013396","https://doi.org/10.1145/2588555.2612185"],"date":"18 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"NetCDF. http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf.","order":1},{"text":"The HDF5 Format. http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/.","order":2},{"text":"I.

The uniqueness results that hold for tensors give them a significant advantage over matrices. However, tensors pose serious algorithmic challenges; in particular, much of the matrix algebra toolkit fails to generalize to tensors. Efficient decomposition in the overcomplete case (where rank exceeds dimension) is particularly challenging. We introduce a smoothed analysis model for studying these questions and develop an efficient algorithm for tensor decomposition in the highly overcomplete case (rank polynomial in the dimension). In this setting, we show that our algorithm is robust to inverse polynomial error -- a crucial property for applications in learning since we are only allowed a polynomial number of samples. While algorithms are known for exact tensor decomposition in some overcomplete settings, our main contribution is in analyzing their stability in the framework of smoothed analysis. Our main technical contribution is to show that tensor products of perturbed vectors are linearly independent in a robust sense (i.e. the associated matrix has singular values that are at least an inverse polynomial). This key result paves the way for applying tensor methods to learning problems in the smoothed setting. In particular, we use it to obtain results for learning multi-view models and mixtures of axis-aligned Gaussians where there are many more \"components\" than dimensions. The assumption here is that the model is not adversarially chosen, which we formalize by thinking of the model parameters as being perturbed. We believe this an appealing way to analyze realistic instances of learning problems, since this framework allows us to overcome many of the usual limitations of using tensor methods.","author":["Aditya Bhaskara","Moses Charikar","Ankur Moitra","Aravindan Vijayaraghavan"],"issue":["STOC '14: Proceedings of the forty-sixth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing","May 2014","Pages   594\u2013603","https://doi.org/10.1145/2591796.2591881"],"date":"31 May 2014","ref":[{"text":"E.

To distinguish between different potential stored values, conventional techniques to read data from flash memory employ a single set of reference voltage values, which are determined based on the overall threshold voltage distribution of flash cells. Unfortunately, the phenomenon of program interference, in which a cell's threshold voltage unintentionally changes when a neighboring cell is programmed, makes this conventional approach increasingly inaccurate in determining the values of cells. This paper makes the new empirical observation that identifying the value stored in the immediate-neighbor cell makes it easier to determine the data value stored in the cell that is being read. We provide a detailed statistical and experimental characterization of threshold voltage distribution of flash memory cells conditional upon the immediate-neighbor cell values, and show that such conditional distributions can be used to determine a set of read reference voltages that lead to error rates much lower than when a single set of reference voltage values based on the overall distribution are used. Based on our analyses, we propose a new method for correcting errors in a flash memory page, neighbor-cell assisted correction (NAC). The key idea is to re-read a flash memory page that fails error correction codes (ECC) with the set of read reference voltage values corresponding to the conditional threshold voltage distribution assuming a neighbor cell value and use the re-read values to correct the cells that have neighbors with that value. Our simulations show that NAC effectively improves flash memory lifetime by 33% while having no (at nominal lifetime) or very modest (less than 5% at extended lifetime) performance overhead.","author":["Yu Cai","Gulay Yalcin","Onur Mutlu","Erich F.

However, most of the proposed models focus on either traditional document retrieval or the use of linked data for finding relevant information. We believe neither of these two types of information resources can offer sufficient support for complex search tasks on their own. We propose that a hybrid approach that combines the coherent content of text with the organized structure of graphs should be taken to better support information finding and sense making. Currently, there is limited insight into the types of information seeking activities performed when a knowledge graph is combined with document retrieval to support exploratory search. This paper describes a general framework that provides the first step towards examining users' exploratory search behaviour when interacting with knowledge graphs and their corresponding documents. We conducted a user study that suggests searchers perform different information seeking activities for a complex search task compared with a simple search task. These findings provide insights that can be used to inform the design of a new search framework, which enables more effective information finding and analysis.","author":["Bahareh Sarrafzadeh","Olga Vechtomova","Vlado Jokic"],"issue":["IIiX '14: Proceedings of the 5th Information Interaction in Context Symposium","August 2014","Pages   135\u2013144","https://doi.org/10.1145/2637002.2637019"],"date":"26 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, these emerging SSD arrays are facing enormous challenges, which are not observed in disk-based arrays. Specifically, we observe that the performance of SSD arrays can significantly degrade due to various array-level resource contentions. In addition, their maintenance costs exponentially increase over time, which renders them difficult to deploy widely in HPC systems. To address these challenges, we propose Triple-A, a non-SSD based Autonomic All-Flash Array, which is a self-optimizing, from-scratch NAND flash cluster. Triple-A can detect two different types of resource contentions and autonomically alleviate them by reshaping the physical data-layout on its flash array network. Our experimental evaluation using both real workloads and a micro-benchmark show that Triple-A can offer a 53% higher sustained throughput and a 80% lower I/O latency than non-autonomic SSD arrays.","author":["Myoungsoo Jung","Wonil Choi","John Shalf","Mahmut Taylan Kandemir"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 42","Issue 1","March 2014","pp   441\u2013454","https://doi.org/10.1145/2654822.2541953"],"date":"24 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"http://www.dramexchange.com/.","order":1},{"text":"SNIA IOTTA repository.

However, traditional erasure codes employ device-level redundancy to protect against sector failures, and hence incur significant space overhead. Recent sector-disk (SD) codes are available only for limited configurations. By making a relaxed but practical assumption, we construct a general family of erasure codes called STAIR codes, which efficiently and provably tolerate both device and sector failures without any restriction on the size of a storage array and the numbers of tolerable device failures and sector failures. We propose the upstairs encoding and downstairs encoding methods, which provide complementary performance advantages for different configurations. We conduct extensive experiments on STAIR codes in terms of space saving, encoding/decoding speed, and update cost. We demonstrate that STAIR codes not only improve space efficiency over traditional erasure codes, but also provide better computational efficiency than SD codes based on our special code construction. Finally, we present analytical models that characterize the reliability of STAIR codes, and show that the support of a wider range of configurations by STAIR codes is critical for tolerating sector failure bursts discovered in the field.","author":["Mingqiang Li","Patrick P.

To achieve this, we leverage multi-path propagation that results in wireless signals bouncing off of objects before arriving at the receiver. These reflections effectively light up the objects, which we use to perform imaging. Our algorithms separate the multi-path reflections from different objects into an image. They can also extract depth information where objects in the same direction, but at different distances to the receiver, can be identified. We implement a prototype wireless receiver using USRP-N210s at 2.4 GHz and demonstrate that it can image objects such as leather couches and metallic shapes in line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios. We also demonstrate proof-of-concept applications including localization of static humans and objects, without the need for tagging them with RF devices. Our results show that we can localize static human subjects and metallic objects with a median accuracy of 26 and 15 cm respectively. Finally, we discuss the limits of our Wi-Fi based approach to imaging.","author":["Donny Huang","Rajalakshmi Nandakumar","Shyamnath Gollakota"],"issue":["SenSys '14: Proceedings of the 12th ACM Conference on Embedded Network Sensor Systems","November 2014","Pages   266\u2013279","https://doi.org/10.1145/2668332.2668344"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"Hg2415g grid antenna. http://www.l-com.com/multimedia/datasheets/DS_HG2415G-NF-5PK.PDF.","order":1},{"text":"wa5vjb directional antenna. http://www.wa5vjb.com/pcb-pdfs/LP8565.pdf.","order":2},{"text":"Xirrus corporation. http://www.xirrus.com.","order":3},{"text":"F.

They can attach directly to processors to form non-volatile main memory (NVMM) and offer the opportunity to build very low-latency storage systems. These high-performance storage systems would be especially useful in large-scale data center environments where reliability and availability are critical. However, providing reliability and availability to NVMM is challenging, since the latency of data replication can overwhelm the low latency that NVMM should provide. We propose Mojim, a system that provides the reliability and availability that large-scale storage systems require, while preserving the performance of NVMM. Mojim achieves these goals by using a two-tier architecture in which the primary tier contains a mirrored pair of nodes and the secondary tier contains one or more secondary backup nodes with weakly consistent copies of data. Mojim uses highly-optimized replication protocols, software, and networking stacks to minimize replication costs and expose as much of NVMM?s performance as possible. We evaluate Mojim using raw DRAM as a proxy for NVMM and using an industrial NVMM emulation system. We find that Mojim provides replicated NVMM with similar or even better performance than un-replicated NVMM (reducing latency by 27% to 63% and delivering between 0.4 to 2.7X the throughput). We demonstrate that replacing MongoDB's built-in replication system with Mojim improves MongoDB's performance by 3.4 to 4X.","author":["Yiying Zhang","Jian Yang","Amirsaman Memaripour","Steven Swanson"],"issue":["ASPLOS '15: Proceedings of the Twentieth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2015","Pages   3\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/2694344.2694370"],"date":"14 March 2015","ref":[{"text":"Atul Adya, William J.

This is a new variant of the previously proposed generators, TGFSR, modified so as to admit a Mersenne-prime period. The characteristic polynomial has many terms. The distribution up to v bits accuracy for 1 \u2264 v \u2264 32 is also shown to be good. An algorithm is also given that checks the primitivity of the characteristic polynomial of MT with computational complexity O(p2) where  p is the degree of the polynomial.We implemented this generator in portable C-code. It passed several stringent statistical tests, including diehard. Its speed is comparable to other modern generators. Its merits are due to the efficient algorithms that are unique to polynomial calculations over the two-element field.","author":["Makoto Matsumoto","Takuji Nishimura"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation","Volume 8","Issue 1","Jan. 1998","pp   3\u201330","https://doi.org/10.1145/272991.272995"],"date":"01 January 1998","ref":[{"text":"BRILLHART, J., LEHMER, D.

To ensure the operation and security of Bitcoin, it is essential that all transactions and their order of execution are available to all Bitcoin users.Unavoidably, in such a setting, the security of transactions comes at odds with transaction privacy. Motivated by the fact that transaction confirmation in Bitcoin requires tens of minutes, we analyze the conditions for performing successful double-spending attacks against fast payments in Bitcoin, where the time between the exchange of currency and goods is short (in the order of a minute). We show that unless new detection techniques are integrated in the Bitcoin implementation, double-spending attacks on fast payments succeed with considerable probability and can be mounted at low cost. We propose a new and lightweight countermeasure that enables the detection of double-spending attacks in fast transactions.In light of such misbehavior, accountability becomes crucial. We show that in the specific case of Bitcoin, accountability complements privacy. To illustrate this tension, we provide accountability and privacy definition for Bitcoin, and we investigate analytically and empirically the privacy and accountability provisions in Bitcoin.","author":["Ghassan O.

Technological advances such as cloud computing and data centers provide a new impetus for investigating this problem under the assumption that agents demand the resources in fixed proportions, known in economics as Leontief preferences. In a recent paper, Ghodsi et al. [2011] introduced the dominant resource fairness (DRF) mechanism, which was shown to possess highly desirable theoretical properties under Leontief preferences. We extend their results in three directions. First, we show that DRF generalizes to more expressive settings, and leverage a new technical framework to formally extend its guarantees. Second, we study the relation between social welfare and properties such as truthfulness; DRF performs poorly in terms of social welfare, but we show that this is an unavoidable shortcoming that is shared by every mechanism that satisfies one of three basic properties. Third, and most importantly, we study a realistic setting that involves indivisibilities. We chart the boundaries of the possible in this setting, contributing a new relaxed notion of fairness and providing both possibility and impossibility results.","author":["David C. Parkes","Ariel D.

FF is a Layer 1 in-band full duplex device, it receives and transmits signals directly and simultaneously on the same frequency. It cleanly integrates into existing networks (both WiFi and LTE) as a separate device and does not require changes to the clients. FF's key invention is a constructive filtering algorithm that transforms the signal at the relay such that when it reaches the destination, it constructively combines with the direct signals from the source and provides a significant throughput gain.

However, the use of priority encoder results in increased energy consumption of pattern updates and search operations. This work, proposes a promising memory technology, called Priority-Decision in Memory (PDM), which eliminates the need for priority encoders and removes restrictions on ordering, meaning that patterns can be stored in an arbitrary order without sorting their lengths. Moreover, we present a Sequential Input-State Search (SIS) scheme to disable the mass of redundant search operations in state segments, based on the analysis distribution of hex signatures in a virus database. Experimental results demonstrate that PDM-based technology can improve update energy consumption of nvTCAM search engines by 36%~67% because most of the energy in the latter is used to reorder. By adopting the SIS-based method to avoid unnecessarily search operations in a TCAM array, the search energy reduction is around 64% of nvTCAM search engines.","author":["Hsiang-Jen Tsai","Keng-Hao Yang","Yin-Chi Peng","Chien-Chen Lin","Ya-Han Tsao","Meng-Fan Chang","Tien-Fu Chen"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 100","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744836"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"C.

However, this growth comes at the cost of an increasing thermal load that must be removed to prevent overheating and server failure. In this paper, we propose to use phase changing materials (PCM) to shape the thermal load of a datacenter, absorbing and releasing heat when it is advantageous to do so. We present and validate a methodology to study the impact of PCM on a datacenter, and evaluate two important opportunities for cost savings. We find that in a datacenter with full cooling system subscription, PCM can reduce the necessary cooling system size by up to 12% without impacting peak throughput, or increase the number of servers by up to 14.6% without increasing the cooling load. In a thermally constrained setting, PCM can increase peak throughput up to 69% while delaying the onset of thermal limits by over 3 hours.","author":["Matt Skach","Manish Arora","Chang-Hong Hsu","Qi Li","Dean Tullsen","Lingjia Tang","Jason Mars"],"issue":["ISCA '15: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2015","Pages   439\u2013449","https://doi.org/10.1145/2749469.2749474"],"date":"13 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"L.

Reservoir computing (RC) is a new computing paradigm that allows to harness the intrinsic dynamics of a \"reservoir\" to perform useful computations. The reservoir, or compute core, must only provide sufficiently rich dynamics that are then mapped onto a low-dimensional space by an readout layer. One of the key advantages of this approach is that only the readout layer needs to be adapted to perform the desired computation. The reservoir itself remains unchanged. In this paper we use for the first time memristive components as reservoir building blocks that are assembled into device networks. Memristive components are particularly interesting for this purpose because of their non-linear and memory characteristics. In addition, they can be integrated very densely and provide rich dynamics with a few components only. We use pattern recognition and associative memory tasks to illustrate the memristive reservoir computing approach. For that purpose, we have built a software framework that allows to create valid memristor networks, to simulate and evaluate them in Ngspice, and to train the readout layer by means of a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Our results show that we can efficiently and robustly classify temporal patterns. The approach presents a promising new computing paradigm that harnesses the non-linear, time-dependent, and highly-variable properties of current memristive components for solving computational tasks.","author":["Manjari S.

In information retrieval tasks we typically deal with query-document pairs, in question answering -- question-answer pairs. However, before learning can take place, such pairs needs to be mapped from the original space of symbolic words into some feature space encoding various aspects of their relatedness, e.g. lexical, syntactic and semantic. Feature engineering is often a laborious task and may require external knowledge sources that are not always available or difficult to obtain. Recently, deep learning approaches have gained a lot of attention from the research community and industry for their ability to automatically learn optimal feature representation for a given task, while claiming state-of-the-art performance in many tasks in computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. In this paper, we present a convolutional neural network architecture for reranking pairs of short texts, where we learn the optimal representation of text pairs and a similarity function to relate them in a supervised way from the available training data. Our network takes only words in the input, thus requiring minimal preprocessing. In particular, we consider the task of reranking short text pairs where elements of the pair are sentences. We test our deep learning system on two popular retrieval tasks from TREC: Question Answering and Microblog Retrieval. Our model demonstrates strong performance on the first task beating previous state-of-the-art systems by about 3\\% absolute points in both MAP and MRR and shows comparable results on tweet reranking, while enjoying the benefits of no manual feature engineering and no additional syntactic parsers.","author":["Aliaksei Severyn","Alessandro Moschitti"],"issue":["SIGIR '15: Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2015","Pages   373\u2013382","https://doi.org/10.1145/2766462.2767738"],"date":"09 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"A.

Unreadable tests are more difficult to maintain and lose some of their value to developers. To overcome this problem, we propose a domain-specific model of unit test readability based on human judgements, and use this model to augment automated unit test generation. The resulting approach can automatically generate test suites with both high coverage and also improved readability. In human studies users prefer our improved tests and are able to answer maintenance questions about them 14% more quickly at the same level of accuracy.","author":["Ermira Daka","Jos\u00e9 Campos","Gordon Fraser","Jonathan Dorn","Westley Weimer"],"issue":["ESEC/FSE 2015: Proceedings of the 2015 10th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering","August 2015","Pages   107\u2013118","https://doi.org/10.1145/2786805.2786838"],"date":"30 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"S.

We introduce Active Pages, a computation model which addresses this gap by shifting data-intensive computations to the memory system. An Active Page consists of a page of data and a set of associated functions which can operate upon that data. We describe an implementation of Active Pages on RADram (Reconfigurable Architecture DRAM), a memory system based upon the integration of DRAM and reconfigurable logic. Results from the SimpleScalar simulator [BA97] demonstrate up to 1000X speedups on several applications using the RADram system versus conventional memory systems. We also explore the sensitivity of our results to implementations in other memory technologies.","author":["Mark Oskin","Frederic T.

EsdRank treats vocabularies, terms and entities from external data, as objects connecting query and documents. Evidence used to link query to objects, and to rank documents are incorporated as features between query-object and object-document correspondingly. A latent listwise learning to rank algorithm, Latent-ListMLE, models the objects as latent space between query and documents, and learns how to handle all evidence in a unified procedure from document relevance judgments. EsdRank is tested in two scenarios: Using a knowledge base for web search, and using a controlled vocabulary for medical search. Experiments on TREC Web Track and OHSUMED data show significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.","author":["Chenyan Xiong","Jamie Callan"],"issue":["CIKM '15: Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2015","Pages   951\u2013960","https://doi.org/10.1145/2806416.2806456"],"date":"17 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"M.

Visual dashboards and templates make it easy to get started, but asking more sophisticated questions often requires learning a tool designed for expert analysts. Natural language interaction allows users to ask questions directly in complex programs without having to learn how to use an interface. However, natural language is often ambiguous. In this work we propose a mixed-initiative approach to managing ambiguity in natural language interfaces for data visualization. We model ambiguity throughout the process of turning a natural language query into a visualization and use algorithmic disambiguation coupled with interactive ambiguity widgets. These widgets allow the user to resolve ambiguities by surfacing system decisions at the point where the ambiguity matters. Corrections are stored as constraints and influence subsequent queries. We have implemented these ideas in a system, DataTone. In a comparative study, we find that DataTone is easy to learn and lets users ask questions without worrying about syntax and proper question form.","author":["Tong Gao","Mira Dontcheva","Eytan Adar","Zhicheng Liu","Karrie G.

The software part of Skylight measures the latency of controlled I/O operations to infer important properties of drive-managed SMR, including type, structure, and size of the persistent cache; type of cleaning algorithm; type of block mapping; and size of bands. The hardware part of Skylight tracks drive head movements during these tests, using a high-speed camera through an observation window drilled through the cover of the drive. These observations not only confirm inferences from measurements, but resolve ambiguities that arise from the use of latency measurements alone. We show the generality and efficacy of our techniques by running them on top of three emulated and two real SMR drives, discovering valuable performance-relevant details of the behavior of the real SMR drives.","author":["Abutalib Aghayev","Mansour Shafaei","Peter Desnoyers"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 11","Issue 4","November 2015","Article No.: 16","pp   1\u201328","https://doi.org/10.1145/2821511"],"date":"16 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"Ahmed Amer, Darrell D.

Specifically, we show that it is possible to design devices and WiFi APs such that the WiFi AP in the process of transmitting data to normal WiFi clients can decode backscatter signals which the devices generate by modulating information on to the ambient WiFi transmission. We show via prototypes and experiments that it is possible to achieve communication rates of up to 5 Mbps at a range of 1 m and 1 Mbps at a range of 5 meters. Such performance is an order to three orders of magnitude better than the best known prior WiFi backscatter system [27,25]. BackFi design is energy efficient, as it relies on backscattering alone and needs insignificant power, hence the energy consumed per bit is small.","author":["Dinesh Bharadia","Kiran Raj Joshi","Manikanta Kotaru","Sachin Katti"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 45","Issue 4","October 2015","pp   283\u2013296","https://doi.org/10.1145/2829988.2787490"],"date":"17 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"Analog Devices ADG904 RF SP4T. http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADG904_904R.pdf .","order":1},{"text":"Cypress Semiconductor CY62146EV30 SRAM. http://www.cypress.com/?docID=48695 .","order":2},{"text":"EPC Class-1 Gen-2 UHF RFID. http://www.gs1.org/gsmp/kc/epcglobal/uhfc1g2/uhfc1g2_1_2_0-standard-20080511.pdf .","order":3},{"text":"ThingMagic.

Accurately estimating the slowdown of each application has several benefits: e.g., it can enable shared resource allocation in a manner that avoids unfair application slowdowns or provides slowdown guarantees. Unfortunately, prior works on estimating slowdowns either lead to inaccurate estimates, do not take into account shared caches, or rely on a priori application knowledge. This severely limits their applicability. In this work, we propose the Application Slowdown Model (ASM), a new technique that accurately estimates application slowdowns due to interference at both the shared cache and main memory, in the absence of a priori application knowledge. ASM is based on the observation that the performance of each application is strongly correlated with the rate at which the application accesses the shared cache. Thus, ASM reduces the problem of estimating slowdown to that of estimating the shared cache access rate of the application had it been run alone on the system. To estimate this for each application, ASM periodically 1) minimizes interference for the application at the main memory, 2) quantifies the interference the application receives at the shared cache, in an aggregate manner for a large set of requests. Our evaluations across 100 workloads show that ASM has an average slowdown estimation error of only 9.9%, a 2.97x improvement over the best previous mechanism. We present several use cases of ASM that leverage its slowdown estimates to improve fairness, performance and provide slowdown guarantees. We provide detailed evaluations of three such use cases: slowdown-aware cache partitioning, slowdown-aware memory bandwidth partitioning and an example scheme to provide soft slowdown guarantees. Our evaluations show that these new schemes perform significantly better than state-of-the-art cache partitioning and memory scheduling schemes.","author":["Lavanya Subramanian","Vivek Seshadri","Arnab Ghosh","Samira Khan","Onur Mutlu"],"issue":["MICRO-48: Proceedings of the 48th International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2015","Pages   62\u201375","https://doi.org/10.1145/2830772.2830803"],"date":"05 December 2015","ref":[{"text":". http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/.","order":1},{"text":". http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/.","order":2},{"text":". http://www.nas.nasa.gov/publications/npb.html.","order":3},{"text":". http://www.spec.org/spec2006.","order":4},{"text":"K.

Due to multiple convolution and fully-connected layers that are compute-/memory-intensive, it is difficult to perform real-time classification with low power consumption on today?s computing systems. FPGAs have been widely explored as hardware accelerators for CNNs because of their reconfigurability and energy efficiency, as well as fast turn-around-time, especially with high-level synthesis methodologies. Previous FPGA-based CNN accelerators, however, typically implemented generic accelerators agnostic to the CNN configuration, where the reconfigurable capabilities of FPGAs are not fully leveraged to maximize the overall system throughput. In this work, we present a systematic design space exploration methodology to maximize the throughput of an OpenCL-based FPGA accelerator for a given CNN model, considering the FPGA resource constraints such as on-chip memory, registers, computational resources and external memory bandwidth. The proposed methodology is demonstrated by optimizing two representative large-scale CNNs, AlexNet and VGG, on two Altera Stratix-V FPGA platforms, DE5-Net and P395-D8 boards, which have different hardware resources. We achieve a peak performance of 136.5 GOPS for convolution operation, and 117.8 GOPS for the entire VGG network that performs ImageNet classification on P395-D8 board.","author":["Naveen Suda","Vikas Chandra","Ganesh Dasika","Abinash Mohanty","Yufei Ma","Sarma Vrudhula","Jae-sun Seo","Yu Cao"],"issue":["FPGA '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2016","Pages   16\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2847263.2847276"],"date":"21 February 2016","ref":[{"text":"Y.

Following the Cederman-Tsigas implementation for GPUs, we synchronize work-items not with locks, mutexes or critical sections, but instead with the atomic operations provided by Altera's OpenCL SDK. We evaluate work-stealing for FPGAs by synthesizing a K-means clustering algorithm on an Altera P385 D5 board, both with work-stealing and with a statically-partitioned load. When block RAM utilization is maximised in both cases, we find that work-stealing leads to a 1.5x speedup. This demonstrates that the ability to do load balancing at run-time can outweigh the drawback of using `expensive' atomics on FPGAs. We hope that our case study will stimulate further research into the high-level synthesis of fine-grained, lock-free, concurrent programs.","author":["Nadesh Ramanathan","John Wickerson","Felix Winterstein","George A.

Model- based SRAF generation has been widely used to achieve high accuracy but it is known to be time consuming and it is hard to obtain consistent SRAFs on the same layout pattern configurations. This paper proposes the first ma- chine learning based framework for fast yet consistent SRAF generation with high quality of results. Our technical con- tributions include robust feature extraction, novel feature compaction, model training for SRAF classification and pre- diction, and the final SRAF generation with consideration of practical mask manufacturing constraints. Experimental re- sults demonstrate that, compared with commercial Calibre tool, our machine learning based SRAF generation obtains 10X speed up and comparable performance in terms of edge placement error (EPE) and process variation (PV) band.","author":["Xiaoqing Xu","Tetsuaki Matsunawa","Shigeki Nojima","Chikaaki Kodama","Toshiya Kotani","David Z.

This \"accommodation\" to one's partners is largely automatic, but the degree to which it occurs is influenced by social factors, such as gender, relative power, and attraction. In settings where such social information is not known, this accommodation can be a useful cue for the missing information. This is especially important in web-based communication, where social dynamics are often fluid and rarely stated explicitly. But connecting accommodation and social dynamics on the web requires accurate quantification of the different amounts of accommodation being made. We focus specifically on accommodation in the form of \"linguistic alignment\": the amount that one person's word use is influenced by another's. Previous studies have used many measures for linguistic alignment, with no clear standard. In this paper, we lay out a set of desiderata for a linguistic alignment measure, including robustness to sparse and short messages, explicit conditionality, and consistency across linguistic features with different baseline frequencies. We propose a straightforward and flexible model-based framework for calculating linguistic alignment, with a focus on the sparse data and limited social information observed in social media. We show that this alignment measure fulfills our desiderata on simulated data. We then analyze a large corpus of Twitter data, both replicating previous results and extending them: Our measure's improved resolution reveals a previously undetectable effect of interpersonal power in Twitter interactions.","author":["Gabriel Doyle","Dan Yurovsky","Michael C.

Unfortunately, when the workload exhibits a non-trivial amount of contention, both 2PL and OCC sacrifice much parallel execution op- portunity. In this paper, we describe a new concurrency control scheme, interleaving constrained concurrency con- trol (IC3), which provides serializability while allowing for parallel execution of certain conflicting transactions. IC3 combines the static analysis of the transaction workload with runtime techniques that track and enforce dependencies among concurrent transactions. The use of static analysis simplifies IC3's runtime design, allowing it to scale to many cores. Evaluations on a 64-core machine using the TPC- C benchmark show that IC3 outperforms traditional con- currency control schemes under contention. It achieves the throughput of 434K transactions/sec on the TPC-C bench- mark configured with only one warehouse. It also scales better than several recent concurrent control schemes that also target contended workloads.","author":["Zhaoguo Wang","Shuai Mu","Yang Cui","Han Yi","Haibo Chen","Jinyang Li"],"issue":["SIGMOD '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data","June 2016","Pages   1643\u20131658","https://doi.org/10.1145/2882903.2882934"],"date":"26 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"D.

Efficient high-dimensional performance modeling of tunable analog/RF circuits is an important yet challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel performance modeling approach for tunable circuits, referred to as Correlated Bayesian Model Fusion (C-BMF). The key idea is to encode the correlation information for both model template and coefficient magnitude among different knob configurations by using a unified prior distribution. The prior distribution is then combined with a few simulation samples via Bayesian inference to efficiently determine the unknown model coefficients. Two circuit examples designed in a commercial 32nm SOI CMOS process demonstrate that C-BMF achieves more than 2\u00d7 cost reduction over the traditional state-of-the-art modeling technique without surrendering any accuracy.","author":["Fa Wang","Xin Li"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 9","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2897999"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"Semiconductor Industry Associate,","order":1},{"text":"X.

While such devices exist, it is still necessary to address several challenges to make them more practical in terms of area and power dissipation. In this work, we apply Learning Based Compressive Subsampling (LBCS) to tackle the power and area trade-offs in neural wireless devices. To this end, we propose a low-power and area-efficient system for neural signal acquisition which yields state-of-art compression rates up to 64x with high reconstruction quality, as demonstrated on two human iEEG datasets. This new fully digital architecture handles one neural acquisition channel, with an area of 210x210\u03bcm in 90nm CMOS technology, and a power dissipation of only 1\u03bcW.","author":["Cosimo Aprile","Luca Baldassarre","Vipul Gupta","Juhwan Yoo","Mahsa Shoaran","Yusuf Leblebici","Volkan Cevher"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '16: Proceedings of the 26th edition on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2016","Pages   433\u2013438","https://doi.org/10.1145/2902961.2903028"],"date":"18 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, existing hashing methods for CF employ binary code learning procedures that most suffer from the challenging discrete constraints. Hence, those methods generally adopt a two-stage learning scheme composed of relaxed optimization via discarding the discrete constraints, followed by binary quantization. We argue that such a scheme will result in a large quantization loss, which especially compromises the performance of large-scale CF that resorts to longer binary codes. In this paper, we propose a principled CF hashing framework called Discrete Collaborative Filtering (DCF), which directly tackles the challenging discrete optimization that should have been treated adequately in hashing. The formulation of DCF has two advantages: 1) the Hamming similarity induced loss that preserves the intrinsic user-item similarity, and 2) the balanced and uncorrelated code constraints that yield compact yet informative binary codes. We devise a computationally efficient algorithm with a rigorous convergence proof of DCF. Through extensive experiments on several real-world benchmarks, we show that DCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CF hashing techniques, e.g, though using only 8 bits, DCF is even significantly better than other methods using 128 bits.","author":["Hanwang Zhang","Fumin Shen","Wei Liu","Xiangnan He","Huanbo Luan","Tat-Seng Chua"],"issue":["SIGIR '16: Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","July 2016","Pages   325\u2013334","https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2911502"],"date":"07 July 2016","ref":[{"text":"G.

Existing camouflaging techniques have been broken by a recent decamouflaging attack, which uses Boolean satisfiability (SAT) techniques to compute specialized discriminating input patterns that prune the functionality search space quickly. This paper presents CamoPerturb, a countermeasure to thwart the decamouflaging attack by integrating logic perturbation with IC camouflaging. CamoPerturb, contrary to all the existing camouflaging schemes, perturbs the functionality of the given design minimally, i.e., adds/removes one minterm, rather than camouflaging the design. A separate camouflaged block CamoFix restores the perturbed minterm, recovering the functionality of the design. The perturbed minterm is the designer's secret and is incorporated into CamoFix using camouflaged cells. CamoPerturb renders the decamouflaging attack effort exponentially harder in the number of camouflaged gates while its overhead grows linearly. The paper presents formal proofs for the security of CamoPerturb along with experimental results.","author":["Muhammad Yasin","Bodhisatwa Mazumdar","Ozgur Sinanoglu","Jeyavijayan Rajendran"],"issue":["ICCAD '16: Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2016","Article No.: 29","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967012"],"date":"07 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"Alkabani, Y., and Koushanfar, F.

Although the security provisions of Bitcoin have been thoroughly analysed, the security guarantees of variant (forked) PoW blockchains (which were instantiated with different parameters) have not received much attention in the literature. This opens the question whether existing security analysis of Bitcoin's PoW applies to other implementations which have been instantiated with different consensus and/or network parameters. In this paper, we introduce a novel quantitative framework to analyse the security and performance implications of various consensus and network parameters of PoW blockchains. Based on our framework, we devise optimal adversarial strategies for double-spending and selfish mining while taking into account real world constraints such as network propagation, different block sizes, block generation intervals, information propagation mechanism, and the impact of eclipse attacks. Our framework therefore allows us to capture existing PoW-based deployments as well as PoW blockchain variants that are instantiated with different parameters, and to objectively compare the tradeoffs between their performance and security provisions.","author":["Arthur Gervais","Ghassan O.

Reversal distance between permutations \u03c0 and \u03c3is the minimum number of reversals to transform \u03c0 into \u0391. Analysis of genome rearrangements in molecular biology started in the late 1930's, when Dobzhansky  and Sturtevant published a milestone paper presenting a rearrangement scenario with 17 inversions between the species of Drosophilia. Analysis of genomes evolving by inversions leads to a combinatorial problem of sorting by reversals studied in detail recently. We study sorting of signed permutations by reversals, a problem that adequately models rearrangements in a small genomes like chloroplast or mitochondrial DNA. The previously suggested approximation algorithms for sorting signed permutations by reversals compute the reversal distance between permutations with an astonishing accuracy for both simulated and biological data. We prove a duality theorem explaining this intriguing performance and show that there exists a  \u201chidden\u201d parameter that allows one to compute the reversal distance between signed permutations in polynomial time.","author":["Sridhar Hannenhalli","Pavel A.

While published designs easily give an order of magnitude improvement over general-purpose hardware, few look beyond an initial implementation. This paper presents Minerva, a highly automated co-design approach across the algorithm, architecture, and circuit levels to optimize DNN hardware accelerators. Compared to an established fixed-point accelerator baseline, we show that fine-grained, heterogeneous datatype optimization reduces power by 1.5\u00d7; aggressive, inline predication and pruning of small activity values further reduces power by 2.0\u00d7; and active hardware fault detection coupled with domain-aware error mitigation eliminates an additional 2.7\u00d7 through lowering SRAM voltages. Across five datasets, these optimizations provide a collective average of 8.1\u00d7 power reduction over an accelerator baseline without compromising DNN model accuracy. Minerva enables highly accurate, ultra-low power DNN accelerators (in the range of tens of milliwatts), making it feasible to deploy DNNs in power-constrained IoT and mobile devices.","author":["Brandon Reagen","Paul Whatmough","Robert Adolf","Saketh Rama","Hyunkwang Lee","Sae Kyu Lee","Jos\u00e9 Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato","Gu-Yeon Wei","David Brooks"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 44","Issue 3","June 2016","pp   267\u2013278","https://doi.org/10.1145/3007787.3001165"],"date":"18 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"K.

NN techniques are conventionally executed on general-purpose processors (such as CPU and GPGPU), which are usually not energy-efficient since they invest excessive hardware resources to flexibly support various workloads. Consequently, application-specific hardware accelerators for neural networks have been proposed recently to improve the energy-efficiency. However, such accelerators were designed for a small set of NN techniques sharing similar computational patterns, and they adopt complex and informative instructions (control signals) directly corresponding to high-level functional blocks of an NN (such as layers), or even an NN as a whole. Although straightforward and easy-to-implement for a limited set of similar NN techniques, the lack of agility in the instruction set prevents such accelerator designs from supporting a variety of different NN techniques with sufficient flexibility and efficiency.In this paper, we propose a novel domain-specific Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for NN accelerators, called Cambricon, which is a load-store architecture that integrates scalar, vector, matrix, logical, data transfer, and control instructions, based on a comprehensive analysis of existing NN techniques. Our evaluation over a total of ten representative yet distinct NN techniques have demonstrated that Cambricon exhibits strong descriptive capacity over a broad range of NN techniques, and provides higher code density than general-purpose ISAs such as \u00d786, MIPS, and GPGPU. Compared to the latest state-of-the-art NN accelerator design DaDianNao [5] (which can only accommodate 3 types of NN techniques), our Cambricon-based accelerator prototype implemented in TSMC 65nm technology incurs only negligible latency/power/area overheads, with a versatile coverage of 10 different NN benchmarks.","author":["Shaoli Liu","Zidong Du","Jinhua Tao","Dong Han","Tao Luo","Yuan Xie","Yunji Chen","Tianshi Chen"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 44","Issue 3","June 2016","pp   393\u2013405","https://doi.org/10.1145/3007787.3001179"],"date":"18 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"Srimat Chakradhar, Murugan Sankaradas, Venkata Jakkula, and Srihari Cadambi.

However, the long routing time imposes a barrier on FPGA computing, which significantly hinders the design productivity. Existing attempts of parallelizing the FPGA routing either do not fully exploit the parallelism or suffer from an excessive quality loss. Massive parallelism using GPUs has the potential to solve this issue but faces non-trivial challenges. To cope with these challenges, this work presents Corolla, a GPU-accelerated FPGA routing method. Corolla enables applying the GPU-friendly shortest path algorithm in FPGA routing, leveraging the idea of problem size reduction by limiting the search in routing subgraphs. We maintain the convergence after problem size reduction using the dynamic expansion of the routing resource subgraphs. In addition, Corolla explores the fine-grained single-net parallelism and proposes a hybrid approach to combine the static and dynamic parallelism on GPU. To explore the coarse-grained multi-net parallelism, Corolla proposes an effective method to parallelize mutli-net routing while preserving the equivalent routing results as the original single-net routing. Experimental results show that Corolla achieves an average of 18.72x speedup on GPU with a tolerable loss in the routing quality and sustains a scalable speedup on large-scale routing graphs. To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of GPU-accelerated FPGA routing.","author":["Minghua Shen","Guojie Luo"],"issue":["FPGA '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2017","Pages   105\u2013114","https://doi.org/10.1145/3020078.3021732"],"date":"22 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"K.

Across the range of applications, the performance needs vary significantly, from high-throughput image recognition to the very low-latency requirements of autonomous cars. In this context, FPGAs can provide a potential platform that can be optimally configured based on the different performance needs. However, the complexity of ConvNet models keeps increasing leading to a large design space. This work presents fpgaConvNet, an end-to-end framework for mapping ConvNets on FPGAs. The proposed framework employs an automated design methodology based on the Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) paradigm and defines a set of transformations on the SDF graph in order to efficiently explore the architectural design space. By treating high-throughput and latency-critical systems separately, the presented tool is able to efficiently explore the architectural design space and to generate hardware designs from high-level ConvNet specifications, explicitly optimised for the performance metric of interest. Overall our framework yields designs that improve the performance density and the performance efficiency by up to 6\u00d7 and 4.49\u00d7 respectively over existing highly-optimised FPGA, DSP and embedded GPU work.","author":["Stylianos I.

BatchDB achieves good performance, provides a high level of data freshness, and minimizes load interaction between the transactional and analytical engines, thus enabling real time analysis over fresh data under tight SLAs for both OLTP and OLAP workloads. BatchDB relies on primary-secondary replication with dedicated replicas, each optimized for a particular workload type (OLTP, OLAP), and a light-weight propagation of transactional updates. The evaluation shows that for standard TPC-C and TPC-H benchmarks, BatchDB can achieve competitive performance to specialized engines for the corresponding transactional and analytical workloads, while providing a level of performance isolation and predictable runtime for hybrid workload mixes (OLTP+OLAP) otherwise unmet by existing solutions.","author":["Darko Makreshanski","Jana Giceva","Claude Barthels","Gustavo Alonso"],"issue":["SIGMOD '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data","May 2017","Pages   37\u201350","https://doi.org/10.1145/3035918.3035959"],"date":"09 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"J.

But this is historically a difficult task because DBMSs have hundreds of configuration \"knobs\" that control everything in the system, such as the amount of memory to use for caches and how often data is written to storage. The problem with these knobs is that they are not standardized (i.e., two DBMSs use a different name for the same knob), not independent (i.e., changing one knob can impact others), and not universal (i.e., what works for one application may be sub-optimal for another). Worse, information about the effects of the knobs typically comes only from (expensive) experience. To overcome these challenges, we present an automated approach that leverages past experience and collects new information to tune DBMS configurations: we use a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to (1) select the most impactful knobs, (2) map unseen database workloads to previous workloads from which we can transfer experience, and (3) recommend knob settings. We implemented our techniques in a new tool called OtterTune and tested it on two DBMSs. Our evaluation shows that OtterTune recommends configurations that are as good as or better than ones generated by existing tools or a human expert.","author":["Dana Van Aken","Andrew Pavlo","Geoffrey J.

Existing approaches usually assume the completeness of network structure. However, in many real-world networks, the links and node attributes can usually be partially observable. In this paper, we study the problem of Cross View Link Prediction (CVLP) on partially observable networks, where the focus is to recommend nodes with only links to nodes with only attributes (or vice versa). We aim to bridge the information gap by learning a robust consensus for link-based and attribute-based representations so that nodes become comparable in the latent space. Also, the link-based and attribute-based representations can lend strength to each other via this consensus learning. Moreover, attribute selection is performed jointly with the representation learning to alleviate the effect of noisy high-dimensional attributes. We present two instantiations of this framework with different loss functions and develop an alternating optimization framework to solve the problem. Experimental results on four real-world datasets show the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline methods significantly for cross-view link prediction.","author":["Xiaokai Wei","Linchuan Xu","Bokai Cao","Philip S.

For such algorithms, access to the input distribution is limited to obtaining an estimate of the expectation of any given function on a sample drawn randomly from the input distribution rather than directly accessing samples. Most natural algorithms of interest in theory and in practice, for example, moments-based methods, local search, standard iterative methods for convex optimization, MCMC, and simulated annealing, can be implemented in this framework. Our framework is based on, and generalizes, the statistical query model in learning theory [Kearns 1998].Our main application is a nearly optimal lower bound on the complexity of any statistical query algorithm for detecting planted bipartite clique distributions (or planted dense subgraph distributions) when the planted clique has size O(n1/2 \u2212 \u03b4) for any constant \u03b4 > 0. The assumed hardness of variants of these problems has been used to prove hardness of several other problems and as a guarantee for security in cryptographic applications. Our lower bounds provide concrete evidence of hardness, thus supporting these assumptions.","author":["Vitaly Feldman","Elena Grigorescu","Lev Reyzin","Santosh S.

High-radix division is reviewed and inexact computing is introduced at different levels. Design parameters such as number of bits (N) and radix (r) are considered in the analysis; the replacement schemes with inexact cells and truncation schemes of exact cells in the binary signed-digit adder array is introduced. Circuit-level performance and the error characteristics of the inexact high radix dividers are analyzed for the proposed designs. The combined assessment of the normal error distance, power dissipation and delay is investigated and applications of approximate high-radix dividers are treated in detail. The simulation results show that the proposed approximate dividers offer extensive saving in terms of power dissipation, circuit complexity and delay, while only incurring in a small degradation in accuracy thus making them possibly suitable and interesting to some applications and domains such as low power/mobile computing.","author":["Linbin Chen","Fabrizio Lombardi","Paolo Montuschi","Jie Han","Weiqiang Liu"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '17: Proceedings of the on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI 2017","May 2017","Pages   293\u2013298","https://doi.org/10.1145/3060403.3060404"],"date":"10 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"S.

FPGAs have long been adopted for computation acceleration due to its advantages of dedicated hardware design. Hence, FPGAs are a compelling alternative for executing iterative stencil algorithms. However, efficient implementation of iterative stencil algorithms on FPGAs is very challenging due to the data dependencies between iterations and elements in the stencil algorithms, programming hurdle of FPGAs, and large design space. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework that synthesizes iterative stencil algorithms on FPGAs efficiently. We leverage the OpenCL-to-FPGA toolchain to generate accelerator automatically and perform design space exploration at the high level. We propose to bridge the neighboring tiles through pipe and enable data sharing among them to improve computation efficiency. Then, we extend the equal tile size design to a heterogeneous design with different tile size to balance the computation among different tiles. We also develop analytical performance models to explore the complex design space. Experiments using a wide range of stencil applications demonstrate that on average our heterogeneous implementations achieve 1.65X performance speedup but with less hardware resource compared to the state-of-the-art.","author":["Shuo Wang","Yun Liang"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 28","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062185"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"W.

In recent years, the FPGA implementation for CNNs has attracted much attention because of its high performance and energy efficiency. However, existing implementations have difficulty to fully leverage the computation power of the latest FPGAs. In this paper we implement CNN on an FPGA using a systolic array architecture, which can achieve high clock frequency under high resource utilization. We provide an analytical model for performance and resource utilization and develop an automatic design space exploration framework, as well as source-to-source code transformation from a C program to a CNN implementation using systolic array. The experimental results show that our framework is able to generate the accelerator for real-life CNN models, achieving up to 461 GFlops for floating point data type and 1.2 Tops for 8-16 bit fixed point.","author":["Xuechao Wei","Cody Hao Yu","Peng Zhang","Youxiang Chen","Yuxin Wang","Han Hu","Yun Liang","Jason Cong"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 29","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062207"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"S.

Prior work in the area of approximate computing has focused on individual subsystems of a computing system, e.g., the computational subsystem or the memory subsystem. Since they focus only on individual subsystems, these techniques are unable to exploit the large energy-saving opportunities that stem from adopting a full-system perspective and approximating multiple subsystems of a computing platform simultaneously in a coordinated manner. This paper proposes a systematic methodology to perform joint approximations across different subsystems, leading to significant energy benefits compared to approximating individual subsystems in isolation. We use the example of a smart camera system that executes various computer vision and image processing applications to illustrate how the sensing, memory, and processing subsystems can all be approximated synergistically. We have implemented such an approximate smart camera system using an Altera Stratix IV GX FPGA development board, a Terasic TRDB-D5M 5 Megapixel camera module, and a 1GB DDR3 SODIMM module. Experimental results obtained using six application benchmarks demonstrate significant energy savings (around 7.5X on average) for minimal (< 1%) loss in application quality. Compared to approximating a single subsystem, the proposed full-system approximation methodology achieves additional energy benefits of 3.5X - 5.5X on average for minimal (< 1%) quality loss.","author":["Arnab Raha","Vijay Raghunathan"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 74","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062333"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"V.

However, existing usages of RDMA lead to a dilemma between performance and redesign cost. They either directly replace socket-based send/receive primitives with the corresponding RDMA counterpart (server-reply), which only achieves moderate performance improvement; or push performance further by using one-sided RDMA operations to totally bypass the server (server-bypass), at the cost of redesigning the software. In this paper, we introduce two interesting observations about RDMA. First, RDMA has asymmetric performance characteristics, which can be used to improve server-reply's performance. Second, the performance of server-bypass is not as good as expected in many cases, because more rounds of RDMA may be needed if the server is totally bypassed. We therefore introduce a new RDMA paradigm called Remote Fetching Paradigm (RFP). Although RFP requires users to set several parameters to achieve the best performance, it supports the legacy RPC interfaces and hence avoids the need of redesigning application-specific data structures. Moreover, with proper parameters, it can achieve even higher IOPS than that of the previous paradigms. We have designed and implemented an in-memory key-value store based on RFP to evaluate its effectiveness. Experimental results show that RFP improves performance by 1.6\u00d7~4\u00d7 compared with both server-reply and server-bypass paradigms.","author":["Maomeng Su","Mingxing Zhang","Kang Chen","Zhenyu Guo","Yongwei Wu"],"issue":["EuroSys '17: Proceedings of the Twelfth European Conference on Computer Systems","April 2017","Pages   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/3064176.3064189"],"date":"23 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"B.

To address these challenges, we propose GRaph-based Attention Model (GRAM) that supplements electronic health records (EHR) with hierarchical information inherent to medical ontologies. Based on the data volume and the ontology structure, GRAM represents a medical concept as a combination of its ancestors in the ontology via an attention mechanism. We compared predictive performance (i.e. accuracy, data needs, interpretability) of GRAM to various methods including the recurrent neural network (RNN) in two sequential diagnoses prediction tasks and one heart failure prediction task. Compared to the basic RNN, GRAM achieved 10% higher accuracy for predicting diseases rarely observed in the training data and 3% improved area under the ROC curve for predicting heart failure using an order of magnitude less training data. Additionally, unlike other methods, the medical concept representations learned by GRAM are well aligned with the medical ontology. Finally, GRAM exhibits intuitive attention behaviors by adaptively generalizing to higher level concepts when facing data insufficiency at the lower level concepts.","author":["Edward Choi","Mohammad Taha Bahadori","Le Song","Walter F.

Our quantitative, performance-driven design study makes two contributions. First, we show that the QoE achievable for high-quality VR applications on today's mobile hardware and wireless networks via local rendering or offloading is about 10X away from the acceptable QoE, yet waiting for future mobile hardware or next-generation wireless networks (e.g. 5G) is unlikely to help, because of power limitation and the higher CPU utilization needed for processing packets under higher data rate. Second, we present Furion, a VR framework that enables high-quality, immersive mobile VR on today's mobile devices and wireless networks. Furion exploits a key insight about the VR workload that foreground interactions and background environment have contrasting predictability and rendering workload, and employs a split renderer architecture running on both the phone and the server. Supplemented with video compression, use of panoramic frames, and parallel decoding on multiple cores on the phone, we demonstrate Furion can support high-quality VR apps on today's smartphones over WiFi, with under 14ms latency and 60 FPS (the phone display refresh rate).","author":["Zeqi Lai","Y.

Most existing methods, either based on language templates or sequence learning, have treated video as a flat data sequence while ignoring intrinsic multimodality nature. Observing that different modalities (e.g., frame, motion, and audio streams), as well as the elements within each modality, contribute differently to the sentence generation, we present a novel deep framework to boost video captioning by learning Multimodal Attention Long-Short Term Memory networks (MA-LSTM). Our proposed MA-LSTM fully exploits both multimodal streams and temporal attention to selectively focus on specific elements during the sentence generation. Moreover, we design a novel child-sum fusion unit in the MA-LSTM to effectively combine different encoded modalities to the initial decoding states. Different from existing approaches that employ the same LSTM structure for different modalities, we train modality-specific LSTM to capture the intrinsic representations of individual modalities. The experiments on two benchmark datasets (MSVD and MSR-VTT) show that our MA-LSTM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with 52.3 [email\u00a0protected] and 70.4 CIDER-D metrics on MSVD dataset, respectively.","author":["Jun Xu","Ting Yao","Yongdong Zhang","Tao Mei"],"issue":["MM '17: Proceedings of the 25th ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2017","Pages   537\u2013545","https://doi.org/10.1145/3123266.3123448"],"date":"19 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Nicolas Ballas, Li Yao, Chris Pal, and Aaron Courville. 2016.

Typically, hosting companies aim for lower operational costs by targeting high utilization of host machines maintaining just enough machines to meet the demand. In this scenario, frequent virtual machine context switches are common, resulting in increased TLB miss rates (often, by over 5X when contexts are doubled) and subsequent expensive page walks. Since each TLB miss in a virtual environment initiates a 2D page walk, the data caches get filled with a large fraction of page table entries (often, in excess of 50%) thereby evicting potentially more useful data contents. In this work, we propose CSALT - a Context-Switch Aware Large TLB, to address the problem of increased TLB miss rates and their adverse impact on data caches. First, we demonstrate that the CSALT architecture can effectively cope with the demands of increased context switches by its capacity to store a very large number of TLB entries. Next, we show that CSALT mitigates data cache contention caused by conflicts between data and translation entries by employing a novel TLB-Aware Cache Partitioning scheme. On 8-core systems that switch between two virtual machine contexts executing multi-threaded workloads, CSALT achieves an average performance improvement of 85% over a baseline with conventional L1-L2 TLBs and 25% over a baseline which has a large L3 TLB.","author":["Yashwant Marathe","Nagendra Gulur","Jee Ho Ryoo","Shuang Song","Lizy K.

In this paper, we propose an operating system for FPGA, called Feniks, to facilitate large scale FPGA deployment in datacenters. XFeniks provides abstracted interface for FPGA accelerators, so that FPGA developers can get rid of underlying hardware details. In addtion, Feniks also provides (1) development and runtime environment for accelerators to share an FPGA chip in efficient way; (2) direct access to server's resource like storage and coprocessor over PCIe bus; (3) an FPGA resource allocation framework throughout a datacenter. We implemented an initial prototype of Feniks on Catapult Shell and Altera Stratix V FPGA. Our experiements show that device-to-device communication over PCIe is feasible and efficient. A case study shows multiple accelerators can share an FPGA chip independently and efficiently.","author":["Jiansong Zhang","Yongqiang Xiong","Ningyi Xu","Ran Shu","Bojie Li","Peng Cheng","Guo Chen","Thomas Moscibroda"],"issue":["APSys '17: Proceedings of the 8th Asia-Pacific Workshop on Systems","September 2017","Article No.: 22","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.1145/3124680.3124743"],"date":"02 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"2016.

These Q&A contents cover a wide range of topics, and they are useful for users to resolve queries and obtain new knowledge. Meanwhile, when people are reading digital documents, they may encounter reading problems such as lack of background information and unclear illustration of concepts. We believe that Q&A sites offer high-quality contents which can serve as rich supplements to digital documents. In this paper, we devise a rigorous formulation of the novel text enrichment problem, and design an end-to-end system named QALink which assigns the most relevant Q&A contents to the corresponding section of the document. We first present a new segmentation approach to model each document with a hierarchical structure. Based on the hierarchy, queries are constructed to retrieve and rank related question-answer pairs. Both syntactical and semantic features are adopted in our system. The empirical evaluation results indicate that QALink is able to effectively enrich text documents with relevant Q&A contents to help people better understand the documents.","author":["Yixuan Tang","Weilong Huang","Qi Liu","Anthony K.H.

We introduce a verification methodology based on a trusted abstract platform (TAP), a formalization of idealized enclave platforms along with a parameterized adversary. We also formalize the notion of secure remote execution and present machine-checked proofs showing that the TAP satisfies the three key security properties that entail secure remote execution: integrity, confidentiality and secure measurement. We then present machine-checked proofs showing that SGX and Sanctum are refinements of the TAP under certain parameterizations of the adversary, demonstrating that these systems implement secure enclaves for the stated adversary models.","author":["Pramod Subramanyan","Rohit Sinha","Ilia Lebedev","Srinivas Devadas","Sanjit A.

Because RNNs are fully connected, they require a large number of weight memory accesses, leading to high power consumption. Recent theory has shown that an RNN delta network update approach can reduce memory access and computes with negligible accuracy loss. This paper describes the implementation of this theoretical approach in a hardware accelerator called \"DeltaRNN\" (DRNN). The DRNN updates the output of a neuron only when the neuron\u00bbs activation changes by more than a delta threshold. It was implemented on a Xilinx Zynq-7100 FPGA. FPGA measurement results from a single-layer RNN of 256 Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neurons show that the DRNN achieves 1.2 TOp/s effective throughput and 164 GOp/s/W power efficiency. The delta update leads to a 5.7x speedup compared to a conventional RNN update because of the sparsity created by the DN algorithm and the zero-skipping ability of DRNN.","author":["Chang Gao","Daniel Neil","Enea Ceolini","Shih-Chii Liu","Tobi Delbruck"],"issue":["FPGA '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2018","Pages   21\u201330","https://doi.org/10.1145/3174243.3174261"],"date":"15 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"A.

Due to the increasing diversity of loop-intensive applications and to the complex memory/computation hierarchies in modern processors, optimization heuristics are pulled towards conflicting goals, highlighting the lack of a systematic approach to optimizing locality and parallelism. Acknowledging these conflicting demands on loop nest optimization, we propose an algorithmic template capable of modeling the multi-level parallelism and the temporal/spatial locality of multiprocessors and accelerators. This algorithmic template orchestrates a collection of parameterizable, linear optimization problems over a polyhedral space of semantics-preserving transformations. While the overall problem is not convex, effective algorithms can be derived from this template delivering unprecedented performance portability over GPU and multicore CPU. We discuss the rationale for this algorithmic template and validate it on representative computational kernels/benchmarks.","author":["Oleksandr Zinenko","Sven Verdoolaege","Chandan Reddy","Jun Shirako","Tobias Grosser","Vivek Sarkar","Albert Cohen"],"issue":["CC 2018: Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Compiler Construction","February 2018","Pages   3\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178372.3179507"],"date":"24 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"John R.

Inevitably, this high increase in processing elements combined with the unpredictable resource requirements of executed applications at design time impose new design constraints to resource management of many-core systems, turning the distributed functionality into a necessity. In this work, we present a distributed runtime resource management framework for many-core systems utilizing a network-on-chip (NoC) infrastructure. Specifically, we couple the concept of distributed management with parallel applications by assigning different roles to the available computing resources. The presented design is based on the idea of local controllers and managers, whereas an on-chip intercommunication scheme ensures decision distribution. The evaluation of the proposed framework was performed on an Intel Single-Chip Cloud Computer, an actual NoC-based, many-core system. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme manages to allocate resources efficiently at runtime, leading to gains of up to 30% in application execution latency compared to relevant state-of-the-art distributed resource management frameworks.","author":["Vasileios Tsoutsouras","Iraklis Anagnostopoulos","Dimosthenis Masouros","Dimitrios Soudris"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 17","Issue 3","June 2018","Article No.: 65","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/3182173"],"date":"23 April 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque, Rudolf Krist, and J\u00f3rg Henkel. 2008.

Both the original VPR area model and the new COFFE area model are compared against the actual layouts with up to three metal layers for the various FPGA building blocks. We found that both models have significant variations with respect to the accuracy of their predictions across the building blocks. In particular, the original VPR model overestimates the layout area of larger buffers, full adders, and multiplexers by as much as 38%, while they underestimate the layout area of smaller buffers and multiplexers by as much as 58%, for an overall prediction error variation of 96%. The newer COFFE model also significantly overestimates the layout area of full adders by 13% and underestimates the layout area of multiplexers by a maximum of 60% for a prediction error variation of 73%. Such variations are particularly significant considering sensitivity analyses are not routinely performed in FPGA architectural studies. Our results suggest that such analyses are extremely important in studies that employ the minimum-width area models so the tolerance of the architectural conclusions against the prediction error variations can be quantified. Furthermore, an open-source version of the layouts of the actual FPGA building blocks should be created so their actual layout area can be used to achieve a highly accurate ranking of the implementation area of FPGA architectures built upon these layouts.","author":["Farheen Fatima Khan","Andy Ye"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 11","Issue 1","March 2018","Article No.: 8","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3182394"],"date":"14 March 2018","ref":[{"text":"Vaughn Betz and Jonathan Rose. 1998.

Unfortunately, these technology advances significantly degrade flash's reliability due to a smaller cell geometry and a finer-grained cell state control. In this paper, we propose a state-aware reliability optimization technique SARO), new flash optimization that improves the flash reliability under diverse scaling and multi-leveling schemes. To this end, we first reveal that reliability-related flash errors are highly skewed among flash cell states, which was not captured by prior studies. The proposed SARO exploits then the different per-state error behavior in flash cell states by selecting the most error-prone flash states (for each error type) and by forming narrow threshold voltage distributions(for the selected states only). Furthermore, SARO is applied only when the program time gets shorter because of flash cell aging, thereby keeping the program latency unchanged. Our experimental results with real MLC and TLC flash devices show that SARO can reduce a significant number of flash bit errors, which can in turn reduce the read latency by 40%, on average.","author":["Myungsuk Kim","Youngsun Song","Myoungsoo Jung","Jihong Kim"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '18: Proceedings of the 2018 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2018","Pages   255\u2013260","https://doi.org/10.1145/3194554.3194591"],"date":"30 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"Y.

In this work, we propose AtomLayer---a universal ReRAM-based accelerator to support both efficient CNN training and inference. AtomLayer uses the atomic layer computation which processes only one network layer each time to eliminate the pipeline related issues such as long latency, pipeline bubbles and large on-chip buffer overhead. For further optimization, we use a unique filter mapping and a data reuse system to minimize the cost of layer switching and DRAM access. Our experimental results show that AtomLayer can achieve higher power efficiency than ISSAC in inference (1.1\u00d7) and PipeLayer in training (1.6\u00d7), respectively, meanwhile reducing the footprint by 15\u00d7.","author":["Ximing Qiao","Xiong Cao","Huanrui Yang","Linghao Song","Hai Li"],"issue":["DAC '18: Proceedings of the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2018","Article No.: 103","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3195998"],"date":"24 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Ali Shafiee et al.

The biggest challenge in executing DNNs is their extremely data-extensive computations. The computing efficiency in speed and energy is constrained when traditional computing platforms are employed in such computational hungry executions. Spiking neuromorphic computing (SNC) has been widely investigated in deep networks implementation own to their high efficiency in computation and communication. However, weights and signals of DNNs are required to be quantized when deploying the DNNs on the SNC, which results in unacceptable accuracy loss. Previous works mainly focus on weights discretize while inter-layer signals are mainly neglected. In this work, we propose to represent DNNs with fixed integer inter-layer signals and fixed-point weights while holding good accuracy. We implement the proposed DNNs on the memristor-based SNC system as a deployment example. With 4-bit data representation, our results show that the accuracy loss can be controlled within 0.02% (2.3%) on MNIST (CIFAR-10). Compared with the 8-bit dynamic fixed-point DNNs, our system can achieve more than 9.8\u00d7 speedup, 89.1% energy saving, and 30% area saving.","author":["Fuqiang Liu","Chenchen Liu"],"issue":["DAC '18: Proceedings of the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2018","Article No.: 104","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3196131"],"date":"24 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"A.

To exploit the benefits of the vertical dimension of 3D integration, through-silicon-via (TSV) has been predominantly used in state-of-the-art manycore chip design. However, for TSV-based systems, high power density and the resultant thermal hotspot remain major concerns from the perspectives of chip functionality and overall reliability. The power consumption and thermal profiles of 3D NoCs can be improved by incorporating a Voltage-Frequency-Island (VFI)-based power management strategy. However, due to inherent thermal constraints of a TSV-based 3D system, we are unable to fully exploit the benefits offered by the power management methodology. In this context, emergence of monolithic 3D (M3D) integration has opened up new possibility of designing ultra-low-power and high-performance circuits and systems. The smaller dimensions of the inter-layer dielectric (ILD) and monolithic inter-tier vias (MIVs) offer high-density integration, flexibility of partitioning logic blocks across multiple tiers, and significant reduction of total wire-length. In this work, we present the first-ever study of the performance-thermal tradeoffs for energy efficient monolithic 3D manycore chips. In particular, we present a comparative performance evaluation of M3D NoCs with respect to their conventional TSV-based counterparts. We demonstrate that the proposed M3D-based NoC architecture incorporating VFI-based power management achieves a maximum of 29.4% lower energy-delay-product (EDP) compared to the TSV-based designs for a large set of benchmarks. We also demonstrate that the M3D-based NoC shows up to 29.1% lower maximum temperature than the TSV-based counterpart for these benchmarks.","author":["Dongjin Lee","Sourav Das","Janardhan Rao Doppa","Partha Pratim Pande","Krishnendu Chakrabarty"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 23","Issue 5","October 2018","Article No.: 60","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/3223046"],"date":"22 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"P.

This allows 3D NAND flash memory to increase storage density using a much less aggressive manufacturing process technology than planar NAND flash memory. The circuit-level and structural changes in 3D NAND flash memory significantly alter how different error sources affect the reliability of the memory. In this paper, through experimental characterization of real, state-of-the-art 3D NAND flash memory chips, we find that 3D NAND flash memory exhibits three new error sources that were not previously observed in planar NAND flash memory: (1) layer-to-layer process variation, a new phenomenon specific to the 3D nature of the device, where the average error rate of each 3D-stacked layer in a chip is significantly different; (2) early retention loss, a new phenomenon where the number of errors due to charge leakage increases quickly within several hours after programming; and (3) retention interference, a new phenomenon where the rate at which charge leaks from a flash cell is dependent on the data value stored in the neighboring cell. Based on our experimental results, we develop new analytical models of layer-to-layer process variation and retention loss in 3D NAND flash memory. Motivated by our new findings and models, we develop four new techniques to mitigate process variation and early retention loss in 3D NAND flash memory. Our first technique, Layer Variation Aware Reading (LaVAR), reduces the effect of layer-to-layer process variation by fine-tuning the read reference voltage separately for each layer. Our second technique, Layer-Interleaved Redundant Array of Independent Disks (LI-RAID), uses information about layer-to-layer process variation to intelligently group pages under the RAID error recovery technique in a manner that reduces the likelihood that the recovery of a group fails significantly earlier than the recovery of other groups. Our third technique, Retention Model Aware Reading (ReMAR), reduces retention errors in 3D NAND flash memory by tracking the retention time of the data using our new retention model and adapting the read reference voltage to data age. Our fourth technique, Retention Interference Aware Neighbor-Cell Assisted Correction (ReNAC), adapts the read reference voltage to the amount of retention interference a page has experienced, in order to re-read the data after a read operation fails. These four techniques are complementary, and can be combined together to significantly improve flash memory reliability. Compared to a state-of-the-art baseline, our techniques, when combined, improve flash memory lifetime by 1.85\u00d7. Alternatively, if a NAND flash vendor wants to keep the lifetime of the 3D NAND flash memory device constant, our techniques reduce the storage overhead required to hold error correction information by 78.9%.","author":["Yixin Luo","Saugata Ghose","Yu Cai","Erich F.

It provides exceptionally low latency, especially for workloads with a high volume of very short messages, and it also supports large messages and high network utilization. Homa uses in-network priority queues to ensure low latency for short messages; priority allocation is managed dynamically by each receiver and integrated with a receiver-driven flow control mechanism. Homa also uses controlled overcommitment of receiver downlinks to ensure efficient bandwidth utilization at high load. Our implementation of Homa delivers 99th percentile round-trip times less than 15 \u03bcs for short messages on a 10 Gbps network running at 80% load. These latencies are almost 100x lower than the best published measurements of an implementation. In simulations, Homa's latency is roughly equal to pFabric and significantly better than pHost, PIAS, and NDP for almost all message sizes and workloads. Homa can also sustain higher network loads than pFabric, pHost, or PIAS.","author":["Behnam Montazeri","Yilong Li","Mohammad Alizadeh","John Ousterhout"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '18: Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication","August 2018","Pages   221\u2013235","https://doi.org/10.1145/3230543.3230564"],"date":"07 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"M.

With the wide-spread usage of DL in critical and time-sensitive applications, including unmanned vehicles, drones, and video surveillance systems, online detection of malicious inputs is of utmost importance. We propose DeepFense, the first end-to-end automated framework that simultaneously enables efficient and safe execution of DL models. DeepFense formalizes the goal of thwarting adversarial attacks as an optimization problem that minimizes the rarely observed regions in the latent feature space spanned by a DL network. To solve the aforementioned minimization problem, a set of complementary but disjoint modular redundancies are trained to validate the legitimacy of the input samples in parallel with the victim DL model. DeepFense leverages hardware/software/algorithm co-design and customized acceleration to achieve just-in-time performance in resource-constrained settings. The proposed countermeasure is unsupervised, meaning that no adversarial sample is leveraged to train modular redundancies. We further provide an accompanying API to reduce the non-recurring engineering cost and ensure automated adaptation to various platforms. Extensive evaluations on FPGAs and GPUs demonstrate up to two orders of magnitude performance improvement while enabling online adversarial sample detection.","author":["Bita Darvish Rouhani","Mohammad Samragh","Mojan Javaheripi","Tara Javidi","Farinaz Koushanfar"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 134","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240791"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"P.

These processors could easily lose half or more of their performance in the memory hierarchy if the hierarchy design is based on conventional caching techniques. This paper presents hardware techniques to improve the performance of caches.Miss caching places a small fully-associative cache between a cache and its refill path. Misses in the cache that hit in the miss cache have only a one cycle miss penalty, as opposed to a many cycle miss penalty without the miss cache. Small miss caches of 2 to 5 entries are shown to be very effective in removing mapping conflict misses in first-level direct-mapped caches.Victim caching is an improvement to miss caching that loads the small fully-associative cache with the victim of a miss and not the requested line. Small victim caches of 1 to 5 entries are even more effective at removing conflict misses than miss caching.Stream buffers prefetch cache lines starting at a cache miss address. The prefetched data is placed in the buffer and not in the cache. Stream buffers are useful in removing capacity and compulsory cache misses, as well as some instruction cache conflict misses. Stream buffers are more effective than previously investigated prefetch techniques at using the next slower level in the memory hierarchy when it is pipelined. An extension to the basic stream buffer, called multi-way stream buffers, is introduced. Multi-way stream buffers are useful for prefetching along multiple intertwined data reference streams.Together, victim caches and stream buffers reduce the miss rate of the first level in the cache hierarchy by a factor of two to three on a set of six large benchmarks.","author":["Norman P.

In this work, we propose Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity-based unsupervised feature learning using convolution-over-time in Spiking Neural Network (SNN). We use shared weight kernels that are convolved with the input patterns over time to encode representative input features, thereby improving the sparsity as well as the robustness of the learning model. We show that the Convolutional SNN self-learns several visual categories for object recognition with limited number of training patterns while yielding comparable classification accuracy relative to the fully connected SNN. Further, we quantify the energy benefits of the Convolutional SNN over fully connected SNN on neuromorphic hardware implementation.","author":["Gopalakrishnan Srinivasan","Priyadarshini Panda","Kaushik Roy"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 14","Issue 4","December 2018","Article No.: 44","pp   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/3266229"],"date":"27 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"Guo-qiang Bi and Mu-ming Poo. 1998.

Despite such attractiveness, neural text classification models suffer from the lack of training data in many real-world applications. Although many semi-supervised and weakly-supervised text classification models exist, they cannot be easily applied to deep neural models and meanwhile support limited supervision types. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised method that addresses the lack of training data in neural text classification. Our method consists of two modules: (1) a pseudo-document generator that leverages seed information to generate pseudo-labeled documents for model pre-training, and (2) a self-training module that bootstraps on real unlabeled data for model refinement. Our method has the flexibility to handle different types of weak supervision and can be easily integrated into existing deep neural models for text classification. We have performed extensive experiments on three real-world datasets from different domains. The results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves inspiring performance without requiring excessive training data and outperforms baseline methods significantly.","author":["Yu Meng","Jiaming Shen","Chao Zhang","Jiawei Han"],"issue":["CIKM '18: Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2018","Pages   983\u2013992","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271737"],"date":"17 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

Crossover interactions -- bi-directional effects between entities and relations --- help select related information when predicting a new triple, but haven't been formally discussed before. In this paper, we propose CrossE, a novel knowledge graph embedding which explicitly simulates crossover interactions. It not only learns one general embedding for each entity and relation as most previous methods do, but also generates multiple triple specific embeddings for both of them, named interaction embeddings. We evaluate embeddings on typical link prediction tasks and find that CrossE achieves state-of-the-art results on complex and more challenging datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate embeddings from a new perspective -- giving explanations for predicted triples, which is important for real applications. In this work, an explanation for a triple is regarded as a reliable closed-path between the head and the tail entity. Compared to other baselines, we show experimentally that CrossE, benefiting from interaction embeddings, is more capable of generating reliable explanations to support its predictions.","author":["Wen Zhang","Bibek Paudel","Wei Zhang","Abraham Bernstein","Huajun Chen"],"issue":["WSDM '19: Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","January 2019","Pages   96\u2013104","https://doi.org/10.1145/3289600.3291014"],"date":"30 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Kurt D.

In this paper, we present a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of the LDPC decoder using High-Level Synthesis (HLS). Because HLS can synthesize a hardware implementation from a high-level description, it is very effective in reducing design time, and in exploring various design alternatives. One of the biggest advantages of FPGAs is flexibility, and therefore, HLS for FPGAs is widely adopted as a good hardware synthesis method. In this paper, we describe an LDPC decoder in high level language, and a HLS tool called SDSoC is used to synthesize the decoder. The proposed design is a serial LDPC decoder that requires smaller amount on hardware resource and power consumption than the conventional design. The major drawback of a serial decoder is slow speed. To overcome such drawback, optimization techniques such as array partitioning, loop unrolling, pipelining methods and fixed-point conversion are applied. With the application of these techniques, the decoding speed of the proposed implementation is 8.11 times and 2.79 times faster than that of a non-optimized implementation and that of a software-based LDPC decoder, respectively.","author":["Geon Choi","Kyeong-Bin Park","Ki-Seok Chung"],"issue":["ICCIP '18: Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Communication and Information Processing","November 2018","Pages   256\u2013259","https://doi.org/10.1145/3290420.3290441"],"date":"02 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"Gallager, R.

Our device is based on a recent exploit that leverages the fact that when exposed to ultrasonic noise, commodity microphones will leak the noise into the audible range. Unfortunately, ultrasonic jammers are built from multiple transducers and therefore exhibit blind spots, i.e., locations in which transducers destructively interfere and where a microphone cannot be jammed. To solve this, our device exploits a synergy between ultrasonic jamming and the naturally occur- ring movements that users induce on their wearable devices (e.g., bracelets) as they gesture or walk. We demonstrate that these movements can blur jamming blind spots and increase jamming coverage. Moreover, current jammers are also directional, requiring users to point the jammer to a microphone; instead, our wearable bracelet is built in a ring-layout that al- lows it to jam in multiple directions. This is beneficial in that it allows our jammer to protect against microphones hidden out of sight. We evaluated our jammer in a series of experiments and found that: (1) it jams in all directions, e.g., our device jams over 87% of the words uttered around it in any direction, while existing devices jam only 30% when not pointed directly at the microphone; (2) it exhibits significantly less blind spots; and, (3) our device induced a feeling of privacy to participants of our user study. We believe our wearable provides stronger privacy in a world in which most devices are constantly eavesdropping on our conversations.","author":["Yuxin Chen","Huiying Li","Shan-Yuan Teng","Steven Nagels","Zhijing Li","Pedro Lopes","Ben Y.

This approach avoids expensive communication between IoT devices and the cloud, thereby enabling energy-efficient real-time analytics. However, ML models are expressed typically in floating-point, and IoT hardware typically does not support floating-point. Therefore, running these models on IoT devices requires simulating IEEE-754 floating-point using software, which is very inefficient.  We present SeeDot, a domain-specific language to express ML inference algorithms and a compiler that compiles SeeDot programs to fixed-point code that can efficiently run on constrained IoT devices. We propose 1)\u00a0a novel compilation strategy that reduces the search space for some key parameters used in the fixed-point code, and 2)\u00a0new efficient implementations of expensive operations. SeeDot compiles state-of-the-art KB-sized models to various microcontrollers and low-end FPGAs. We show that SeeDot outperforms 1) software emulation of floating-point (Arduino), 2) high-bitwidth fixed-point (MATLAB), 3) post-training quantization (TensorFlow-Lite), and 4) floating- and fixed-point FPGA implementations generated using high-level synthesis tools.","author":["Sridhar Gopinath","Nikhil Ghanathe","Vivek Seshadri","Rahul Sharma"],"issue":["PLDI 2019: Proceedings of the 40th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation","June 2019","Pages   79\u201395","https://doi.org/10.1145/3314221.3314597"],"date":"08 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"S.

Conventional simulation methods suffer from a tremendous computational cost for achieving high accuracy. Recently, machine learning was introduced to trade off between accuracy and runtime through speeding up the resist modeling stage of the simulation flow. In this work, we propose LithoGAN, an end-to-end lithography modeling framework based on a generative adversarial network (GAN), to map the input mask patterns directly to the output resist patterns. Our experimental results show that LithoGAN can predict resist patterns with high accuracy while achieving orders of magnitude speedup compared to conventional lithography simulation and previous machine learning based approach.","author":["Wei Ye","Mohamed Baker Alawieh","Yibo Lin","David Z.

Row-hammering is one of these problems. The row-hammering effect is a critical issue for reliable memory operation because it can cause some unexpected errors. Hence, it is necessary to address this problem. Mainly, there are two different methods to deal with the row-hammering problem. One is a counter based method, and the other is a probabilistic method. This paper proposes the improved version of the latter method and compares it with other probabilistic methods, PARA and PRoHIT. According to the evaluation results, comparing the proposed method with conventional ones, the proposed one has increased row-hammering reduction per refresh 1.82 and 7.78 times against PARA and PRoHIT in average, respectively.","author":["Jung Min You","Joon-Sung Yang"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 19","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317866"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"A.

This property can be leveraged to improve the energy-efficiency of IoT-Edge (wearables) through the emerging trend of approximate computing. This paper presents XBioSiP, a novel methodology for approximate bio-signal processing that employs two quality evaluation stages, during the pre-processing and bio-signal processing stages, to determine the approximation parameters. It thereby achieves high energy savings while satisfying the user-determined quality constraint. Our methodology achieves, up to 19\u00d7 and 22\u00d7 reduction in the energy consumption of a QRS peak detection algorithm for 0% and < 1% loss in peak detection accuracy, respectively.","author":["Bharath Srinivas Prabakaran","Semeen Rehman","Muhammad Shafique"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 184","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317933"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"Woongki Baek et al. 2010.

The open-source flow incorporates a compatible open-source set of tools that span logic synthesis, floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, global routing and detailed routing. The flow also incorporates analysis and support tools for static timing analysis, parasitic extraction, power integrity analysis, and cloud deployment.

Our aim is to use this information to determine in advance potential targets for hoaxes and fake news. In this article, we introduce a framework for promptly identifying polarizing content on social media and, thus, \u201cpredicting\u201d future fake news topics. We validate the performances of the proposed methodology on a massive Italian Facebook dataset, showing that we are able to identify topics that are susceptible to misinformation with 77% accuracy. Moreover, such information may be embedded as a new feature in an additional classifier able to recognize fake news with 91% accuracy. The novelty of our approach consists in taking into account a series of characteristics related to users\u2019 behavior on online social media such as Facebook, making a first, important step towards the mitigation of misinformation phenomena by supporting the identification of potential misinformation targets and thus the design of tailored counter-narratives.","author":["Michela Del Vicario","Walter Quattrociocchi","Antonio Scala","Fabiana Zollo"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on the Web","Volume 13","Issue 2","April 2019","Article No.: 10","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316809"],"date":"27 March 2019","ref":[{"text":"Statista. 2018.

Unlike most existing approaches that only focus on leveraging knowledge graphs for more accurate recommendation, we aim to conduct explicit reasoning with knowledge for decision making so that the recommendations are generated and supported by an interpretable causal inference procedure. To this end, we propose a method called Policy-Guided Path Reasoning (PGPR), which couples recommendation and interpretability by providing actual paths in a knowledge graph. Our contributions include four aspects. We first highlight the significance of incorporating knowledge graphs into recommendation to formally define and interpret the reasoning process. Second, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach featured by an innovative soft reward strategy, user-conditional action pruning and a multi-hop scoring function. Third, we design a policy-guided graph search algorithm to efficiently and effectively sample reasoning paths for recommendation. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method on several large-scale real-world benchmark datasets, obtaining favorable results compared with state-of-the-art methods.","author":["Yikun Xian","Zuohui Fu","S.

It overlaps the host-to-device memory copy with host computation or CUDA kernel computation by exploiting Unified Memory and fault mechanisms. HUM provides wrapper functions of CUDA commands and executes host-to-device memory copy commands in an asynchronous manner. We also propose two runtime techniques. One checks if it is correct to make the synchronous host-to-device memory copy command asynchronous. If not, HUM makes the host computation or the kernel computation wait until the memory copy completes. The other subdivides consecutive host-to-device memory copy commands into smaller memory copy requests and schedules the requests from different commands in a round-robin manner. As a result, the kernel execution can be scheduled as early as possible to maximize the overlap. We evaluate HUM using 51 applications from Parboil, Rodinia, and CUDA Code Samples and compare their performance under HUM with that of hand-optimized implementations. The evaluation result shows that executing the applications under HUM is, on average, 1.21 times faster than executing them under original CUDA. The speedup is comparable to the average speedup 1.22 of the hand-optimized implementations for Unified Memory.","author":["Jaehoon Jung","Daeyoung Park","Youngdong Do","Jungho Park","Jaejin Lee"],"issue":["PPoPP '20: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming","February 2020","Pages   321\u2013335","https://doi.org/10.1145/3332466.3374531"],"date":"19 February 2020","ref":[{"text":"Ammar Ahmad Awan, Ching-Hsiang Chu, Hari Subramoni, Xiaoyi Lu, and Dhabaleswar K.

As a proof-of-concept, it presents an extension of the [email\u00a0protected] toolchain that allows the tasks offloaded into the FPGA to create and synchronize nested tasks on their own without involving the host. Those FPGA spawned tasks may target the host to execute code not suitable for the FPGA, like system calls or I/O operations; or target other kernel accelerators inside the same FPGA. In addition to the programmability benefits of this new feature, the proposed system presents significant performance improvements and a better productivity over the classical master-slave approach.","author":["Jaume Bosch","Miquel Vidal","Antonio Filgueras","Carlos \u00c1lvarez","Daniel Jim\u00e9nez-Gonz\u00e1lez","Xavier Martorell","Eduard Ayguad\u00e9"],"issue":["PPoPP '20: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming","February 2020","Pages   419\u2013420","https://doi.org/10.1145/3332466.3374545"],"date":"19 February 2020","ref":[{"text":"Jaume Bosch, Xubin Tan, Antonio Filgueras, Miquel Vidal, Marc Mateu, Daniel Jim\u00e9nez-Gonz\u00e1lez, Carlos \u00c1lvarez, Xavier Martorell, Eduard Ayguad\u00e9, and Jes\u00fas Labarta. 2018.

Developers mainly rely on libraries and tools to add deep learning capabilities to their software. What kinds of bugs are frequently found in such software? What are the root causes of such bugs? What impacts do such bugs have? Which stages of deep learning pipeline are more bug prone? Are there any antipatterns? Understanding such characteristics of bugs in deep learning software has the potential to foster the development of better deep learning platforms, debugging mechanisms, development practices, and encourage the development of analysis and verification frameworks. Therefore, we study 2716 high-quality posts from Stack Overflow and 500 bug fix commits from Github about five popular deep learning libraries Caffe, Keras, Tensorflow, Theano, and Torch to understand the types of bugs, root causes of bugs, impacts of bugs, bug-prone stage of deep learning pipeline as well as whether there are some common antipatterns found in this buggy software. The key findings of our study include: data bug and logic bug are the most severe bug types in deep learning software appearing more than 48% of the times, major root causes of these bugs are Incorrect Model Parameter (IPS) and Structural Inefficiency (SI) showing up more than 43% of the times.We have also found that the bugs in the usage of deep learning libraries have some common antipatterns.","author":["Md Johirul Islam","Giang Nguyen","Rangeet Pan","Hridesh Rajan"],"issue":["ESEC/FSE 2019: Proceedings of the 2019 27th ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering","August 2019","Pages   510\u2013520","https://doi.org/10.1145/3338906.3338955"],"date":"12 August 2019","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, et al. 2016.

Then, the tools are applied in datasets built based on contracts that contain personally identifiable information. The results show that models' performance was highly positive in accurately classifying both the generic and the contracts' data.

This data is best exploited infavailable as arelational table that we could use for answering precise queries or running data mining tasks.We explore a technique for extracting such tables from document collections that requires only a handful of training examples from users. These examples are used to generate extraction patterns, that in turn result in new tuples being extracted from the document collection.We build on this idea and present our Snowball system. Snowball introduces novel strategies for generating patterns and extracting tuples from plain-text documents.At each iteration of the extraction process, Snowball evaluates the quality of these patterns and tuples without human intervention,and keeps only the most reliable ones for the next iteration. In this paper we also develop a scalable evaluation methodology and metrics for our task, and present a thorough experimental evaluation of   Snowball and comparable techniques over a collection of more than 300,000 newspaper documents.","author":["Eugene Agichtein","Luis Gravano"],"issue":["DL '00: Proceedings of the fifth ACM conference on Digital libraries","June 2000","Pages   85\u201394","https://doi.org/10.1145/336597.336644"],"date":"01 June 2000","ref":[{"text":"Proceedings of the Sixth Message Understanding Conference.

Recently, deep clustering, which derives inspiration primarily from deep learning approaches, achieves state-of-the-art performance and has attracted considerable attention. Current deep clustering methods usually boost the clustering results by means of the powerful representation ability of deep learning, e.g., autoencoder, suggesting that learning an effective representation for clustering is a crucial requirement. The strength of deep clustering methods is to extract the useful representations from the data itself, rather than the structure of data, which receives scarce attention in representation learning. Motivated by the great success of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) in encoding the graph structure, we propose a Structural Deep Clustering Network (SDCN) to integrate the structural information into deep clustering. Specifically, we design a delivery operator to transfer the representations learned by autoencoder to the corresponding GCN layer, and a dual self-supervised mechanism to unify these two different deep neural architectures and guide the update of the whole model. In this way, the multiple structures of data, from low-order to high-order, are naturally combined with the multiple representations learned by autoencoder. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the delivery operator, i.e., with the delivery operator, GCN improves the autoencoder-specific representation as a high-order graph regularization constraint and autoencoder helps alleviate the over-smoothing problem in GCN. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our propose model can consistently perform better over the state-of-the-art techniques.","author":["Deyu Bo","Xiao Wang","Chuan Shi","Meiqi Zhu","Emiao Lu","Peng Cui"],"issue":["WWW '20: Proceedings of The Web Conference 2020","April 2020","Pages   1400\u20131410","https://doi.org/10.1145/3366423.3380214"],"date":"20 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"Charu\u00a0C Aggarwal and ChengXiang Zhai. 2012.

Motivated by the problem of sealing an object using minimal resources, we show how a particle system can self-organize to form an object's convex hull. We give a distributed, local algorithm for convex hull formation and prove that it runs in O(B) asynchronous rounds, where B is the length of the object's boundary. Within the same asymptotic runtime, this algorithm can be extended to also form the object's (weak) O-hull, which uses the same number of particles but minimizes the area enclosed by the hull. Our algorithms are the first to compute convex hulls with distributed entities that have strictly local sensing, constant-size memory, and no shared sense of orientation or coordinates. Ours is also the first distributed approach to computing restricted-orientation convex hulls. This approach involves coordinating particles as distributed memory; thus, as a supporting but independent result, we present and analyze an algorithm for organizing particles with constant-size memory as distributed binary counters that efficiently support increments, decrements, and zero-tests --- even as the particles move.","author":["Joshua J.

Combinatorial optimization problems are notoriously challenging to exactly solve due to the NP-hardness. Scientists have long discovered that numerically simulating classical nonlinear Hamiltonian systems can effectively solve many well-known combinatorial optimization problems. However, such physical simulation typically requires a massive amount of computation, which even outstrips the logic capability of modern reconfigurable digital fabrics. In this work, we proposed an FPGA-based general combinatorial optimization problem solver which achieved ultra-high performance and scalability. Specifically, we first reformulated a broad range of combinatorial optimization problems with a general graph-based data structure called the Ising model. Second, instead of utilizing classical simulated annealing to find an approximate solution, we utilized a new heuristic algorithm, simulated bifurcation, to search for solutions.

However, designing DNN chips is non-trivial because: (1) mainstream DNNs have millions of parameters and billions of operations; (2) the design space is large due to numerous design choices of dataflows, processing elements, memory hierarchy, etc.; and (3) there is an algorithm/hardware co-design need for the same DNN functionality to have a different decomposition that would require different hardware IPs and thus correspond to dramatically different performance/energy/area tradeoffs. Therefore, DNN chips often take months to years to design and require a large team of cross-disciplinary experts. To enable fast and effective DNN chip design, we propose AutoDNNchip - a DNN chip generator that can automatically produce both FPGA- and ASIC-based DNN chip implementation (i.e., synthesizable RTL code with optimized algorithm-to-hardware mapping) from DNNs developed by machine learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch) for a designated application and dataset without humans in the loop. Specifically, AutoDNNchip consists of 2 integrated enablers: (1) a Chip Predictor, which can accurately and efficiently predict a DNN accelerator's energy, throughput, latency, and area based on the DNN model parameters, hardware configurations, technology-based IPs, and platform constraints; and (2) a Chip Builder, which can automatically explore the design space of DNN chips (including IP selections, block configurations, resource balancing, etc.), optimize chip designs via the Chip Predictor, and then generate synthesizable RTL code with optimized dataflows to achieve the target design metrics. Experimental results show that our Chip Predictor's predicted performance differs from real-measured ones by <10% when validated using 15 DNN models and 4 platforms (edge-FPGA/TPU/GPU and ASIC). Furthermore, DNN accelerators generated by our AutoDNNchip can achieve better (up to 3.86X improvement) performance than that of expert-crafted state-of-the-art FPGA- and ASIC-based accelerators, showing the effectiveness of AutoDNNchip.

On the other side, since GPU global memory is a scarce resource, large models also pose a significant challenge due to memory requirement in the training process. This restriction limits the DNN architecture exploration flexibility. In this paper, we propose Capuchin, a tensor-based GPU memory management module that reduces the memory footprint via tensor eviction/prefetching and recomputation. The key feature of Capuchin is that it makes memory management decisions based on dynamic tensor access pattern tracked at runtime. This design is motivated by the observation that the access pattern to tensors is regular during training iterations. Based on the identified patterns, one can exploit the total memory optimization space and offer the fine-grain and flexible control of when and how to perform memory optimization techniques. We deploy Capuchin in a widely-used deep learning framework, Tensorflow, and show that Capuchin can reduce the memory footprint by up to 85% among 6 state-of-the-art DNNs compared to the original Tensorflow. Especially, for the NLP task BERT, the maximum batch size that Capuchin can outperforms Tensorflow and gradient-checkpointing by 7x and 2.1x, respectively. We also show that Capuchin outperforms vDNN and gradient-checkpointing by up to 286% and 55% under the same memory oversubscription.","author":["Xuan Peng","Xuanhua Shi","Hulin Dai","Hai Jin","Weiliang Ma","Qian Xiong","Fan Yang","Xuehai Qian"],"issue":["ASPLOS '20: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2020","Pages   891\u2013905","https://doi.org/10.1145/3373376.3378505"],"date":"13 March 2020","ref":[{"text":"Gradient-checkpointing. https://github.com/cybertronai/gradient-checkpointing.","order":1},{"text":"Abadi, M., Barham, P., Chen, J., Chen, Z., Davis, A., Dean, J., Devin, M., Ghemawat, S., Irving, G., Isard, M., Kudlur, M., Levenberg, J., Monga, R., Moore, S., Murray, D.

One major advantage of NVPIM is that the vector dot-product operations can be completed efficiently by analog computing inside a Nonvolatile Memory (NVM) crossbar. However, its inference efficiency is severely downgraded when processing depth-wise convolution layers, which have been widely employed in many lightweight DCNNs. One major challenge is that the cell utilization is extreme low when mapping the depth-wise convolution layer to a crossbar. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel hybrid mode NVPIM architecture, namely, MobiLattice. With moderate hardware overhead, MobiLattice enables both analog and digital mode operations on NVM crossbars. While conventional convolution layers are computed efficiently using the analog mode, the computation efficiency of depth-wise convolution layers are substantially improved using the digital mode by mitigating the redundant memory space in the NVM crossbars. Experimental results show that, compared to prior approaches where only the analog mode is supported by the NVPIM architecture, MobiLattice can speedup the processing of typical depth-wise DCNNs by 2 ~ 5\u00d7 on average and up to 30\u00d7 by combining with some extreme quantization schemes.","author":["Qilin Zheng","Xingchen Li","Zongwei Wang","Guangyu Sun","Yimao Cai","Ru Huang","Yiran Chen","Hai (Helen) Li"],"issue":["ICCAD '20: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2020","Article No.: 104","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/3400302.3415666"],"date":"02 November 2020","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, the corresponding memory requirement is proportional to the run-time of the evaluation program. Therefore, the practical applicability of the reverse mode in its original formulation is limited despite the availability of ever larger memory systems. This observation leads to the development of checkpointing schedules to reduce the storage requirements. This article presents the function revolve, which generates checkpointing schedules that are provably optimal with regard to a primary and a secondary criterion.

A Click router is assembled from packet processing modules called elements. Individual elements implement simple router functions like packet classification, queuing, scheduling, and interfacing with network devices. A router configurable is a directed graph with elements at the vertices; packets flow along the edges of the graph. Several features make individual elements more powerful and complex configurations easier to write, including pull connections, which model packet flow drivn by transmitting hardware devices, and flow-based router context, which helps an element locate other interesting elements. Click configurations are modular and easy to extend. A standards-compliant Click IP router has 16 elements on its forwarding path; some of its elements are also useful in Ethernet switches and IP tunnelling configurations. Extending the IP router to support dropping policies, fairness among flows, or Differentiated Services simply requires adding a couple of element at the right place. On conventional PC hardware, the Click IP router achieves a maximum loss-free forwarding rate of 333,000 64-byte packets per second, demonstrating that Click's modular and flexible architecture is compatible with good performance.","author":["Eddie Kohler","Robert Morris","Benjie Chen","John Jannotti","M.

These proposals augment a conventional multiprocessor, which employs explicit threading, with the ability to handle implicit threads. Current proposals focus on only implicitly-threaded code sections. This paper identifies, for the first time, the issues in combining explicit and implicit threading. We present the Multiplex architecture to combine the two threading models. Multiplex exploits the similarities between implicit and explicit threading, and provides a unified support for the two threading models without additional hardware. Multiplex groups a subset of protocol states in an implicitly-threaded CMP to provide a write-invalidate protocol for explicit threads.\nUsing a fully-integrated compiler infrastructure for automatic generation of Multiplex code, this paper presents a detailed performance analysis for entire benchmarks, instead of just implicitly-threaded sections, as done in previous papers. We show that neither threading models alone performs consistently better than the other across the benchmarks. A CMP with four dual-issue CPUs achieves a speedup of 1.48 and 2.17 over one dual-issue CPU, using implicit-only and explicit-only threading, respectively. Multiplex matches or outperforms the better of the two threading models for every benchmark, and a four-CPU Multiplex achieves a speedup of 2.63. Our detailed analysis indicates that the dominant overheads in an implicitly-threaded CMP are speculation state overflow due to limited L1 cache capacity, and load imbalance and data dependences in fine-grain threads.","author":["Chong-Liang Ooi","Seon Wook Kim","Il Park","Rudolf Eigenmann","Babak Falsafi","T.

They can be deeply embedded in the physical world and spread throughout our environment like smart dust. The missing elements are an overall system architecture and a methodology for systematic advance. To this end, we identify key requirements, develop a small device that is representative of the class, design a tiny event-driven operating system, and show that it provides support for efficient modularity and concurrency-intensive operation. Our operating system fits in 178 bytes of memory, propagates events in the time it takes to copy 1.25 bytes of memory, context switches in the time it takes to copy 6 bytes of memory and supports two level scheduling. The analysis lays a groundwork for future architectural advances.","author":["Jason Hill","Robert Szewczyk","Alec Woo","Seth Hollar","David Culler","Kristofer Pister"],"issue":["ASPLOS IX: Proceedings of the ninth international conference on Architectural support for programming languages and operating systems","November 2000","Pages   93\u2013104","https://doi.org/10.1145/378993.379006"],"date":"12 November 2000","ref":[{"text":"Atmel AT91 Arm Thumb. http://www.atmel.com/atmel/products/prod35.htm.","order":1},{"text":"Atmel AVR 8-Bit RISC processor. http://www.atmel.com/atmel/products/prod23.htm.","order":2},{"text":"Microware Ariel Technical Overview. http://www.microware.com/ProductsServices/ Technologies/ariel_technology_brief.html.","order":3},{"text":"PalmOS Software 3.5 Overview. http://www.palm.com/devzone/docs/palmos35.html.","order":4},{"text":"Pico Radio. http: //bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Pico_Radio/.","order":5},{"text":"Pister, K.S.J.

DATUM is the first known method that can mask any given number of failures, requires an optimal amount of redundant storage space, and spreads reconstruction accesses uniformly over disks in the presence of failures without needing large layout tables in controller memory. Our approach is based on information dispersal, a coding technique that admits an efficient hardware implementation. As the method does not restrict the configuration parameters of the disk array, many existing RAID organizations are particular cases of DATUM. A detailed performance comparison with two other approaches shows that DATUM'S response times are similar to those of the best competitor when two or less disks fail, and that the performance degrades gracefully when more than two disks fail.","author":["Guillermo A.

Consequently, the gap between processor and main memory performance is expected to grow, increasing the number of execution cycles spent waiting for memory accesses to complete. One solution to this growing problem is to reduce the number of cache misses by increasing the effectiveness of the cache hierarchy. In this paper we present a technique for dynamic analysis of program data access behavior, which is then used to proactively guide the placement of data within the cache hierarchy in a location-sensitive manner. We introduce the concept of a macroblock, which allows us to feasibly characterize the memory locations accessed by a program, and a Memory Address Table, which performs the dynamic reference analysis. Our technique is fully compatible with existing Instruction Set Architectures. Results from detailed simulations of several integer programs show significant speedups.","author":["Teresa L.

In the near future, the graphics pipeline is likely to evolve into a general programmable stream processor capable of more than simply feed-forward triangle rendering.In this paper, we evaluate these trends in programmability of the graphics pipeline and explain how ray tracing can be mapped to graphics hardware. Using our simulator, we analyze the performance of a ray casting implementation on next generation programmable graphics hardware. In addition, we compare the performance difference between non-branching programmable hardware using a multipass implementation and an architecture that supports branching. We also show how this approach is applicable to other ray tracing algorithms such as Whitted ray tracing, path tracing, and hybrid rendering algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate that ray tracing on graphics hardware could prove to be faster than CPU based implementations as well as competitive with traditional hardware accelerated feed-forward triangle rendering.","author":["Timothy J.

These architectures use hardware speculative storage to buffer uncertain data, track data dependences and roll back incorrect executions. Because all memory references access the speculative storage, current proposals implement this storage using small memory structures for fast access. The limited capacity of the speculative storage causes considerable performance loss due to speculative storage overflow whenever a thread's speculative state exceeds the storage capacity. Larger threads exacerbate the overflow problem but are preferable to smaller threads, as larger threads uncover more parallelism.In this paper, we discover a new program property called memory reference idempotency.  Idempotent references need not be tracked in the speculative storage, and instead can directly access non-speculative storage (i.e., the conventional memory hierarchy).  Thus, we reduce the demand for speculative storage space.  We define a formal framework for reference idempotency and present a novel compiler-assisted speculative execution model. We prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for reference idempotency using our model. We present a compiler algorithm to label idempotent memory references for the hardware.  Experimental results show that for our benchmarks, over 60% of the references in non-parallelizable program sections are idempotent.","author":["Seon Wook Kim","Chong-liang Ooi","Rudolf Eigenmann","Babak Falsafi","T.

In the first part of the survey we classify rollback-recovery protocols into checkpoint-based and log-based. Checkpoint-based protocols rely solely on checkpointing for system state restoration. Checkpointing can be coordinated, uncoordinated, or communication-induced. Log-based protocols combine checkpointing with logging of nondeterministic events, encoded in tuples called determinants. Depending on how determinants are logged, log-based protocols can be pessimistic, optimistic, or causal. Throughout the survey, we highlight the research issues that are at the core of rollback-recovery and present the solutions that currently address them. We also compare the performance of different rollback-recovery protocols with respect to a series of desirable properties and discuss the issues that arise in the practical implementations of these protocols.","author":["E.

Meanwhile, dynamic software optimization methods have shown the usefulness and feasibility of runtime program optimization, but those optimizations do not achieve as much as partitioning. We introduce a first approach to dynamic hardware/software partitioning. We describe our system architecture and initial on-chip tools, including profiler, decompiler, synthesis, and placement and routing tools for a simplified configurable logic fabric, able to perform dynamic partitioning of real benchmarks. We show speedups averaging 2.6 for five benchmarks taken from Powerstone, NetBench, and our own benchmarks.","author":["Greg Stitt","Roman Lysecky","Frank Vahid"],"issue":["DAC '03: Proceedings of the 40th annual Design Automation Conference","June 2003","Pages   250\u2013255","https://doi.org/10.1145/775832.775896"],"date":"02 June 2003","ref":[{"text":"V.

However, many of those applications, such as Internet Protocol routing table and network access control list reduction, require logic minimization during the application's runtime, and hence could benefit from minimization executing on-chip alongside the application. On-chip minimization can even enable dynamic hardware/software partitioning. We discuss requirements of on-chip logic minimization, and present our new on-chip logic minimization tool, ROCM. We compare with the well-known Espresso logic minimizer and show that ROCM is 10 times smaller, executes 10-20 times faster, and uses 3 times less data memory, with a mere 2% quality penalty, for the routing table and access control list applications. We show that ROCM solves real-sized problems on an ARM7 embedded processor in just seconds.","author":["Roman Lysecky","Frank Vahid"],"issue":["DAC '03: Proceedings of the 40th annual Design Automation Conference","June 2003","Pages   334\u2013337","https://doi.org/10.1145/775832.775918"],"date":"02 June 2003","ref":[{"text":"Advanced RISC Machines Ltd.

The non-blocking property we consider is obstruction-freedom. Obstruction-freedom is weaker than lock-freedom; as a result, it admits substantially simpler and more efficient implementations. A novel feature of our obstruction-free STM implementation is its use of modular contention managers to ensure progress in practice. We illustrate the utility of our dynamic STM with a straightforward implementation of an obstruction-free red-black tree, thereby demonstrating a sophisticated non-blocking dynamic data structure that would be difficult to implement by other means. We also present the results of simple preliminary performance experiments that demonstrate that an \"early release\" feature of our STM is useful for reducing contention, and that our STM lends itself to the effective use of modular contention managers.","author":["Maurice Herlihy","Victor Luchangco","Mark Moir","William N.

Recently, motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target?We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most influential nodes is NP-hard here, and we provide the first provable approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions, we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63% of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of influence problems in social networks.We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees, our approximation algorithms significantly out-perform node-selection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the field of social networks.","author":["David Kempe","Jon Kleinberg","\u00c9va Tardos"],"issue":["KDD '03: Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2003","Pages   137\u2013146","https://doi.org/10.1145/956750.956769"],"date":"24 August 2003","ref":[{"text":"R.

We first discuss the way TCP realizes statistical bandwidth sharing, illustrating essential properties by means of packet level simulations. Mathematical flow level models based on the theory of stochastic networks are then proposed to explain the observed behavior. A notable result is that first order performance (e.g., mean throughput) is insensitive with respect both to the flow size distribution and the flow arrival process, as long as \"sessions\" arrive according to a Poisson process. Perceived performance is shown to depend most significantly on whether demand at flow level is less than or greater than available capacity. The models provide a key to understanding the effectiveness of techniques for congestion management and service differentiation.","author":["S. Ben Fred","T. Bonald","A. Proutiere","G.

As in many applications the environment to be displayed consists of polygons many of whose relative geometric relations are static, we attempt to capitalize on this by preprocessing the environment's database so as to decrease the run-time computations required to generate a scene. This preprocessing is based on generating a \u201cbinary space partitioning\u201d tree whose in order traversal of visibility priority at run-time will produce a linear order, dependent upon the viewing position, on (parts of) the polygons, which can then be used to easily solve the hidden surface problem. In the application where the entire environment is static with only the viewing-position changing, as is common in simulation, the results presented will be sufficient to solve completely the hidden surface problem.","author":["Henry Fuchs","Zvi M.

Novel techniques aiming at fast parasitic closure are employed throughout the flow. Parasitic corners generated based on the earlier placement statistics are included for circuit resizing to enable parasitic robust designs. A performance-driven placement with simultaneous fast incremental global routing is proposed to achieve accurate parasitic estimation. Device tuning is utilized during layout to compensate for layout induced performance degradations. This methodology allows sophisticated macromodels of performances versus device variables and parasitics to be used during layout synthesis to make it truly performance-driven.

Such a trend opens up interesting opportunities but also raises immense challenges since the efficient use of heterogeneous many-core systems is not a trivial problem. In this paper, we explore how to program data processing operators on top of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). FPGAs are very versatile in terms of how they can be used and can also be added as additional processing units in standard CPU sockets.In the paper, we study how data processing can be accelerated using an FPGA. Our results indicate that efficient usage of FPGAs involves non-trivial aspects such as having the right computation model (an asynchronous sorting network in this case); a careful implementation that balances all the design constraints in an FPGA; and the proper integration strategy to link the FPGA to the rest of the system. Once these issues are properly addressed, our experiments show that FPGAs exhibit performance figures competitive with those of modern general-purpose CPUs while offering significant advantages in terms of power consumption and parallel stream evaluation.","author":["Rene Mueller","Jens Teubner","Gustavo Alonso"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 2","Issue 1","August 2009","pp   910\u2013921","https://doi.org/10.14778/1687627.1687730"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"D.

MapReduce and Dryad are two popular platforms in which the dataflow takes the form of a directed acyclic graph of operators. These platforms lack built-in support for iterative programs, which arise naturally in many applications including data mining, web ranking, graph analysis, model fitting, and so on. This paper presents HaLoop, a modified version of the Hadoop MapReduce framework that is designed to serve these applications. HaLoop not only extends MapReduce with programming support for iterative applications, it also dramatically improves their efficiency by making the task scheduler loop-aware and by adding various caching mechanisms. We evaluated HaLoop on real queries and real datasets. Compared with Hadoop, on average, HaLoop reduces query runtimes by 1.85, and shuffles only 4% of the data between mappers and reducers.","author":["Yingyi Bu","Bill Howe","Magdalena Balazinska","Michael D.

The system is well recognized for its elastic scalability and fine-grained fault tolerance although its performance has been noted to be suboptimal in the database context. According to a recent study [19], Hadoop, an open source implementation of MapReduce, is slower than two state-of-the-art parallel database systems in performing a variety of analytical tasks by a factor of 3.1 to 6.5. MapReduce can achieve better performance with the allocation of more compute nodes from the cloud to speed up computation; however, this approach of \"renting more nodes\" is not cost effective in a pay-as-you-go environment. Users desire an economical elastically scalable data processing system, and therefore, are interested in whether MapReduce can offer both elastic scalability and efficiency.In this paper, we conduct a performance study of MapReduce (Hadoop) on a 100-node cluster of Amazon EC2 with various levels of parallelism. We identify five design factors that affect the performance of Hadoop, and investigate alternative but known methods for each factor. We show that by carefully tuning these factors, the overall performance of Hadoop can be improved by a factor of 2.5 to 3.5 for the same benchmark used in [19], and is thus more comparable to that of parallel database systems. Our results show that it is therefore possible to build a cloud data processing system that is both elastically scalable and efficient.","author":["Dawei Jiang","Beng Chin Ooi","Lei Shi","Sai Wu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   472\u2013483","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920903"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"Amazon elastic compute cloud (Amazon EC2) http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/.","order":1},{"text":"http://code.google.com/p/protobuf.","order":2},{"text":"http://developer.yahoo.net/blogs/hadoop/2008/09/.","order":3},{"text":"http://hadoop.apache.org.","order":4},{"text":"http://www.cloudera.com/blog/2009/12/7-tips-for-improving-mapreduce-performance/.","order":5},{"text":"http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~epic/.","order":6},{"text":"http://www.cse.yorku.ca/oz/hash.html.","order":7},{"text":"http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/je/index.html.","order":8},{"text":"http://www.vertica.com.","order":9},{"text":"A.

To query these networks, one often needs to identify the matches of a given query graph in a (typically large) network modeled as a target graph. Due to noise and the lack of fixed schema in the target graph, the query graph can substantially differ from its matches in the target graph in both structure and node labels, thus bringing challenges to the graph querying tasks. In this paper, we propose NeMa (Network Match), a neighborhood-based subgraph matching technique for querying real-life networks. (1) To measure the quality of the match, we propose a novel subgraph matching cost metric that aggregates the costs of matching individual nodes, and unifies both structure and node label similarities. (2) Based on the metric, we formulate the minimum cost subgraph matching problem. Given a query graph and a target graph, the problem is to identify the (top-k) matches of the query graph with minimum costs in the target graph. We show that the problem is NP-hard, and also hard to approximate. (3) We propose a heuristic algorithm for solving the problem based on an inference model. In addition, we propose optimization techniques to improve the efficiency of our method. (4) We empirically verify that NeMa is both effective and efficient compared to the keyword search and various state-of-the-art graph querying techniques.","author":["Arijit Khan","Yinghui Wu","Charu C.

The objective of SC is to outsource a set of spatio-temporal tasks to a set of workers, i.e., individuals with mobile devices that perform the tasks by physically traveling to specified locations of interest. However, current solutions require the workers, who in many cases are simply volunteering for a cause, to disclose their locations to untrustworthy entities. In this paper, we introduce a framework for protecting location privacy of workers participating in SC tasks. We argue that existing location privacy techniques are not sufficient for SC, and we propose a mechanism based on differential privacy and geocasting that achieves effective SC services while offering privacy guarantees to workers. We investigate analytical models and task assignment strategies that balance multiple crucial aspects of SC functionality, such as task completion rate, worker travel distance and system overhead. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that the proposed technique protects workers' location privacy without incurring significant performance metrics penalties.","author":["Hien To","Gabriel Ghinita","Cyrus Shahabi"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 10","June 2014","pp   919\u2013930","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732951.2732966"],"date":"01 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"F.

This paper concerns the problem of privacy preserving range query processing on clouds. Prior schemes are weak in privacy protection as they cannot achieve index indistinguishability, and therefore allow the cloud to statistically estimate the values of data and queries using domain knowledge and history query results. In this paper, we propose the first range query processing scheme that achieves index indistinguishability under the indistinguishability against chosen keyword attack (IND-CKA). Our key idea is to organize indexing elements in a complete binary tree called PBtree, which satisfies structure indistinguishability (i.e., two sets of data items have the same PBtree structure if and only if the two sets have the same number of data items) and node indistinguishability (i.e., the values of PBtree nodes are completely random and have no statistical meaning). We prove that our scheme is secure under the widely adopted IND-CKA security model. We propose two algorithms, namely PBtree traversal width minimization and PBtree traversal depth minimization, to improve query processing efficiency. We prove that the worse case complexity of our query processing algorithm using PBtree is O(|R| log n), where n is the total number of data items and R is the set of data items in the query result. We implemented and evaluated our scheme on a real world data set with 5 million items. For example, for a query whose results contain ten data items, it takes only 0.17 milliseconds.","author":["Rui Li","Alex X. Liu","Ann L.

This has led to research into NVM programming models, where persistent data structures remain in memory and are accessed directly through CPU loads and stores. Existing mechanisms for transactional updates are not appropriate in such a setting as they are optimized for block-based storage. We present REWIND, a user-mode library approach to managing transactional updates directly from user code written in an imperative general-purpose language. REWIND relies on a custom persistent in-memory data structure for the log that supports recoverable operations on itself. The scheme also employs a combination of non-temporal updates, persistent memory fences, and lightweight logging. Experimental results on synthetic transactional workloads and TPC-C show the overhead of REWIND compared to its non-recoverable equivalent to be within a factor of only 1.5 and 1.39 respectively. Moreover, REWIND outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for data structure recoverability as well as general purpose and NVM-aware DBMS-based recovery schemes by up to two orders of magnitude.","author":["Andreas Chatzistergiou","Marcelo Cintra","Stratis D.

Besides the challenges in massive scalability and low latency distributed query processing, it is imperative to achieve all these requirements with effective fault tolerance and efficient recovery, as failures and fluctuations are the norm in such a distributed environment.We present a cloud scale interactive query processing system, called JetScope, developed at Microsoft. The system has a SQL-like declarative scripting language and delivers massive scalability and high performance through advanced optimizations. In order to achieve low latency, the system leverages various access methods, optimizes delivering first rows, and maximizes network and scheduling efficiency. The system also provides a fine-grained fault tolerance mechanism which is able to efficiently detect and mitigate failures without significantly impacting the query latency and user experience. JetScope has been deployed to hundreds of servers in production at Microsoft, serving a few million queries every day.","author":["Eric Boutin","Paul Brett","Xiaoyu Chen","Jaliya Ekanayake","Tao Guan","Anna Korsun","Zhicheng Yin","Nan Zhang","Jingren Zhou"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 12","August 2015","pp   1680\u20131691","https://doi.org/10.14778/2824032.2824066"],"date":"01 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"L.

However, it has not supported range operations, only individual record operations (e.g., create, read, update, delete). In this paper, we enhance our multi-version timestamp order technique to handle range concurrency and prevent phantoms. Importantly, we maintain high performance while respecting the clean separation of duties required by Deuteronomy, where a transaction component performs purely logical concurrency control (including range support), while a data component performs data storage and management duties. Like the rest of the Deuteronomy stack, our range technique manages concurrency information in a latch-free manner. With our range enhancement, Deuteronomy can reach scan speeds of nearly 250 million records/s (more than 27 GB/s) on modern hardware, while providing serializable isolation complete with phantom prevention.","author":["Justin Levandoski","David Lomet","Sudipta Sengupta","Ryan Stutsman","Rui Wang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 13","September 2015","pp   2146\u20132157","https://doi.org/10.14778/2831360.2831368"],"date":"01 September 2015","ref":[{"text":"M.

However, due to the schema-free nature of RDF data, it is very difficult for users to have full knowledge of the underlying schema. Furthermore, the same kind of information can be represented in diverse graph fragments. Hence, it is a huge challenge to formulate complex SPARQL expressions by taking the union of all possible structures.In this paper, we propose an effective framework to access the RDF repository even if users have no full knowledge of the underlying schema. Specifically, given a SPARQL query, the system could return as more answers that match the query based on the semantic similarity as possible. Interestingly, we propose a systematic method to mine diverse semantically equivalent structure patterns. More importantly, incorporating both structural and semantic similarities we are the first to propose a novel similarity measure, semantic graph edit distance. In order to improve the efficiency performance, we apply the semantic summary graph to summarize the knowledge graph, which supports both high-level pruning and drill-down pruning. We also devise an effective lower bound based on the TA-style access to each of the candidate sets. Extensive experiments over real datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.","author":["Weiguo Zheng","Lei Zou","Wei Peng","Xifeng Yan","Shaoxu Song","Dongyan Zhao"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 9","Issue 11","July 2016","pp   840\u2013851","https://doi.org/10.14778/2983200.2983201"],"date":"01 July 2016","ref":[{"text":"R.

Can we say whether it will converge?BP, traditionally an inference algorithm for graphical models, exploits so-called \"network effects\" to perform graph classification tasks when labels for a subset of nodes are provided; and it has been successful in numerous settings like fraudulent entity detection in online retailers and classification in social networks. However, it does not have a closed-form nor does it provide convergence guarantees in general. We propose ZooBP, a method to perform fast BP on undirected heterogeneous graphs with provable convergence guarantees. ZooBP has the following advantages: (1) Generality: It works on heterogeneous graphs with multiple types of nodes and edges; (2) Closed-form solution: ZooBP gives a closed-form solution as well as convergence guarantees; (3) Scalability: ZooBP is linear on the graph size and is up to 600\u00d7 faster than BP, running on graphs with 3.3 million edges in a few seconds. (4) Effectiveness: Applied on real data (a Flipkart e-commerce network with users, products and sellers), ZooBP identifies fraudulent users with a near-perfect precision of 92.3 % over the top 300 results.","author":["Dhivya Eswaran","Stephan G\u00fcnnemann","Christos Faloutsos","Disha Makhija","Mohit Kumar"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 5","January 2017","pp   625\u2013636","https://doi.org/10.14778/3055540.3055554"],"date":"01 January 2017","ref":[{"text":"L.

Methods using lower precision input data are of special interest given their overall higher efficiency. However, in databases, these methods have a hidden cost: the quantization of the real value into a smaller number is an expensive step. To address this issue, we present ML-Weaving, a data structure and hardware acceleration technique intended to speed up learning of generalized linear models over low precision data. MLWeaving provides a compact in-memory representation that enables the retrieval of data at any level of precision. MLWeaving also provides a highly efficient implementation of stochastic gradient descent on FPGAs and enables the dynamic tuning of precision, instead of using a fixed precision level during learning. Experimental results show that MLWeaving converges up to 16 x faster than low-precision implementations of first-order methods on CPUs.","author":["Zeke Wang","Kaan Kara","Hantian Zhang","Gustavo Alonso","Onur Mutlu","Ce Zhang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 12","Issue 7","March 2019","pp   807\u2013821","https://doi.org/10.14778/3317315.3317322"],"date":"01 March 2019","ref":[{"text":"S.

Traditional solutions to this demand have limitations on effectively balancing the tradeoff between privacy and utility of the released data. Thus, the database community and machine learning community have recently studied a new problem of relational data synthesis using generative adversarial networks (GAN) and proposed various algorithms. However, these algorithms are not compared under the same framework and thus it is hard for practitioners to understand GAN's benefits and limitations. To bridge the gaps, we conduct so far the most comprehensive experimental study that investigates applying GAN to relational data synthesis. We introduce a unified GAN-based framework and define a space of design solutions for each component in the framework, including neural network architectures and training strategies. We conduct extensive experiments to explore the design space and compare with traditional data synthesis approaches. Through extensive experiments, we find that GAN is very promising for relational data synthesis, and provide guidance for selecting appropriate design solutions. We also point out limitations of GAN and identify future research directions.","author":["Ju Fan","Junyou Chen","Tongyu Liu","Yuwei Shen","Guoliang Li","Xiaoyong Du"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 13","Issue 12","August 2020","pp   1962\u20131975","https://doi.org/10.14778/3407790.3407802"],"date":"01 July 2020","ref":[{"text":"Adult data set. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult.","order":1},{"text":"Anuran calls (mfccs) data set. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Anuran+Calls+%28MFCCs%29.","order":2},{"text":"Census-income (kdd) data set. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census-Income+(KDD).","order":3},{"text":"Covertype data set. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype.","order":4},{"text":"Htru2 data set. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2.","order":5},{"text":"Pen-based recognition of handwritten digits data set. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pen-Based+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits.","order":6},{"text":"Statlog (landsat satellite) data set. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28Landsat+Satellite%29.","order":7},{"text":"D.

Properly identifying them provides the basis for an English parser to decode the related structures. Phrasal verbs have been a challenge to Natural Language Processing (NLP) because they sit at the borderline between lexicon and syntax. Traditional NLP frameworks that separate the lexicon module from the parser make it difficult to handle this problem properly. This paper presents a finite state approach that integrates a phrasal verb expert lexicon between shallow parsing and deep parsing to handle morpho-syntactic interaction. With precision/recall combined performance benchmarked consistently at 95.8%-97.5%, the Phrasal Verb identification problem has basically been solved with the presented method.","author":["Wei Li","Xiuhong Zhang","Cheng Niu","Yuankai Jiang","Rohini Srihari"],"issue":["ACL '03: Proceedings of the 41st Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics - Volume 1","July 2003","Pages   513\u2013520","https://doi.org/10.3115/1075096.1075161"],"date":"07 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"Breidt.

The N-Best algorithm is a time-synchronous Viterbi-style beam search algorithm that can be made to find the most likely N whole sentence alternatives that are within a given a \"beam\" of the most likely sentence. The algorithm can be shown to be exact under some reasonable constraints. That is, it guarantees that the answers it finds are, in fact, the most likely sentence hypotheses. The computation is linear with the length of the utterance, and faster than linear in N. When used together with a first-order statistical grammar, the correct sentence is usually within the first few sentence choices. The output of the algorithm, which is an ordered set of sentence hypotheses with acoustic and language model scores can easily be processed by natural language knowledge sources. Thus, this method of integrating speech recognition and natural language avoids the huge expansion of the search space that would be needed to include all possible knowledge sources in a top-down search. The algorithm has also been used to generate alternative sentence hypotheses for discriminative training. Finally, the alternative sentences generated are useful for testing overgeneration of syntax and semantics.","author":["Yen-Lu Chow","Richard Schwartz"],"issue":["HLT '89: Proceedings of the workshop on Speech and Natural Language","October 1989","Pages   199\u2013202","https://doi.org/10.3115/1075434.1075467"],"date":"15 October 1989"},{"_id":"10.3115/1118693.1118699","title":"An empirical evaluation of knowledge sources and learning algorithms for word sense disambiguation","abstract":"In this paper, we evaluate a variety of knowledge sources and supervised learning algorithms for word sense disambiguation on SENSEVAL-2 and SENSEVAL-1 data.

A bigram back-off language model was chosen for the language model to be used in the informal ATIS CSR baseline evaluation test[13, 21].The stack decoder[2, 8, 24] is a promising control structure for a speech understanding system because it can combine constraints from both the acoustic model and a long span language model (such as a natural language processor (NLP)) into a single integrated search[17].

A log-linear regression model uses these constraints to predict whether conjoined adjectives are of same or different orientations, achieving 82% accuracy in this task when each conjunction is considered independently. Combining the constraints across many adjectives, a clustering algorithm separates the adjectives into groups of different orientations, and finally, adjectives are labeled positive or negative. Evaluations on real data and simulation experiments indicate high levels of performance: classification precision is more than 90% for adjectives that occur in a modest number of conjunctions in the corpus.","author":["Vasileios Hatzivassiloglou","Kathleen R.

Two models are discussed fot the lexical representation of idioms. One extends the notion continuation class from two-level morphology, the other is a localist, connectionist model. The connectionist model has an important advantage over the continuation class model: the conventionality principle follows naturally from the architecture of the connectionist model.","author":["Erik-Jan van der Linden","Wessel Kraaij"],"issue":["COLING '90: Proceedings of the 13th conference on Computational linguistics - Volume 2","August 1990","Pages   245\u2013250","https://doi.org/10.3115/997939.997982"],"date":"20 August 1990","ref":[{"text":"Bobrow, S. and Bell, S. 1973.

Given a set of documents (e.g., movie reviews) and accompanying ratings (e.g., \"4 stars\"), the task calls for inferring numerical ratings for unlabeled documents based on the perceived sentiment expressed by their text. In particular, we are interested in the situation where labeled data is scarce. We place this task in the semi-supervised setting and demonstrate that considering unlabeled reviews in the learning process can improve rating-inference performance. We do so by creating a graph on both labeled and unlabeled data to encode certain assumptions for this task. We then solve an optimization problem to obtain a smooth rating function over the whole graph. When only limited labeled data is available, this method achieves significantly better predictive accuracy over other methods that ignore the unlabeled examples during training.","author":["Andrew B.

The Adaptive Strategies for Sustainable Long-Term Social Interaction (ALIZ-E) project focuses on the design of long-term, adaptive social interaction between robots and child users in real-world settings. In this paper, we report on the iterative approach taken to scientific and technical developments toward this goal: advancing individual technical competencies and integrating them to form an autonomous robotic system for evaluation \"in the wild.\" The first evaluation iterations have shown the potential of this methodology in terms of adaptation of the robot to the interactant and the resulting influences on engagement. This sets the foundation for an ongoing research program that seeks to develop technologies for social robot companions.","author":["Tony Belpaeme","Paul Baxter","Robin Read","Rachel Wood","Heriberto Cuay\u00e1huitl","Bernd Kiefer","Stefania Racioppa","Ivana Kruijff-Korbayov\u00e1","Georgios Athanasopoulos","Valentin Enescu","Rosemarijn Looije","Mark Neerincx","Yiannis Demiris","Raquel Ros-Espinoza","Aryel Beck","Lola Ca\u00f1amero","Antione Hiolle","Matthew Lewis","Ilaria Baroni","Marco Nalin","Piero Cosi","Giulio Paci","Fabio Tesser","Giacomo Sommavilla","Remi Humbert"],"issue":["Journal of Human-Robot Interaction","Volume 1","Issue 2","January 2013","pp   33\u201353"],"date":"28 January 2013","ref":[{"text":"Baldridge, J.
