This will make DRAM cost, the space and the power it consumes a serious problem. The main question raised in this research is how cost, size, and power consumption can be reduced by transforming traditional flat main-memory systems into a multi-level hierarchy. We make the case for a multi-level main memory hierarchy by proposing and evaluating the performance of an implementation that enables aggressive use of memory compression, sharing of memory resources among computers, and dynamic power management of unused regions of memory. This paper presents the key design strategies to make this happen. We evaluate our implementation using complete runs of applications from the Spec 2K suite, SpecJBB, and SAP --- typical desktop and server applications. We show that only 30% of the entire memory resources typically needed must be accessed at DRAM speed whereas the rest can be accessed at a speed that is a magnitude slower. The resulting performance overhead is shown to be only 1.2% on average.","author":["Magnus Ekman","Per Stenstrom"],"issue":["WMPI '04: Proceedings of the 3rd workshop on Memory performance issues: in conjunction with the 31st international symposium on computer architecture","June 2004","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/1054943.1054944"],"date":"20 June 2004","ref":[{"text":"Abali B, Franke H, Shen X, Poff D and Smith B.

In this paper we present a generalized force-directed algorithm embedded in mPL2's [12] multilevel framework. Our new algorithm, named mPL5, produces the shortest wirelength among all published placers with very competitive runtime on the IBM circuits used in [29]. The new contributions and enhancements are: (1) We develop a new analytical placement algorithm using a density constrained minimization formulation which can be viewed as a generalization of the force-directed method in [16]; (2) We analyze and identify the advantages of our new algorithm over the force-directed method; (3) We successfully incorporate the generalized force-directed algorithm into a multilevel framework which significantly improves wirelength and speed. Compared to Capo9.0, our algorithm mPL5 produces 8% shorter wirelength and is 2X faster. Compared to Dragon3.01, mPL5 has 3% shorter wirelength and is 12X faster. Compared to Fengshui5.0, it has 5% shorter wirelength and is 2X faster. Compared to the ultra-fast placement algorithm: FastPlace, mPL5 produces 8% shorter wirelength but is 6X slower. A fast mode of mPL5 (mPL5-fast) can produce 1% shorter wirelength than Fast-Place1.0 and is only 2X slower. Moreover, mPL5-fast has demonstrated better scalability than FastPlace1.0.","author":["Tony Chan","Jason Cong","Kenton Sze"],"issue":["ISPD '05: Proceedings of the 2005 international symposium on Physical design","April 2005","Pages   185\u2013192","https://doi.org/10.1145/1055137.1055177"],"date":"03 April 2005","ref":[{"text":"http://vlsicad.eecs.umich.edu/BK/ISPD02bench/.","order":1},{"text":"C.

Accurately tracking the lineage (origin and subsequent processing history) of scientific data sets is thus imperative for the complete documentation of scientific work. Researchers are effectively prevented from determining, preserving, or providing the lineage of the computational data products they use and create, however, because of the lack of a definitive model for lineage retrieval and a poor fit between current data management tools and scientific software.

The implementation of streaming algorithms, typified by highly parallel computations with little reuse of input data, has been widely explored on GPUs. We relax the streaming model's constraint on input reuse and perform an in-depth analysis of dense matrix-matrix multiplication, which reuses each element of input matrices O(n) times. Its regular data access pattern and highly parallel computational requirements suggest matrix-matrix multiplication as an obvious candidate for efficient evaluation on GPUs but, surprisingly we find even near-optimal GPU implementations are pronouncedly less efficient than current cache-aware CPU approaches. We find the key cause of this inefficiency is that the GPU can fetch less data and yet execute more arithmetic operations per clock than the CPU when both are operating out of their closest caches. The lack of high bandwidth access to cached data will impair the performance of GPU implementations of any computation featuring significant input reuse.","author":["K. Fatahalian","J. Sugerman","P.

The tissues are endowed with a highly nonlinear constitutive model including controllable anisotropic muscle activations based on fiber directions. Detailed models of this sort can be difficult to animate requiring complex coordinated stimulation of the underlying musculature. We propose a solution to this problem automatically determining muscle activations that track a sparse set of surface landmarks, e.g. acquired from motion capture marker data. Since the resulting animation is obtained via a three dimensional nonlinear finite element method, we obtain visually plausible and anatomically correct deformations with spatial and temporal coherence that provides robustness against outliers in the motion capture data. Moreover, the obtained muscle activations can be used in a robust simulation framework including contact and collision of the face with external objects.","author":["Eftychios Sifakis","Igor Neverov","Ronald Fedkiw"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 24","Issue 3","July 2005","pp   417\u2013425","https://doi.org/10.1145/1073204.1073208"],"date":"01 July 2005","ref":[{"text":"Basu, S., Oliver, N., and Pentland, A. 1998. 3D lip shapes from video: a combined physical-statistical model.

Neither private nor shared caches can provide both large capacity and fast access in CMPs. We observe that compared to symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs), CMPs change the latency-capacity tradeoff in two significant ways. We propose three novel ideas to exploit the changes: (1) Though placing copies close to requestors allows fast access for read-only sharing, the copies also reduce the already-limited on-chip capacity in CMPs. We propose controlled replication to reduce capacity pressure by not making extra copies in some cases, and obtaining the data from an existing on-chip copy. This option is not suitable for SMPs because obtaining data from another processor is expensive and capacity is not limited to on-chip storage. (2) Unlike SMPs, CMPs allow fast on-chip communication between processors for read-write sharing. Instead of incurring slow access to read-write shared data through coherence misses as do SMPs, we propose in-situ communication to provide fast access without making copies or incurring coherence misses. (3) Accessing neighbors\u00fd caches is not as expensive in CMPs as it is in SMPs. We propose capacity stealing in which private data that exceeds a core\u00fds capacity is placed in a neighboring cache with less capacity demand. To incorporate our ideas, we use a hybrid of private, per-processor tag arrays and a shared data array. Because the shared data array is slow, we employ non-uniform access and distance associativity from previous proposals to hold frequently-accessed data in regions close to the requestor. We extend the previously-proposed Non-uniform access with Replacement And Placement usIng Distance associativity (NuRAPID) to CMPs, and call our cache CMP-NuRAPID. Our results show that for a 4-core CMP with 8 MB cache, CMP-NuRAPID improves performance by 13% over a shared cache and 8% over private caches for three commercial multithreaded workloads.","author":["Zeshan Chishti","Michael D.

Improved cut enumeration computes all K-feasible cuts without pruning for up to 7 inputs for the largest MCNC benchmarks. A new technique for on-the-fly cut dropping reduces by orders of magnitude memory needed to represent cuts for large designs. Improved area recovery leads to mappings with area on average 7% smaller than DAOmap, while preserving delay optimality when starting from the same optimized netlists. Applying mapping with structural choices derived by a synthesis flow on average reduces delay by 7% and area by 14%, compared to DAOmap.","author":["Alan Mishchenko","Satrajit Chatterjee","Robert Brayton"],"issue":["FPGA '06: Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/SIGDA 14th international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2006","Pages   41\u201349","https://doi.org/10.1145/1117201.1117208"],"date":"22 February 2006","ref":[{"text":"B.

Local collaboration among nodes de-correlates measurements, yielding a sparser data set with significant values at far fewer nodes. Sparsity can then be leveraged for subsequent processing such as measurement compression, de-noising, and query routing. A number of factors complicate realizing such a transform in real-world deployments, including irregular spatial placement of nodes and a potentially prohibitive energy cost associated with calculating the transform in-network. In this paper, we address these concerns head-on; our contributions are fourfold. First, we propose a simple interpolatory wavelet transform for irregular sampling grids. Second, using ns-2 simulations of network traffic generated by the transform, we establish for a variety of network configurations break-even points in network size beyond which multiscale data processing provides energy savings. Distributed lossy compression of network measurements provides a representative application for this study. Third, we develop a new protocol for extracting approximations given only a vague notion of source statistics and analyze its energy savings over a more intuitive but na\u00efve approach. Finally, we extend the 2-dimensional (2-D) spatial irregular grid transform to a 3-D spatio-temporal transform, demonstrating the substantial gain of distributed 3-D compression over repeated 2-D compression.","author":["Raymond S.

Community mining is one of the major directions in social network analysis. Most of the existing methods on community mining assume that there is only one kind of relation in the network, and moreover, the mining results are independent of the users' needs or preferences. However, in reality, there exist multiple, heterogeneous social networks, each representing a particular kind of relationship, and each kind of relationship may play a distinct role in a particular task. Thus mining networks by assuming only one kind of relation may miss a lot of valuable hidden community information and may not be adaptable to the diverse information needs from different users.In this paper, we systematically analyze the problem of mining hidden communities on heterogeneous social networks. Based on the observation that different relations have different importance with respect to a certain query, we propose a new method for learning an optimal linear combination of these relations which can best meet the user's expectation. With the obtained relation, better performance can be achieved for community mining. Our approach to social network analysis and community mining represents a major shift in methodology from the traditional one, a shift from single-network, user-independent analysis to multi-network, user-dependant, and query-based analysis. Experimental results on Iris data set and DBLP data set demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","author":["Deng Cai","Zheng Shao","Xiaofei He","Xifeng Yan","Jiawei Han"],"issue":["LinkKDD '05: Proceedings of the 3rd international workshop on Link discovery","August 2005","Pages   58\u201365","https://doi.org/10.1145/1134271.1134280"],"date":"21 August 2005","ref":[{"text":"L.

The generated performance tradeoff offers the designer access to a set of optimal design solutions, from which the designer can choose a satisfactory design point according to the performance specifications. The presented method takes advantage of the Pareto--optimal performance solutions of the hierarchical lower--level sub--blocks to generate the overall Pareto--optimal set at system level. The way the lower--level performance tradeoffs are combined and propagated to higher hierarchical levels, is one of the major key points in the bottom--up methodology.

As feature sizes and voltages are reduced to create faster, more efficient, and computationally more powerful processors, these errors will increase significantly. We show that (contrary to conventional wisdom) error correction codes (ECC) can be efficiently utilized to handle these errors as instructions are being processed through the microprocessor pipeline. We will analyze some of the tradeoffs involved in a hardware implementation of ECC for the instruction queue with respect to performance, power, area, and reliability. Specifically, for an environment with high error rates, we show that we can correct all single bit errors with a negligible drop in performance.

In particular:---We show that, for any p \u2208 (0, 2], one can maintain (using only O(log n/\u03f52) words of storage) a sketch C(q) of a point q \u2208 lnp under dynamic updates of its coordinates. The sketch has the property that, given C(q) and C(s), one can estimate \u2016q \u2212 s\u2016p up to a factor of (1 + \u03f5) with large probability. This solves the main open problem of Feigenbaum et al. [1999].---We show that the aforementioned sketching approach directly translates into an approximate algorithm that, for a fixed linear mapping A, and given x \u2208 \u211cn and y \u2208 \u211cm, estimates \u2016Ax \u2212 y\u2016p in O(n + m) time, for any p \u2208 (0, 2]. This generalizes an earlier algorithm of Wasserman and Blum [1997] which worked for the case p = 2.---We obtain another sketch function C\u2032 which probabilistically embeds ln1 into a normed space lm1. The embedding guarantees that, if we set m = log(1/\u03b4)O(1/\u03f5), then for any pair of points q, s \u2208 ln1, the distance between q and s does not increase by more than (1 + \u03f5) with constant probability, and it does not decrease by more than (1 \u2212 \u03f5) with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b4. This is the only known dimensionality reduction theorem for the l1 norm. In fact, stronger theorems of this type (i.e., that guarantee very low probability of expansion as well as of contraction) cannot exist [Brinkman and Charikar 2003].---We give an explicit embedding of ln2 into lnO(log n)1 with distortion (1 + 1/n\u0398(1)).","author":["Piotr Indyk"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 53","Issue 3","May 2006","pp   307\u2013323","https://doi.org/10.1145/1147954.1147955"],"date":"01 May 2006","ref":[{"text":"Alon, N., Matias, Y., and Szegedy, M. 1996.

Like most accelerators, FPGAs are very efficient at both dense matrix multiplication and FFT computations, but two important aspects of how to deliver that performance to applications have received too little attention. First, the standard API for important compute kernels hides parallelism from the system. Second, the issue of system architecture is virtually never addressed. This paper explores both issues and their implications for applications. We find that high bandwidth, low latency connectivity can be important, but the right API can be even more important.","author":["Keith D. Underwood","K.

Comparing noisy data requires comparisons based on similarity instead of exact matches, and thus searching for noisy data requires similarity search instead of exact search.The Ferret toolkit is designed to help system builders quickly construct content-based similarity search systems for feature-rich data types. The key component of the toolkit is a content-based similarity search engine for generic, multi-feature object representations. To solve the similarity search problem in high-dimensional spaces, we have developed approximation methods inspired by recent theoretical results on dimension reduction. The search engine constructs sketches from feature vectors as highly compact data structures for matching, filtering and ranking data objects. The toolkit also includes several other components to help system builders address search system infrastructure issues. We have implemented the toolkit and used it to successfully construct content-based similarity search systems for four data types: audio recordings, digital photos, 3D shape models and genomic microarray data.","author":["Qin Lv","William Josephson","Zhe Wang","Moses Charikar","Kai Li"],"issue":["ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","Volume 40","Issue 4","October 2006","pp   317\u2013330","https://doi.org/10.1145/1218063.1217966"],"date":"18 April 2006","ref":[{"text":"Altavista. http://www.altavista.com.","order":1},{"text":"Spotlight: Find anything on your mac instantly. http://images.apple.com/macosx/pdf/MacOSX_Spotlight_TB.pdf.","order":2},{"text":"3D model retrieval. http://amp.ece.cmu.edu/projects/3DModelRetrieval/.","order":3},{"text":"3D model retrieval. http://3d.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~dynamic/.","order":4},{"text":"3D model retrieval. http://shape.cs.princeton.edu/search.html.","order":5},{"text":"A.

Several methods have been proposed to achieve this engagement for computer science and other disciplines. Active learning is one such technique that incorporates interactive classroom activities to reinforce concepts and involve the students. Visualizations of computer science concepts such as algorithm animations can be used for these activities. To be most effective in this environment, they need to be designed and used with active learning in mind. This paper describes the design characteristics of such visualizations, ways of using them in the classroom, and our experience with developing and using visualization tools across different courses in the computer science curriculum.","author":["Dino Schweitzer","Wayne Brown"],"issue":["ACM SIGCSE Bulletin","Volume 39","Issue 1","March 2007","pp   208\u2013212","https://doi.org/10.1145/1227504.1227384"],"date":"07 March 2007","ref":[{"text":"Baecker, R.

In this paper, techniques referred to as wear leveling for the lengthening of flash-memory overall lifespan are considered. This paper presents the dual-pool algorithm, which realizes two key ideas: To cease the wearing of blocks by storing cold data, and to smartly leave alone blocks until wear leveling takes effect. The proposed algorithm requires no complicated tuning, and it resists changes of spatial locality in workloads. Extensive evaluation and comparison were conducted, and the merits of the proposed algorithm are justified in terms of wear-leveling performance and resource conservation.","author":["Li-Pin Chang"],"issue":["SAC '07: Proceedings of the 2007 ACM symposium on Applied computing","March 2007","Pages   1126\u20131130","https://doi.org/10.1145/1244002.1244248"],"date":"11 March 2007","ref":[{"text":"A.

Through a simple interface with two functions, map and reduce, this model facilitates parallel implementation of many real-world tasks such as data processing jobs for search engines and machine learning. However,this model does not directly support processing multiple related heterogeneous datasets. While processing relational data is a common need, this limitation causes difficulties and/or inefficiency when Map-Reduce is applied on relational operations like joins. We improve Map-Reduce into a new model called Map-Reduce-Merge. It adds to Map-Reduce a Merge phase that can efficiently merge data already partitioned and sorted (or hashed) by map and reduce modules. We also demonstrate that this new model can express relational algebra operators as well as implement several join algorithms.","author":["Hung-chih Yang","Ali Dasdan","Ruey-Lung Hsiao","D.

Camera systems have been proposed that allow for recording all-focus images, or for extracting depth, but to record both simultaneously has required more extensive hardware and reduced spatial resolution. We propose a simple modification to a conventional camera that allows for the simultaneous recovery of both (a) high resolution image information and (b) depth information adequate for semi-automatic extraction of a layered depth representation of the image.Our modification is to insert a patterned occluder within the aperture of the camera lens, creating a coded aperture. We introduce a criterion for depth discriminability which we use to design the preferred aperture pattern. Using a statistical model of images, we can recover both depth information and an all-focus image from single photographs taken with the modified camera. A layered depth map is then extracted, requiring user-drawn strokes to clarify layer assignments in some cases. The resulting sharp image and layered depth map can be combined for various photographic applications, including automatic scene segmentation, post-exposure refocusing, or re-rendering of the scene from an alternate viewpoint.","author":["Anat Levin","Rob Fergus","Fr\u00e9do Durand","William T.

Because traditional database systems benchmarks are inapproriate to measure performance for operations on engineering objects, we designed a new benchmark Object Operations version 1 (OO1) to focus on important characteristics of these applications.  OO1 is descended from an earlier benchmark for simple database operations and is based on several years experience with that benchmark. In this paper we describe the OO1 benchmark and results we obtained running it on a variety of database systems. We provide a careful specification of the benchmark, show how it can be   implemented on database systems, and present evidence that more than an order of magnitude difference in performance can result from a DBMS implementation quite different from current products; minimizing overhead per database call, offloading database server functionality to workstations, taking advantage of large main memories, and using link-based methods.","author":["R.

Although identity cues are scarce in cyberspace, individuals often leave behind textual identity traces. In this study we proposed the use of stylometric analysis techniques to help identify individuals based on writing style. We incorporated a rich set of stylistic features, including lexical, syntactic, structural, content-specific, and idiosyncratic attributes. We also developed the Writeprints technique for identification and similarity detection of anonymous identities. Writeprints is a Karhunen-Loeve transforms-based technique that uses a sliding window and pattern disruption algorithm with individual author-level feature sets. The Writeprints technique and extended feature set were evaluated on a testbed encompassing four online datasets spanning different domains: email, instant messaging, feedback comments, and program code. Writeprints outperformed benchmark techniques, including SVM, Ensemble SVM, PCA, and standard Karhunen-Loeve transforms, on the identification and similarity detection tasks with accuracy as high as 94% when differentiating between 100 authors. The extended feature set also significantly outperformed a baseline set of features commonly used in previous research. Furthermore, individual-author-level feature sets generally outperformed use of a single group of attributes.","author":["Ahmed Abbasi","Hsinchun Chen"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 26","Issue 2","March 2008","Article No.: 7","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/1344411.1344413"],"date":"08 April 2008","ref":[{"text":"Abbasi, A. and Chen, H. 2005.

These architectures support single-threaded performance and multithreaded throughput at lower costs (e.g., die size and power). However, they also pose unique challenges to operating systems, which traditionally assume homogeneous hardware. This paper presents AMPS, an operating system scheduler that efficiently supports both SMP-and NUMA-style performance-asymmetric architectures. AMPS contains three components: asymmetry-aware load balancing, faster-core-first scheduling, and NUMA-aware migration. We have implemented AMPS in Linux kernel 2.6.16 and used CPU clock modulation to emulate performance asymmetry on an SMP and NUMA system. For various workloads, we show that AMPS achieves a median speedup of 1.16 with a maximum of 1.44 over stock Linux on the SMP, and a median of 1.07 with a maximum of 2.61 on the NUMA system. Our results also show that AMPS improves fairness and repeatability of application performance measurements.","author":["Tong Li","Dan Baumberger","David A.

Most reference works that one traditionally found on the reference shelves of libraries -- dictionaries, encyclopedias, gazetteers etc. -- are now curated databases. Since it is now easy to publish databases on the web, there has been an explosion in the number of new curated databases used in scientific research. The value of curated databases lies in the organization and the quality of the data they contain. Like the paper reference works they have replaced, they usually represent the efforts of a dedicated group of people to produce a definitive description of some subject area. Curated databases present a number of challenges for database research. The topics of annotation, provenance, and citation are central, because curated databases are heavily cross-referenced with, and include data from, other databases, and much of the work of a curator is annotating existing data. Evolution of structure is important because these databases often evolve from semistructured representations, and because they have to accommodate new scientific discoveries. Much of the work in these areas is in its infancy, but it is beginning to provide suggest new research for both theory and practice. We discuss some of this research and emphasize the need to find appropriate models of the processes associated with curated databases.","author":["Peter Buneman","James Cheney","Wang-Chiew Tan","Stijn Vansummeren"],"issue":["PODS '08: Proceedings of the twenty-seventh ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems","June 2008","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/1376916.1376918"],"date":"09 June 2008","ref":[{"text":"C.

Unlike previous efforts for hardware accelerated SAT solving, our design focuses on accelerating the most time consuming part of the SAT solver --- Boolean Constraint Propagation (BCP), leaving the choices of heuristics such as branching order, restarting policy, and learning and backtracking to software. Our novel approach uses an application-specific architecture instead of an instance-specific one to avoid time-consuming FPGA synthesis for each SAT instance. By avoiding global signal wires and carefully pipelining the design, our BCP accelerator is able to achieve much higher clock frequency than that of previous work. In addition, it can load SAT instances in milliseconds, can handle SAT instances with tens of thousands of variables and clauses using a single FPGA, and can easily scale to handle more clauses by using multiple FPGAs. Our evaluation on a cycle-accurate simulator shows that the FPGA co-processor can achieve 3.7--38.6x speedup on BCP compared to state-of-the-art software SAT solvers.","author":["John D.

Specifically, the system focuses on: 1) Extracting researcher profiles automatically from the Web; 2) Integrating the publication data into the network from existing digital libraries; 3) Modeling the entire academic network; and 4) Providing search services for the academic network. So far, 448,470 researcher profiles have been extracted using a unified tagging approach. We integrate publications from online Web databases and propose a probabilistic framework to deal with the name ambiguity problem. Furthermore, we propose a unified modeling approach to simultaneously model topical aspects of papers, authors, and publication venues. Search services such as expertise search and people association search have been provided based on the modeling results. In this paper, we describe the architecture and main features of the system. We also present the empirical evaluation of the proposed methods.","author":["Jie Tang","Jing Zhang","Limin Yao","Juanzi Li","Li Zhang","Zhong Su"],"issue":["KDD '08: Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2008","Pages   990\u2013998","https://doi.org/10.1145/1401890.1402008"],"date":"24 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"L.

Towards this goal, we developed a spam signature generation framework called AutoRE to detect botnet-based spam emails and botnet membership. AutoRE does not require pre-classified training data or white lists. Moreover, it outputs high quality regular expression signatures that can detect botnet spam with a low false positive rate. Using a three-month sample of emails from Hotmail, AutoRE successfully identified 7,721 botnet-based spam campaigns together with 340,050 unique botnet host IP addresses.Our in-depth analysis of the identified botnets revealed several interesting findings regarding the degree of email obfuscation, properties of botnet IP addresses, sending patterns, and their correlation with network scanning traffic. We believe these observations are useful information in the design of botnet detection schemes.","author":["Yinglian Xie","Fang Yu","Kannan Achan","Rina Panigrahy","Geoff Hulten","Ivan Osipkov"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 38","Issue 4","October 2008","pp   171\u2013182","https://doi.org/10.1145/1402946.1402979"],"date":"17 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"M.

The situation becomes worse if energy-efficient jamming can be achieved by exploiting knowledge of the data link layer. Encrypting the packets may help to prevent the jammer from taking actions based on the content of the packets, but the temporal arrangement of the packets induced by the nature of the protocol might unravel patterns that the jammer can take advantage of, even when the packets are encrypted.By looking at the packet interarrival times in three representative MAC protocols, S-MAC, LMAC, and B-MAC, we derive several jamming attacks that allow the jammer to jam S-MAC, LMAC, and B-MAC energy efficiently. The jamming attacks are based on realistic assumptions. The algorithms are described in detail and simulated. The effectiveness and efficiency of the attacks are examined. In addition, we validate our simulation model by comparing its results with measurements obtained from actual implementation on our sensor node prototypes. We show that it takes little effort to implement such effective jammers, making them a realistic threat.Careful analysis of other protocols belonging to the respective categories of S-MAC, LMAC, and B-MAC reveals that those protocols are, to some extent, also susceptible to our attacks. The result of this investigation provides new insights into the security considerations of MAC protocols.","author":["Yee Wei Law","Marimuthu Palaniswami","Lodewijk Van Hoesel","Jeroen Doumen","Pieter Hartel","Paul Havinga"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks","Volume 5","Issue 1","February 2009","Article No.: 6","pp   1\u201338","https://doi.org/10.1145/1464420.1464426"],"date":"11 February 2009","ref":[{"text":"Adamy, D.

We evaluate these techniques by using trace simulations to find the limits of parallelism for machines that employ different combinations of these techniques. We have three major results. First, local regions of code have limited parallelism, and control dependence analysis is useful in extracting global parallelism from different parts of a program. Second, a superscalar processor is fundamentally limited because it cannot execute independent regions of code concurrently. Higher performance can be obtained with machines, such as multiprocessors and dataflow  machines, that can simultaneously follow multiple flows of control. Finally, without speculative execution to allow instructions to execute before their control dependences are resolved, only modest amounts of parallelism can be obtained for programs with complex control flow.","author":["Monica S.

In this survey, we discuss the issues that must be addressed in the development of a Web clustering engine, including acquisition and preprocessing of search results, their clustering and visualization. Search results clustering, the core of the system, has specific requirements that cannot be addressed by classical clustering algorithms. We emphasize the role played by the quality of the cluster labels as opposed to optimizing only the clustering structure. We highlight the main characteristics of a number of existing Web clustering engines and also discuss how to evaluate their retrieval performance. Some directions for future research are finally presented.","author":["Claudio Carpineto","Stanislaw Osi\u0144ski","Giovanni Romano","Dawid Weiss"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 41","Issue 3","July 2009","Article No.: 17","pp   1\u201338","https://doi.org/10.1145/1541880.1541884"],"date":"30 July 2009","ref":[{"text":"Abney, S. 1991.

There are now more than 3.3 billion active cell phones in the world-a device that we now all depend on in our daily lives. The current generation of devices employs a combination of general-purpose processors, digital signal processors, and hardwired accelerators to provide giga-operations-per-second performance on milliWatt power budgets. Such heterogeneous organizations are inefficient to build and maintain, as well as waste silicon area and power. Looking forward to the next generation of mobile computing, computation requirements will increase by one to three orders of magnitude due to higher data rates, increased complexity algorithms, and greater computation diversity but the power requirements will be just as stringent. Scaling of existing approaches will not suffice instead the inherent computational efficiency, programmability, and adaptability of the hardware must change. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an example architecture, referred to as AnySP, for the next generation mobile signal processing. AnySP uses a co-design approach where the next generation wireless signal processing and high-definition video algorithms are analyzed to create a domain specific programmable architecture. At the heart of AnySP is a configurable single-instruction multiple-data datapath that is capable of processing wide vectors or multiple narrow vectors simultaneously. In addition, deeper computation subgraphs can be pipelined across the single-instruction multiple-data lanes. These three operating modes provide high throughput across varying application types. Results show that AnySP is capable of sustaining 4G wireless processing and high-definition video throughput rates, and will approach the 1000 Mops/mW efficiency barrier when scaled to 45nm.","author":["Mark Woh","Sangwon Seo","Scott Mahlke","Trevor Mudge","Chaitali Chakrabarti","Krisztian Flautner"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 37","Issue 3","June 2009","pp   128\u2013139","https://doi.org/10.1145/1555815.1555773"],"date":"20 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"J.

While CMOS-compatible nanophotonics has emerged as a leading candidate for replacing global wires beyond the 22nm timeframe, on-chip optical interconnect architectures proposed thus far are either limited in scalability or are dependent on comparatively slow electrical control networks.In this paper, we present Phastlane, a hybrid electrical/optical routing network for future large scale, cache coherent multicore microprocessors. The heart of the Phastlane network is a low-latency optical crossbar that uses simple predecoded source routing to transmit cache-line-sized packets several hops in a single clock cycle under contentionless conditions. When contention exists, the router makes use of electrical buffers and, if necessary, a high speed drop signaling network. Overall, Phastlane achieve 2X better network performance than a state-of-the-art electrical baseline while consuming 80% less network power.","author":["Mark J. Cianchetti","Joseph C.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to efficiently extract the worst-case corners for nanoscale ICs. Our proposed approach mathematically formulates a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem for corner extraction. Next, it applies the Lagrange duality theory to convert the non-convex QCQP problem to a convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problem that is easier to solve. Our circuit example designed in a commercial CMOS process demonstrates that the proposed SDP formulation can find the worst-case corners both efficiently and robustly, while the traditional QCQP fails to achieve global convergence.","author":["Hong Zhang","Tsung-Hao Chen","Ming-Yuan Ting","Xin Li"],"issue":["DAC '09: Proceedings of the 46th Annual Design Automation Conference","July 2009","Pages   386\u2013389","https://doi.org/10.1145/1629911.1630013"],"date":"26 July 2009","ref":[{"text":"Semiconductor Industry Associate,","order":1},{"text":"X.

Large SRAM structures used for caches are particularly sensitive to process variation due to their high density and organization. Designers typically over-provision caches with additional resources to overcome the hard-faults. However, static allocation and binding of redundant resources results in low utilization of the extra resources and ultimately limits the number of defects that can be tolerated. This work re-examines the design of process variation tolerant on-chip caches with the focus on flexibility and dynamic reconfigurability to allow a large number defects to be tolerated with modest hardware overhead. Our approach, ZerehCache, combines redundant data array elements with a permutation network for providing a higher degree of freedom on replacement. A graph coloring algorithm is used to configure the network and find the proper mapping of replacement elements. We perform an extensive design space exploration of both L1/L2 caches to identify several Pareto optimal ZerehCaches. For the yield analysis, a population of 1000 chips was studied at the 45nm technology node; L1 designs with 16% and an L2 designs with 8% area overheads achieve yields of 99% and 96%, respectively.","author":["Amin Ansari","Shantanu Gupta","Shuguang Feng","Scott Mahlke"],"issue":["MICRO 42: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2009","Pages   100\u2013110","https://doi.org/10.1145/1669112.1669127"],"date":"12 December 2009","ref":[{"text":"D.

At the microarchitectural level, McPAT includes models for the fundamental components of a chip multiprocessor, including in-order and out-of-order processor cores, networks-on-chip, shared caches, integrated memory controllers, and multiple-domain clocking. At the circuit and technology levels, McPAT supports critical-path timing modeling, area modeling, and dynamic, short-circuit, and leakage power modeling for each of the device types forecast in the ITRS roadmap including bulk CMOS, SOI, and doublegate transistors. McPAT has a flexible XML interface to facilitate its use with many performance simulators. Combined with a performance simulator, McPAT enables architects to consistently quantify the cost of new ideas and assess tradeoffs of different architectures using new metrics like energy-delay-area2 product (EDA2P) and energy-delay-area product (EDAP). This paper explores the interconnect options of future manycore processors by varying the degree of clustering over generations of process technologies. Clustering will bring interesting tradeoffs between area and performance because the interconnects needed to group cores into clusters incur area overhead, but many applications can make good use of them due to synergies of cache sharing. Combining power, area, and timing results of McPAT with performance simulation of PARSEC benchmarks at the 22nm technology node for both common in-order and out-of-order manycore designs shows that when die cost is not taken into account clustering 8 cores together gives the best energy-delay product, whereas when cost is taken into account configuring clusters with 4 cores gives the best EDA2P and EDAP.","author":["Sheng Li","Jung Ho Ahn","Richard D.

The Axel system enables the first demonstration of FPGAs, GPUs and CPUs running collaboratively for N-body simulation.

To address this problem, we have designed and implemented an open architecture and API for such cameras: the Frankencamera. It consists of a base hardware specification, a software stack based on Linux, and an API for C++. Our architecture permits control and synchronization of the sensor and image processing pipeline at the microsecond time scale, as well as the ability to incorporate and synchronize external hardware like lenses and flashes. This paper specifies our architecture and API, and it describes two reference implementations we have built. Using these implementations we demonstrate six computational photography applications: HDR viewfinding and capture, low-light viewfinding and capture, automated acquisition of extended dynamic range panoramas, foveal imaging, IMU-based hand shake detection, and rephotography. Our goal is to standardize the architecture and distribute Frankencameras to researchers and students, as a step towards creating a community of photographer-programmers who develop algorithms, applications, and hardware for computational cameras.","author":["Andrew Adams","Eino-Ville Talvala","Sung Hee Park","David E.

We show how the joint architecture-circuit space provides a trade-off range of approximately 6.5x in performance for 4x energy, and we identify the optimal architectures for different design objectives. We then show that many of the designs in this space come at very high marginal costs. Our results show that, for a large range of design objectives, voltage scaling is effective in efficiently trading off performance and energy, and that the choice of optimal architecture and circuits does not change much during voltage scaling. Finally, we show that with only two designs--a dual-issue in-order design and a dual-issue out-of-order design, both properly optimized-a large part of the energy-performance trade-off space can be covered within 3% of the optimal energy-efficiency.","author":["Omid Azizi","Aqeel Mahesri","Benjamin C.

FPGAs using non-volatile memories have been the focus of attention with zero boot-up delay, real-time reconfigurability, and superior energy efficiency. This paper presents a novel three-dimensional (3D) non-volatile FPGA architecture (3D-Non-FAR) using phase change memory (PCM) and 3D die stacking techniques. Basic structures in a conventional FPGA architecture are renovated with PCM, and components are repartitioned and reorganized in 3D-NonFAR to allow an efficient 3D integration of PCM elements. 3D-NonFAR not only preserves the advantages of existing non-volatile FPGAs, but also provides high integration density, high performance, and bit-level programmability, which enable PCM as a universal memory replacement in FPGAs. Evaluation results show that 3D-NonFAR has smaller footprint, higher performance, and lower power consumption compared with other FPGA counterparts.","author":["Yibo Chen","Jishen Zhao","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["ISLPED '10: Proceedings of the 16th ACM/IEEE international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2010","Pages   55\u201360","https://doi.org/10.1145/1840845.1840857"],"date":"18 August 2010","ref":[{"text":"K.

Low-level design tools are increasingly required for RC bitstream debugging and IP core design assurance, particularly in multiparty Partially Reconfigurable (PR) designs. While tools for low-level analysis of design netlists do exist, there is increasing demand for automated and customisable bitstream analysis tools.This article discusses the need for low-level IP core verification within PR-enabled FPGA systems and reports FDAT (FPGA Design Analysis Tool), a versatile, modular and open tools framework for low-level analysis and verification of FPGA designs. FDAT provides a set of high-level Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) abstracting the Xilinx FPGA fabric, the implemented design (e.g., placed and routed netlist) and the related bitstream. A lightweight graphic front-end allows custom visualisation of the design within the FPGA fabric. The operation of FDAT is governed by \u201crecipe\u201d scripts which support rapid prototyping of the abstract algorithms for system-level design verification. FDAT recipes, being Python scripts, can be ported to embedded FPGA systems, for example, the previously reported Secure Reconfiguration Controller (SeReCon) which enforces an IP core spatial isolation policy in order to provide run-time protection to the PR system.The paper illustrates the application of FDAT for bit-pattern analysis of Virtex-II Pro and Virtex-5 inter-tile routing and verification of the spatial isolation between designs.","author":["K.

This information is obtained through low-level processing of sensory media streams, which are usually noisy and imprecise, leading to many undesired consequences such as false alarms, service interruptions, and often violation of privacy. Therefore, we need a mechanism to compute the quality of sensor-driven information that would help a user or a system in making an informed decision and improve the automated monitoring process. In this article, we propose a model to characterize such quality of information in a multisensor multimedia monitoring system in terms of certainty, accuracy/confidence and timeliness. Our model adopts a multimodal fusion approach to obtain the target information and dynamically compute these attributes based on the observations of the participating sensors. We consider the environment context, the agreement/disagreement among the sensors, and their prior confidence in the fusion process in determining the information of interest. The proposed method is demonstrated by developing and deploying a real-time monitoring system in a simulated smart environment. The effectiveness and suitability of the method has been demonstrated by dynamically assessing the value of the three quality attributes with respect to the detection and identification of human presence in the environment.","author":["M.

Unlike other technologies supporting science, software can be copied and distributed at essentially no cost, potentially opening the door to unprecedented levels of sharing and collaborative innovation. Yet we do not have a clear picture of how software development for science fits into the day-to-day practice of science, or how well the methods and incentives of its production facilitate realization of this potential. We report the results of a multiple-case study of software development in three fields: high energy physics, structural biology, and microbiology. In each case, we identify a typical publication, and use qualitative methods to explore the production of the software used in the science represented by the publication. We identify several different production systems, characterized primarily by differences in incentive structures. We identify ways in which incentives are matched and mismatched with the needs of the science fields, especially with respect to collaboration.","author":["James Howison","James D.

The algorithm proposes and evaluates multiple moves in parallel, and has been incorporated into Altera\u2019s Quartus II CAD system. Across a set of 18 industrial benchmark circuits, we achieve geometric average speedups during the quench of 2.7x and 4.0x on four and eight processors, respectively, with individual circuits achieving speedups of up to 3.6x and 5.9x. Over the course of the entire anneal, we achieve speedups of up to 2.8x and 3.7x, with geometric average speedups of 2.1x and 2.4x.Our algorithm is the first parallel placer to optimize for criteria other than wirelength, such as critical path length, and is one of the few deterministic parallel placement algorithms. We discuss the challenges involved in combining these two features and the new techniques we used to overcome them. We also quantify the impact of maintaining determinism on eight cores, and find that while it reduces performance by approximately 15% relative to an ideal speedup of 8.0x, hardware limitations are a larger factor and reduce performance by 30--40%. We then suggest possible enhancements to allow our approach to scale to 16 cores and beyond.","author":["Adrian Ludwin","Vaughn Betz"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 16","Issue 3","June 2011","Article No.: 22","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/1970353.1970355"],"date":"01 June 2011","ref":[{"text":"1986.

Using in-depth semi-structured interviewing we invited practitioners to reflect on their experiences and selected three to use as exemplars or case studies. In documenting some details of attempts to deploy model driven practices, we identify some 'lessons learned', in particular the importance of complex organizational, managerial and social factors - as opposed to simple technical factors - in the relative success, or failure, of the endeavour. As an example of organizational change management the successful deployment of model driven engineering appears to require: a progressive and iterative approach; transparent organizational commitment and motivation; integration with existing organizational processes and a clear business focus.","author":["John Hutchinson","Mark Rouncefield","Jon Whittle"],"issue":["ICSE '11: Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Software Engineering","May 2011","Pages   633\u2013642","https://doi.org/10.1145/1985793.1985882"],"date":"21 May 2011","ref":[{"text":"Afonso, M., Vogel, R., and Teixeira, J., \"From code-centric to model-centric software engineering: practical case study of MDD infusion in a systems integration company,\" in Workshop on MBD/MOMPES, 2006.","doi":"10.1109/MBD-MOMPES.2006.13","order":1},{"text":"Anda, B., Hansen, K., Gullesen, I., and Thorsen, H., \"Experiences from Introducing UML-based Development in a Large Safety-Critical Project,\" Emprical Software Engineering, vol. 11, pp. 555--581, 2006.","doi":"10.1007/s10664-006-9020-6","order":2},{"text":"Arisholm, E., Briand, L., Hove, S.

Exploiting energy-accuracy trade-offs is an attractive choice in applications that can tolerate inaccuracies. Recent work has explored exposing this trade-off in programming models. A key challenge, though, is how to isolate parts of the program that must be precise from those that can be approximated so that a program functions correctly even as quality of service degrades.We propose using type qualifiers to declare data that may be subject to approximate computation. Using these types, the system automatically maps approximate variables to low-power storage, uses low-power operations, and even applies more energy-efficient algorithms provided by the programmer. In addition, the system can statically guarantee isolation of the precise program component from the approximate component. This allows a programmer to control explicitly how information flows from approximate data to precise data. Importantly, employing static analysis eliminates the need for dynamic checks, further improving energy savings. As a proof of concept, we develop EnerJ, an extension to Java that adds approximate data types. We also propose a hardware architecture that offers explicit approximate storage and computation. We port several applications to EnerJ and show that our extensions are expressive and effective; a small number of annotations lead to significant potential energy savings (10%-50%) at very little accuracy cost.","author":["Adrian Sampson","Werner Dietl","Emily Fortuna","Danushen Gnanapragasam","Luis Ceze","Dan Grossman"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 46","Issue 6","June 2011","pp   164\u2013174","https://doi.org/10.1145/1993316.1993518"],"date":"04 June 2011","ref":[{"text":"A.

To lower power consumption, one way is to reduce the supply voltage as in multisupply voltage (MSV) designs. In region-based MSV, a circuit will be partitioned into \u201cvoltage islands\u201d where each island occupies a contiguous physical space and operates at one supply voltage. In the work of Wu et al. [2005], this voltage supply problem is addressed, and the input placement is partitioned into a set of rectangular voltage islands by a slicing structure. However, the constraint of using a slicing structure prohibits better solutions in their approach. In the work of Ching et al. [2006], the constraint of obtaining rectangular shapes is relaxed; their method forms islands of very irregular shapes. In this article, we propose a method that focuses on forming rectangular voltage islands to minimize the power consumption, while at the same time favoring the power routing step. It is found that, even with this reduced flexibility on island shapes, we can still perform as well as, or in some cases, even better than the previous work of Ching et al. [2006] that does not control the shapes of the islands, in terms of power saving and island number.","author":["Mario K. Y. Leung","Eric K. I. Chio","Evangeline F. Y.

This paper presents the design and evaluation of the EM-MAC (Efficient Multichannel MAC) protocol, which addresses these challenges through the introduction of novel mechanisms for adaptive receiver-initiated multichannel rendezvous and predictive wake-up scheduling. EM-MAC substantially enhances wireless channel utilization and transmission efficiency while resisting wireless interference and jamming by enabling every node to dynamically optimize the selection of wireless channels it utilizes based on the channel conditions it senses, without use of any reserved control channel. EM-MAC achieves high energy efficiency by enabling a sender to predict the receiver's wake-up channel and wake-up time Implemented in TinyOS on MICAz motes, EM-MAC substantially outperformed other MAC protocols studied. EM-MAC maintained the lowest sender and receiver duty cycles, the lowest packet delivery latency, and 100% packet delivery ratio across all experiments. Our evaluation includes single-hop and multihop flows, as well as experiments with heavy ZigBee interference, constant ZigBee jamming, and Wi-Fi interference.","author":["Lei Tang","Yanjun Sun","Omer Gurewitz","David B.

Sequences of time-orderedimages allow the estimation of projected two-dimensional image motion as either instantaneous image velocities or discrete image displacements. These are usually called the optical flow field or the image velocity field. Provided that optical flow is a reliable approximation to two-dimensional image motion, it may then be used to recover the three-dimensional motion of the visual sensor (to within a scale factor) and the three-dimensional surface structure (shape or relative depth) through assumptions concerning the structure of the optical flow field, the three-dimensional environment, and the motion of the sensor. Optical flow may also be used to perform motion detection, object segmentation, time-to-collision and focus of expansion calculations, motion compensated encoding, and stereo disparity measurement. We investigate the computation of optical flow in this survey: widely known methods for estimating optical flow are classified and examined by scrutinizing the hypothesis and assumptions they use. The survey concludes with a discussion of current research issues.","author":["S. S. Beauchemin","J. L.

This problem is exacerbated because of the high variability in lifetime across PCM cells, resulting in weaker cells failing much earlier than nominal cells. Ensuring long lifetimes under high variability requires that the design can correct a large number of errors for any given memory line. Unfortunately, supporting high levels of error correction for all lines incurs significantly high overhead, often exceeding 10% of overall memory capacity. Such an overhead may be too high for wide-scale adoption of PCM, given that memory market is typically very cost-sensitive. This paper reduces the storage required for error correction by making the key observation that only a few lines require high levels of hard-error correction. Therefore, prior approaches that uniformly allocated large number of error correction entries for all lines are inefficient, as most (> 90%) of these entries remain unused. We propose Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG), an efficient hard-error resilient architecture that allocates error correction entries in proportion to the number of hard-faults in the line. We describe a storage-efficient and low-latency organization for PAYG. Compared to the previously proposed ECP-6 technique, PAYG requires 3X lower storage overhead and yet provides 13% more lifetime, while incurring a latency overhead of < 0.4% for the first five years of system lifetime. We also show that PAYG is more effective than the recent FREE-p proposal.","author":["Moinuddin K.

Its distinctive characteristic to record the historic profile of the voltage/current creates a great potential for future neuromorphic computing system design. However, at the nano-scale, process variation control in the manufacturing of memristor devices is very difficult. The impact of process variations on a memristive system that relies on the continuous (analog) states of the memristors could be significant. We use TiO2-based memristor as an example to analyze the impact of geometry variations on the electrical properties. A simple algorithm was proposed to generate a large volume of geometry variation-aware three-dimensional device structures for Monte-Carlo simulations. A neuromorphic computing system based on memristor-based bidirectional synapse design is proposed as case study. We analyze and evaluate the robustness of the proposed system in pattern recognition based on massive Monte-Carlo simulations, after considering input defects and process variations.","author":["Robinson E.

Recently, related studies have shown the feasibility of identifying RFID-enabled devices based on physical-layer fingerprints. In this work, we leverage on these findings and demonstrate that physical-layer identification of HF RFID devices is also practical, that is, can achieve high accuracy and stability. We propose an improved hardware setup and enhanced techniques for fingerprint extraction and matching. Our new system enables device identification with an Equal Error Rate as low as 0.005 (0.5%) on a set 50 HF RFID smart cards of the same manufacturer and type. We further investigate the fingerprint stability over an extended period of time and across different acquisition setups. In the latter case, we propose a solution based on channel equalization that preserves the fingerprint quality across setups. Our results strengthen the practical use of physical-layer identification of RFID devices in product and document anti-counterfeiting solutions.","author":["Boris Danev","Srdjan Capkun","Ramya Jayaram Masti","Thomas S.

The quality of data from those sources is very diverse, as values may be out of date, incomplete or incorrect. Moreover, data sources may provide conflicting values for a single real-world object. In order for Linked Data applications to consume data from this global data space in an integrated fashion, a number of challenges have to be overcome. One of these challenges is to rate and to integrate data based on their quality. However, quality is a very subjective matter, and finding a canonic judgement that is suitable for each and every task is not feasible. To simplify the task of consuming high-quality data, we present Sieve, a framework for flexibly expressing quality assessment methods as well as fusion methods. Sieve is integrated into the Linked Data Integration Framework (LDIF), which handles Data Access, Schema Mapping and Identity Resolution, all crucial preliminaries for quality assessment and fusion. We demonstrate Sieve in a data integration scenario importing data from the English and Portuguese versions of DBpedia, and discuss how we increase completeness, conciseness and consistency through the use of our framework.","author":["Pablo N.

This forces a NAND flash memory file system to scan the whole flash memory during its mount rather than saving frequently updated file system information in a fixed area. Since the mount time linearly increases with the size of NAND flash memory, boot times of embedded systems are also linearly increased. In addition, since data loss may occur if a file system terminates abnormally due to unexpected errors, a stability scheme for NAND flash memory file system is in great demand. To resolve these problems, this article suggests an extended logical block called Exblock (Extended Block) and a table called SNode (Snapshot Node) to reduce the mount time and proposes a new journaling scheme to improve stability for an enhanced file system for NAND flash memory storage called ENFFiS (Enhanced NAND Flash memory File System). It also proposes a new cache policy to improve read/write performances. ENFFiS shows better performance than existing file systems in terms of reading, writing, mount time and stability.","author":["Sang Oh Park","Sung Jo Kim"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 12","Issue 2","February 2013","Article No.: 23","pp   1\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/2423636.2423641"],"date":"22 February 2013","ref":[{"text":"Aleph One 2006.

In this paper, we first demonstrate the possible effects of process variations on DRAM performance and power consumption by performing Monte-Carlo simulations on a detailed DRAM cross-section. We then propose a methodology to empirically determine the actual impact for any given DRAM memory by assessing its performance characteristics during the DRAM calibration phase at system boot-time, thereby enabling its optimal use at run-time. We further employ our analysis on Micron's 2Gb DDR3-1600-x16 memory and show considerable over-estimation in the datasheet measures and the energy estimates (up to 28%), by using realistic current measures for a set of MediaBench applications.","author":["Karthik Chandrasekar","Christian Weis","Benny Akesson","Norbert Wehn","Kees Goossens"],"issue":["DAC '13: Proceedings of the 50th Annual Design Automation Conference","May 2013","Article No.: 23","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/2463209.2488762"],"date":"29 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"C.

There is no doubt the era of big data has arrived. This paper explores targeted deployment of hardware accelerators to improve the throughput and energy efficiency of large-scale data processing. In particular, data partitioning is a critical operation for manipulating large data sets. It is often the limiting factor in database performance and represents a significant fraction of the overall runtime of large data queries. To accelerate partitioning, this paper describes a hardware accelerator for range partitioning, or HARP, and a hardware-software data streaming framework. The streaming framework offers a seamless execution environment for streaming accelerators such as HARP. Together, HARP and the streaming framework provide an order of magnitude improvement in partitioning performance and energy. A detailed analysis of a 32nm physical design shows 7.8 times the throughput of a highly optimized and optimistic software implementation, while consuming just 6.9% of the area and 4.3% of the power of a single Xeon core in the same technology generation.","author":["Lisa Wu","Raymond J.

For server and high-performance computing markets, however, such DRAM caches must also provide sufficient support for reliability and fault tolerance. While conventional off-chip memory provides ECC support by adding one or more extra chips, this may not be practical in a 3D stack. In this paper, we present a DRAM cache organization that uses error-correcting codes (ECCs), strong checksums (CRCs), and dirty data duplication to detect and correct a wide range of stacked DRAM failures, from traditional bit errors to large-scale row, column, bank, and channel failures. With only a modest performance degradation compared to a DRAM cache with no ECC support, our proposal can correct all single-bit failures, and 99.9993% of all row, column, and bank failures, providing more than a 54,000x improvement in the FIT rate of silent-data corruptions compared to basic SECDED ECC protection.","author":["Jaewoong Sim","Gabriel H.

These graphs are massive, often containing hundreds of millions of nodes and billions of edges. While some theoretical models have been proposed to study such graphs, their analysis is still difficult due to the scale and nature of the data. We propose a framework for large-scale graph decomposition and inference. To resolve the scale, our framework is distributed so that the data are partitioned over a shared-nothing set of machines. We propose a novel factorization technique that relies on partitioning a graph so as to minimize the number of neighboring vertices rather than edges across partitions. Our decomposition is based on a streaming algorithm. It is network-aware as it adapts to the network topology of the underlying computational hardware. We use local copies of the variables and an efficient asynchronous communication protocol to synchronize the replicated values in order to perform most of the computation without having to incur the cost of network communication. On a graph of 200 million vertices and 10 billion edges, derived from an email communication network, our algorithm retains convergence properties while allowing for almost linear scalability in the number of computers.","author":["Amr Ahmed","Nino Shervashidze","Shravan Narayanamurthy","Vanja Josifovski","Alexander J.

An effective way of improving performance in the face of bandwidth and power limitations is to rely on associative memory systems. Recent work on a PCM-based, associative TCAM accelerator shows that associative search capability can reduce both off-chip bandwidth demand and overall system energy. Unfortunately, previously proposed resistive TCAM accelerators have limited flexibility: only a restricted (albeit important) class of applications can benefit from a TCAM accelerator, and the implementation is confined to resistive memory technologies with a high dynamic range (RHigh/RLow), such as PCM.This work proposes AC-DIMM, a flexible, high-performance associative compute engine built on a DDR3-compatible memory module. AC-DIMM addresses the limited flexibility of previous resistive TCAM accelerators by combining two powerful capabilities---associative search and processing in memory. Generality is improved by augmenting a TCAM system with a set of integrated, user programmable microcontrollers that operate directly on search results, and by architecting the system such that key-value pairs can be co-located in the same TCAM row. A new, bit-serial TCAM array is proposed, which enables the system to be implemented using STT-MRAM. AC-DIMM achieves a 4.2X speedup and a 6.5X energy reduction over a conventional RAM-based system on a set of 13 evaluated applications.","author":["Qing Guo","Xiaochen Guo","Ravi Patel","Engin Ipek","Eby G.

As a proof of concept, we present the instruction set architecture, microarchitecture, and hardware implementation of one DPU, called Q100. The Q100 has a collection of heterogeneous ASIC tiles that process relational tables and columns quickly and energy-efficiently. The architecture uses coarse grained in- structions that manipulate streams of data, thereby maximizing pipeline and data parallelism, and minimizing the need to time multiplex the accelerator tiles and spill inter- mediate results to memory. This work explores a Q100 de- sign space of 150 configurations, selecting three for further analysis: a small, power-conscious implementation, a high- performance implementation, and a balanced design that maximizes performance per Watt. We then demonstrate that the power-conscious Q100 handles the TPC-H queries with three orders of magnitude less energy than a state of the art software DBMS, while the performance-oriented design out- performs the same DBMS by 70X.","author":["Lisa Wu","Andrea Lottarini","Timothy K.

Simulation results show that our platform is potentially a versatile graphics solution for future application processors as it provides a real-time ray tracing performance at full HD resolution that can compete with that of existing desktop GPU ray tracers.

Our method relies on the use of a semantic network, namely the DBpedia knowledge base, for acquiring fine-grained information about entities and their semantic relations, thus resulting in a knowledge-rich document model. We demonstrate the benefits of these semantic representations in two tasks: entity ranking and computing document semantic similarity. To this end, we couple DBpedia's structure with an information-theoretic measure of concept association, based on its explicit semantic relations, and compute semantic similarity using a Graph Edit Distance based measure, which finds the optimal matching between the documents' entities using the Hungarian method. Experimental results show that our general model outperforms baselines built on top of traditional methods, and achieves a performance close to that of highly specialized methods that have been tuned to these specific tasks.","author":["Michael Schuhmacher","Simone Paolo Ponzetto"],"issue":["WSDM '14: Proceedings of the 7th ACM international conference on Web search and data mining","February 2014","Pages   543\u2013552","https://doi.org/10.1145/2556195.2556250"],"date":"24 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"E.

Prior work has focused on modeling the reliability of individual workers, for instance, by way of confusion matrices, and using these latent traits to estimate the true labels more accurately. However, this strategy becomes ineffective when there are too few labels per worker to reliably estimate their quality. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel community-based Bayesian label aggregation model, CommunityBCC, which assumes that crowd workers conform to a few different types, where each type represents a group of workers with similar confusion matrices. We assume that each worker belongs to a certain community, where the worker's confusion matrix is similar to (a perturbation of) the community's confusion matrix. Our model can then learn a set of key latent features: (i) the confusion matrix of each community, (ii) the community membership of each user, and (iii) the aggregated label of each item. We compare the performance of our model against established aggregation methods on a number of large-scale, real-world crowdsourcing datasets. Our experimental results show that our CommunityBCC model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art label aggregation methods, requiring, on average, 50% less data to pass the 90% accuracy mark.","author":["Matteo Venanzi","John Guiver","Gabriella Kazai","Pushmeet Kohli","Milad Shokouhi"],"issue":["WWW '14: Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World wide web","April 2014","Pages   155\u2013164","https://doi.org/10.1145/2566486.2567989"],"date":"07 April 2014","ref":[{"text":"Y.

Our approximation scheme builds on the observation that, in well-conditioned problems, many elements in the decomposition nearly vanish. Such elements may be pruned from the dependency graph with mild accuracy degradation. Using an example from image-domain warping, we show that pruning reduces the amount of operations per solve by over 75%, resulting in significant savings in computing time, area or energy.","author":["Michael Schaffner","Frank K.

Releasing this constraint by allowing timing violations could lead to significant performance improvements, but conventional forms of computer arithmetic do not fail gracefully when pushed beyond deterministic operation. In this paper we take a fresh look at Online Arithmetic, originally proposed for digit serial operation, and synthesize unrolled digit parallel online operators to allow for graceful degradation. We quantify the impact of timing violation on key arithmetic primitives, and show that substantial performance benefits can be obtained in comparison to binary arithmetic. Since timing errors are caused by long carry chains, these result in errors in least significant digits with online arithmetic, causing less impact than conventional implementations. Using analytical models and empirical FPGA results from an image processing application, we demonstrate an error reduction over 89% and an improvement in SNR of over 20dB for the same clock rate.","author":["Kan Shi","David Boland","Edward Stott","Samuel Bayliss","George A.

The thermal analysis is sensitive to detailed device specifications (including its material composition and 3-D layout) as well as different use cases (each case specifying the set of active device components and their activity levels). Therminator considers all major components within the device, builds a corresponding compact thermal model for each component and the whole device, and produces their steady-state temperature maps. Temperature results obtained by using Therminator have been validated against a commercial computational fluid dynamics-based tool, i.e., Autodesk Simulation CFD, and thermocouple measurements on a Qualcomm Mobile Developer Platform.

One component of MPI is collective communication and its performance is key for certain parallel applications to achieve good speedups. Previous work showed that, with synthetic communication-only benchmarks, communication improvements of up to 11.4-fold and 22-fold for broadcast and reduce operations, respectively, can be achieved by providing hardware support at the network level in a Network-on-Chip (NoC). However, these numbers do not provide a good estimation of the advantage for actual applications, as there are other factors that affect performance besides communications, such as computation. To this end, we extend our previous work by evaluating the impact of hardware support over a set of five parallel application kernels of varying computation-to-communication ratios. By introducing some useful computation to the performance evaluation, we obtain more representative results of the benefits of adding hardware support for broadcast and reduce operations. The experiments show that applications with lower computation-to-communication ratios benefit the most from hardware support as they highly depend on efficient collective communications to achieve better scalability. We also extend our work by doing more analysis on clock frequency, resource usage, power, and energy. The results show reasonable scalability for resource utilization and power in the network interfaces as the number of channels increases and that, even though more power is dissipated in the network interfaces due to the added hardware, the total energy used can still be less if the actual speedup is sufficient. The application kernels are executed in a 24-embedded-processor system distributed across four FPGAs.","author":["Yuanxi Peng","Manuel Salda\u00f1a","Christopher A.

It is important that these benchmarks reflect modern large-scale systems that make use of heterogeneous resources; however, most current FPGA benchmarks are both small and simple. In this artile, we present Titan, a hybrid CAD flow that addresses these issues. The flow uses Altera\u2019s Quartus II FPGA CAD software to perform HDL synthesis and a conversion tool to translate the result into the academic Berkeley Logic Interchange Format (BLIF). Using this flow, we created the Titan23 benchmark set, which consists of 23 large (90K--1.8M block) benchmark circuits covering a wide range of application domains. Using the Titan23 benchmarks and an enhanced model of Altera\u2019s Stratix IV architecture, including a detailed timing model, we compare the performance and quality of VPR and Quartus II targeting the same architecture. We found that VPR is at least 2.8 \u00d7 slower, uses 6.2 \u00d7 more memory, 2.2 \u00d7 more wire, and produces critical paths 1.5 \u00d7 slower compared to Quartus II. Finally, we identified that VPR\u2019s focus on achieving a dense packing and an inability to take apart clusters is responsible for a large portion of the wire length and critical path delay gap.","author":["Kevin E.

To achieve location distinction, recent research has been focused on investigating the spatial uncorrelation property of wireless channels. Specifically, the differences of wireless channel characteristics are used to distinguish locations or identify location changes. However, we discover a new attack against all existing location distinction approaches that are built on the spatial uncorrelation property of wireless channels. In such an attack, the adversary can easily hide her location changes or impersonate movements by injecting fake wireless channel characteristics into a target receiver. Experimental results on our USRP-based prototype show that the discovered attack can craft any desired channel characteristic with a successful probability of 95.0% to defeat spatial uncorrelation based location distinction schemes. To defend against this attack, we propose a detection technique that utilizes an auxiliary receiver or antenna to identify these fake channel characteristics. Experiments demonstrate that our novel detection method achieves a detection rate higher than 91.2% while maintaining a very low false alarm rate.","author":["Song Fang","Yao Liu","Wenbo Shen","Haojin Zhu"],"issue":["MobiCom '14: Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking","September 2014","Pages   225\u2013236","https://doi.org/10.1145/2639108.2639117"],"date":"07 September 2014","ref":[{"text":"N.

The proposed architecture comprises three key components: spatial-spectral encoded optical camera design, over-complete HS dictionary learning and sparse-constraint computational reconstruction. Our spatial-spectral encoded sampling scheme provides a higher degree of randomness in the measured projections than previous compressive HS imaging approaches; and a robust nonlinear sparse reconstruction method is employed to recover the HS images from the coded projection with higher performance. To exploit the sparsity constraint on the nature HS images for computational reconstruction, an over-complete HS dictionary is learned to represent the HS images in a sparser way than previous representations. We validate the proposed approach on both synthetic and real captured data, and show successful recovery of HS images for both indoor and outdoor scenes. In addition, we demonstrate other applications for the over-complete HS dictionary and sparse coding techniques, including 3D HS images compression and denoising.","author":["Xing Lin","Yebin Liu","Jiamin Wu","Qionghai Dai"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 33","Issue 6","November 2014","Article No.: 233","pp   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/2661229.2661262"],"date":"19 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"Aharon, M., Elad, M., and Bruckstein, A. 2006.

Most existing I/O scheduling algorithms in the host interface logic (HIL) of state-of-the-art SSDs are oblivious to such low-level performance bottlenecks in SSDs. As a result, SSDs may violate quality of service (QoS) requirements by not being able to meet the deadlines of I/O requests. In this paper, we propose a novel host interface I/O scheduler that is both GC-aware and QoS-aware. The proposed scheduler redistributes the GC overheads across non-critical I/O requests and reduces channel resource contention. Our experiments with workloads from various application domains reveal that the proposed scheduler reduces the standard deviation for latency over stateof- the-art I/O schedulers used in the HIL by 52.5%, and the worst-case latency by 86.6%. In addition, for I/O requests with sizes smaller than a superpage, our proposed scheduler avoids channel resource conflicts and reduces latency by 29.2% compared to the state-of-the-art","author":["Myoungsoo Jung","Wonil Choi","Shekhar Srikantaiah","Joonhyuk Yoo","Mahmut T.

These faults are predicted to become more frequent in future systems that contain orders of magnitude more DRAM and SRAM than found in current memory subsystems. These memory subsystems will need to provide resilience techniques to tolerate these faults when deployed in high-performance computing systems and data centers containing tens of thousands of nodes. Therefore, it is critical to understand the efficacy of current hardware resilience techniques to determine whether they will be suitable for future systems. In this paper, we present a study of DRAM and SRAM faults and errors from the field. We use data from two leadership-class high-performance computer systems to analyze the reliability impact of hardware resilience schemes that are deployed in current systems. Our study has several key findings about the efficacy of many currently deployed reliability techniques such as DRAM ECC, DDR address/command parity, and SRAM ECC and parity. We also perform a methodological study, and find that counting errors instead of faults, a common practice among researchers and data center operators, can lead to incorrect conclusions about system reliability. Finally, we use our data to project the needs of future large-scale systems. We find that SRAM faults are unlikely to pose a significantly larger reliability threat in the future, while DRAM faults will be a major concern and stronger DRAM resilience schemes will be needed to maintain acceptable failure rates similar to those found on today's systems.","author":["Vilas Sridharan","Nathan DeBardeleben","Sean Blanchard","Kurt B.

Nevertheless, all known software fallbacks to date, from simple locks to sophisticated versions of the NOrec Hybrid TM algorithm, have either limited scalability or weakened semantics. We propose a novel reduced-hardware (RH) version of the NOrec HyTM algorithm. Instead of an all-software slow path, in our RH NOrec the slow-path is a \"mix\" of hardware and software: one short hardware transaction executes a maximal amount of initial reads in the hardware, and the second executes all of the writes. This novel combination of the RH approach and the NOrec algorithm delivers the first Hybrid TM that scales while fully preserving the hardware's original semantics of opacity and privatization. Our GCC implementation of RH NOrec is promising in that it shows improved performance relative to all prior methods, at the concurrency levels we could test today.","author":["Alexander Matveev","Nir Shavit"],"issue":["ASPLOS '15: Proceedings of the Twentieth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2015","Pages   59\u201371","https://doi.org/10.1145/2694344.2694393"],"date":"14 March 2015","ref":[{"text":"A.

Though PCM is one of the most promising candidates with commercial products available, its adoption has been greatly compromised by limited write endurance. As main memory is one of the most heavily accessed components, it is critical to prolong the lifetime of PCM.In this article, we present write-activity-aware page table management (WAPTM), a simple yet effective page table management scheme for reducing unnecessary writes, by redesigning system software and exploiting write-activity-aware features provided by the hardware. We implemented WAPTM in Google Android based on the ARM architecture and evaluated it with real Android applications. Experimental results show that WAPTM can significantly reduce writes in page tables, proving the feasibility and potential of prolonging the lifetime of PCM-based main memory through reducing writes at the OS level.","author":["Tianzheng Wang","Duo Liu","Yi Wang","Zili Shao"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 14","Issue 2","March 2015","Article No.: 34","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/2697394"],"date":"17 February 2015","ref":[{"text":"Sean Eron Anderson. 2005.

However, reliably inferring user behavior and context from noisy and complex sensor data collected under mobile device constraints remains an open problem, and a key bottleneck to sensor app development. In recent years, advances in the field of deep learning have resulted in nearly unprecedented gains in related inference tasks such as speech and object recognition. However, although mobile sensing shares many of the same data modeling challenges, we have yet to see deep learning be systematically studied within the sensing domain. If deep learning could lead to significantly more robust and efficient mobile sensor inference it would revolutionize the field by rapidly expanding the number of sensor apps ready for mainstream usage. In this paper, we provide preliminary answers to this potentially game-changing question by prototyping a low-power Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference engine that exploits both the CPU and DSP of a mobile device SoC. We use this engine to study typical mobile sensing tasks (e.g., activity recognition) using DNNs, and compare results to learning techniques in more common usage. Our early findings provide illustrative examples of DNN usage that do not overburden modern mobile hardware, while also indicating how they can improve inference accuracy. Moreover, we show DNNs can gracefully scale to larger numbers of inference classes and can be flexibly partitioned across mobile and remote resources. Collectively, these results highlight the critical need for further exploration as to how the field of mobile sensing can best make use of advances in deep learning towards robust and efficient sensor inference.","author":["Nicholas D.

Recently, the million scale labelled image dataset further contributes to the rebirth of deep convolutional neural network and bypass manual designing handcraft features. However, the construction process of image dataset is mainly manual-based and quite labor intensive, which often take years' efforts to construct a million scale dataset with high quality. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based method to construct large scale image dataset in an automatic way. Specifically, word representation and image representation are learned in a deep neural network from large amount of click-through logs, and further used to define word-word similarity and image-word similarity. These two similarities are used to automatize the two labor intensive steps in manual-based image dataset construction: query formation and noisy image removal. With a new proposed cross convolutional filter regularizer, we can construct a million scale image dataset in one week. Finally, two image datasets are constructed to verify the effectiveness of the method. In addition to scale, the automatically constructed dataset has comparable accuracy, diversity and cross-dataset generalization with manually labelled image datasets.","author":["Yalong Bai","Kuiyuan Yang","Wei Yu","Chang Xu","Wei-Ying Ma","Tiejun Zhao"],"issue":["MM '15: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2015","Pages   441\u2013450","https://doi.org/10.1145/2733373.2806243"],"date":"13 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"Y.

Such linguistic shifts are especially prevalent on the Internet, where the rapid exchange of ideas can quickly change a word's meaning. Our meta-analysis approach constructs property time series of word usage, and then uses statistically sound change point detection algorithms to identify significant linguistic shifts. We consider and analyze three approaches of increasing complexity to generate such linguistic property time series, the culmination of which uses distributional characteristics inferred from word co-occurrences. Using recently proposed deep neural language models, we first train vector representations of words for each time period. Second, we warp the vector spaces into one unified coordinate system. Finally, we construct a distance-based distributional time series for each word to track its linguistic displacement over time. We demonstrate that our approach is scalable by tracking linguistic change across years of micro-blogging using Twitter, a decade of product reviews using a corpus of movie reviews from Amazon, and a century of written books using the Google Book Ngrams. Our analysis reveals interesting patterns of language usage change commensurate with each medium.","author":["Vivek Kulkarni","Rami Al-Rfou","Bryan Perozzi","Steven Skiena"],"issue":["WWW '15: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web","May 2015","Pages   625\u2013635","https://doi.org/10.1145/2736277.2741627"],"date":"18 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"R.

However, stakeholders have little guidance for choosing fitting definitions and metrics for these quality properties, thus leading to potential misunderstandings. For example, cloud consumers and providers cannot negotiate reliable and quantitative service level objectives directly understood by each stakeholder. Objectives: Therefore, we examine existing definitions and metrics for these quality properties from the viewpoint of cloud consumers, cloud providers, and software architects with regard to commonly used concepts. Methods: We execute a systematic literature review (SLR), reproducibly collecting common concepts in definitions and metrics for scalability, elasticity, and efficiency. As quality selection criteria, we assess whether existing literature differentiates the three properties, exemplifies metrics, and considers typical cloud characteristics and cloud roles. Results: Our SLR yields 418 initial results from which we select 20 for in-depth evaluation based on our quality selection criteria. In our evaluation, we recommend concepts, definitions, and metrics for each property. Conclusions: Software architects can use our recommendations to analyze the quality of cloud computing applications. Cloud providers and cloud consumers can specify service level objectives based on our metric suggestions.","author":["Sebastian Lehrig","Hendrik Eikerling","Steffen Becker"],"issue":["QoSA '15: Proceedings of the 11th International ACM SIGSOFT Conference on Quality of Software Architectures","May 2015","Pages   83\u201392","https://doi.org/10.1145/2737182.2737185"],"date":"04 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"R.

The ability to offer guarantees to large transfers is crucial for business needs and impacts overall cost-of-business. State-of-the-art traffic engineering solutions only consider the current time epoch and hence cannot provide pre-facto promises for long-lived transfers. We present Tempus, an online traffic engineering scheme that exploits information on transfer size and deadlines to appropriately pack long-running transfers across network paths and time, thereby leaving enough capacity slack for future high-priority requests. Tempus builds on a tailored approximate solution to a mixed packing-covering linear program, which is parallelizable and scales well in both running time and memory usage. Consequently, Tempus is able to quickly and effectively update its solution when new transfers arrive or unexpected changes happen. These updates involve only small edits to existing transfers. Therefore, as experiments on traces from a large production WAN show, Tempus can offer and keep promises to long-lived transfers well in advance of their actual deadline; the promise on minimal transfer size is comparable with an offline optimal solution and outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by 2-3X.","author":["Srikanth Kandula","Ishai Menache","Roy Schwartz","Spandana Raj Babbula"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 44","Issue 4","October 2014","pp   515\u2013526","https://doi.org/10.1145/2740070.2626336"],"date":"17 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"D.

Most existing solutions, however, focus on the approximation of on-chip computations without considering that of off-chip data accesses, whose energy consumption may contribute to a significant portion of the total energy. In this work, we propose a novel approximate memory access technique for dynamic precision scaling, namely ApproxMA. To be specific, by taking both runtime data precision constraints and error-resilient capabilities of the application into consideration, ApproxMA determines the precision of data accesses and loads scaled data from off-chip memory for computation. Experimental results with mixture model-based clustering algorithms demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.","author":["Ye Tian","Qian Zhang","Ting Wang","Feng Yuan","Qiang Xu"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '15: Proceedings of the 25th edition on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2015","Pages   337\u2013342","https://doi.org/10.1145/2742060.2743759"],"date":"20 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"V.

In this paper, we present a low-latency generic accuracy configurable adder to support variable approximation modes. It provides a higher number of potential configurations compared to state-of-the-art, thus enabling a high degree of design flexibility and trade-off between performance and output quality. An error correction unit is integrated to provide accurate results for cases where high accuracy is required. Furthermore, an associated scheme for error probability estimation allows convenient comparison of different approximate adder configurations without requiring the need to numerically simulate the adder. Our experimental results validate the developed error model and also the lower latency of our generic accuracy configurable adder over state-of-the-art approximate adders. For functional verification and prototyping, we have used a Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA. Our adder model and synthesizable RTL are made open-source.","author":["Muhammad Shafique","Waqas Ahmad","Rehan Hafiz","J\u00f6rg Henkel"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 86","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744778"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"A.

SC computes with randomized bit-streams that loosely resemble the neural spike trains of the brain. Its key feature is the use of low-cost and low-power logic elements to implement complex numerical operations in a highly error-tolerant fashion. These advantages must be weighed against SC's inherently slow computing speed and low precision. Although studied sporadically since its invention in the 1960s, SC has regained interest recently as potentially suited to some emerging nanotechnologies, and to applications such as ECC decoding and biomedical image processing. However, a number of major challenges must be overcome if this potential is to be fully realized.","author":["John P.

In conventional design higher levels of synthesis have to deliver a gate and net list, from which layout synthesis has to built a mask specification for manufacturing. Analysis, mainly timing analysis, is built in a feedback loop to catch violations of timing requirements before sign-off. These violations are used to hand an updated specification to synthesis. Such iteration is not desirable, and for really high performance not feasible. To come to a design flow, higher level synthesis should distribute delay over the functional elements and interconnect, and layout synthesis should use its degrees of freedom to realize those delays.","author":["Ralph H.

However, there is a fundamental disconnect between the theoretical results and the practice of data analysis: the theory of statistical inference assumes a fixed collection of hypotheses to be tested, or learning algorithms to be applied, selected non-adaptively before the data are gathered, whereas in practice data is shared and reused with hypotheses and new analyses being generated on the basis of data exploration and the outcomes of previous analyses. In this work we initiate a principled study of how to guarantee the validity of statistical inference in adaptive data analysis. As an instance of this problem, we propose and investigate the question of estimating the expectations of m adaptively chosen functions on an unknown distribution given n random samples. We show that, surprisingly, there is a way to estimate an exponential in n number of expectations accurately even if the functions are chosen adaptively. This gives an exponential improvement over standard empirical estimators that are limited to a linear number of estimates. Our result follows from a general technique that counter-intuitively involves actively perturbing and coordinating the estimates, using techniques developed for privacy preservation. We give additional applications of this technique to our question.","author":["Cynthia Dwork","Vitaly Feldman","Moritz Hardt","Toniann Pitassi","Omer Reingold","Aaron Leon Roth"],"issue":["STOC '15: Proceedings of the forty-seventh annual ACM symposium on Theory of Computing","June 2015","Pages   117\u2013126","https://doi.org/10.1145/2746539.2746580"],"date":"14 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"Five lessons from Kaggle's event recommendation engine challenge. http://www.rouli.net/2013/02/five-lessons-from-kaggles-event.html.

Given samples coming from a random one out of k Gaussian distributions in Rn, the learning problem asks to estimate the means and the covariance matrices of these Gaussians. This learning problem arises in many areas ranging from the natural sciences to the social sciences, and has also found many ma- chine learning applications. Unfortunately, learning mixture of Gaussians is an information theoretically hard problem: in order to learn the parameters up to a reasonable accuracy, the number of samples required is exponential in the number of Gaussian components in the worst case. In this work, we show that provided we are in high enough dimensions, the class of Gaussian mixtures is learnable in its most general form under a smoothed analysis framework, where the parameters are randomly perturbed from an adversarial starting point. In particular, given samples from a mixture of Gaussians with randomly perturbed parameters, when n \u2265 \u03a9(k2), we give an algorithm that learns the parameters with polynomial running time and using polynomial number of samples. The central algorithmic ideas consist of new ways to de- compose the moment tensor of the Gaussian mixture by exploiting its structural properties. The symmetries of this tensor are derived from the combinatorial structure of higher order moments of Gaussian distributions (sometimes referred to as Isserlis' theorem or Wick's theorem). We also develop new tools for bounding smallest singular values of structured random matrices, which could be useful in other smoothed analysis settings.","author":["Rong Ge","Qingqing Huang","Sham M.

Aggressively underprovisioning grid infrastructure can trigger power emergency in which simultaneous peak power draws across the datacenter exceed the tightly budgeted grid power capacity, leading to possible serious consequences including power shutdown. The resulting power emergency mandates a graceful reaction mechanism to sustain the power requirement to avoid power overdraw. While leveraging renewable energy in a green datacenter provides a possibility to prevent power overdraw during such a power emergency, the intermittent nature of renewable energy makes it a very challenging task because of the potentially unpredictable performance impact to individual applications. This paper addresses this issue by designing a novel renewable energy delivery infrastructure and considering performance consequences to individual applications of underprovisioning the grid power infrastructure in the presence of varied renewable power and limited battery's energy capacity in a datacenter. We build an experimental prototype to demonstrate such grid power underprovisioning on a cluster of 10 servers, with a simulated solar power generator. Using representative datacenter benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of the renewable solution in handling power emergencies, we show that renewable energy by itself can sustain different duration lengths of power emergency when its supply is sufficient. Batteries play an important role for performance boost when the supply of the renewable energy is insufficient. Our theoretical solution, in conjunction with workload migration, provides a seamless bridge across the whole spectrum of duration lengths of power emergency.","author":["Xu Zhou","Qiang Cao","Hong Jiang","Changsheng Xie"],"issue":["ICS '15: Proceedings of the 29th ACM on International Conference on Supercomputing","June 2015","Pages   229\u2013240","https://doi.org/10.1145/2751205.2751222"],"date":"08 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"http://www.aiso.net/technology-network-sun.html.","order":1},{"text":"http://www.greenhousedata.com/.","order":2},{"text":"X.

First we place the BBS theory into the unifying framework of optimal transport theory. This also opens the way to exploit coupling methods for establishing properties required of a good similarity function as per their definition. Next, we use the approach to the problem of graph classification via geometric embeddings such as the Laplacian, pseudo-inverse Laplacian and the Lov\u00e1sz orthogonal labellings. We consider the similarity function given by optimal and near--optimal matchings with respect to Euclidean distance of the corresponding embeddings of the graphs in high dimensions. We use optimal couplings to rigorously establish that this yields a \"good\" similarity measure in the BBS sense for two well known families of graphs. Further, we show that the similarity yields better classification accuracy in practice, on these families, than matchings of other well-known graph embeddings. Finally we perform an extensive empirical evaluation on benchmark data sets where we show that classifying graphs using matchings of geometric embeddings outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.","author":["Fredrik D.

Although efficient implementations of specific graph applications exist, the behavior of full-spectrum graph computing remains unknown. To understand graph computing, we must consider multiple graph computation types, graph frameworks, data representations, and various data sources in a holistic way. In this paper, we present GraphBIG, a benchmark suite inspired by IBM System G project. To cover major graph computation types and data sources, GraphBIG selects representative datastructures, workloads and data sets from 21 real-world use cases of multiple application domains. We characterized GraphBIG on real machines and observed extremely irregular memory patterns and significant diverse behavior across different computations. GraphBIG helps users understand the impact of modern graph computing on the hardware architecture and enables future architecture and system research.","author":["Lifeng Nai","Yinglong Xia","Ilie G.

Whereas conventional implementations of Ttm rely on explicitly converting the input tensor operand into a matrix---in order to be able to use any available and fast general matrix-matrix multiply (Gemm) implementation---our framework's strategy is to carry out the Ttm in-place, avoiding this copy. As the resulting implementations expose tuning parameters, this paper also describes a heuristic empirical model for selecting an optimal configuration based on the Ttm's inputs. When compared to widely used single-node Ttm implementations that are available in the Tensor Toolbox and Cyclops Tensor Framework (Ctf), In-TensLi's in-place and input-adaptive Ttm implementations achieve 4\u00d7 and 13\u00d7 speedups, showing Gemm-like performance on a variety of input sizes.","author":["Jiajia Li","Casey Battaglino","Ioakeim Perros","Jimeng Sun","Richard Vuduc"],"issue":["SC '15: Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2015","Article No.: 76","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2807591.2807671"],"date":"15 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"An updated set of Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS).","doi":"10.1145/567806.567807","order":1},{"text":"E.

The key to combining performance and ease of programming is to decouple the ACID abstraction---which Callas offers identically for all transactions---from the mechanism used to support it. MCC, the new Modular approach to Concurrency Control at the core of Callas, makes it possible to partition transactions in groups with the guarantee that, as long as the concurrency control mechanism within each group upholds a given isolation property, that property will also hold among transactions in different groups. Because of their limited and specialized scope, these group-specific mechanisms can be customized for concurrency with unprecedented aggressiveness. In our MySQL Cluster-based prototype, Callas yields an 8.2x throughput gain for TPC-C with no programming effort.","author":["Chao Xie","Chunzhi Su","Cody Littley","Lorenzo Alvisi","Manos Kapritsos","Yang Wang"],"issue":["SOSP '15: Proceedings of the 25th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","October 2015","Pages   279\u2013294","https://doi.org/10.1145/2815400.2815430"],"date":"04 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"Cloud Lab. http://www.cloudlab.us/.","order":1},{"text":"Front Accounting. http://frontaccounting.com/.","order":2},{"text":"Fusion Ticket. http://www.fusionticket.org/.","order":3},{"text":"MemSQL. http://www.memsql.com/.","order":4},{"text":"Microsoft SQL Server. http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/.","order":5},{"text":"MySQL Cluster. http://www.mysql.com/products/cluster/.","order":6},{"text":"Oracle Database. http://www.oracle.com/database/.","order":7},{"text":"Postgres SQL. http://www.postgresql.org/.","order":8},{"text":"SAP Hana. http://www.saphana.com/.","order":9},{"text":"SimpleDB. http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/.","order":10},{"text":"Atul Adya, Barbara Liskov, and Patrick O'Neil.

Cache designs have improved dramatically by considering reference locality. Data values are also a source of optimization. Compression and deduplication exploit data values to use cache storage more efficiently resulting in smaller caches without sacrificing performance. In multi-megabyte LLCs, many identical or similar values may be cached across multiple blocks simultaneously. This redundancy effectively wastes cache capacity. We observe that a large fraction of cache values exhibit approximate similarity. More specifically, values across cache blocks are not identical but are similar. Coupled with approximate computing which observes that some applications can tolerate error or inexactness, we leverage approximate similarity to design a novel LLC architecture: the Doppelg\u00e4nger cache. The Doppelg\u00e4nger cache associates the tags of multiple similar blocks with a single data array entry to reduce the amount of data stored. Our design achieves 1.55\u00d7, 2.55\u00d7 and 1.41\u00d7 reductions in LLC area, dynamic energy and leakage energy without harming performance nor incurring high application error.","author":["Joshua San Miguel","Jorge Albericio","Andreas Moshovos","Natalie Enright Jerger"],"issue":["MICRO-48: Proceedings of the 48th International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2015","Pages   50\u201361","https://doi.org/10.1145/2830772.2830790"],"date":"05 December 2015","ref":[{"text":"A.

A 400G Ethernet MAC needs to process wide data at high speeds to meet the throughput needs. Altera recently introduced HyperFlexTM [1][2][3], a change to the fabric architecture aimed to facilitate massive pipelining of FPGA designs -- allowing them to run faster and hence alleviate the congestion that is caused by widening datapaths beyond 512b or 1024b. Though it seems counterintuitive it can be easier to close timing at 781 MHz for a 640b datapath than at 390 MHz for a 1280b datapath when wire congestion is taken into account. This presentation will discuss some of the practical details in implementing high-throughput protocols such as Ethernet and Interlaken, how we address these traditionally and how the design of the cores is modified with HyperPipelining. We will discuss alternative development styles for control and datapath logic, strategies for wire planning to avoid congestion, the throughput limits of FPGA routing networks, common timing closure issues and how to alleviate them, and how to pipeline intelligently. This presentation is thus partly a tutorial in the issues of making a 400G FPGA design close timing, and partly a case study of using HyperFlex on an FPGA design.","author":["Gregg Baeckler"],"issue":["FPGA '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2016","Pages   2","https://doi.org/10.1145/2847263.2847285"],"date":"21 February 2016","ref":[{"text":"D.

Thus, a large variety of sorting methods exist for both software and hardware implementations. For the latter, there is a trade-off between the throughput achieved and the cost (i.e., the logic and storage invested to sort n elements). Two popular solutions are bitonic sorting networks with O(nlog 2n) logic and storage, which sort n elements per cycle, and linear sorters with O(n) logic and storage, which sort n elements per n cycles. In this article, we present new hardware structures that we call streaming sorting networks, which we derive through a mathematical formalism that we introduce, and an accompanying domain-specific hardware generator that translates our formal mathematical description into synthesizable RTL Verilog. With the new networks, we achieve novel and improved cost-performance trade-offs. For example, assuming that n is a two-power and w is any divisor of n, one class of these networks can sort in n/;w cycles with O(wlog 2n) logic and O(nlog 2n) storage; the other class that we present sorts in nlog 2n/;w cycles with O(w) logic and O(n) storage. We carefully analyze the performance of these networks and their cost at three levels of abstraction: (1) asymptotically, (2) exactly in terms of the number of basic elements needed, and (3) in terms of the resources required by the actual circuit when mapped to a field-programmable gate array. The accompanying hardware generator allows us to explore the entire design space, identify the Pareto-optimal solutions, and show superior cost-performance trade-offs compared to prior work.","author":["Marcela Zuluaga","Peter Milder","Markus P\u00fcschel"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 21","Issue 4","September 2016","Article No.: 55","pp   1\u201330","https://doi.org/10.1145/2854150"],"date":"27 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"M.

Much success has been reported recently by techniques that first compute a similarity structure of the data points and then project them into a low-dimensional space with the structure preserved. These two steps suffer from considerable computational costs, preventing the state-of-the-art methods such as the t-SNE from scaling to large-scale and high-dimensional data (e.g., millions of data points and hundreds of dimensions). We propose the LargeVis, a technique that first constructs an accurately approximated K-nearest neighbor graph from the data and then layouts the graph in the low-dimensional space. Comparing to t-SNE, LargeVis significantly reduces the computational cost of the graph construction step and employs a principled probabilistic model for the visualization step, the objective of which can be effectively optimized through asynchronous stochastic gradient descent with a linear time complexity. The whole procedure thus easily scales to millions of high-dimensional data points. Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate that the LargeVis outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and effectiveness. The hyper-parameters of LargeVis are also much more stable over different data sets.","author":["Jian Tang","Jingzhou Liu","Ming Zhang","Qiaozhu Mei"],"issue":["WWW '16: Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web","April 2016","Pages   287\u2013297","https://doi.org/10.1145/2872427.2883041"],"date":"11 April 2016","ref":[{"text":"M.

In particular, large-scale graph processing is gaining attention due to its broad applicability from social science to machine learning. However, scalable hardware design that can efficiently process large graphs in main memory is still an open problem. Ideally, cost-effective and scalable graph processing systems can be realized by building a system whose performance increases proportionally with the sizes of graphs that can be stored in the system, which is extremely challenging in conventional systems due to severe memory bandwidth limitations.In this work, we argue that the conventional concept of processing-in-memory (PIM) can be a viable solution to achieve such an objective. The key modern enabler for PIM is the recent advancement of the 3D integration technology that facilitates stacking logic and memory dies in a single package, which was not available when the PIM concept was originally examined. In order to take advantage of such a new technology to enable memory-capacity-proportional performance, we design a programmable PIM accelerator for large-scale graph processing called Tesseract. Tesseract is composed of (1) a new hardware architecture that fully utilizes the available memory bandwidth, (2) an efficient method of communication between different memory partitions, and (3) a programming interface that reflects and exploits the unique hardware design. It also includes two hardware prefetchers specialized for memory access patterns of graph processing, which operate based on the hints provided by our programming model. Our comprehensive evaluations using five state-of-the-art graph processing workloads with large real-world graphs show that the proposed architecture improves average system performance by a factor of ten and achieves 87% average energy reduction over conventional systems.","author":["Junwhan Ahn","Sungpack Hong","Sungjoo Yoo","Onur Mutlu","Kiyoung Choi"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 43","Issue 3S","June 2015","pp   105\u2013117","https://doi.org/10.1145/2872887.2750386"],"date":"13 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"ARM Cortex-A5 Processor.

As an alternative, spin-transfer torque magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) technology shows comparable performance in terms of speed and power consumption and much better performance in terms of density and leakage. Moreover, MRAM brings up new paradigms in system design thanks to its inherent nonvolatility, which allows the definition of new instant-on/off policies and leakage current optimization. Based on our compact model, we have developed a fully characterized system-on-chip from the basic cell up to the system architecture in a 40nm LP hybrid CMOS/magnetic process. Through simulations, first we demonstrate that STT-MRAM is a candidate for the memory part of embedded systems, and second we implement a check-pointing methodology based on the regular interrupt routines of a processor to enable a fast power on and off functionality. Using a synthetic benchmark developed in high-level programming languages intended to be representative of integer system performance, our method shows that having MRAM instead of SRAM in an embedded design brings up important energy savings. The influence of the check-pointing routine on power consumption is finally evaluated with regard to various shutdown and restart behaviors.","author":["Christophe Layer","Laurent Becker","Kotb Jabeur","Sylvain Claireux","Bernard Dieny","Guillaume Prenat","Gregory Di Pendina","Stephane Gros","Pierre Paoli","Virgile Javerliac","Fabrice Bernard-Granger","Loic Decloedt"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 12","Issue 4","July 2016","Article No.: 32","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/2876507"],"date":"12 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"L.

However, harvested energy is intrinsically unstable. In order to overcome this drawback, non-volatile processors (NVPs) have been proposed to bridge intermittent program execution. However, even with NVPs, frequent power interruptions will severely degrade system performance. Hence, in this paper we adopt a multi-source in-door energy harvesting architecture to compensate the shortcoming of single energy source. We further investigate power harvesting prediction techniques, which are critical for NVP systems since they can coordinate with task scheduler in the NVP system to compensate the intermittent ambient energy harvesting. We investigate prediction methods both for single energy harvesting source and for multiple energy harvesting sources, the total output power of which is more stable compared with the single source case. A comprehensive evaluation framework has been developed using actually measured harvesting traces on the proposed neural network-based power harvesting prediction methods. It turns out that the most favorable prediction methods are directly predicting the total output power of DC-DC converters (connecting between energy sources and NVP), or predicting the total input power of DC-DC converters first and then inferring the total output power using a learned mapping function, for multi-source power harvesting predictions.","author":["Ning Liu","Caiwen Ding","Yanzhi Wang","Jingtong Hu"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '16: Proceedings of the 26th edition on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2016","Pages   275\u2013280","https://doi.org/10.1145/2902961.2903037"],"date":"18 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"B.

The current practice is to either use a single set of configuration parameters or rely on statically configured storage policies for a cloud object store deployment, even when the store is used to support different types of applications with evolving requirements. This crucial mismatch between the different applications requirements and capabilities of the object store is problematic and should be addressed to achieve high efficiency and performance. In this paper, we propose MOS, a Micro Object Storage architecture, which supports independently configured microstores each tuned dynamically to the needs of a particular type of workload. We also design an enhancement, MOS++, that extends MOS's capabilities through fine-grained resource management to effectively meet the tenants' SLAs while maximizing resource efficiency. We have implemented a prototype of MOS ++ in OpenStack Swift using Docker containers. Our evaluation shows that MOS ++ can effectively support heterogeneous workloads across multiple tenants. Compared to default and statically configured object store setups, for a two-tenant setup, MOS++ improves the sustained access bandwidth by up to 79% for a large-object workload, while reducing the 95th percentile latency by up to 70.2% for a small-object workload.","author":["Ali Anwar","Yue Cheng","Aayush Gupta","Ali R.

We present Visage, an interactive visual graph querying approach that empowers users to construct expressive queries, without writing complex code (e.g., finding money laundering rings of bankers and business owners). Our contributions are as follows: (1) we introduce graph autocomplete, an interactive approach that guides users to construct and refine queries, preventing over-specification; (2) Visage guides the construction of graph queries using a data-driven approach, enabling users to specify queries with varying levels of specificity, from concrete and detailed (e.g., query by example), to abstract (e.g., with \"wildcard\" nodes of any types), to purely structural matching; (3) a twelve-participant, within-subject user study demonstrates Visage's ease of use and the ability to construct graph queries significantly faster than using a conventional query language; (4) Visage works on real graphs with over 468K edges, achieving sub-second response times for common queries.","author":["Robert Pienta","Acar Tamersoy","Alex Endert","Shamkant Navathe","Hanghang Tong","Duen Horng Chau"],"issue":["AVI '16: Proceedings of the International Working Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces","June 2016","Pages   272\u2013279","https://doi.org/10.1145/2909132.2909246"],"date":"07 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"C.

In particular, people may show more negative or aggressive behavior toward entitative (i.e., cohesive) robot groups, like they do toward entitative human groups, compared to diverse groups. Furthermore, because people in collectivist (e.g., Japan) and individualistic (e.g., US) cultures respond to groups and to cues of entitativity differently, entitative robot groups may affect people differently across such cultures. This study examines how robot Entitativity Condition (Single Robots, Diverse Group, Entitative Group) and Country (USA, Japan) affect emotions toward, mind attributions to, and willingness to interact with robots. Results indicate that Entitative robot groups, compared to Single robots, were viewed more negatively. Entitative robots were also more threatening than Diverse robots. Diverse robot groups, compared to Single robots, were viewed as having more mind, and participants were more willing to interact with them. These findings were similar in the USA and Japan. This indicates that robot group entitativity and diversity is critical to keep in mind when designing robots.","author":["Marlena R. Fraune","Yusaku Nishiwaki","Selma Sabanovi\u0107","Eliot R.

Our analysis indicate slowing the clock frequency by 85% restores 170 mV of sense margin under 300 Oe DC magnetic field.

This \"sharing\" or \"gig\" economy represents a more flexible work system, and is most common in two-sided markets in which a firm acts as a platform to connect service providers and consumers. One prominent example of this is the ride-sharing company Uber, which connects riders and driver-partners, and dynamically prices trips using a system known as \"surge\" pricing. In this talk, I discuss the practical problems of designing such a dynamic pricing system, how that dynamic pricing coordinates workers who can now earn compensation on a flexible schedule, and more broadly how the \"gig\" economy is evolving and growing as a form of market organization.","author":["M.

Notably, each I/O operation has to pass through several software layers to reach the NAND-flash-based storage systems. This article targets at optimizing I/O for mobile virtualization, since I/O becomes one of major performance bottlenecks that seriously affects the performance of mobile devices. Among all the I/O operations, a large percentage is to update metadata. Frequently updated metadata not only degrade overall I/O performance but also severely reduce flash memory lifetime.In this article, we propose a novel I/O optimization technique to identify the metadata of a guest file system that is stored in a virtual machine image file and frequently updated. Then, these metadata are stored in a small additional non-volatile memory (NVM), which is faster and more endurable to greatly improve flash memory\u2019s performance and lifetime. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to identify the file system metadata from regular data in a guest OS image file with NVM optimization. The proposed scheme is evaluated on a real hardware embedded platform. The experimental results show that the proposed techniques can improve write performance to 45.21% in mobile devices with virtualization.","author":["Renhai Chen","Yi Wang","Jingtong Hu","Duo Liu","Zili Shao","Yong Guan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 16","Issue 1","November 2016","Article No.: 12","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/2950059"],"date":"13 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"H.

Even well-optimized hardware implementations of digital NNs show significant power consumption. It is mainly due to non-uniform pipeline structures and inherent redundancy of numerous arithmetic operations that have to be performed to produce each single output vector. This paper provides a methodology for the design of well-optimized power-efficient NNs with a uniform structure suitable for hardware implementation. An error resilience analysis was performed in order to determine key constraints for the design of approximate multipliers that are employed in the resulting structure of NN. By means of a search based approximation method, approximate multipliers showing desired tradeoffs between the accuracy and implementation cost were created. Resulting approximate NNs, containing the approximate multipliers, were evaluated using standard benchmarks (MNIST dataset) and a real-world classification problem of Street-View House Numbers. Significant improvement in power efficiency was obtained in both cases with respect to regular NNs. In some cases, 91% power reduction of multiplication led to classification accuracy degradation of less than 2.80%. Moreover, the paper showed the capability of the back propagation learning algorithm to adapt with NNs containing the approximate multipliers.","author":["Vojtech Mrazek","Syed Shakib Sarwar","Lukas Sekanina","Zdenek Vasicek","Kaushik Roy"],"issue":["ICCAD '16: Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2016","Article No.: 81","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967021"],"date":"07 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"L.

However, today's DMFBs suffer from several limitations: (i) constraints on droplet size and the inability to vary droplet volume in a fine-grained manner; (ii) the lack of integrated sensors for real-time detection; (iii) the need for special fabrication processes and the associated reliability/yield concerns. To overcome the above problems, DMFBs based on a micro-electrode-dot-array (MEDA) architecture have been proposed recently, and droplet manipulation on these devices has been experimentally demonstrated. Errors are likely to occur due to defects, chip degradation, and the lack of precision inherent in biochemical experiments. Therefore, an efficient error-recovery strategy is essential to ensure the correctness of assays executed on MEDA biochips. By exploiting MEDA-specific advances in droplet sensing, we present a novel error-recovery technique to dynamically reconfigure the biochip using real-time data provided by on-chip sensors. Local recovery strategies based on probabilistic-timed-automata are presented for various types of errors. A control flow is also proposed to connect local recovery procedures with global error recovery for the complete bioassay. Laboratory experiments using a fabricated MEDA chip are used to characterize the outcomes of key droplet operations. The PRISM model checker and three analytical chemistry benchmarks are used for an extensive set of simulations. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed error-recovery strategy.","author":["Zipeng Li","Kelvin Yi-Tse Lai","Po-Hsien Yu","Krishnendu Chakrabarty","Miroslav Pajic","Tsung-Yi Ho","Chen-Yi Lee"],"issue":["ICCAD '16: Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2016","Article No.: 105","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967035"],"date":"07 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"R.

Smart vision sensors offer a means to reduce the computational burden of visual processing pipelines by placing more processing capabilities next to the sensor. In this work, we use a vision-chip in which a small processor with memory is located next to each photosensitive element. The architecture of this device is optimized to perform local operations. To perform a task like tracking, we implement a neuromorphic approach using a Dynamic Neural Field, which allows to segregate, memorize, and track objects. Our system, consisting of the vision-chip running the DNF, outputs only the activity that corresponds to the tracked objects. These outputs reduce the bandwidth needed to transfer information as well as further post-processing, since computation happens at the pixel level.","author":["Julien N.P.

In the last few years collective link prediction methods have been proposed for the problem of link prediction in heterogeneous networks. These methods capture the correlation between different types of links and utilize this information in the link prediction task. In this paper we pose the problem of link prediction in heterogeneous networks as a multi-task, metric learning (MTML) problem. For each link-type (relation) we learn a corresponding distance measure, which utilizes both network and node features. These link-type specific distance measures are learnt in a coupled fashion by employing the Multi-Task Structure Preserving Metric Learning (MT-SPML) setup. We further extend the MT-SPML method to account for task correlations, robustness to non-informative features and non-stationary degree distribution across networks. Experiments on the Flickr and DBLP network demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed approach vis-\u00e0-vis competitive baselines.","author":["Sumit Negi","Santanu Chaudhury"],"issue":["CIKM '16: Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2016","Pages   609\u2013617","https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983722"],"date":"24 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"Y.

The counts of small subgraph patterns in networks, called network motifs, are crucial to understanding the structure and function of these systems. However, the role of network motifs for temporal networks, which contain many timestamped links between nodes, is not well understood. Here we develop a notion of a temporal network motif as an elementary unit of temporal networks and provide a general methodology for counting such motifs. We define temporal network motifs as induced subgraphs on sequences of edges, design several fast algorithms for counting temporal network motifs, and prove their runtime complexity. We also show that our fast algorithms achieve 1.3x to 56.5x speedups compared to a baseline method. We use our algorithms to count temporal network motifs in a variety of real-world datasets. Results show that networks from different domains have significantly different motif frequencies, whereas networks from the same domain tend to have similar motif frequencies. We also find that measuring motif counts at various time scales reveals different behavior.","author":["Ashwin Paranjape","Austin R.

CNNs outperform older methods in accuracy, but require vast amounts of computation and memory. As a result, existing CNN applications are typically run on clusters of CPUs or GPUs. Studies into the FPGA acceleration of CNN workloads has achieved reductions in power and energy consumption. However, large GPUs outperform modern FPGAs in throughput, and the existence of compatible deep learning frameworks give GPUs a significant advantage in programmability. Recent research in machine learning demonstrates the potential of very low precision CNNs -- i.e., CNNs with binarized weights and activations. Such binarized neural networks (BNNs) appear well suited for FPGA implementation, as their dominant computations are bitwise logic operations and their memory requirements are reduced. A combination of low-precision networks and high-level design methodology may help address the performance and productivity gap between FPGAs and GPUs. In this paper, we present the design of a BNN accelerator that is synthesized from C++ to FPGA-targeted Verilog. The accelerator outperforms existing FPGA-based CNN accelerators in GOPS as well as energy and resource efficiency.","author":["Ritchie Zhao","Weinan Song","Wentao Zhang","Tianwei Xing","Jeng-Hau Lin","Mani Srivastava","Rajesh Gupta","Zhiru Zhang"],"issue":["FPGA '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2017","Pages   15\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/3020078.3021741"],"date":"22 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

Two of the most important features supported by several existing extensions to CSL are higher-order quantification and custom ghost state. However, none of the logics that support both of these features reap the full potential of their combination. In particular, none of them provide general support for a feature we dub \"higher-order ghost state\": the ability to store arbitrary higher-order separation-logic predicates in ghost variables.  In this paper, we propose higher-order ghost state as a interesting and useful extension to CSL, which we formalize in the framework of Jung et al.'s recently developed Iris logic. To justify its soundness, we develop a novel algebraic structure called CMRAs (\"cameras\"), which can be thought of as \"step-indexed partial commutative monoids\". Finally, we show that Iris proofs utilizing higher-order ghost state can be effectively formalized in Coq, and discuss the challenges we faced in formalizing them.","author":["Ralf Jung","Robbert Krebbers","Lars Birkedal","Derek Dreyer"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 51","Issue 9","September 2016","pp   256\u2013269","https://doi.org/10.1145/3022670.2951943"],"date":"04 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"Higher-Order Ghost State: Appendix and Coq development.

However, in the stochastic setting, counterexamples exist and prevent Nesterov's momentum from providing similar acceleration, even if the underlying problem is convex.  We introduce Katyusha, a direct, primal-only stochastic gradient method to fix this issue. It has a provably accelerated convergence rate in convex (off-line) stochastic optimization. The main ingredient is Katyusha momentum, a novel \"negative momentum\" on top of Nesterov's momentum that can be incorporated into a variance-reduction based algorithm and speed it up. Since variance reduction has been successfully applied to a growing list of practical problems, our paper suggests that in each of such cases, one could potentially give Katyusha a hug.","author":["Zeyuan Allen-Zhu"],"issue":["STOC 2017: Proceedings of the 49th Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing","June 2017","Pages   1200\u20131205","https://doi.org/10.1145/3055399.3055448"],"date":"19 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Zeyuan Allen-Zhu and Elad Hazan.

We present a synthesis algorithm for quantum computing based on k-LUT networks, which can be derived from Verilog netlists using state-of-the-art and off-the-shelf mapping algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in automatically synthesizing several floating point networks up to double precision. As many quantum algorithms target scientific simulation applications, they can make rich use of floating point arithmetic components. But due to the lack of quantum circuit descriptions for those components, it is not possible to find a realistic cost estimation for the algorithms. Our synthesized benchmarks provide cost estimates that allow quantum algorithm designers to provide the first complete cost estimates for a host of quantum algorithms. This is an essential step towards the goal of understanding which quantum algorithms will be practical in the first generations of quantum computers.","author":["Mathias Soeken","Martin Roetteler","Nathan Wiebe","Giovanni De Micheli"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 78","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062261"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"N.

Although a number of key frame selection methods have been proposed in the past, existing technologies mainly focus on how to precisely summarize the video content, but seldom take the user preferences into consideration. However, in real scenarios, people may cast diverse interests on the contents even for the same video, and thus they may be attracted by quite different key frames, which makes the selection of key frames an inherently personalized process. In this paper, we propose and investigate the problem of personalized key frame recommendation to bridge the above gap. To do so, we make use of video images and user time-synchronized comments to design a novel key frame recommender that can simultaneously model visual and textual features in a unified framework. By user personalization based on her/his previously reviewed frames and posted comments, we are able to encode different user interests in a unified multi-modal space, and can thus select key frames in a personalized manner, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first time in the research field of video content analysis. Experimental results show that our method performs better than its competitors on various measures.","author":["Xu Chen","Yongfeng Zhang","Qingyao Ai","Hongteng Xu","Junchi Yan","Zheng Qin"],"issue":["SIGIR '17: Proceedings of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2017","Pages   315\u2013324","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080776"],"date":"07 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"D.

However, GPU passthrough prevents service administrators from performing virtual machine migration between physical hosts. Crane is a new technique for virtualizing OpenCL-based GPGPU computing that achieves within 5.25% of passthrough GPU performance while supporting VM migration. Crane interposes a virtualization-aware OpenCL library that makes it possible to reclaim and subsequently reassign physical GPUs to a VM without terminating the guest or its applications. Crane also enables continued GPU operation while the VM is undergoing live migration by transparently switching between GPU passthrough operation and API remoting.","author":["James Gleeson","Daniel Kats","Charlie Mei","Eyal de Lara"],"issue":["SYSTOR '17: Proceedings of the 10th ACM International Systems and Storage Conference","May 2017","Article No.: 11","Pages   1\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/3078468.3078478"],"date":"22 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"PCI express - address translation services revision 1.1. 2009.","order":1},{"text":"M.

It supports remote (even third-party) software installation on devices while maintaining strong security guarantees. More specifically, Sancus can remotely attest to a software provider that a specific software module is running uncompromised and can provide a secure communication channel between software modules and software providers. Software modules can securely maintain local state and can securely interact with other software modules that they choose to trust.Over the past three years, significant experience has been gained with applications of Sancus, and several extensions of the architecture have been investigated\u2014both by the original designers as well as by independent researchers. Informed by these additional research results, this journal version of the Sancus paper describes an improved design and implementation, supporting additional security guarantees (such as confidential deployment) and a more efficient cryptographic core.We describe the design of Sancus 2.0 (without relying on any prior knowledge of Sancus) and develop and evaluate a prototype FPGA implementation. The prototype extends an MSP430 processor with hardware support for the memory access control and cryptographic functionality required to run Sancus. We report on our experience using Sancus in a variety of application scenarios and discuss some important avenues of ongoing and future work.","author":["Job Noorman","Jo Van Bulck","Jan Tobias M\u00fchlberg","Frank Piessens","Pieter Maene","Bart Preneel","Ingrid Verbauwhede","Johannes G\u00f6tzfried","Tilo M\u00fcller","Felix Freiling"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security","Volume 20","Issue 3","August 2017","Article No.: 7","pp   1\u201333","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079763"],"date":"31 July 2017","ref":[{"text":"Pieter Agten, Raoul Strackx, Bart Jacobs, and Frank Piessens. 2012.

We are already witnessing a major upheaval in the off-chip memory hierarchy, with the introduction of many new memory products\u2014buffer-on-board, LRDIMM, HMC, HBM, and NVMs, to name a few. Given the plethora of choices, it is expected that different vendors will adopt different strategies for their high-capacity memory systems, often deviating from DDR standards and/or integrating new functionality within memory systems. These strategies will likely differ in their choice of interconnect and topology, with a significant fraction of memory energy being dissipated in I/O and data movement. To make the case for memory interconnect specialization, this paper makes three contributions.First, we design a tool that carefully models I/O power in the memory system, explores the design space, and gives the user the ability to define new types of memory interconnects/topologies. The tool is validated against SPICE models, and is integrated into version 7 of the popular CACTI package. Our analysis with the tool shows that several design parameters have a significant impact on I/O power.We then use the tool to help craft novel specialized memory system channels. We introduce a new relay-on-board chip that partitions a DDR channel into multiple cascaded channels. We show that this simple change to the channel topology can improve performance by 22% for DDR DRAM and lower cost by up to 65% for DDR DRAM. This new architecture does not require any changes to DIMMs, and it efficiently supports hybrid DRAM/NVM systems.Finally, as an example of a more disruptive architecture, we design a custom DIMM and parallel bus that moves away from the DDR3/DDR4 standards. To reduce energy and improve performance, the baseline data channel is split into three narrow parallel channels and the on-DIMM interconnects are operated at a lower frequency. In addition, this allows us to design a two-tier error protection strategy that reduces data transfers on the interconnect. This architecture yields a performance improvement of 18% and a memory power reduction of 23%.The cascaded channel and narrow channel architectures serve as case studies for the new tool and show the potential for benefit from re-organizing basic memory interconnects.","author":["Rajeev Balasubramonian","Andrew B.

In fact, recent works design techniques that exploit fast bulk bitwise operations to accelerate databases (bitmap indices, BitWeaving) and web search (BitFunnel). Unfortunately, in existing architectures, the throughput of bulk bitwise operations is limited by the memory bandwidth available to the processing unit (e.g., CPU, GPU, FPGA, processing-in-memory). To overcome this bottleneck, we propose Ambit, an Accelerator-in-Memory for bulk bitwise operations. Unlike prior works, Ambit exploits the analog operation of DRAM technology to perform bitwise operations completely inside DRAM, thereby exploiting the full internal DRAM bandwidth. Ambit consists of two components. First, simultaneous activation of three DRAM rows that share the same set of sense amplifiers enables the system to perform bitwise AND and OR operations. Second, with modest changes to the sense amplifier, the system can use the inverters present inside the sense amplifier to perform bitwise NOT operations. With these two components, Ambit can perform any bulk bitwise operation efficiently inside DRAM. Ambit largely exploits existing DRAM structure, and hence incurs low cost on top of commodity DRAM designs (1% of DRAM chip area). Importantly, Ambit uses the modern DRAM interface without any changes, and therefore it can be directly plugged onto the memory bus. Our extensive circuit simulations show that Ambit works as expected even in the presence of significant process variation. Averaged across seven bulk bitwise operations, Ambit improves performance by 32X and reduces energy consumption by 35X compared to state-of-the-art systems. When integrated with Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC), a 3D-stacked DRAM with a logic layer, Ambit improves performance of bulk bitwise operations by 9.7X compared to processing in the logic layer of the HMC. Ambit improves the performance of three real-world data-intensive applications, 1) database bitmap indices, 2) BitWeaving, a technique to accelerate database scans, and 3) bit-vector-based implementation of sets, by 3X-7X compared to a state-of-the-art baseline using SIMD optimizations. We describe four other applications that can benefit from Ambit, including a recent technique proposed to speed up web search. We believe that large performance and energy improvements provided by Ambit can enable other applications to use bulk bitwise operations.","author":["Vivek Seshadri","Donghyuk Lee","Thomas Mullins","Hasan Hassan","Amirali Boroumand","Jeremie Kim","Michael A.

In-memory computation is an alternative approach that combines memory and processor in the same location, and eliminates the potential memory bottlenecks. Associative processors are a promising candidate for in-memory computation, however the existing implementations have been deemed too costly and power hungry. Approximate computing is another promising approach for energy-efficient digital system designs where it sacrifices the accuracy for the sake of energy reduction and speedup in error-resilient applications. In this study, approximate in-memory computing is introduced in memristive associative processors. Two approximate computing methodologies are proposed; bit trimming and memristance scaling. Results show that the proposed methods not only reduce energy consumption of in-memory parallel computing but also improve their performance. As compared to other existing approximate computing methodologies on different architectures (e.g., CPU, GPU, and ASIC), approximate memristive in-memory computing exhibits better results in terms of energy reduction (up to 80x) and speedup (up to 20x) on a variety of benchmarks from different domains when quality degradation is limited to 10% and it confirms that memristive associative processors provide a highly-promising platform for approximate computing.","author":["Hasan Erdem Yantir","Ahmed M.

In order to better understand the space of adversarial examples, we survey ten recent proposals that are designed for detection and compare their efficacy. We show that all can be defeated by constructing new loss functions. We conclude that adversarial examples are significantly harder to detect than previously appreciated, and the properties believed to be intrinsic to adversarial examples are in fact not. Finally, we propose several simple guidelines for evaluating future proposed defenses.","author":["Nicholas Carlini","David Wagner"],"issue":["AISec '17: Proceedings of the 10th ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security","November 2017","Pages   3\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/3128572.3140444"],"date":"03 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"Marco Barreno, Blaine Nelson, Anthony D.

Given the input keywords, in this paper, we study how to assemble a query graph that is to represent user's query intention accurately and efficiently. Based on the input keywords, we first obtain the elementary query graph building blocks, such as entity/class vertices and predicate edges. Then, we formally define the query graph assembly (QGA) problem. Unfortunately, we prove theoretically that QGA is a NP-complete problem. In order to solve that, we design some heuristic lower bounds and propose a bipartite graph matching-based best-first search algorithm. The algorithm's time complexity is O(k2l ... l3l), where l is the number of the keywords and k is a tunable parameter, i.e., the maximum number of candidate entity/class vertices and predicate edges allowed to match each keyword. Although QGA is intractable, both l and k are small in practice. Furthermore, the algorithm's time complexity does not depend on the RDF graph size, which guarantees the good scalability of our system in large RDF graphs. Experiments on DBpedia and Freebase confirm the superiority of our system on both effectiveness and efficiency.","author":["Shuo Han","Lei Zou","Jeffery Xu Yu","Dongyan Zhao"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   227\u2013236","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132957"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"Sanjay Agrawal, Surajit Chaudhuri, and Gautam Das. 2002.

These applications use the results of complex queries over knowledge graphs in order to help users in taking crucial decisions such as which drug to administer, or whether certain actions are compliant with all the regulatory requirements and so on. However, these knowledge graphs constantly evolve, and the newer versions may adversely impact the results of queries that the previously taken business decisions were based on. We propose a framework based on provenance polynomials to track the impact of knowledge graph changes on arbitrary SPARQL query results. Focusing on the deletion of facts, we show how to efficiently determine the queries impacted by the change, develop ways to incrementally maintain these polynomials, and present an efficient implementation on top of RDF graph databases. Our experimental evaluation over large-scale RDF/SPARQL benchmarks show the effectiveness of our proposal.","author":["Garima Gaur","Srikanta J.

A popular way to facilitate the information in a network is to embed the network structure into low-dimension spaces where each node is represented as a vector. The learned representations have been proven to advance various network analysis tasks such as link prediction and node classification. The majority of existing embedding algorithms are designed for the networks with one type of nodes and one dimension of relations among nodes. However, many networks in the real-world complex systems have multiple types of nodes and multiple dimensions of relations. For example, an e-commerce network can have users and items, and items can be viewed or purchased by users, corresponding to two dimensions of relations. In addition, some types of nodes can present hierarchical structure. For example, authors in publication networks are associated to affiliations; and items in e-commerce networks belong to categories. Most of existing methods cannot be naturally applicable to these networks. In this paper, we aim to learn representations for networks with multiple dimensions and hierarchical structure. In particular, we provide an approach to capture independent information from each dimension and dependent information across dimensions and propose a framework MINES, which performs Multi-dImension Network Embedding with hierarchical Structure. Experimental results on a network from a real-world e-commerce website demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","author":["Yao Ma","Zhaochun Ren","Ziheng Jiang","Jiliang Tang","Dawei Yin"],"issue":["WSDM '18: Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2018","Pages   387\u2013395","https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159680"],"date":"02 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mikhail Belkin and Partha Niyogi . 2002.

These characteristics, especially those different from planar NAND flash, can significantly affect design choices of flash management techniques. In this article, we present a characterization study on the state-of-the-art 3D floating gate (FG) NAND flash memory through comprehensive experiments on an FPGA-based 3D NAND flash evaluation platform. We make distinct observations on its performance and reliability, such as operation latencies and various error patterns, followed by careful analyses from physical and circuit-level perspectives. Although 3D FG NAND flash provides much higher storage densities than planar NAND flash, it faces new performance challenges of garbage collection overhead and program performance variations and more complicated reliability issues due to, e.g., distinct location dependence and value dependence of errors. We also summarize the differences between 3D FG NAND flash and planar NAND flash and discuss implications on the designs of NAND flash management techniques brought by the architecture innovation. We believe that our work will facilitate developing novel 3D FG NAND flash-oriented designs to achieve better performance and reliability.","author":["Qin Xiong","Fei Wu","Zhonghai Lu","Yue Zhu","You Zhou","Yibing Chu","Changsheng Xie","Ping Huang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 14","Issue 2","May 2018","Article No.: 16","pp   1\u201331","https://doi.org/10.1145/3162616"],"date":"12 April 2018","ref":[{"text":"Seiichi Aritome, Yoohyun Noh, Hyunseung Yoo, Eun-Seok Choi, Han-Soo Joo, Youngsoo Ahn, Byeongil Han, Sungjae Chung, Keonsoo Shim, Keunwoo Lee, Sanghyon Kwak, Sungchul Shin, Iksoo Choi, Sanghyuk Nam, Gyuseog Cho, Dongsun Sheen, Seungho Pyi, Jongmoo Choi, Sungkye Park, Jinwoong Kim, Seokkiu Lee, Sungjoo Hong, Sungwook Park, and Takamaro Kikkawa. 2013.

CGRAs are programmable hardware devices having large ALU-like logic blocks, and datapath bus-style inter-connect. CGRAs are positioned between fine-grained FPGAs and standard-cell ASICs on the spectrum of programmability - they are less flexible than FPGAs, yet are more flexible than ASICs. With CGRA-ME, an architect can describe a CGRA architecture in an XML-based language. The framework also allows the architect to map benchmarks onto the architecture and provides automatic generation of Verilog RTL for the modeled architecture. This allows the architect to simulate for verification purposes, and perform synthesis to either an ASIC or FPGA-overlay implementation of the CGRA, assessing performance, area, and power consumption. In an experimental study, we use CGRA-ME to model, map benchmarks onto, and evaluate several variants of a widely known CGRA, considering both standard-cell and FPGA-overlay physical realizations of the CGRA.","author":["S.

Since BNN is based on binarized bit-level operations, there exist great opportunities to reduce power-hungry data transfers and complex arithmetic operations. In this paper, we propose a content addressable memory (CAM) based BNN accelerator. By using time-domain signal processing, the huge convolution operations of BNN can be effectively replaced to the CAM search operation. In addition, thanks to fully parallel search of CAM, the parallel convolution operations for non-overlapped filtering window is enabled for high throughput data processing. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed CAM based BNN accelerator, the convolutional layer of LeNet-5 model has been implemented using 65nm CMOS technology. The implementation results show that the proposed BNN accelerator achieves 9.4% and 38.5% of area and energy savings, respectively. The parallel convolution operation of the proposed approach also shows 2.4x improved processing time.","author":["Woong Choi","Kwanghyo Jeong","Kyungrak Choi","Kyeongho Lee","Jongsun Park"],"issue":["DAC '18: Proceedings of the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2018","Article No.: 138","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3196014"],"date":"24 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Y.

Adopting FPGAs in datacenters as accelerators to improve performance and energy efficiency also attracts increasing attention. However, the integration of FPGAs into such JVM-based frameworks raises the challenge of poor programmability. Programmers must not only rewrite Java/Scala programs to C/C++ or OpenCL, but, to achieve high performance, they must also take into consideration the intricacies of FPGAs. To address this challenge, we present S2FA (Spark-to-FPGA-Accelerator), an automation framework that generates FPGA accelerator designs from Apache Spark programs written in Scala. S2FA bridges the semantic gap between object-oriented languages and HLS C while achieving high performance using learning-based design space exploration. Evaluation results show that our generated FPGA designs achieve up to 49.9\u00d7 performance improvement for several machine learning applications compared to their corresponding implementations on the JVM.","author":["Cody Hao Yu","Peng Wei","Max Grossman","Peng Zhang","Vivek Sarker","Jason Cong"],"issue":["DAC '18: Proceedings of the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2018","Article No.: 153","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3196109"],"date":"24 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Amazon EC2 F1 Instance. https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/f1/.","order":1},{"text":"Apache Hadoop. http://hadoop.apache.org/.","order":2},{"text":"Aparapi in amd developer website. https://github.com/aparapi/aparapi.","order":3},{"text":"Falcon Computing Solutions, Inc. http://falcon-computing.com/.","order":4},{"text":"Rose Compiler Infrastructure. http://rosecompiler.org/.","order":5},{"text":"Xilinx SDx. www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/software-zone/sdaccel.html.","order":6},{"text":"J.

This fact is rendered quite interesting by recent research on such problems, notably by R. E. Gomory [2, 3], which gives promise of yielding efficient computational techniques for their solution. The present paper provides yet another example of the versatility of integer programming as a mathematical modeling device by representing a generalization of the well-known \u201cTravelling Salesman Problem\u201d in integer programming terms. The authors have developed several such models, of which the one presented here is the most efficient in terms of generality, number of variables, and number of constraints. This model is due to the second author [4] and was presented briefly at the Symposium on Combinatorial Problems held at Princeton University, April 1960, sponsored by SIAM and IBM. The problem treated is: (1) A salesman is required to visit each of n cities, indexed by 1, \u2026 , n. He leaves from a \u201cbase city\u201d indexed by 0, visits each of the n other cities exactly once, and returns to city 0. During his travels he must return to 0 exactly t times, including his final return (here t may be allowed to vary), and he must visit no more than p cities in one tour. (By a tour we mean a succession of visits to cities without stopping at city 0.) It is required to find such an itinerary which minimizes the total distance traveled by the salesman.Note that if t is fixed, then for the problem to have a solution we must have tp \u2267 n. For t = 1, p \u2267 n, we have the standard traveling salesman problem.Let dij (i \u2260 j = 0, 1, \u2026 , n) be the distance covered in traveling from city i to city j. The following integer programming problem will be shown to be equivalent to (1): (2) Minimize the linear form \u22110\u2266i\u2260j\u2266n\u2211 dijxij over the set determined by the relations \u2211ni=0i\u2260j xij = 1 (j = 1, \u2026 , n) \u2211nj=0j\u2260i xij = 1 (i = 1, \u2026 , n) ui - uj + pxij \u2266 p - 1 (1 \u2266 i \u2260 j \u2266 n) where the xij are non-negative integers and the ui (i = 1, \u2026, n) are arbitrary real numbers. (We shall see that it is permissible to restrict the ui to be non-negative integers as well.)If t is fixed it is necessary to add the additional relation: \u2211nu=1 xi0 = t Note that the constraints require that xij = 0 or 1, so that a natural correspondence between these two problems exists if the xij are interpreted as follows: The salesman proceeds from city i to city j if and only if xij = 1. Under this correspondence the form to be minimized in (2) is the total distance to be traveled by the salesman in (1), so the burden of proof is to show that the two feasible sets correspond; i.e., a feasible solution to (2) has xij which do define a legitimate itinerary in (1), and, conversely a legitimate itinerary in (1) defines xij, which, together with appropriate ui, satisfy the constraints of (2).Consider a feasible solution to (2).The number of returns to city 0 is given by \u2211ni=1 xi0. The constraints of the form \u2211 xij = 1, all xij non-negative integers, represent the conditions that each city (other than zero) is visited exactly once. The ui play a role similar to node potentials in a network and the inequalities involving them serve to eliminate tours that do not begin and end at city 0 and tours that visit more than p cities. Consider any xr0r1 = 1 (r1 \u2260 0). There exists a unique r2 such that xr1r2 = 1. Unless r2 = 0, there is a unique r3 with xr2r3 = 1. We proceed in this fashion until some rj = 0. This must happen since the alternative is that at some point we reach an rk = rj, j + 1 < k. Since none of the r's are zero we have uri - uri + 1 + pxriri + 1 \u2266 p - 1 or uri - uri + 1 \u2266 - 1. Summing from i = j to k - 1, we have urj - urk = 0 \u2266 j + 1 - k, which is a contradiction. Thus all tours include city 0. It remains to observe that no tours is of length greater than p. Suppose such a tour exists, x0r1 , xr1r2 , \u2026 , xrprp+1 = 1 with all ri \u2260 0. Then, as before, ur1 - urp+1 \u2266 - p or urp+1 - ur1 \u2267 p.But we have urp+1 - ur1 + pxrp+1r1 \u2266 p - 1 or urp+1 - ur1 \u2266 p (1 - xrp+1r1) - 1 \u2266 p - 1, which is a contradiction.Conversely, if the xij correspond to a legitimate itinerary, it is clear that the ui can be adjusted so that ui = j if city i is the jth city visited in the tour which includes city i, for we then have ui - uj = - 1 if xij = 1, and always ui - uj \u2266 p - 1.The above integer program involves n2 + n constraints (if t is not fixed) in n2 + 2n variables. Since the inequality form of constraint is fundamental for integer programming calculations, one may eliminate 2n variables, say the xi0 and x0j, by means of the equation constraints and produce an equivalent problem with n2 + n inequalities and n2 variables.The currently known integer programming procedures are sufficiently regular in their behavior to cast doubt on the heuristic value of machine experiments with our model. However, it seems appropriate to report the results of the five machine experiments we have conducted so far. The solution procedure used was the all-integer algorithm of R. E. Gomory [3] without the ranking procedure he describes.The first three experiments were simple model verification tests on a four-city standard traveling salesman problem with distance matrix [ 20 23 4 30 7 27 25 5 25 3 21 26 ]The first experiment was with a model, now obsolete, using roughly twice as many constraints and variables as the current model (for this problem, 28 constraints in 21 variables). The machine was halted after 4000 pivot steps had failed to produce a solution.The second experiment used the earlier model with the xi0 and x0j eliminated, resulting in a 28-constraint, 15-variable problem. Here the machine produced the optimal solution in 41 pivot steps.The third experiment used the current formulation with the xi0 and x0j eliminated, yielding 13 constraints and 9 variables. The optimal solution was reached in 7 pivot steps.The fourth and fifth experiments were used on a standard ten-city problem, due to Barachet, solved by Dantzig, Johnson and Fulkerson [1]. The current formulation was used, yielding 91 constraints in 81 variables. The fifth problem differed from the fourth only in that the ordering of the rows was altered to attempt to introduce more favorable pivot choices. In each case the machine was stopped after over 250 pivot steps had failed to produce the solution. In each case the last 100 pivot steps had failed to change the value of the objective function.It seems hopeful that more efficient integer programming procedures now under development will yield a satisfactory algorithmic solution to the traveling salesman problem, when applied to this model. In any case, the model serves to illustrate how problems of this sort may be succinctly formulated in integer programming terms.","author":["C. E. Miller","A. W. Tucker","R. A.

In CNNs, the trainable local filters enable the automatic extraction of high-level features. The computation with filters requires a fixed number of ordered units in the receptive fields. However, the number of neighboring units is neither fixed nor are they ordered in generic graphs, thereby hindering the applications of convolutional operations. Here, we address these challenges by proposing the learnable graph convolutional layer (LGCL). LGCL automatically selects a fixed number of neighboring nodes for each feature based on value ranking in order to transform graph data into grid-like structures in 1-D format, thereby enabling the use of regular convolutional operations on generic graphs. To enable model training on large-scale graphs, we propose a sub-graph training method to reduce the excessive memory and computational resource requirements suffered by prior methods on graph convolutions. Our experimental results on node classification tasks in both transductive and inductive learning settings demonstrate that our methods can achieve consistently better performance on the Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed citation network, and protein-protein interaction network datasets. Our results also indicate that the proposed methods using sub-graph training strategy are more efficient as compared to prior approaches.","author":["Hongyang Gao","Zhengyang Wang","Shuiwang Ji"],"issue":["KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2018","Pages   1416\u20131424","https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3219947"],"date":"19 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio . 2015.

The neighborhood structure of a vertex is usually closely related with an underlying hierarchical taxonomy---the vertices are associated with successively broader categories that can be organized hierarchically. The categories of different levels reflects similarity of different granularity. The hierarchy of the taxonomy therefore requires that the learned representations support multiple levels of granularity. Moreover, the hierarchical taxonomy enables the information to flow between vertices via their common categories, and thus provides an effective mechanism for alleviating data scarcity. However, incorporating the hierarchical taxonomy into network embedding poses a great challenge (since the taxonomy is generally unknown), and it is neglected by the existing approaches. In this paper, we propose NetHiex, a NETwork embedding model that captures the latent HIErarchical taXonomy. In our model, a vertex representation consists of multiple components that are associated with categories of different granularity. The representations of both the vertices and the categories are co-regularized. We employ the nested Chinese restaurant process to guide the search of the most plausible hierarchical taxonomy. The network structure is then recovered from the latent representations via a Bernoulli distribution. The whole model is unified within a nonparametric probabilistic framework. A scalable expectation-maximization algorithm is derived for optimization. Empirical results demonstrate that NetHiex achieves significant performance gain over the state-of-arts.","author":["Jianxin Ma","Peng Cui","Xiao Wang","Wenwu Zhu"],"issue":["KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2018","Pages   1920\u20131929","https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3220062"],"date":"19 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"D.

For this reason, there is interest in creating differentially private versions of them. However, their conversion to differentially private algorithms is often naive. For instance, a fixed number of iterations are chosen, the privacy budget is split evenly among them, and at each iteration, parameters are updated with a noisy gradient. In this paper, we show that gradient-based algorithms can be improved by a more careful allocation of privacy budget per iteration. Intuitively, at the beginning of the optimization, gradients are expected to be large, so that they do not need to be measured as accurately. However, as the parameters approach their optimal values, the gradients decrease and hence need to be measured more accurately. We add a basic line-search capability that helps the algorithm decide when more accurate gradient measurements are necessary. Our gradient descent algorithm works with the recently introduced zCDP version of differential privacy. It outperforms prior algorithms for model fitting and is competitive with the state-of-the-art for $(\u03b5,\u03b4)$-differential privacy, a strictly weaker definition than zCDP.","author":["Jaewoo Lee","Daniel Kifer"],"issue":["KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2018","Pages   1656\u20131665","https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3220076"],"date":"19 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Martin Abadi, Andy Chu, Ian Goodfellow, H Brendan McMahan, Ilya Mironov, Kunal Talwar, and Li Zhang . 2016.

Infomap is a graph clustering algorithm capable of achieving high-quality communities. However, it remains a very challenging problem to effectively apply Infomap on large graphs. By analyzing communication and workload patterns of Infomap and leveraging a distributed delegate partitioning and distribution method, we develop a new heuristic strategy to carefully coordinate the community constitution from the vertices of a graph in a distributed environment, and achieve the convergence of the distributed clustering algorithm. We have implemented our optimized algorithm using MPI (Message Passing Interface), which can be easily employed or extended to massively distributed computing systems. We analyze the correctness of our algorithm, and conduct an intensive experimental study to investigate the communication and computation cost of our distributed algorithm, which has not shown in previous work. The results demonstrate the scalability and the correctness of our distributed Infomap algorithm with large-scale real-world datasets.","author":["Jianping Zeng","Hongfeng Yu"],"issue":["ICPP 2018: Proceedings of the 47th International Conference on Parallel Processing","August 2018","Article No.: 4","Pages   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/3225058.3225137"],"date":"13 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"R\u00e9ka Albert, Hawoong Jeong, and Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si. 1999.

The OpenCL framework supports portable programming across a wide range of computing devices and is gaining influence in programming next-generation accelerators. To characterize the performance of these devices across a range of applications requires a diverse, portable and configurable benchmark suite, and OpenCL is an attractive programming model for this purpose. We present an extended and enhanced version of the OpenDwarfs OpenCL benchmark suite, with a strong focus placed on the robustness of applications, curation of additional benchmarks with an increased emphasis on correctness of results and choice of problem size. Preliminary results and analysis are reported for eight benchmark codes on a diverse set of architectures -- three Intel CPUs, five Nvidia GPUs, six AMD GPUs and a Xeon Phi.","author":["Beau Johnston","Josh Milthorpe"],"issue":["ICPP '18: Proceedings of the 47th International Conference on Parallel Processing Companion","August 2018","Article No.: 4","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3229710.3229729"],"date":"13 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"Krste Asanovi\u0107, Ras Bodik, Bryan Christopher Catanzaro, Joseph James Gebis, Parry Husbands, Kurt Keutzer, David A Patterson, William Lester Plishker, John Shalf, Samuel Webb Williams, and Kathy Yelick. 2006.

At present, the use of recurrent neural network to Chinese word segmentation model has become a new trend. The researchers proposed various models based on the LSTM network model of long and short memory and the word segmentation method based on the GRU network model. Both LSTM and GRU are a type of circulatory neural network that inherits the ability to automatically learn and long-short term memory characteristics. However, in the process of Chinese word segmentation, as the length of the sentence becomes longer, the inter-dependent feature distance in the context becomes farther, resulting in the loss of the historical feature information and future feature information that the given sentence depends on, thereby reducing the accuracy of word segmentation. In order to solve this problem, this paper introduces the attention mechanism and proposes the BI_GRU_AT_HW_CRF_6 neural network segmentation model. Experiments show that with the introduction of attentional mechanism, with the change of sentence, there is a better performance in accuracy, training, and forecasting data speed.","author":["Ge Yunsheng","Kong Jie"],"issue":["ICIIP '18: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Intelligent Information Processing","May 2018","Pages   88\u201394","https://doi.org/10.1145/3232116.3232131"],"date":"19 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"Biqing Li, Zhao Li (2018).

We have seen wide adoption of DL in many safety-critical scenarios. However, a plethora of studies have shown that the state-of-the-art DL systems suffer from various vulnerabilities which can lead to severe consequences when applied to real-world applications. Currently, the testing adequacy of a DL system is usually measured by the accuracy of test data. Considering the limitation of accessible high quality test data, good accuracy performance on test data can hardly provide confidence to the testing adequacy and generality of DL systems. Unlike traditional software systems that have clear and controllable logic and functionality, the lack of interpretability in a DL system makes system analysis and defect detection difficult, which could potentially hinder its real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose DeepGauge, a set of multi-granularity testing criteria for DL systems, which aims at rendering a multi-faceted portrayal of the testbed. The in-depth evaluation of our proposed testing criteria is demonstrated on two well-known datasets, five DL systems, and with four state-of-the-art adversarial attack techniques against DL. The potential usefulness of DeepGauge sheds light on the construction of more generic and robust DL systems.","author":["Lei Ma","Felix Juefei-Xu","Fuyuan Zhang","Jiyuan Sun","Minhui Xue","Bo Li","Chunyang Chen","Ting Su","Li Li","Yang Liu","Jianjun Zhao","Yadong Wang"],"issue":["ASE 2018: Proceedings of the 33rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automated Software Engineering","September 2018","Pages   120\u2013131","https://doi.org/10.1145/3238147.3238202"],"date":"03 September 2018","ref":[{"text":"Martin Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, Manjunath Kudlur, Josh Levenberg, Rajat Monga, Sherry Moore, Derek G.

Their efficient hardware implementation is crucial to applications at the edge. Binarized NNs (BNNs), where the weights and output of a neuron are of binary values {-1, +1} (or encoded in {0,1}), have been proposed recently. As no multiplier is required, they are particularly attractive and suitable for hardware realization. Most prior NN synthesis methods target on hardware architectures with neural processing elements (NPEs), where the weights of a neuron are loaded and the output of the neuron is computed. The load-and-compute method, though area efficient, requires expensive memory access, which deteriorates energy and performance efficiency. In this work we aim at synthesizing BNN dense layers into dedicated logic circuits. We formulate the corresponding matrix covering problem and propose a scalable algorithm to reduce the area and routing cost of BNNs. Experimental results justify the effectiveness of the method in terms of area and net savings on FPGA implementation. Our method provides an alternative implementation of BNNs, and can be applied in combination with NPE-based implementation for area, speed, and power tradeoffs.","author":["Chia-Chih Chi","Jie-Hong R.

While statistical optimization can be applied based on Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation, exploration of bitcell design space is time consuming. This paper presents a framework for model-based design and optimization of subthreshold SRAM bitcells under random PVT variations. By incorporating key design and process features, a physical model of bitcell static noise margin (SNM) has been derived analytically. It captures intra-die SNM variations by the combination of a folded-normal distribution and a non-central chi-squared distribution. Validations with MC simulation show its accuracy of modeling SNM distributions down to 25mV beyond 6-sigma for typical bitcells in 28nm. Model-based tuning of subthreshold SRAM bitcells is investigated for design tradeoff between leakage, area and stability. When targeting a specific SNM constraint, we show that an optimal standby voltage exists which offers minimum bitcell leakage power - any deviation above or below increases the power consumption. When targeting a specific standby voltage, our design flow identifies bitcell instances of 12x less leakage power or 3x reductions in area as compared to the minimum-length design.","author":["Xin Fan","Rui Wang","Tobias Gemmeke"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 38","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240836"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"V.

To meet this requirement, it is necessary to incorporate length-matching constraint into routing problem. However, the solutions of existing routing algorithms are inherently limited by pre-allocated splitters (SPLs), which complicates the subsequent routing stage under length-matching constraint. Hence, in this paper, we reallocate SPLs to fully utilize routing resources to cope with length-matching effectively. We propose the first multi-terminal routing algorithm for RSFQ circuits that integrates SPL reallocation into the routing stage. The experimental results on a practical circuit show that our proposed algorithm achieves routing completion while reducing the required area by 17%. Comparing to [2], we can still improve by 7% with less runtime when SPLs are pre-allocated.","author":["Pei-Yi Cheng","Kazuyoshi Takagi","Tsung-Yi Ho"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 111","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3243487"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"W Chen, AV Rylyakov, Vijay Patel, JE Lukens, and KK Likharev. 1999.

This exploratory phase is winding down as the 5G standards are currently being developed with a scheduled completion date of late-2019; the 5G wireless networks are expected to be deployed globally throughout 2020s. As such, it is time to reinitiate a similar brainstorming endeavour followed by the technical groundwork towards the subsequent generation (6G) wireless networks of 2030s. One reasonable starting point in this new 6G discussion is to reflect on the possible shortcomings of the 5G networks to-bedeployed. 5G promises to provide connectivity for a broad range of use-cases in a variety of vertical industries; after all, this rich set of scenarios is indeed what distinguishes 5G from the previous four generations. Many of the envisioned 5G use-cases require challenging target values for one or more of the key QoS elements, such as high rate, high reliability, low latency, and high energy efficiency; we refer to the presence of such demanding links as the super-connectivity.","author":["Halim Yanikomeroglu"],"issue":["MSWIM '18: Proceedings of the 21st ACM International Conference on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems","October 2018","Pages   3\u20134","https://doi.org/10.1145/3242102.3242148"],"date":"25 October 2018"},{"_id":"10.1145/3278721.3278779","title":"Mitigating Unwanted Biases with Adversarial Learning","abstract":"Machine learning is a tool for building models that accurately represent input training data. When undesired biases concerning demographic groups are in the training data, well-trained models will reflect those biases. We present a framework for mitigating such biases by including a variable for the group of interest and simultaneously learning a predictor and an adversary. The input to the network X, here text or census data, produces a prediction Y, such as an analogy completion or income bracket, while the adversary tries to model a protected variable Z, here gender or zip code. The objective is to maximize the predictor's ability to predict Y while minimizing the adversary's ability to predict Z. Applied to analogy completion, this method results in accurate predictions that exhibit less evidence of stereotyping Z. When applied to a classification task using the UCI Adult (Census) Dataset, it results in a predictive model that does not lose much accuracy while achieving very close to equality of odds (Hardt, et al., 2016). The method is flexible and applicable to multiple definitions of fairness as well as a wide range of gradient-based learning models, including both regression and classification tasks.","author":["Brian Hu Zhang","Blake Lemoine","Margaret Mitchell"],"issue":["AIES '18: Proceedings of the 2018 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society","December 2018","Pages   335\u2013340","https://doi.org/10.1145/3278721.3278779"],"date":"27 December 2018","ref":[{"text":"Asuncion, A., and Newman, D. 2007.

These non-volatile memories have trade-offs among access speed, capacity and bit cost.

Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)s offer a promising direction to reduce the computation cost by exploiting hardware parallelism. However, it is difficult to translate vision algorithms to FPGA bitstream efficiently. OpenVX is an industry standard for graph-based representation of vision algorithms. It defines a set of widely used vision kernels and data structures that can be used to form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to represent a vision algorithm. This paper proposes a framework for automatic FPGA acceleration of computer vision algorithms based on OpenVX specification, called AFFIX. AFFIX receives a vision algorithm formed using the OpenVX and generates a heterogeneous CPU-FPGA implementation. AFFIX incorporates several high level and low-level optimization methods to improve the efficiency of the FPGA implementation. It provides a configurable and extensible framework that enables vision algorithm developers to quickly develop, verify and test FPGA implementations of vision algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework via development and evaluations of multiple vision algorithms.","author":["Sajjad Taheri","Payman Behnam","Eli Bozorgzadeh","Alexander Veidenbaum","Alexandru Nicolau"],"issue":["FPGA '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2019","Pages   252\u2013261","https://doi.org/10.1145/3289602.3293907"],"date":"20 February 2019","ref":[{"text":"Computer vision technology permeates our daily lives. https://www.iotforall.com/computer-vision-applications-in-daily-life/.

Thus, verbal and nonverbal cues in robot behaviors are critical to ease conversational closure. In this study1, human participants observed either of three types of robot nonverbal behaviors, e.g., continual gestures by robot(Condition 1), reducing gestures(Condition 2) and gesture followed by adapter(Condition 3). All the conversations were videotaped, and the participants were interviewed after the experiment. The experimental results showed that adapter behaviors of robot helped to end a conversation. Furthermore, when the robot expressed adapters, the human followed suit, indicating that the participants wanted to end the conversation. These findings will contribute to the design of robot behavior that improves human-robot communication.","author":["Toshihiko Isaka","Ryosuke Aoki","Naoki Ohshima","Naoki Mukawa"],"issue":["OzCHI '18: Proceedings of the 30th Australian Conference on Computer-Human Interaction","December 2018","Pages   519\u2013523","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292147.3292243"],"date":"04 December 2018","ref":[{"text":"E.A.

Many existing graph kernels, which focus on local patterns within graphs rather than their global properties, suffer from significant structure information loss when representing graphs. Some recent global graph kernels, which utilizes the alignment of geometric node embeddings of graphs, yield state-of-the-art performance. However, these graph kernels are not necessarily positive-definite. More importantly, computing the graph kernel matrix will have at least quadratic time complexity in terms of the number and the size of the graphs. In this paper, we propose a new family of global alignment graph kernels, which take into account the global properties of graphs by using geometric node embeddings and an associated node transportation based on earth mover's distance. Compared to existing global kernels, the proposed kernel is positive-definite. Our graph kernel is obtained by defining a distribution over random graphs, which can naturally yield random feature approximations. The random feature approximations lead to our graph embeddings, which is named as \"random graph embeddings\" (RGE). In particular, RGE is shown to achieve (quasi-)linear scalability with respect to the number and the size of the graphs. The experimental results on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that RGE outperforms or matches twelve state-of-the-art graph classification algorithms.","author":["Lingfei Wu","Ian En-Hsu Yen","Zhen Zhang","Kun Xu","Liang Zhao","Xi Peng","Yinglong Xia","Charu Aggarwal"],"issue":["KDD '19: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2019","Pages   1418\u20131428","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292500.3330918"],"date":"25 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"Rami Al-Rfou, Dustin Zelle, and Bryan Perozzi. 2019.

Despite its importance, past research has mainly focused on studying and researching it in technology mediated interactions. As nature of technical artifacts becomes increasingly intelligent and human-like, a theory for explaining and predicting trust in such artifacts also becomes important. However, studying trust relationship of a user with technical artifacts is still in its infancy. To address this, we build on prior work which empirically modelled trust in user technology interactions and evaluate a human computer trust model using partial-least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Our research results identify four factors: competence, benevolence, willingness & reciprocity which impact user trust. Suggestions for future applications of the model are also discussed. Our study contributes to the literature by advancing the discussion on (a) human-like technologies and (b) the role of trust in human-artifact relationship.","author":["Siddharth Gulati","Sonia Sousa","David Lamas"],"issue":["IndiaHCI'18: Proceedings of the 9th Indian Conference on Human Computer Interaction","December 2018","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3297121.3297124"],"date":"16 December 2018","ref":[{"text":"Izak Benbasat and Weiquan Wang. 2005.

One is that, in most industries, data exists in the form of isolated islands. The other is the strengthening of data privacy and security. We propose a possible solution to these challenges: secure federated learning. Beyond the federated-learning framework first proposed by Google in 2016, we introduce a comprehensive secure federated-learning framework, which includes horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning, and federated transfer learning. We provide definitions, architectures, and applications for the federated-learning framework, and provide a comprehensive survey of existing works on this subject. In addition, we propose building data networks among organizations based on federated mechanisms as an effective solution to allowing knowledge to be shared without compromising user privacy.","author":["Qiang Yang","Yang Liu","Tianjian Chen","Yongxin Tong"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology","Volume 10","Issue 2","February 2019","Article No.: 12","pp   1\u201319","https://doi.org/10.1145/3298981"],"date":"28 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Martin Abadi, Andy Chu, Ian Goodfellow, H.

We provide an introduction to MOSO at the advanced tutorial level, aimed at researchers and practitioners who wish to begin working in this emerging area. Our focus is exclusively on MOSO methods that characterize the entire efficient or Pareto-optimal set as the solution to the MOSO problem; later, this set may be used as input to the broader multicriteria decision-making process. Our introduction to MOSO includes an overview of existing theory, methods, and provably convergent algorithms that explicitly control sampling error for (1) MOSO on finite sets, called multiobjective ranking and selection; (2) MOSO with integer-ordered decision variables; and (3) MOSO with continuous decision variables. In the context of integer-ordered and continuous decision variables, we focus on methods that provably converge to a local efficient set under the natural ordering. We also discuss key open questions that remain in this emerging field.","author":["Susan R. Hunter","Eric A.

The basic idea is to trade computation accuracy for power and energy during all phases of the computation, from data to algorithm and hardware implementation. In this paper, we explore how to utilize approximate computing for security based information hiding. More specifically, we will demonstrate with examples the potential of embedding information in approximate hardware and approximate data, as well as during approximate computation. We analyze both the security vulnerabilities that this may cause and the potential security applications enabled by such information hiding. We argue that information could be hidden behind approximate computation without compromising the computation accuracy or energy efficiency.","author":["Ye Wang","Qian Xu","Gang Qu","Jian Dong"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '19: Proceedings of the 2019 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2019","Pages   405\u2013410","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299874.3319456"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Shaoxiong Hua, Gang Qu, and S.

In 2016, the successful fabrication and testing of AQFP-based circuits with the scale of 83,000 JJs have demonstrated the scalability and potential of implementing large-scale systems using AQFP. As a result, it will be promising for AQFP in high-performance computing and deep space applications, with Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference acceleration as an important example. Besides ultra-high energy efficiency, AQFP exhibits two unique characteristics: the deep pipelining nature since each AQFP logic gate is connected with an AC clock signal, which increases the difficulty to avoid RAW hazards; the second is the unique opportunity of true random number generation (RNG) using a single AQFP buffer, far more efficient than RNG in CMOS. We point out that these two characteristics make AQFP especially compatible with the stochastic computing (SC) technique, which uses a time-independent bit sequence for value representation, and is compatible with the deep pipelining nature. Further, the application of SC has been investigated in DNNs in prior work, and the suitability has been illustrated as SC is more compatible with approximate computations. This work is the first to develop an SC-based DNN acceleration framework using AQFP technology. The deep-pipelining nature of AQFP circuits translates into the difficulty in designing accumulators/counters in AQFP, which makes the prior design in SC-based DNN not suitable. We overcome this limitation taking into account different properties in CONV and FC layers: (i) the inner product calculation in FC layers has more number of inputs than that in CONV layers; (ii) accurate activation function is critical in CONV rather than FC layers. Based on these observations, we propose (i) accurate integration of summation and activation function in CONV layers using bitonic sorting network and feedback loop, and (ii) low-complexity categorization block for FC layers based on chain of majority gates. For complete design we also develop (i) ultra-efficient stochastic number generator in AQFP, (ii) a high-accuracy sub-sampling (pooling) block in AQFP, and (iii) majority synthesis for further performance improvement and automatic buffer/splitter insertion for requirement of AQFP circuits. Experimental results suggest that the proposed SC-based DNN using AQFP can achieve up to 6.8 \u00d7 104 times higher energy efficiency compared to CMOS-based implementation while maintaining 96% accuracy on the MNIST dataset.","author":["Ruizhe Cai","Ao Ren","Olivia Chen","Ning Liu","Caiwen Ding","Xuehai Qian","Jie Han","Wenhui Luo","Nobuyuki Yoshikawa","Yanzhi Wang"],"issue":["ISCA '19: Proceedings of the 46th International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2019","Pages   567\u2013578","https://doi.org/10.1145/3307650.3322270"],"date":"22 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"Armin Alaghi and John P Hayes. 2013.

Despite the need for deep interdisciplinary knowledge, existing research occurs in separate disciplinary silos, and tackles separate portions of the sign language processing pipeline. This leads to three key questions: 1) What does an interdisciplinary view of the current landscape reveal? 2) What are the biggest challenges facing the field? and 3) What are the calls to action for people working in the field? To help answer these questions, we brought together a diverse group of experts for a two-day workshop. This paper presents the results of that interdisciplinary workshop, providing key background that is often overlooked by computer scientists, a review of the state-of-the-art, a set of pressing challenges, and a call to action for the research community.","author":["Danielle Bragg","Oscar Koller","Mary Bellard","Larwan Berke","Patrick Boudreault","Annelies Braffort","Naomi Caselli","Matt Huenerfauth","Hernisa Kacorri","Tessa Verhoef","Christian Vogler","Meredith Ringel Morris"],"issue":["ASSETS '19: The 21st International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility","October 2019","Pages   16\u201331","https://doi.org/10.1145/3308561.3353774"],"date":"24 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Nicoletta Adamo-Villani and Ronnie B.

In this paper, we discuss the unique economic properties of IoT data that bring new challenges to its market design.

Prior works have shown the merits of video-based and augmented reality (AR) tutoring systems for local tasks. However, due to the lack of a bodily representation of the tutor, they are not as effective for spatial and body-coordinated interactions. We propose avatars as an additional tutor representation to the existing AR instructions. In order to understand the design space of tutoring presence for machine tasks, we conduct a comparative study with 32 users. We aim to explore the strengths/limitations of the following four tutor options: video, non-avatar-AR, half-body+AR, and full-body+AR. The results show that users prefer the half-body+AR overall, especially for the spatial interactions. They have a preference for the full-body+AR for the body-coordinated interactions and the non-avatar-AR for the local interactions. We further discuss and summarize design recommendations and insights for future machine task tutoring systems.","author":["Yuanzhi Cao","Xun Qian","Tianyi Wang","Rachel Lee","Ke Huo","Karthik Ramani"],"issue":["CHI '20: Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","April 2020","Pages   1\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376688"],"date":"21 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"2019.

In this work, we found in addition to zero patterns, a larger group of repetitive patterns and values exists in the working-set of CNN inference task, which is defined as computation redundancy and induces unnecessary performance and storage overhead in CNN accelerators. Based on this observation, we proposed a redundancy-free architecture that detects and eliminates the repetitive computation and storage patterns in CNN for more efficient network inference. The architecture consists of two parts: the off-line parameter analyzer that extracts the repetitive patterns in the 3D tensor of parameters, and the dataflow accelerator. The proposed accelerator at first preprocesses the weight patterns and the dynamically generated activations, and then cache these intermediate results in special P2-cache banks for further usage in convolution or full-connection stage. It is evaluated in experiments that the proposed Cavoluche architecture removes up to 89% of the repetitive operations from the layer inference process and reduce 77% of on-chip storage space to store both redundancy-free weight and activations. It is seen in experiments that the implementation of Cavoluche outperforms the state-of-the-art mobile GPGPU in both performance and energy-efficiency. When compared to the latest sparsity base accelerators, Cavoluche also achieves better operation elimination effects.","author":["Ying Wang","Shengwen Liang","Huawei Li","Xiaowei Li"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 202","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317749"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"W.

While hand-designed features on point clouds have long been proposed in graphics and vision, however, the recent overwhelming success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis suggests the value of adapting insight from CNN to the point cloud world. Point clouds inherently lack topological information, so designing a model to recover topology can enrich the representation power of point clouds. To this end, we propose a new neural network module dubbed EdgeConv suitable for CNN-based high-level tasks on point clouds, including classification and segmentation. EdgeConv acts on graphs dynamically computed in each layer of the network. It is differentiable and can be plugged into existing architectures. Compared to existing modules operating in extrinsic space or treating each point independently, EdgeConv has several appealing properties: It incorporates local neighborhood information; it can be stacked applied to learn global shape properties; and in multi-layer systems affinity in feature space captures semantic characteristics over potentially long distances in the original embedding. We show the performance of our model on standard benchmarks, including ModelNet40, ShapeNetPart, and S3DIS.","author":["Yue Wang","Yongbin Sun","Ziwei Liu","Sanjay E. Sarma","Michael M.

Training a random forest demands a large number of relational comparison and data movement operations, which take long time when using modern CPUs. Accelerating random forest training using either GPUs or FPGAs achieves only modest speedups. In this paper, we propose RFAcc, a ReRAM based accelerator, to speed up random forest training process. We first devise a 3D ReRAM based relational comparison engine, referred to as 3D-VRComp, to enable parallel in-memory value comparison. We then exploit 3D-VRComp to construct RFAcc to speedup random forest training. Finally, we propose three optimizations, i.e., unary encoding, pipeline design, and parallel tree node training, to fully utilize the accelerator resources for maximized throughput improvement. Our experimental results show that, on average, RFAcc achieves 8564 and 16850 times speedup and 6.6 \u00d7 104 and 2.6 \u00d7 105 times energy saving over the training on a 4.2GHz Intel Core i7 CPU and a NVIDIA GTX1080 GPU, respectively.","author":["Lei Zhao","Quan Deng","Youtao Zhang","Jun Yang"],"issue":["ICS '19: Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Supercomputing","June 2019","Pages   473\u2013483","https://doi.org/10.1145/3330345.3330387"],"date":"26 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"Mahdi Nazm Bojnordi and Engin Ipek. 2016.

These techniques can be categorized as either global or local. While global techniques rely on analysis of a whole collection to discover word relationships, local techniques emphasize analysis of the top-ranked documents retrieved for a query. While local techniques have shown to be more effective that global techniques in general, existing local techniques are not robust and can seriously hurt retrieved when few of the retrieval documents are relevant. We propose a new technique, called local context analysis, which selects expansion terms based on cooccurrence with the query terms within the  top-ranked documents. Experiments on a number of collections, both English and non-English, show that local context analysis offers more effective and consistent retrieval results.","author":["Jinxi Xu","W.

The primary characteristic of sentiment analysis is to examine a body of text and identify the opinion expressed by it. Usually this sentiment is associated with a positive or a negative value, known as polarity. The overall sentiment is identified on the base of the polarity score and classified on the simplest binary form of Positivity, Negativity or Neuter. It works best on the content text or raw text consisting of subjective context, instead of just objective one. A successful Emotion Analysis, gives valuable and exact insights which can be effortlessly transformed into actions, by identifying audience's motives and impulses. It has various business aspect's, like in industries where it can provide information about the products used by the user's in the form of feedback's.

In many real-world applications, nodes in information networks are often associated with additional attributes, resulting in Attributed HINs (or AHINs). In this paper, we study semi-supervised learning (SSL) on AHINs to classify nodes based on their structure, node types and attributes, given limited supervision. Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have achieved impressive results in several graph-based SSL tasks. However, they operate on homogeneous networks, while being completely agnostic to the semantics of typed nodes and relationships in real-world HINs. In this paper, we seek to bridge the gap between semantic-rich HINs and the neighborhood aggregation paradigm of graph neural networks, to generalize GCNs through metagraph semantics. We propose a novel metagraph convolution operation to extract features from local metagraph-structured neighborhoods, thus capturing semantic higher-order relationships in AHINs. Our proposed neural architecture Meta-GNN extracts features of diverse semantics by utilizing multiple metagraphs, and employs a novel metagraph-attention module to learn personalized metagraph preferences for each node. Our semi-supervised node classification experiments on multiple real-world AHIN datasets indicate significant performance gains of 6% Micro-F1 on average over state-of-the-art AHIN baselines. Visualizations on metagraph attention weights yield interpretable insights into their relative task-specific importance.","author":["Aravind Sankar","Xinyang Zhang","Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang"],"issue":["ASONAM '19: Proceedings of the 2019 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining","August 2019","Pages   137\u2013144","https://doi.org/10.1145/3341161.3342859"],"date":"15 January 2020","ref":[{"text":"D.

GEMSEC is a general extension of earlier work in the domain of sequence-based graph embedding. GEMSEC places nodes in an abstract feature space where the vertex features minimize the negative log-likelihood of preserving sampled vertex neighborhoods, and it incorporates known social network properties through a machine learning regularization. We present two new social network datasets and show that by simultaneously considering the embedding and clustering problems with respect to social properties, GEMSEC extracts high-quality clusters competitive with or superior to other community detection algorithms.

Based on Cuckoo Filter (CF), AF improves insertion throughput on NVM with Spillable Buckets and Lookahead Eviction, and lookup throughput with Bucket Primacy. To analyze the effect of our optimizations, we design a probabilistic model to estimate the performance of CF and AF. For failure atomicity, AF writes minimum amount of logging to maintain its consistency. We evaluated AF and four other AMQs - CF, Morton Filter (MF), Rank-and-Select Quotient Filter (RSQF), and Bloom Filter (BF) - on NVM. We use Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory and Quartz emulation for the evaluation. AF and CF are generally much faster than the other filters for sequential runs. However, in high load factors CF's insertion throughput becomes prohibitively low due to the eviction overhead. With our optimizations, AF's insertion throughput is fastest even in high load factors. In parallel evaluation, AF's performance is substantially higher than CF for both insertion and lookup. Our optimizations reduce the bandwidth consumption, making AF's parallel performance much faster than CF's on bandwidth-limited NVM. For parallel insertion AF is up to 10.7X faster than CF (2.6X faster on average) and for parallel lookup AF is up to 1.2X faster (1.1X faster on average).","author":["Hyungjun Oh","Bongki Cho","Changdae Kim","Heejin Park","Jiwon Seo"],"issue":["EuroSys '20: Proceedings of the Fifteenth European Conference on Computer Systems","April 2020","Article No.: 21","Pages   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/3342195.3387528"],"date":"15 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"Intel 64 and ia-32 architectures software developer's manual volume 3a, section 8.2.2. https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32--architectures-software-developer-vol-3a-part-1--manual.pdf.","order":1},{"text":"Intel and Micron Produce Breakthrough Memory Technology. https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-and-micron-produce-breakthrough-memory-technology.","order":2},{"text":"J.

Concurrently, many works have been proposing the incorporation of approximate computing techniques within HLS toolchains, allowing automated generation of inexact circuits for error-tolerant application domains with the aim of trading-off computation accuracy with area/power savings or performance improvements. Thus, when attempting to make a design meet timing requirements, designers of real-time systems using HLS may resort to approximation approaches. However, current approximate HLS tools do not allow specifying real-time constraints, being instead error-constrained to explore area, power, or performance optimizations. In this work, we propose an approximate HLS framework for real-time systems that can be integrated with state-of-the-art HLS tools. With this framework designers can specify real-time constraints and satisfy them while minimizing the output error. It uses scheduling information and Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) analysis for iteratively exploring time-error trade-offs of approximations in the time-critical execution path. Experimental results on signal and image processing benchmarks show that we can reduce the WCET of exact designs by up to 35% with acceptable quality degradation.","author":["Marcos T.

This paper presents a small length LDPC code of six-by-seven. The shifted identity matrix and a lower staircase matrix are used to construct the LDPC code.

However, efficient implementation suffers from very sequential execution that tremendously slows down both training and inference compared to other neural networks. This is the primary reason that prevents intensive research involving MD-LSTM in the recent years, despite large progress in microelectronics and architectures. The main goal of the current research is to provide acceleration for inference of MD-LSTM, so to open a door for efficient training that can boost application of MD-LSTM. By this research we advocate that FPGA is an alternative platform for deep learning that can offer a solution in cases when a massive parallelism of GPUs does not provide the necessary performance required by the application. In this paper, we present the first hardware architecture for MD-LSTM. We conduct a systematic exploration of precision vs. accuracy trade-off using challenging dataset for historical document image binarization from DIBCO 2017 contest, and well known MNIST dataset for handwritten digits recognition. Based on our new architecture we implement FPGA-based accelerator that outperforms NVIDIA K80 GPU implementation in terms of runtime by up to 50x and energy efficiency by up to 746x. At the same time, our accelerator demonstrates higher accuracy and comparable throughput in comparison with state-of-the-art FPGA-based implementations of multilayer perceptron for MNIST dataset.","author":["Vladimir Rybalkin","Norbert Wehn"],"issue":["FPGA '20: Proceedings of the 2020 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2020","Pages   111\u2013121","https://doi.org/10.1145/3373087.3375301"],"date":"23 February 2020","ref":[{"text":"[n. d.]. http://pytorch.org/","order":1},{"text":"[n. d.].

Surprisingly, the loop transformations needed to create these hardware variants can be precisely and concisely represented by Halide's scheduling language. By modifying the Halide compiler to generate hardware, we create a system that can fairly compare these prior accelerators. As long as proper loop blocking schemes are used, and the hardware can support mapping replicated loops, many different hardware dataflows yield similar energy efficiency with good performance. This is because the loop blocking can ensure that most data references stay on-chip with good locality and the processing units have high resource utilization. How resources are allocated, especially in the memory system, has a large impact on energy and performance. By optimizing hardware resource allocation while keeping throughput constant, we achieve up to 4.2X energy improvement for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), 1.6X and 1.8X improvement for Long Short-Term Memories (LSTMs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), respectively.","author":["Xuan Yang","Mingyu Gao","Qiaoyi Liu","Jeff Setter","Jing Pu","Ankita Nayak","Steven Bell","Kaidi Cao","Heonjae Ha","Priyanka Raina","Christos Kozyrakis","Mark Horowitz"],"issue":["ASPLOS '20: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2020","Pages   369\u2013383","https://doi.org/10.1145/3373376.3378514"],"date":"09 March 2020","ref":[{"text":"ARM ML Processor. https://developer.arm.com/products/processors/machine-learning/arm-ml-processor/.","order":1},{"text":"NVDLA. http://nvdla.org/.","order":2},{"text":"Tensilica customizable processor IP. http://ip.cadence.com/ipportfolio/tensilica-ip.","order":3},{"text":"Jorge Albericio, Patrick Judd, Tayler Hetherington, Tor Aamodt, Natalie Enright Jerger, and Andreas Moshovos.

Therefore, this article proposes a novel two-step Korean POS tagger that solves the problems. This tagger first generates a sequence of lemmatized and recovered morphemes that can be mapped one-to-one to a POS tag using an encoder-decoder architecture derived from a POS-tagged corpus. Then, the POS tag of each morpheme in the generated sequence is finally determined by a standard sequence labeling method. Since the knowledge for segmenting and recovering morphemes is extracted automatically from a POS-tagged corpus by an encoder-decoder architecture, the POS tagger is constructed without a dictionary nor handcrafted linguistic rules. The experimental results on a standard dataset show that the proposed method outperforms existing POS taggers with its state-of-the-art performance.","author":["Hyun-Je Song","Seong-Bae Park"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing","Volume 19","Issue 3","April 2020","Article No.: 41","pp   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3373608"],"date":"09 January 2020","ref":[{"text":"Dae-Ho Baek, Ho Lee, and Hae-Chang Rim. 1995.

However, in FL involving business participants, they might incur significant costs if several competitors join the same federation. Furthermore, the training and commercialization of the models will take time, resulting in delays before the federation accumulates enough budget to pay back the participants. The issues of costs and temporary mismatch between contributions and rewards have not been addressed by existing payoff-sharing schemes. In this paper, we propose the Federated Learning Incentivizer (FLI) payoff-sharing scheme. The scheme dynamically divides a given budget in a context-aware manner among data owners in a federation by jointly maximizing the collective utility while minimizing the inequality among the data owners, in terms of the payoff gained by them and the waiting time for receiving payoff. Extensive experimental comparisons with five state-of-the-art payoff-sharing schemes show that FLI is the most attractive to high quality data owners and achieves the highest expected revenue for a data federation.","author":["Han Yu","Zelei Liu","Yang Liu","Tianjian Chen","Mingshu Cong","Xi Weng","Dusit Niyato","Qiang Yang"],"issue":["AIES '20: Proceedings of the AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society","February 2020","Pages   393\u2013399","https://doi.org/10.1145/3375627.3375840"],"date":"07 February 2020","ref":[{"text":"1978.

Existing LDP protocols are developed primarily to ensure data privacy in the collection of single numerical or categorical values, such as click count in Web access logs. However, in federated learning model parameter updates are collected iteratively from each participant and consist of high dimensional, continuous values with high precision (10s of digits after the decimal point), making existing LDP protocols inapplicable. To address this challenge in LDP-Fed, we design and develop two novel approaches. First, LDP-Fed's LDP Module provides a formal differential privacy guarantee for the repeated collection of model training parameters in the federated training of large-scale neural networks over multiple individual participants' private datasets. Second, LDP-Fed implements a suite of selection and filtering techniques for perturbing and sharing select parameter updates with the parameter server. We validate our system deployed with a condensed LDP protocol in training deep neural networks on public data. We compare this version of LDP-Fed, coined CLDP-Fed, with other state-of-the-art approaches with respect to model accuracy, privacy preservation, and system capabilities.","author":["Stacey Truex","Ling Liu","Ka-Ho Chow","Mehmet Emre Gursoy","Wenqi Wei"],"issue":["EdgeSys '20: Proceedings of the Third ACM International Workshop on Edge Systems, Analytics and Networking","April 2020","Pages   61\u201366","https://doi.org/10.1145/3378679.3394533"],"date":"27 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, et al. 2016a.

Quantum computers can be conceived from basic photonic elements, such as Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI), but they still need control mechanisms and sensing elements from traditional VLSI technology. In this study, we present an ongoing study on a potential architecture for these basic photonic circuits. We realized two Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC) test structures embedding metallic thermistors as phase shifters and silicon photodiodes as output detectors. We present a complete characterization of the phase shifter elements for an effective on-chip PIC interaction. To induce a consistent phase shift still retaining coherence of light, we act on the phase-shifters by means of a closed-loop control. By controlling through Pulse-Width Modulation the phase shifters, we drive the path of photons accurately in the PIC, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed configuration for the management of a photonic chip.","author":["Luca Gemma","Martino Bernard","Mher Ghulinyan","Davide Brunelli"],"issue":["CF '20: Proceedings of the 17th ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers","May 2020","Pages   245\u2013248","https://doi.org/10.1145/3387902.3394034"],"date":"11 May 2020","ref":[{"text":"The Verge.

Most of these devices are based on the embedded systems that have to operate on limited energy resources, such as batteries or energy harvesters. Therefore, energy efficiency is one of the critical issues for these devices. To relieve the energy consumption by reducing the total accesses on memory and storage layers, the technologies of storage-class memory (SCM) and data compression techniques are applied to eliminate the data movements and squeeze the data size, respectively. However, the information gap between them hinders the cooperation among the two techniques for achieving further optimizations on minimizing energy consumption. This work proposes a write-friendly arithmetic coding with joint managing both techniques to achieve energy-efficient non-volatile memory (NVM) systems. In particular, the concept of \"ignorable bits\" is introduced to further skip the write operations while storing the compressed data into SCM devices. The proposed design was evaluated by a series of intensive experiments, and the results are encouraging.","author":["Yi-Shen Chen","Chun-Feng Wu","Yuan-Hao Chang","Tei-Wei Kuo"],"issue":["ASPDAC '21: Proceedings of the 26th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2021","Pages   633\u2013638","https://doi.org/10.1145/3394885.3431511"],"date":"18 January 2021","ref":[{"text":"Nasir Ahmed, T_ Natarajan, and Kamisetty R Rao. 1974.

This work proposes an optimization framework, DeepOpt, for general ASIC-based systolic hardware accelerators for layer-specific and hardware-specific scheduling strategy for each layer of a CNN to optimize energy and latency. Optimal hardware allocation significantly reduces execution cost as compared to generic static hardware resource allocation, e.g., improvements of up to 50x in the energy-delay product for VGG-16 and 41x for GoogleNet-v1.","author":["Susmita Dey Manasi","Sachin S.

Inferring missing events in temporal knowledge graphs is a fundamental and challenging task. However, most existing methods solely focus on entity features or consider the entities and relations in a disjoint manner. They do not integrate the features of entities and relations in their modeling process. In this paper, we propose TPmod, a tendency-guided prediction model, to predict the missing events for TKGs (extrapolation). Differing from existing works, we propose two definitions for TKGs: the Goodness of relations and the Closeness of entity pairs. More importantly, inspired by the attention mechanism, we propose a novel tendency strategy to guide our aggregated process. It integrates the features of entities and relations, and assigns varying weights to different past events. What is more, we select the Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) as our sequential encoder to model the temporal dependency in TKGs. Besides, the Softmax function is employed to generate the final decreasing group of candidate entities. We evaluate our model on two TKG datasets: GDELT-5 and ICEWS-250. Experimental results show that our method has a significant and consistent improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines.","author":["Luyi Bai","Xiangnan Ma","Mingcheng Zhang","Wenting Yu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data","Volume 15","Issue 3","April 2021","Article No.: 41","pp   1\u201317","https://doi.org/10.1145/3443687"],"date":"21 April 2021","ref":[{"text":"Giang Hoang Nguyen, Jhon Boaz Lee, Ryan A.

However, this outcome is not easily transferable to tree-structured CA, since the neighbors having half and double the index value of the current CA cell under question can be sufficiently distanced apart on the FPGA floor. Challenges to meet throughput requirements, seamlessly translate algorithmic modifications for changing application specifications to gate level architectures and to address reliability challenges of semiconductor chips are ever increasing. Thus, a proper design framework assisting automation of synthesizable, delay-optimized VLSI architecture descriptions facilitating testability is desirable. In this article, we have automated the generation of hardware description of tree-structured CA that includes a built-in scan path realized with zero area and delay overhead. The scan path facilitates seeding the CA, state modification, and fault localization on the FPGA fabric. Three placement algorithms were proposed to ensure maximum physical adjacency amongst neighboring CA cells, arranged in a multi-columnar fashion on the FPGA grid. Our proposed architectures outperform implementations arising out of standard placers and behavioral designs, existing tree mapping strategies, and state-of-the-art FPGA centric error detection architectures in area and speed.","author":["Ayan Palchaudhuri","Sandeep Sharma","Anindya Sundar Dhar"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 26","Issue 4","April 2021","Article No.: 31","pp   1\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/3446206"],"date":"22 April 2021","ref":[{"text":"Xilinx Inc. 2016. 7 Series FPGAs Configurable Logic Block, User Guide, UG474 (v1.7).

As energy harvesting is an attractive IoT power source, recent ReRAM-based CNN accelerators have been designed for operation on harvested energy. When addressing the instability problems of harvested energy, prior optimization techniques often assume that the load is fixed, overlooking the close interactions among input power, computational load, and circuit efficiency, or adapt the dynamic load to match the just-in-time incoming power under a simple harvesting architecture with no intermediate energy storage.Targeting a more efficient harvesting architecture equipped with both energy storage and energy delivery modules, this paper is the first effort to target whole system, end-to-end efficiency for an energy harvesting ReRAM-based accelerator. First, we model the relationships among ReRAM load power, DC-DC converter efficiency, and power failure overhead. Then, a maximum computation progress tracking scheme (MaxTracker) is proposed to achieve a joint optimization of the whole system by tuning the load power of the ReRAM-based accelerator. Specifically, MaxTracker accommodates both continuous and intermittent computing schemes and provides dynamic ReRAM load according to harvesting scenarios.We evaluate MaxTracker over four input power scenarios, and the experimental results show average speedups of 38.4%/40.3% (up to 51.3%/84.4%), over a full activation scheme (with energy storage) and order-of-magnitude speedups over the recently proposed (energy storage-less) ResiRCA technique. Furthermore, we also explore MaxTracker in combination with the Capybara reconfigurable capacitor approach to offer more flexible tuners and thus further boost the system performance.","author":["Keni Qiu","Nicholas Jao","Kunyu Zhou","Yongpan Liu","Jack Sampson","Mahmut Taylan Kandemir","Vijaykrishnan Narayanan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 20","Issue 5s","October 2021","Article No.: 78","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3477009"],"date":"22 September 2021","ref":[{"text":"M.

In this paper, we investigate an emerging class of distributed systems where low-level communication does not rely on network topological location. Rather, low-level communication is based on attributes that are external to the network topology and relevant to the application. When combined with dense deployment of nodes, this kind of named data enables in-network processing for data aggregation, collaborative signal processing, and similar problems. These approaches are essential for emerging applications such as sensor networks where resources such as bandwidth and energy are limited. This paper is the first description of the software architecture that supports named data and in-network processing in an operational, multi-application sensor-network. We show that approaches such as in-network aggregation and nested queries can significantly affect network traffic. In one experiment aggregation reduces traffic by up to 42% and nested queries reduce loss rates by 30%. Although aggregation has been previously studied in simulation, this paper demonstrates nested queries as another form of in-network processing, and it presents the first evaluation of these approaches over an operational testbed.","author":["John Heidemann","Fabio Silva","Chalermek Intanagonwiwat","Ramesh Govindan","Deborah Estrin","Deepak Ganesan"],"issue":["SOSP '01: Proceedings of the eighteenth ACM symposium on Operating systems principles","October 2001","Pages   146\u2013159","https://doi.org/10.1145/502034.502049"],"date":"21 October 2001","ref":[{"text":"W.

As a result, informed coscheduling can yield significant performance gains over naive schedulers. However, prior work on coscheduling focused on equal-priority job mixes, which is an unrealistic assumption for modern operating systems.This paper demonstrates that a scheduler for an SMT machine can both satisfy process priorities and symbiotically schedule low and high priority threads to increase system throughput. Naive priority schedulers dedicate the machine to high priority jobs to meet priority goals, and as a result decrease opportunities for increased performance from multithreading and coscheduling. More informed schedulers, however, can dynamically monitor the progress and resource utilization of jobs on the machine, and dynamically adjust the degree of multithreading to improve performance while still meeting priority goals.Using detailed simulation of an SMT architecture, we introduce and evaluate a series of five software and hardware-assisted priority schedulers. Overall, our results indicate that coscheduling priority jobs can significantly increase system throughput by as much as 40%, and that (1) the benefit depends upon the relative priority of the coscheduled jobs, and (2) more sophisticated schedulers are more effective when the differences in priorities are greatest. We show that our priority schedulers can decrease average turnaround times for a random jobmix by as much as 33%.","author":["Allan Snavely","Dean M.

Finding a heuristic that performs well on a broad range of applications is a tedious and difficult process. This paper introduces Meta Optimization, a methodology for automatically fine-tuning compiler heuristics. Meta Optimization uses machine-learning techniques to automatically search the space of compiler heuristics. Our techniques reduce compiler design complexity by relieving compiler writers of the tedium of heuristic tuning. Our machine-learning system uses an evolutionary algorithm to automatically find effective compiler heuristics. We present promising experimental results. In one mode of operation Meta Optimization creates application-specific heuristics which often result in impressive speedups. For hyperblock formation, one optimization we present in this paper, we obtain an average speedup of 23% (up to 73%) for the applications in our suite. Furthermore, by evolving a compiler's heuristic over several benchmarks, we can create effective, general-purpose heuristics. The best general-purpose heuristic our system found for hyperblock formation improved performance by an average of 25% on our training set, and 9% on a completely unrelated test set. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques on three different optimizations in this paper: hyperblock formation, register allocation, and data prefetching.","author":["Mark Stephenson","Saman Amarasinghe","Martin Martin","Una-May O'Reilly"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 38","Issue 5","May 2003","pp   77\u201390","https://doi.org/10.1145/780822.781141"],"date":"09 May 2003","ref":[{"text":"S.

Therefore, for memory intensive workloads, it becomes more important to overlap multiple cache misses than to overlap slow memory operations with other computations. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to parallelize sequential cache misses, thereby increasing memory-level parallelism (MLP). Our idea is based on the value prediction, which was proposed originally as an instruction-level-parallelism (ILP) optimization to break true data dependencies. In this paper, we advocate value prediction in its capability to enhance MLP instead of ILP. We propose to use value prediction and value speculative execution only for prefetching so that the complex prediction validation and misprediction recovery mechanisms are avoided and only minor changes in the microarchitecture are needed. The same hardware modifications also enable aggressive memory disambiguation for prefetching. The experimental results show that our technique enhances MLP effectively and achieves significant speedups even with a simple stride value predictor.","author":["Huiyang Zhou","Thomas M.

Today, Web surfers access the Web through two dominant interfaces: clicking on hyperlinks and searching via keyword queries. This process is often tentative and unsatisfactory. Better support is needed for expressing one's information need and dealing with a search result in more structured ways than available now. Data mining and machine learning have significant roles to play towards this end.In this paper we will survey recent advances in learning and mining problems related to hypertext in general and the Web in particular. We will review the continuum of supervised to semi-supervised to unsupervised learning problems, highlight the specific challenges which distinguish data mining in the hypertext domain from data mining in the context of data warehouses, and summarize the key areas of recent and ongoing research.","author":["Soumen Chakrabarti"],"issue":["ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter","Volume 1","Issue 2","January 2000","pp   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/846183.846187"],"date":"01 January 2000","ref":[{"text":"R.

This is achieved by batteries serving as a dedicated energy source. The requirement of portability places severe restrictions on size and weight, which in turn limits the amount of energy that is continuously available to maintain system operability. For these reasons, efficient energy utilization has become one of the key challenges to the designer of battery-powered embedded computing systems.In this paper, we first present a novel analytical battery model, which can be used for the battery lifetime estimation. The high quality of the proposed model is demonstrated with measurements and simulations. Using this battery model, we introduce a new \"battery-aware\" cost function, which will be used for optimizing the lifetime of the battery. This cost function generalizes the traditional minimization metric, namely the energy consumption of the system. We formulate the problem of battery-aware task scheduling on a single processor with multiple voltages. Then, we prove several important mathematical properties of the cost function. Based on these properties, we propose several algorithms for task ordering and voltage assignment, including optimal idle period insertion to exercise charge recovery.This paper presents the first effort toward a formal treatment of battery-aware task scheduling and voltage scaling, based on an accurate analytical model of the battery behavior.","author":["Daler Rakhmatov","Sarma Vrudhula"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 2","Issue 3","August 2003","pp   277\u2013324","https://doi.org/10.1145/860176.860179"],"date":"01 August 2003","ref":[{"text":"Arora, P., Doyle, M., Gozdz, A., White, R., and Newman, J. 2000.

The key idea is to carry along with the computation an explicit representation of the required rounding accuracy.We begin with the simpler problem of converting fixed-point fractions. A modification of the well-known algorithm for radix-conversion of fixed-point fractions by multiplication explicitly determines when to terminate the conversion process; a variable number of digits are produced. The algorithm has these properties:\nNo information is lost; the original fraction can be recovered from the output by rounding.No \u201cgarbage digits\u201d are produced.The output is correctly rounded.It is never necessary to propagate carries on rounding.We then derive two algorithms for free-formal output of floating-point numbers. The first simply scales the given floating-point number to an appropriate fractional range and then applies the algorithm for fractions. This is quite fast and simple to code but has inaccuracies stemming from round-off errors and oversimplification. The second algorithm guarantees mathematical accuracy by using multiple-precision integer arithmetic and handling special cases. Both algorithms produce no more digits than necessary (intuitively, the \u201c1.3 prints as 1.2999999\u201d problem does not occur).Finally, we modify the free-format conversion algorithm for use in fixed-format applications. Information may be lost if the fixed format provides too few digit positions, but the output is always correctly rounded. On the other hand, no \u201cgarbage digits\u201d are ever produced, even if the fixed format specifies too many digit positions (intuitively, the \u201c4/3 prints as 1.333333328366279602\u201d problem does not occur).","author":["Guy L.

A basic problem in contingency table analysis is co-clustering: simultaneous clustering of the rows and columns. A novel theoretical formulation views the contingency table as an empirical joint probability distribution of two discrete random variables and poses the co-clustering problem as an optimization problem in information theory---the optimal co-clustering maximizes the mutual information between the clustered random variables subject to constraints on the number of row and column clusters. We present an innovative co-clustering algorithm that monotonically increases the preserved mutual information by intertwining both the row and column clusterings at all stages. Using the practical example of simultaneous word-document clustering, we demonstrate that our algorithm works well in practice, especially in the presence of sparsity and high-dimensionality.","author":["Inderjit S.

Yet little is known about the frequency of misconfiguration or its causes, except for the few spectacular incidents of widespread outages. In this paper, we present the first quantitative study of BGP misconfiguration. Over a three week period, we analyzed routing table advertisements from 23 vantage points across the Internet backbone to detect incidents of misconfiguration. For each incident we polled the ISP operators involved to verify whether it was a misconfiguration, and to learn the cause of the incident. We also actively probed the Internet to determine the impact of misconfiguration on connectivity.Surprisingly, we find that configuration errors are pervasive, with 200-1200 prefixes (0.2-1.0% of the BGP table size) suffering from misconfiguration each day. Close to 3 in 4 of all new prefix advertisements were results of misconfiguration. Fortunately, the connectivity seen by end users is surprisingly robust to misconfigurations. While misconfigurations can substantially increase the update load on routers, only one in twenty five affects connectivity. While the causes of misconfiguration are diverse, we argue that most could be prevented through better router design.","author":["Ratul Mahajan","David Wetherall","Tom Anderson"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 32","Issue 4","October 2002","pp   3\u201316","https://doi.org/10.1145/964725.633027"],"date":"19 August 2002","ref":[{"text":"C.

Although most of the images created with these algorithms do give the impression of transparency, they usually do not look realistic. One of the most serious problems is that the intensity of the light that is transmitted through the objects is generally not proportional to the amount of material through which it must pass. Another problem is that the image seen behind the objects is not distorted as would naturally occur when the light is refracted as it passes through a material of different density.Use of a non-linear transparency algorithm can provide a great improvement in the realism of an image at a small additional cost. Making the transparency proportional to the normal to the surface causes it to decrease towards the edges of the surface where the path of the light through the object is longer. The exact simulation of refraction, however, requires that each sight ray be individually traced from the observer, through the picture plane and through each transparent object until an opaque surface is intersected. Since the direction of the ray would change as each material of differing optical density was entered, the hidden surface calculations required would be very time consuming. However, if a few assumptions are made about the geometry of each object and about the conditions under which they are viewed, a much simplier algorithm can be used to approximate the refractive effect. This method proceeds in a back to front order, mapping the current background image onto the next surface, until all surfaces have been considered.","author":["Douglas Scott Kay","Donald Greenberg"],"issue":["ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics","Volume 13","Issue 2","August 1979","pp   158\u2013164","https://doi.org/10.1145/965103.807438"],"date":"01 August 1979","ref":[{"text":"Atherton, Peter, Weiler, Kevin and Greenberg, Donald Polygon shadow generation.

Separating surface interaction into diffuse plus specular, we compute the specular component on the fly, as in ray tracing, and store the diffuse component (the radiosity) for later-reuse, similar to a radiosity algorithm. Radiosities are stored in adaptive radiosity textures (rexes)1 that record the pattern of light and shadow on every diffuse surface in the scene. They adaptively subdivide themselves to the appropriate level of detail for the picture being made, resolving sharp shadow edges automatically.We use a three-pass, bidirectional ray tracing algorithm that traces rays from both the lights and the eye. The \"size pass\" records visibility information on diffuse surfaces; the \"light pass\" progressively traces rays from lights and bright surfaces to deposit photons on diffuse surfaces to construct the radiosity textures; and the \"eye pass\" traces rays from the eye, collecting light from diffuse surfaces to make a picture.","author":["Paul S.

In this paper, we propose a new statistically aware Dual-Vt and sizing optimization that considers both the variability in performance and leakage of a design. While extensive work has been performed in the past on statistical analysis methods, circuit optimization is still largely performed using deterministic methods. We show in this paper that deterministic optimization quickly looses effectiveness for stringent performance and leakage constraints in designs with significant variability. We then propose a statistically aware dual-Vt and sizing algorithm where both delay constraints and sensitivity computations are performed in a statistical manner. We demonstrate that using this statistically aware optimization, leakage power can be reduced by 15-35% compared to traditional deterministic analysis. The improvements increase for strict delay constraints making statistical optimization especially important for high performance designs.","author":["Ashish Srivastava","Dennis Sylvester","David Blaauw"],"issue":["DAC '04: Proceedings of the 41st annual Design Automation Conference","June 2004","Pages   773\u2013778","https://doi.org/10.1145/996566.996775"],"date":"07 June 2004","ref":[{"text":"S.

Regular users and even expert database administrators struggle to tune these parameters for good performance. The wave of research on improving database manageability has largely overlooked this problem which turns out to be hard to solve. We describe iTuned, a tool that automates the task of identifying good settings for database configuration parameters. iTuned has three novel features: (i) a technique called Adaptive Sampling that proactively brings in appropriate data through planned experiments to find high-impact parameters and high-performance parameter settings, (ii) an executor that supports online experiments in production database environments through a cycle-stealing paradigm that places near-zero overhead on the production workload; and (iii) portability across different database systems. We show the effectiveness of iTuned through an extensive evaluation based on different types of workloads, database systems, and usage scenarios.","author":["Songyun Duan","Vamsidhar Thummala","Shivnath Babu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 2","Issue 1","August 2009","pp   1246\u20131257","https://doi.org/10.14778/1687627.1687767"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"E.

The challenge for many complex event processing (CEP) systems is to be able to evaluate event patterns on high-volume data streams while adhering to real-time constraints. To solve this problem, in this paper we present a hardware-based complex event detection system implemented on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). By inserting the FPGA directly into the data path between the network interface and the CPU, our solution can detect complex events at gigabit wire speed with constant and fully predictable latency, independently of network load, packet size, or data distribution. This is a significant improvement over CPU-based systems and an architectural approach that opens up interesting opportunities for hybrid stream engines that combine the flexibility of the CPU with the parallelism and processing power of FPGAs.","author":["Louis Woods","Jens Teubner","Gustavo Alonso"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   660\u2013669","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920926"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"J.

In this paper, we identify a major performance bottleneck of Hadoop: its lack of ability to colocate related data on the same set of nodes. To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce CoHadoop, a lightweight extension of Hadoop that allows applications to control where data are stored. In contrast to previous approaches, CoHadoop retains the flexibility of Hadoop in that it does not require users to convert their data to a certain format (e.g., a relational database or a specific file format). Instead, applications give hints to CoHadoop that some set of files are related and may be processed jointly; CoHadoop then tries to colocate these files for improved efficiency. Our approach is designed such that the strong fault tolerance properties of Hadoop are retained. Colocation can be used to improve the efficiency of many operations, including indexing, grouping, aggregation, columnar storage, joins, and sessionization. We conducted a detailed study of joins and sessionization in the context of log processing---a common use case for Hadoop---, and propose efficient map-only algorithms that exploit colocated data partitions. In our experiments, we observed that CoHadoop outperforms both plain Hadoop and previous work. In particular, our approach not only performs better than repartition-based algorithms, but also outperforms map-only algorithms that do exploit data partitioning but not colocation. 8.","author":["Mohamed Y.

Many machine learning methods such as linear regression or support vector machines rely on this representation. However, when the underlying data has strong relational patterns, especially relations with high cardinality, the design matrix can get very large which can make learning and prediction slow or even infeasible.This work solves this issue by making use of repeating patterns in the design matrix which stem from the underlying relational structure of the data. It is shown how coordinate descent learning and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference can be scaled for linear regression and factorization machine models. Empirically, it is shown on two large scale and very competitive datasets (Netflix prize, KDDCup 2012), that (1) standard learning algorithms based on the design matrix representation cannot scale to relational predictor variables, (2) the proposed new algorithms scale and (3) the predictive quality of the proposed generic feature-based approach is as good as the best specialized models that have been tailored to the respective tasks.","author":["Steffen Rendle"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 5","March 2013","pp   337\u2013348","https://doi.org/10.14778/2535573.2488340"],"date":"01 March 2013","ref":[{"text":"C.-T.

The emergence of massive scale spatial data is due to the proliferation of cost effective and ubiquitous positioning technologies, development of high resolution imaging technologies, and contribution from a large number of community users. There are two major challenges for managing and querying massive spatial data to support spatial queries: the explosion of spatial data, and the high computational complexity of spatial queries. In this paper, we present Hadoop-GIS - a scalable and high performance spatial data warehousing system for running large scale spatial queries on Hadoop. Hadoop-GIS supports multiple types of spatial queries on MapReduce through spatial partitioning, customizable spatial query engine RESQUE, implicit parallel spatial query execution on MapReduce, and effective methods for amending query results through handling boundary objects. Hadoop-GIS utilizes global partition indexing and customizable on demand local spatial indexing to achieve efficient query processing. Hadoop-GIS is integrated into Hive to support declarative spatial queries with an integrated architecture. Our experiments have demonstrated the high efficiency of Hadoop-GIS on query response and high scalability to run on commodity clusters. Our comparative experiments have showed that performance of Hadoop-GIS is on par with parallel SDBMS and outperforms SDBMS for compute-intensive queries. Hadoop-GIS is available as a set of library for processing spatial queries, and as an integrated software package in Hive.","author":["Ablimit Aji","Fusheng Wang","Hoang Vo","Rubao Lee","Qiaoling Liu","Xiaodong Zhang","Joel Saltz"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 11","August 2013","pp   1009\u20131020","https://doi.org/10.14778/2536222.2536227"],"date":"01 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"Geocouch. https://github.com/couchbase/geocouch/.","order":1},{"text":"neo4j/spatial. https://github.com/neo4j/spatial.","order":2},{"text":"The sloan digital sky survey project (sdss). http://www.sdss.org.","order":3},{"text":"Spatial index library. http://libspatialindex.github.com.","order":4},{"text":"Spatialhadoop. http://spatialhadoop.cs.umn.edu/.","order":5},{"text":"Geos. http://trac.osgeo.org/geos, 2013.","order":6},{"text":"Hadoop-GIS wiki. https://web.cci.emory.edu/confluence/display/hadoopgis, 2013.","order":7},{"text":"Openstreetmap. http://www.openstreetmap.org, 2013.","order":8},{"text":"Pathology analytical imaging standards. https://web.cci.emory.edu/confluence/display/PAIS, 2013.","order":9},{"text":"A.

There is no appropriate analytical model and experimenting with commercial SSDs is cumbersome, as it requires a careful experimental methodology to ensure repeatability. Worse, performance results obtained on a given SSD cannot be generalized. Overall, it is impossible to explore how a given algorithm, say a hash join or LSM-tree insertions, leverages the intrinsic parallelism of a modern SSD, or how a slight change in the internals of an SSD would impact its overall performance. In this paper, we propose a new SSD simulation framework, named EagleTree, which addresses these problems, and enables a principled study of SSD-Based algorithms. The demonstration scenario illustrates the design space for algorithms based on an SSD-based IO stack, and shows how researchers and practitioners can use EagleTree to perform tractable explorations of this complex design space.","author":["Niv Dayan","Martin Kj\u00e6r Svendsen","Matias Bj\u00f8rling","Philippe Bonnet","Luc Bouganim"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 12","August 2013","pp   1290\u20131293","https://doi.org/10.14778/2536274.2536298"],"date":"01 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"N.

For example, users can simply snap a movie poster to search relevant reviews and trailers. To solve the problem, a set of mapping functions are learned to project high-dimensional features extracted from data of different media types into a common low-dimensional space so that metric distance measures can be applied. In this paper, we propose an effective mapping mechanism based on deep learning (i.e., stacked auto-encoders) for multi-modal retrieval. Mapping functions are learned by optimizing a new objective function, which captures both intra-modal and inter-modal semantic relationships of data from heterogeneous sources effectively. Compared with previous works which require a substantial amount of prior knowledge such as similarity matrices of intra-modal data and ranking examples, our method requires little prior knowledge. Given a large training dataset, we split it into mini-batches and continually adjust the mapping functions for each batch of input. Hence, our method is memory efficient with respect to the data volume. Experiments on three real datasets illustrate that our proposed method achieves significant improvement in search accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.","author":["Wei Wang","Beng Chin Ooi","Xiaoyan Yang","Dongxiang Zhang","Yueting Zhuang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 8","April 2014","pp   649\u2013660","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732296.2732301"],"date":"01 April 2014","ref":[{"text":"M.

However, to make deep learning practical for a wide range of applications in Tencent Inc., three requirements must be considered: 1) Lots of computational power are required to train a practical model with tens of millions of parameters and billions of samples for products such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), and the number of parameters and training data is still growing. 2) The capability of training larger model is necessary for better model quality. 3) Easy to use frameworks are valuable to do many experiments to perform model selection, such as finding an appropriate optimization algorithm and tuning optimal hyper-parameters. To accelerate training, support large models, and make experiments easier, we built Mariana, the Tencent deep learning platform, which utilizes GPU and CPU cluster to train models parallelly with three frameworks: 1) a multi-GPU data parallelism framework for deep neural networks (DNNs). 2) a multi-GPU model parallelism and data parallelism framework for deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 3) a CPU cluster framework for large scale DNNs. Mariana also provides built-in algorithms and features to facilitate experiments. Mariana is in production usage for more than one year, achieves state-of-the-art acceleration performance, and plays a key role in training models and improving quality for automatic speech recognition and image recognition in Tencent WeChat, a mobile social platform, and for Ad click-through rate prediction (pCTR) in Tencent QQ, an instant messaging platform, and Tencent Qzone, a social networking service.","author":["Yongqiang Zou","Xing Jin","Yi Li","Zhimao Guo","Eryu Wang","Bin Xiao"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 13","August 2014","pp   1772\u20131777","https://doi.org/10.14778/2733004.2733082"],"date":"01 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"Hinton, G.

Apache SystemML addresses these challenges through declarative ML by (1) increasing the productivity of data scientists as they are able to express custom algorithms in a familiar domain-specific language covering linear algebra primitives and statistical functions, and (2) transparently running these ML algorithms on distributed, data-parallel frameworks by applying cost-based compilation techniques to generate efficient, low-level execution plans with in-memory single-node and large-scale distributed operations. This paper describes SystemML on Apache Spark, end to end, including insights into various optimizer and runtime techniques as well as performance characteristics. We also share lessons learned from porting SystemML to Spark and declarative ML in general.

However, node similarity between nodes in different graphs (inter-graph nodes) has not received enough attention yet. The inter-graph node similarity is important in learning a new graph based on the knowledge extracted from an existing graph (transfer learning on graphs) and has applications in biological, communication, and social networks. In this paper, we propose a novel distance function for measuring inter-graph <u>n</u>ode similarity with <u>e</u>dit <u>d</u>istance, called NED. In NED, two nodes are compared according to their local neighborhood topologies which are represented as unordered k-adjacent trees, without relying on any extra information. Due to the hardness of computing tree edit distance on unordered trees which is NP-Complete, we propose a modified tree edit distance, called TED*, for comparing unordered and unlabeled k-adjacent trees. TED* is a metric distance, as the original tree edit distance, but more importantly, TED* is polynomially computable. As a metric distance, NED admits efficient indexing, provides interpretable results, and shows to perform better than existing approaches on a number of data analysis tasks, including graph deanonymization. Finally, the efficiency and effectiveness of NED are empirically demonstrated using real-world graphs.","author":["Haohan Zhu","Xianrui Meng","George Kollios"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 6","February 2017","pp   697\u2013708","https://doi.org/10.14778/3055330.3055336"],"date":"01 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"L.

While there is a lot of work on scalable and fast ML systems, little work has addressed the pains of sourcing data for ML tasks. Real-world relational databases typically have many tables (often, dozens) and data scientists often struggle to even obtain all tables for joins before ML. In this context, Kumar et al. showed recently that key-foreign key dependencies (KFKDs) between tables often lets us avoid such joins without significantly affecting prediction accuracy-an idea they called \"avoiding joins safely.\" While initially controversial, this idea has since been used by multiple companies to reduce the burden of data sourcing for ML. But their work applied only to linear classifiers. In this work, we verify if their results hold for three popular high-capacity classifiers: decision trees, non-linear SVMs, and ANNs. We conduct an extensive experimental study using both real-world datasets and simulations to analyze the effects of avoiding KFK joins on such models. Our results show that these high-capacity classifiers are surprisingly and counter-intuitively more robust to avoiding KFK joins compared to linear classifiers, refuting an intuition from the prior work's analysis. We explain this behavior intuitively and identify open questions at the intersection of data management and ML theoretical research.

Thus far, a large number of access methods have been proposed to accelerate the similarity query processing. Nonetheless, these methods mostly focus on developing standalone systems by proposing new indices. Given the fact that existing RDBMS merely support traditional indices, it is of great necessity and practical importance to develop a standard RDBMS built-in index based approach to speeding up the query processing. In this demonstration, we introduce MSQL+, a plugin toolkit that enable users to answer similarity queries in metric spaces simply using standard SQL statements. This toolkit can help existing RDBMS to effectively and efficiently handle with big data due to the following three advantages. First, MSQL+ enables users to find similar objects by submitting SELECT-FROM-WHERE statements so that it can be easily integrated into existing RDBMS. Second, MSQL+ works in a more general data space. Objects of any type can be indexed by B+-trees and the query processing can be boosted by using index seeks, as long as the similarity function is metric. Third, MSQL+ supports the parallelization of both pre-processing and query processing in distributed RDBMS.","author":["Wei Lu","Xinyi Zhang","Zhiyu Shui","Zhe Peng","Xiao Zhang","Xiaoyong Du","Hao Huang","Xiaoyu Wang","Anqun Pan","Haixiang Li"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 12","August 2018","pp   1970\u20131973","https://doi.org/10.14778/3229863.3236237"],"date":"01 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"R.

It is a key technology of Information Extraction and Open-Domain Question Answering. First, we show that an NE recognizer based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) gives better scores than conventional systems. However, off-the-shelf SVM classifiers are too inefficient for this task. Therefore, we present a method that makes the system substantially faster. This approach can also be applied to other similar tasks such as chunking and part-of-speech tagging. We also present an SVM-based feature selection method and an efficient training method.","author":["Hideki Isozaki","Hideto Kazawa"],"issue":["COLING '02: Proceedings of the 19th international conference on Computational linguistics - Volume 1","August 2002","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.3115/1072228.1072282"],"date":"24 August 2002","ref":[{"text":"James Allen. 1995.

We have found that our standard approach---using a narrow beam width in a Viterbi search for simple discrete-density hidden Markov models (HMMs)---works in real time with only very low accuracy. Our most accurate algorithms recognize speech many times slower than real time. Our (yet unattained) goal is to recognize speech in real time at or near full accuracy.We describe the speed/accuracy trade-offs associated with several techniques used in a one-pass speech recognition framework:\u2022 Trade-offs associated with reducing the acoustic modeling resolution of the HMMs (e.g., output-distribution type, number of parameters, cross-word modeling)\u2022 Trade-offs associated with using lexicon trees, and techniques for implementing full and partial bigram grammars with those trees\u2022 Computation of Gaussian probabilities are the most time-consuming aspect of our highest accuracy system, and techniques allowing us to reduce the number of Gaussian probabilities computed with little or no impact on speech recognition accuracy.Our results show that tree-based modeling techniques used with appropriate acoustic modeling approaches achieve real-time performance on current UNIX workstations at about a 30% error rate for the WSJ task. The results also show that we can dramatically reduce the computational complexity of our more accurate but slower modeling alternatives so that they are near the speed necessary for real-time performance in a multipass search. Our near-future goal is to combine these two technologies so that real-time, high-accuracy large-vocabulary speech recognition can be achieved.","author":["Hy Murveit","Peter Monaco","Vassilios Digalakis","John Butzberger"],"issue":["HLT '94: Proceedings of the workshop on Human Language Technology","March 1994","Pages   393\u2013398","https://doi.org/10.3115/1075812.1075903"],"date":"08 March 1994","ref":[{"text":"F.

Since GATE comes with a customisable and extendable set of components, it allows students to get hands-on experience with building NLP applications. GATE also has tools for corpus annotation and performance evaluation, so students can go through the entire application development process within its graphical development environment. Finally, it offers comprehensive Unicode-compliant multilingual support, thus allowing students to create components for languages other than English. Unlike other NLP teaching tools which were designed specifically and only for this purpose, GATE is a system developed for and used actively in language engineering research. This unique duality allows students to contribute to research projects and gain skills in embedding HLT in practical applications.","author":["Kalina Bontcheva","Hamish Cunningham","Valentin Tablan","Diana Maynard","Oana Hamza"],"issue":["ETMTNLP '02: Proceedings of the ACL-02 Workshop on Effective tools and methodologies for teaching natural language processing and computational linguistics - Volume 1","July 2002","Pages   54\u201362","https://doi.org/10.3115/1118108.1118116"],"date":"07 July 2002","ref":[{"text":"D.

Disambiguation methods fall into different categories, e.g., rule-based, statistical-based and example-based approaches, each of which may involve a variety of machine learning techniques. In this paper we report our current progress within the example-based approach, including its framework, example representation and collection, example matching and application. Experimental results show that this effective approach resolves more than 90% of ambiguities found. Hence, if it is integrated effectively with a segmentation method of the precision P > 95%, the resulting segmentation accuracy can reach, theoretically, beyond 99.5%.","author":["Chunyu Kit","Haihua Pan","Hongbiao Chen"],"issue":["SIGHAN '02: Proceedings of the first SIGHAN workshop on Chinese language processing - Volume 18","September 2002","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.3115/1118824.1118832"],"date":"01 September 2002","ref":[{"text":"M.

We discuss the system approach, design methodology, and implementation details, which incorporate insights from psychology research on intrinsic motivation, and we present five clear design principles for SAR-based therapeutic interventions. We then describe the system evaluation, consisting of a multi-session user study with older adults (n = 33), to evaluate the effectiveness of our SAR exercise system and to investigate the role of embodiment by comparing user evaluations of similar physically and virtually embodied coaches. The results validate the system approach and effectiveness at motivating physical exercise in older adults according to a variety of user performance and outcomes measures. The results also show a clear preference by older adults for the physically embodied robot coach over the virtual coach in terms of enjoyableness, helpfulness, and social attraction, among other factors.","author":["Juan Fasola","Maja J Matari\u0107"],"issue":["Journal of Human-Robot Interaction","Volume 2","Issue 2","June 2013","pp   3\u201332","https://doi.org/10.5898/JHRI.2.2.Fasola"],"date":"18 June 2013","ref":[{"text":"American Association of Colleges of Nursing.
