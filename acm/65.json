We describe a prototype stereo display comprising two independent fixed-viewpoint volumetric displays. Like autostereoscopic volumetric displays, fixed-viewpoint volumetric displays generate near-correct focus cues without tracking eye position, because light comes from sources at the correct focal distances. (In our prototype, from three image planes at different physical distances.) Unlike autostereoscopic volumetric displays, however, fixed-viewpoint volumetric displays retain the qualities of modern projective graphics: view-dependent lighting effects such as occlusion, specularity, and reflection are correctly depicted; modern graphics processor and 2-D display technology can be utilized; and realistic fields of view and depths of field can be implemented. While not a practical solution for general-purpose viewing, our prototype display is a proof of concept and a platform for ongoing vision research. The design, implementation, and verification of this stereo display are described, including a novel technique of filtering along visual lines using 1-D texture mapping.","author":["Kurt Akeley","Simon J.

A sensor typically runs on a battery having a limited lifetime. In order to increase the lifetime of a sensor it is important that the mechanisms used in monitoring them be energy-efficient. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm called Prediction-based monitoring for energy-efficient monitoring. We show that the paradigm can be visualized as a watching of a \"sensor movie\" and that concepts from MPEG may be applied to it. We have implemented the proposed algorithms in a test bed of Rene Motes [2]. Experimental results show that the proposed solutions cut down the energy consumption by more than 5 times, considerably increasing sensor lifetimes, and thereby, the lifetime of the networks formed from these sensors.","author":["Samir Goel","Tomasz Imielinski"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 31","Issue 5","October 2001","pp   82\u201398","https://doi.org/10.1145/1037107.1037117"],"date":"01 October 2001","ref":[{"text":"Forest of sensors project. http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/vsam/.]]","order":1},{"text":"TinyOS: An operating system for networked sensors. http://tinyos.millennium.berkeley.edu/.]]","order":2},{"text":"Tools for programming rene motes. http://tinyos.millennium.berkeley.edu/release/toslatest.tar.gz.]]","order":3},{"text":"L.

Consequently, the completely annotated forms are almost never used in practice, since partially annotated forms can be defined which still allow syntax directed type checking. An additional optimization that is used in some proof and type systems is to take advantage of the context of occurrence of terms to further elide type information using bidirectional type checking rules. While this technique is generally effective, we show that there exist bidirectional terms which exhibit asymptotic increases in the size of their type decorations when sequentialized into a named-form calculus (a common first step in compilation). In this paper, we introduce a refinement of the bidirectional type system based on strict logic which allows additional type decorations to be eliminated, and show that it is well-behaved under sequentialization.","author":["Adam Chlipala","Leaf Petersen","Robert Harper"],"issue":["TLDI '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGPLAN international workshop on Types in languages design and implementation","January 2005","Pages   71\u201378","https://doi.org/10.1145/1040294.1040301"],"date":"10 January 2005","ref":[{"text":"Cormac Flanagan, Amr Sabry, Bruce F.

Since it is expected that the number of relationships between entities in a knowledge base will be much larger than the number of entities themselves, the likelihood that Semantic Association searches would result in an overwhelming number of results for users is increased, therefore elevating the need for appropriate ranking schemes. Furthermore, it is unlikely that ranking schemes for ranking entities (documents, resources, etc.) may be applied to complex structures such as Semantic Associations.In this paper, we present an approach that ranks results based on how predictable a result might be for users. It is based on a relevance model SemRank, which is a rich blend of semantic and information-theoretic techniques with heuristics that supports the novel idea of modulative searches, where users may vary their search modes to effect changes in the ordering of results depending on their need. We also present the infrastructure used in the SSARK system to support the computation of SemRank values for resulting Semantic Associations and their ordering.","author":["Kemafor Anyanwu","Angela Maduko","Amit Sheth"],"issue":["WWW '05: Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web","May 2005","Pages   117\u2013127","https://doi.org/10.1145/1060745.1060766"],"date":"10 May 2005","ref":[{"text":"Aleman-Meza, B., Halaschek, C., Arpinar, I., and Sheth, A.

To reduce the head positioning latencies, we propose a novel technique that dynamically places copies of data in file system's free blocks according to the disk access patterns observed at runtime. As one or more replicas can now be accessed in addition to their original data block, choosing the \"nearest\" replica that provides fastest access can significantly improve performance for disk I/O operations.We implemented and evaluated a prototype based on the popular Ext2 file system. In our prototype, since the file system layout is modified only by using the free/unused disk space (hence the name Free Space File System, or FS2), users are completely oblivious to how the file system layout is modified in the background; they will only notice performance improvements over time. For a wide range of workloads running under Linux, FS2 is shown to reduce disk access time by 41--68% (as a result of a 37--78% shorter seek time and a 31--68% shorter rotational delay) making a 16--34% overall user-perceived performance improvement. The reduced disk access time also leads to a 40--71% energy savings per access.","author":["Hai Huang","Wanda Hung","Kang G.

However, due to process variation, a higher source voltage can significantly increase data flipping in standby mode (Hold Failures) resulting in faulty memories. This imposes serious concerns in reducing standby power with source-bias. In this paper, we analyze the effect of source bias on hold failures under both inter-die and intra-die variations. We propose a self-calibrating SRAM for aggressively reducing leakage while maintaining the hold failures under control.","author":["Swaroop Ghosh","Saibal Mukhopadhyay","Keejong Kim","Kaushik Roy"],"issue":["DAC '06: Proceedings of the 43rd annual Design Automation Conference","July 2006","Pages   971\u2013976","https://doi.org/10.1145/1146909.1147155"],"date":"24 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"K.

Chip Multi-Processors (CMP) are an attractive choice for future billion transistor architectures due to their low design complexity, high clock frequency, and high throughput. In a typical CMP architecture, the L2 cache is shared by multiple cores and data coherence is maintained among private L1s. Coherence operations entail frequent communication over global on-chip wires. In future technologies, communication between different L1s will have a significant impact on overall processor performance and power consumption. On-chip wires can be designed to have different latency, bandwidth, and energy properties. Likewise, coherence protocol messages have different latency and bandwidth needs. We propose an interconnect composed of wires with varying latency, bandwidth, and energy characteristics, and advocate intelligently mapping coherence operations to the appropriate wires. In this paper, we present a comprehensive list of techniques that allow coherence protocols to exploit a heterogeneous interconnect and evaluate a subset of these techniques to show their performance and power-efficiency potential. Most of the proposed techniques can be implemented with a minimum complexity overhead.","author":["Liqun Cheng","Naveen Muralimanohar","Karthik Ramani","Rajeev Balasubramonian","John B.

To classify these queries into certain target categories is a difficult but important problem. In this article, we present a new technique called query enrichment, which takes a short query and maps it to intermediate objects. Based on the collected intermediate objects, the query is then mapped to target categories. To build the necessary mapping functions, we use an ensemble of search engines to produce an enrichment of the queries. Our technique was applied to the ACM Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining competition (ACM KDDCUP) in 2005, where we won the championship on all three evaluation metrics (precision, F1 measure, which combines precision and recall, and creativity, which is judged by the organizers) among a total of 33 teams worldwide. In this article, we show that, despite the difficulty of an abundance of ambiguous queries and lack of training data, our query-enrichment technique can solve the problem satisfactorily through a two-phase classification framework. We present a detailed description of our algorithm and experimental evaluation. Our best result for F1 and precision is 42.4% and 44.4%, respectively, which is 9.6% and 24.3% higher than those from the runner-ups, respectively.","author":["Dou Shen","Rong Pan","Jian-Tao Sun","Jeffrey Junfeng Pan","Kangheng Wu","Jie Yin","Qiang Yang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 24","Issue 3","July 2006","pp   320\u2013352","https://doi.org/10.1145/1165774.1165776"],"date":"01 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"Alpaydin, E. 2004.

Bioassays are mapped to microfluidic arrays using synthesis tools, and they are executed through the manipulation of sample and reagent droplets by electrical means. Most prior work on CAD for biochips has assumed independent control of electrodes using a large number of (electrical) input pins. Such solutions are not feasible for low-cost disposable biochips that are envisaged for many field applications. A more promising design strategy is to divide the microfluidic array into smaller partitions and use a small number of electrodes to control the electrodes in each partition. We propose a partitioning algorithm based on the concept of \"droplet trace\", which is extracted from the scheduling and droplet routing results produced by a synthesis tool. An efficient pin assignment method, referred to as the \"Connect-5 algorithm\", is combined with the array partitioning technique based on droplet traces. The array partitioning and pin assignment methods are evaluated using a set of multiplexed bioassays.","author":["Tao Xu","Krishnendu Chakrabarty"],"issue":["CODES+ISSS '06: Proceedings of the 4th international conference on Hardware/software codesign and system synthesis","October 2006","Pages   112\u2013117","https://doi.org/10.1145/1176254.1176283"],"date":"22 October 2006","ref":[{"text":"E.

A Dryad application combines computational \"vertices\" with communication \"channels\" to form a dataflow graph. Dryad runs the application by executing the vertices of this graph on a set of available computers, communicating as appropriate through flies, TCP pipes, and shared-memory FIFOs. The vertices provided by the application developer are quite simple and are usually written as sequential programs with no thread creation or locking. Concurrency arises from Dryad scheduling vertices to run simultaneously on multiple computers, or on multiple CPU cores within a computer. The application can discover the size and placement of data at run time, and modify the graph as the computation progresses to make efficient use of the available resources. Dryad is designed to scale from powerful multi-core single computers, through small clusters of computers, to data centers with thousands of computers. The Dryad execution engine handles all the difficult problems of creating a large distributed, concurrent application: scheduling the use of computers and their CPUs, recovering from communication or computer failures, and transporting data between vertices.","author":["Michael Isard","Mihai Budiu","Yuan Yu","Andrew Birrell","Dennis Fetterly"],"issue":["EuroSys '07: Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGOPS/EuroSys European Conference on Computer Systems 2007","March 2007","Pages   59\u201372","https://doi.org/10.1145/1272996.1273005"],"date":"21 March 2007","ref":[{"text":"Global grid forum. http://www.gridforum.org/.","order":1},{"text":"Intel IXP2XXX product line of network processors. http://www.intel.com/design/network/products/npfamily/ixp2xxx.htm.","order":2},{"text":"Intel platform 2015. http://www.Intel.com/technology/architecture/platform2015/.","order":3},{"text":"The LINQ project. http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/future/linq/.","order":4},{"text":"Open MPI. http://www.open-mpi.org/.","order":5},{"text":"SQL Server Integration Services. http://www.microsoft.com/sq1/technologies/integration/default.mspx.","order":6},{"text":"Thomas E.

Intra-array memory reuse is a way of reducing the size of a temporary array by folding, thanks to affine mappings and modulo operations, reusing memory locations when they contain a value not used later. We describe the algorithms needed to implement such a strategy. Our implementation has two parts. The first part, Bee, uses the source-to-source transformer ROSE to extract from the program all necessary information on the lifetime of array elements and to generate the code after memory reduction. The second part, [email\u00a0protected], is a stand-alone mathematical tool dedicated to optimizations on polyhedra, in particular the computation of successive minima and the computation of good admissible lattices, which are the basis for lattice-based memory reuse. Both tools are developed in C++ and use linear programming and polyhedra manipulations. They can be used either for embedded program optimizations, e.g., to limit memory expansion introduced for parallelization, or in high-level synthesis, e.g., to design memories between communicating hardware accelerators.","author":["Christophe Alias","Fabrice Baray","Alain Darte"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 42","Issue 7","July 2007","pp   73\u201382","https://doi.org/10.1145/1273444.1254778"],"date":"13 June 2007","ref":[{"text":"F.

Our surface representation can be expressed by either a projection procedure or in implicit form. The central advantages of our approach compared to existing planar MLS include significantly improved stability of the projection under low sampling rates and in the presence of high curvature. The method can approximate or interpolate the input point set and naturally handles planar point clouds. In addition, our approach provides a reliable estimate of the mean curvature of the surface at no additional cost and allows for the robust handling of sharp features and boundaries. It processes a simple point set as input, but can also take significant advantage of surface normals to improve robustness, quality and performance. We also present an novel normal estimation procedure which exploits the properties of the spherical fit for both direction estimation and orientation propagation. Very efficient computational procedures enable us to compute the algebraic sphere fitting with up to 40 million points per second on latest generation GPUs.","author":["Ga\u00ebl Guennebaud","Markus Gross"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 26","Issue 3","July 2007","pp   23\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.1145/1276377.1276406"],"date":"29 July 2007","ref":[{"text":"Adams, B., and Dutr\u00e9, P. 2003.

Usually, the user-item matrix is quite sparse, which directly leads to inaccurate recommendations. This paper focuses the memory-based collaborative filtering problems on two crucial factors: (1) similarity computation between users or items and (2) missing data prediction algorithms. First, we use the enhanced Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) algorithm by adding one parameter which overcomes the potential decrease of accuracy when computing the similarity of users or items. Second, we propose an effective missing data prediction algorithm, in which information of both users and items is taken into account. In this algorithm, we set the similarity threshold for users and items respectively, and the prediction algorithm will determine whether predicting the missing data or not. We also address how to predict the missing data by employing a combination of user and item information. Finally, empirical studies on dataset MovieLens have shown that our newly proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms and it is more robust against data sparsity.","author":["Hao Ma","Irwin King","Michael R.

We explore the possibilities of reducing the body-doping of FD/SOI devices with proper tuning of back-gate bias or gate workfunction to achieve a given leakage target. The reduction of body-doping density helps reduce the effect of the random dopant fluctuation (RDF), while the Vt and leakage are controlled using the back-gate bias.

As biochips are adopted for the complex procedures in molecular biology, its complexity is expected to increase due to the need of multiple and concurrent assays on a chip.

To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first work that adopts a topological representation to solve the placement problem of digital microfluidic biochips. We also consider the defect tolerant issue to avoid to use defective cells due to fabrication.

This technique simply terminates each parallel phaseas soon as there are too few remaining tasks to keep all of the processors busy.Although this technique completely eliminates the idling that would other wise occur at barrier synchronization points, it may also change the computation and therefore the result that the computation produces. We address this issue by providing probabilistic distortion models that characterize how the use of early phase termination distorts the result that the computation produces. Our experimental results show that for our set of benchmark applications, 1) early phase termination can improve the performance of the parallel computation, 2) the distortion is small (or can be made to be small with the use of an appropriate compensation technique) and 3) the distortion models provide accurate and tight distortion bounds. These bounds can enable users to evaluate the effect of early phase termination and confidently accept results from parallel computations that use this technique if they find the distortion bounds to be acceptable.Finally, we identify a general computational pattern that works well with early phase termination and explain why computations that exhibit this pattern can tolerate the early termination of parallel tasks without producing unacceptable results.","author":["Martin C.

As high-throughput bioassays are mapped to digital microfluidic platforms, the need for design automation techniques is being increasingly felt. Moreover, as most applications of biochips are safety-critical in nature, defect tolerance is an essential system attribute. Several synthesis tools have recently been proposed for the automated design of biochips from the specifications of laboratory protocols. However, only a few of these tools address the problem of defect tolerance. In addition, most of these methods do not consider the problem of droplet routing in microfluidic arrays. These methods typically rely on postsynthesis droplet routing to implement biochemical protocols. Such an approach is not only time consuming, but also imposes an undue burden on the chip user. Postsynthesis droplet routing does not guarantee that feasible droplet pathways can be found for area-constrained biochip layouts; nonroutable fabricated biochips must be discarded. We present a synthesis tool that integrates defect tolerance and droplet routing in the design flow. Droplet routability, defined as the ease with which droplet pathways can be determined, is estimated and integrated in the synthesis procedure. Presynthesis and postsynthesis defect-tolerance methods are also presented. We use a large-scale protein assay as a case study to evaluate the proposed synthesis method.","author":["Tao Xu","Krishnendu Chakrabarty"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 4","Issue 3","August 2008","Article No.: 11","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/1389089.1389091"],"date":"29 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"Bohringer, K.

The previous bound on the space complexity of undirected st-connectivity was log4/3(\u22c5) obtained by Armoni, Ta-Shma, Wigderson and Zhou (JACM 2000). As undirected st-connectivity is complete for the class of problems solvable by symmetric, nondeterministic, log-space computations (the class SL), this algorithm implies that SL = L (where L is the class of problems solvable by deterministic log-space computations). Independent of our work (and using different techniques), Trifonov (STOC 2005) has presented an O(log n log log n)-space, deterministic algorithm for undirected st-connectivity.Our algorithm also implies a way to construct in log-space a fixed sequence of directions that guides a deterministic walk through all of the vertices of any connected graph. Specifically, we give log-space constructible universal-traversal sequences for graphs with restricted labeling and log-space constructible universal-exploration sequences for general graphs.","author":["Omer Reingold"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 55","Issue 4","September 2008","Article No.: 17","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/1391289.1391291"],"date":"18 September 2008","ref":[{"text":"Ajtai, M., Koml\u00f3s, J., and Szemer\u00e9di, E. 1987.

Customizing the storage structures is becoming increasingly important in mitigating the continuing gap between memory latencies and internal computing speeds. In this article we describe and evaluate a compiler algorithm that maps the arrays of a loop-based computation to internal storage structures, either RAM blocks or discrete registers. Our objective is to minimize the overall execution time while considering the capacity and bandwidth constraints of the storage resources. The novelty of our approach lies in creating a single framework that combines high-level compiler techniques with lower-level scheduling information for mapping the data. We illustrate the benefits of our approach for a set of image/signal processing kernels using a Xilinx Virtex\u2122 Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Our algorithm leads to faster designs compared to the state-of-the-art custom data layout mapping technique, in some instances using less storage. When compared to hand-coded designs, our results are comparable in terms of execution time and resources, but are derived in a minute fraction of the design time.","author":["Nastaran Baradaran","Pedro C.

As useful as LMSs are, they are short on features that meet certain needs specific to computer science education. On the other hand, computer science educators have developed--and continue to develop-computer-based software tools that aid in management, teaching, and/or learning in computer science courses. In this report we provide an overview of current CS specific on-line learning resources and guidance on how one might best go about extending an LMS to include such tools and resources. We refer to an LMS that is extended specifically for computer science education as a Computing Augmented Learning Management System, or CALMS. We also discuss sound pedagogical practices and some practical and technical principles for building a CALMS. However, we do not go into details of creating a plug-in for some specific LMS. Further, the report does not favor one LMS over another as the foundation for a CALMS.","author":["Guido R\u00f6\u00dfling","Mike Joy","Andr\u00e9s Moreno","Atanas Radenski","Lauri Malmi","Andreas Kerren","Thomas Naps","Rockford J.

Game-based techniques provide a popular approach in which proofs are structured as sequences of games and in which proof steps establish the validity of transitions between successive games. Code-based techniques form an instance of this approach that takes a code-centric view of games, and that relies on programming language theory to justify proof steps. While code-based techniques contribute to formalize the security statements precisely and to carry out proofs systematically, typical proofs are so long and involved that formal verification is necessary to achieve a high degree of confidence. We present Certicrypt, a framework that enables the machine-checked construction and verification of code-based proofs. Certicrypt is built upon the general-purpose proof assistant Coq, and draws on many areas, including probability, complexity, algebra, and semantics of programming languages. Certicrypt provides certified tools to reason about the equivalence of probabilistic programs, including a relational Hoare logic, a theory of observational equivalence, verified program transformations, and game-based techniques such as reasoning about failure events. The usefulness of Certicrypt is demonstrated through various examples, including a proof of semantic security of OAEP (with a bound that improves upon existing published results), and a proof of existential unforgeability of FDH signatures. Our work provides a first yet significant step towards Halevi's ambitious programme of providing tool support for cryptographic proofs.","author":["Gilles Barthe","Benjamin Gr\u00e9goire","Santiago Zanella B\u00e9guelin"],"issue":["POPL '09: Proceedings of the 36th annual ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT symposium on Principles of programming languages","January 2009","Pages   90\u2013101","https://doi.org/10.1145/1480881.1480894"],"date":"21 January 2009","ref":[{"text":"M.

These graphics cores accelerate the z-buffer algorithm and provide a highly interactive experience at a relatively low cost. However, many applications in entertainment, science, and industry require high quality lighting effects such as accurate shadows, reflection, and refraction. These effects can be difficult to achieve with z-buffer algorithms but are straightforward to implement using ray tracing. Although ray tracing is computationally more complex, the algorithm exhibits excellent scaling and parallelism properties. Nevertheless, ray tracing memory access patterns are difficult to predict and the parallelism speedup promise is therefore hard to achieve.This paper highlights a novel approach to ray tracing based on stream filtering and presents StreamRay, a multicore wide SIMD microarchitecture that delivers interactive frame rates of 15-32 frames/second for scenes of high geometric complexity and exhibits high utilization for SIMD widths ranging from eight to 16 elements. StreamRay consists of two main components: the ray engine, which is responsible for stream assembly and employs address generation units that generate addresses to form large SIMD vectors, and the filter engine, which implements the ray tracing operations with programmable accelerators. Results demonstrate that separating address and data processing reduces data movement and resource contention. Performance improves by 56% while simultaneously providing 11.63% power savings per accelerator core compared to a design which does not use separate resources for address and data computations.","author":["Karthik Ramani","Christiaan P.

Topology is preserved if a connectivity algorithm, such as k-nearest neighbors, can easily recover the edges of the input graph from only the coordinates of the nodes after embedding. SPE is formulated as a semidefinite program that learns a low-rank kernel matrix constrained by a set of linear inequalities which captures the connectivity structure of the input graph. Traditional graph embedding algorithms do not preserve structure according to our definition, and thus the resulting visualizations can be misleading or less informative. SPE provides significant improvements in terms of visualization and lossless compression of graphs, outperforming popular methods such as spectral embedding and Laplacian eigen-maps. We find that many classical graphs and networks can be properly embedded using only a few dimensions. Furthermore, introducing structure preserving constraints into dimensionality reduction algorithms produces more accurate representations of high-dimensional data.","author":["Blake Shaw","Tony Jebara"],"issue":["ICML '09: Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Machine Learning","June 2009","Pages   937\u2013944","https://doi.org/10.1145/1553374.1553494"],"date":"14 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"Adamic, L.

This paper presents a study of NAND Flash SSD architectures and their management techniques, quantifying SSD performance under user-driven/PC applications in a multi-tasked environment; user activity represents typical PC workloads and includes browsing files and folders, emailing, text editing and document creation, surfing the web, listening to music and playing movies, editing large pictures, and running office applications. We find the following: (a) the real limitation to NAND Flash memory performance is not its low per-device bandwidth but its internal core interface; (b) NAND Flash memory media transfer rates do not need to scale up to those of HDDs for good performance; (c) SSD organizations that exploit concurrency at both the system and device level (e.g. RAID-like organizations and Micron-style (superblocks) improve performance significantly; and (d) these system- and device-level concurrency mechanisms are, to a significant degree, orthogonal: that is, the performance increase due to one does not come at the expense of the other, as each exploits a different facet of concurrency exhibited within the PC workload.","author":["Cagdas Dirik","Bruce Jacob"],"issue":["ISCA '09: Proceedings of the 36th annual international symposium on Computer architecture","June 2009","Pages   279\u2013289","https://doi.org/10.1145/1555754.1555790"],"date":"20 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"Agrawal, N., Prabhakaran, V., Wobber, T., Davis, J.

Current DRAM-based main memory systems are starting to hit the power and cost limit. An alternative memory technology that uses resistance contrast in phase-change materials is being actively investigated in the circuits community. Phase Change Memory (PCM) devices offer more density relative to DRAM, and can help increase main memory capacity of future systems while remaining within the cost and power constraints.In this paper, we analyze a PCM-based hybrid main memory system using an architecture level model of PCM.We explore the trade-offs for a main memory system consisting of PCMstorage coupled with a small DRAM buffer. Such an architecture has the latency benefits of DRAM and the capacity benefits of PCM. Our evaluations for a baseline system of 16-cores with 8GB DRAM show that, on average, PCM can reduce page faults by 5X and provide a speedup of 3X. As PCM is projected to have limited write endurance, we also propose simple organizational and management solutions of the hybrid memory that reduces the write traffic to PCM, boosting its lifetime from 3 years to 9.7 years.","author":["Moinuddin K.

Recent gains in energy efficiency of new-generation NAND flash storage have strengthened the case for in-network storage by data-centric sensor network applications. We argue that current storage solutions offering a simple file system abstraction are inadequate for sensor applications to exploit storage. Instead, we propose Capsule\u2014a rich, flexible and portable object storage abstraction that offers stream, file, array, queue and index storage objects for data storage and retrieval. Further, Capsule supports checkpointing and rollback of object state for fault tolerance. Our experiments demonstrate that Capsule provides platform independence, greater functionality and greater energy efficiency than existing storage solutions.","author":["Gaurav Mathur","Peter Desnoyers","Paul Chukiu","Deepak Ganesan","Prashant Shenoy"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks","Volume 5","Issue 4","November 2009","Article No.: 33","pp   1\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/1614379.1614385"],"date":"27 November 2009","ref":[{"text":"Agilent.

Inspired by techniques in empirical data analysis and morphological image analysis, we use the local extrema of the input image to extract information about oscillations: We define detail as oscillations between local minima and maxima. Building on the key observation that the spatial scale of oscillations are characterized by the density of local extrema, we develop an algorithm for decomposing images into multiple scales of superposed oscillations.Current edge-preserving image decompositions assume image detail to be low contrast variation. Consequently they apply filters that extract features with increasing contrast as successive layers of detail. As a result, they are unable to distinguish between high-contrast, fine-scale features and edges of similar contrast that are to be preserved. We compare our results with existing edge-preserving image decomposition algorithms and demonstrate exciting applications that are made possible by our new notion of detail.","author":["Kartic Subr","Cyril Soler","Fr\u00e9do Durand"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 28","Issue 5","December 2009","pp   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/1618452.1618493"],"date":"01 December 2009","ref":[{"text":"Bae, S., Paris, S., and Durand, F. 2006.

The key innovation in our proposed work is a hybrid memory array, which is mixture of conventional 6T and 8T SRAM bit-cells. The fundamental premise of our approach lies in the fact that human visual system (HVS) is mostly sensitive to higher order bits of luminance pixels in video data. We implemented a preferential storage policy in which the higher order luma bits are stored in robust 8T bit-cells while the lower order bits are stored in conventional 6T bit-cells. This facilitates aggressive scaling of supply voltage in memory as the important luma bits, stored in 8T bit-cells, remain relatively unaffected by voltage scaling. The not-so-important lower order luma bits, stored in 6T bit-cells, if affected, contribute insignificantly to the overall degradation in output video quality. Simulation results show average power savings of up to 56%, in the hybrid memory array compared to the conventional 6T SRAM array implemented in 65nm CMOS. The area overhead and maximum output quality degradation (PSNR) incurred were 11.5% and 0.56 dB, respectively.","author":["Ik Joon Chang","Debabrata Mohapatra","Kaushik Roy"],"issue":["DAC '09: Proceedings of the 46th Annual Design Automation Conference","July 2009","Pages   670\u2013675","https://doi.org/10.1145/1629911.1630087"],"date":"26 July 2009","ref":[{"text":"http://www.mpeg4.org","order":1},{"text":"P.

However, the electric field density and power demand grow if Vcc is not scaled. Therefore, Vcc must be scaled in pace with new technology nodes to prevent excessive degradation and keep power demand within reasonable limits. Unfortunately, low Vcc operation exacerbates the effect of variations and decreases noise and stability margins, increasing the likelihood of errors in SRAM memories such as caches. Those errors translate into performance loss and performance variation across different cores, which is especially undesirable in a multi-core processor. This paper presents (i) a novel scheme to tolerate high faulty bit rates in caches by disabling only faulty subblocks, (ii) a dynamic address remapping scheme to reduce performance variation across different cores, which is key for performance predictability, and (iii) a comparison with state-of-the-art techniques for faulty bit tolerance in caches. Results for some typical first level data cache configurations show 15% average performance increase and standard deviation reduction from 3.13% down to 0.55% when compared to cache line disabling schemes.","author":["Jaume Abella","Javier Carretero","Pedro Chaparro","Xavier Vera","Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez"],"issue":["MICRO 42: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2009","Pages   111\u2013121","https://doi.org/10.1145/1669112.1669128"],"date":"12 December 2009","ref":[{"text":"J.

Unlike earlier generations of laptop computers, the new generation of mobile computers can be an integrated part of a distributed computing environment, one in which users change physical location frequently. The result is a new computing paradigm, nomadic computing. This paradigm will affect the design of much of our current systems software, including that of database systems.\nThis paper discusses in some detail the impact of nomadic computing on a number of traditional database system concepts. In particular, we point out how the reliance on short-lived batteries changes the cost assumptions underlying query processing. In these systems, power consumption competes with resource utilization in the definition of cost metrics. We also discuss how the likelihood of temporary disconnection forces consideration of alternative transaction processing protocols. The limited screen space of mobile computers along with the advent of pen-based computing provides new opportunities and new constraints on database interfaces and languages. Lastly, we believe that the movement of computers and data among networks potentially belonging to distinct, autonomous organizations creates serious security problems.","author":["Rafael Alonso","Henry F.

The analysis can be used to verify the robustness  of programs whose inputs can have small amounts of error and uncertainty---e.g., embedded controllers processing slightly unreliable sensor data, or handheld devices using slightly stale satellite data. Continuity is a fundamental notion in mathematics. However, it is difficult to apply continuity proofs from real analysis to functions that are coded as imperative programs, especially when they use diverse data types and features such as assignments, branches, and loops. We associate data types with metric spaces as opposed to just sets of values, and continuity of typed programs is phrased in terms of these spaces. Our analysis reduces questions about continuity to verification conditions that do not refer to infinitesimal changes and can be discharged using off-the-shelf SMT solvers. Challenges arise in proving continuity of programs with branches and loops, as a small perturbation in the value of a variable often leads to divergent control-flow that can lead to large changes in values of variables. Our proof rules identify appropriate ``synchronization points'' between executions and their perturbed counterparts, and establish that values of certain variables converge back to the original results in spite of temporary divergence. We prove our analysis sound with respect to the traditional epsilon-delta definition of continuity. We demonstrate the precision of our analysis by applying it to a range of classic algorithms, including algorithms for array sorting, shortest paths in graphs, minimum spanning trees, and combinatorial optimization. A prototype implementation based on the Z3 SMT-solver is also presented.","author":["Swarat Chaudhuri","Sumit Gulwani","Roberto Lublinerman"],"issue":["POPL '10: Proceedings of the 37th annual ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT symposium on Principles of programming languages","January 2010","Pages   57\u201370","https://doi.org/10.1145/1706299.1706308"],"date":"17 January 2010","ref":[{"text":"Rajeev Alur, Costas Courcoubetis, Thomas A.

If one process is interrupted in the middle of an operation, other processes will not be prevented from operating on that object. In highly concurrent systems, lock-free data structures avoid common problems associated with conventional locking techniques, including priority inversion, convoying, and difficulty of avoiding deadlock. This paper introduces transactional memory, a new multiprocessor architecture intended to make lock-free synchronization as efficient (and easy to use) as conventional techniques based on mutual exclusion. Transactional memory allows programmers to define customized read-modify-write operations that apply to multiple, independently-chosen words of memory. It is implemented by straightforward extensions to any multiprocessor cache-coherence protocol. Simulation results show that transactional memory matches or outperforms the best known locking techniques for simple benchmarks, even in the absence of priority inversion, convoying, and deadlock.","author":["Maurice Herlihy","J.

We argue that business planning as a means to generate plan data is an equally important cornerstone of a data warehouse system, and we propose it to be a first-class citizen within an OLAP engine. We introduce an abstract model describing relevant aspects of the planning process in general and the requirements it poses to a planning engine. Furthermore, we show that business planning lends itself well to parallelization and benefits from a column-store much like traditional OLAP does. We then develop a physical model specifically targeted at a highly parallel column-store, and with our implementation, we show nearly linear scaling behavior.","author":["Bernhard Jaecksch","Wolfgang Lehner","Franz Faerber"],"issue":["EDBT '10: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology","March 2010","Pages   681\u2013686","https://doi.org/10.1145/1739041.1739126"],"date":"22 March 2010","ref":[{"text":"D.

To enhance the data availability, some form of redundancy is used. For example, conventional RAID-5 systems provide data availability for single disk failure only, while recent advanced coding techniques such as row-diagonal parity (RDP) can provide data availability with up to two disk failures. To reduce the probability of data unavailability, whenever a single disk fails, disk recovery (or rebuild) will be carried out. We show that conventional recovery scheme of RDP code for a single disk failure is inefficient and suboptimal. In this paper, we propose an optimal and efficient disk recovery scheme, Row-Diagonal Optimal Recovery (RDOR), for single disk failure of RDP code that has the following properties: (1) it is read optimal in the sense that it issues the smallest number of disk reads to recover the failed disk; (2) it has the load balancing property that all surviving disks will be subjected to the same amount of additional workload in rebuilding the failed disk. We carefully explore the design state space and theoretically show the optimality of RDOR. We carry out performance evaluation to quantify the merits of RDOR on some widely used disks.","author":["Liping Xiang","Yinlong Xu","John C.S.

This paper explores the sources of these performance and energy overheads in general-purpose processing systems by quantifying the overheads of a 720p HD H.264 encoder running on a general-purpose CMP system. It then explores methods to eliminate these overheads by transforming the CPU into a specialized system for H.264 encoding. We evaluate the gains from customizations useful to broad classes of algorithms, such as SIMD units, as well as those specific to particular computation, such as customized storage and functional units. The ASIC is 500x more energy efficient than our original four-processor CMP. Broadly applicable optimizations improve performance by 10x and energy by 7x. However, the very low energy costs of actual core ops (100s fJ in 90nm) mean that over 90% of the energy used in these solutions is still \"overhead\". Achieving ASIC-like performance and efficiency requires algorithm-specific optimizations. For each sub-algorithm of H.264, we create a large, specialized functional unit that is capable of executing 100s of operations per instruction. This improves performance and energy by an additional 25x and the final customized CMP matches an ASIC solution's performance within 3x of its energy and within comparable area.","author":["Rehan Hameed","Wajahat Qadeer","Megan Wachs","Omid Azizi","Alex Solomatnikov","Benjamin C.

In this paper, we study the discovery of frequent patterns and association rules from probabilistic data under the Possible World Semantics. This is technically challenging, since a probabilistic database can have an exponential number of possible worlds. We propose two effcient algorithms, which discover frequent patterns in bottom-up and top-down manners. Both algorithms can be easily extended to discover maximal frequent patterns. We also explain how to use these patterns to generate association rules. Extensive experiments, using real and synthetic datasets, were conducted to validate the performance of our methods.","author":["Liwen Sun","Reynold Cheng","David W.

In this article, we propose a scalable FPGA-array with bandwidth-reduction mechanism (BRM) to implement high-performance and power-efficient CCMs for scientific simulations based on finite difference methods. With the FPGA-array, we construct a systolic computational-memory array (SCMA), which is given a minimum of programmability to provide flexibility and high productivity for various computing kernels and boundary computations. Since the systolic computational-memory architecture of SCMA provides scalability of both memory bandwidth and arithmetic performance according to the array size, we introduce a homogeneously partitioning approach to the SCMA so that it is extensible over a 1D or 2D array of FPGAs connected with a mesh network. To satisfy the bandwidth requirement of inter-FPGA communication, we propose BRM based on time-division multiplexing. BRM decreases the required number of communication channels between the adjacent FPGAs at the cost of delay cycles. We formulate the trade-off between bandwidth and delay of inter-FPGA data-transfer with BRM. To demonstrate feasibility and evaluate performance quantitatively, we design and implement the SCMA of 192 processing elements over two ALTERA Stratix II FPGAs. The implemented SCMA running at 106MHz has the peak performance of 40.7 GFlops in single precision. We demonstrate that the SCMA achieves the sustained performances of 32.8 to 35.7 GFlops for three benchmark computations with high utilization of computing units. The SCMA has complete scalability to the increasing number of FPGAs due to the highly localized computation and communication. In addition, we also demonstrate that the FPGA-based SCMA is power-efficient: it consumes 69% to 87% power and requires only 2.8% to 7.0% energy of those for the same computations performed by a 3.4-GHz Pentium4 processor. With software simulation, we show that BRM works effectively for benchmark computations, and therefore commercially available low-end FPGAs with relatively narrow I/O bandwidth can be utilized to construct a scalable FPGA-array.","author":["Kentaro Sano","Wang Luzhou","Yoshiaki Hatsuda","Takanori Iizuka","Satoru Yamamoto"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 3","Issue 4","November 2010","Article No.: 21","pp   1\u201335","https://doi.org/10.1145/1862648.1862651"],"date":"01 November 2010","ref":[{"text":". 2008. http://www.altera.com/literature/.","order":1},{"text":"2004.

However, most model-based Collaborative Filtering approaches such as Matrix Factorization do not provide a straightforward way of integrating context information into the model. In this work, we introduce a Collaborative Filtering method based on Tensor Factorization, a generalization of Matrix Factorization that allows for a flexible and generic integration of contextual information by modeling the data as a User-Item-Context N-dimensional tensor instead of the traditional 2D User-Item matrix. In the proposed model, called Multiverse Recommendation, different types of context are considered as additional dimensions in the representation of the data as a tensor. The factorization of this tensor leads to a compact model of the data which can be used to provide context-aware recommendations. We provide an algorithm to address the N-dimensional factorization, and show that the Multiverse Recommendation improves upon non-contextual Matrix Factorization up to 30% in terms of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). We also compare to two state-of-the-art context-aware methods and show that Tensor Factorization consistently outperforms them both in semi-synthetic and real-world data - improvements range from 2.5% to more than 12% depending on the data. Noticeably, our approach outperforms other methods by a wider margin whenever more contextual information is available.","author":["Alexandros Karatzoglou","Xavier Amatriain","Linas Baltrunas","Nuria Oliver"],"issue":["RecSys '10: Proceedings of the fourth ACM conference on Recommender systems","September 2010","Pages   79\u201386","https://doi.org/10.1145/1864708.1864727"],"date":"26 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"}}G.

Recently, two-three transistor one gated-diode (2T/3T1D) DRAMs were proposed as alternatives to address the SRAM variability problem, with an emphasis on high-activity embedded cache applications. They are highly competitive to SRAM in terms of performance, while having a smaller power and area footprint at lower technology nodes. The current evolutionary trend in transistor structures is moving toward an era of multigate devices, which makes it necessary to identify design issues and advantages of gated-diode DRAMs implemented in a multigate technology.In this work, we address gated-diode DRAM design in FinFET technology using mixed-mode 2D-device simulations. We revisit the model of internal voltage gain in bulk gated diodes and extend it to provide quantitative insight into designing Fin gated diodes, that is, gated diodes in FinFET technology. To this effect, we propose FinFET variants of the bulk gated-diode configuration and identify parameters that are critical to enhancing the retention time and read current in 2T/3T1D FinFET DRAMs. Additionally, we show the superiority of 2T1D FinFET DRAM over 6T FinFET SRAM having pass-gate feedback (6T PGFB) and 2T1D bulk DRAM under the effect of physical parameter process variations using a quasi--Monte Carlo method implemented in FinE, an environment we have developed for double-gate circuit design that integrates Sentaurus TCAD from Synopsys with the Spice3-UFDG double-gate compact model from University of Florida, under a single framework. Finally, we present a new tunable threshold gated diode FinFET amplifier which uses an n-type gated diode for voltage-boosting, along with a p-type gated diode for zero-suppression.","author":["Ajay N.

These features are necessary to support modern and future FPGA complex soft logic blocks, memory and hard blocks. The key part of the CAD flow associated with this complexity is the packer, which takes the logical atomic pieces of the complex blocks and groups them into whole physical entities. We present an area-driven generic packing tool that can pack the logical atoms into any heterogeneous FPGA described in the new language, including many different kinds of soft and hard logic blocks. We gauge its area quality by comparing the results achieved with a lower bound on the number of blocks required, and then illustrate its explorative capability in two ways: on fracturable LUT soft logic architectures, and on hard block memory architectures. The new infrastructure attaches to a flow that begins with a Verilog front-end, permitting the use of benchmarks that are significantly larger than the usual ones, and can target heterogenous FPGAs.","author":["Jason Luu","Jason Helge Anderson","Jonathan Scott Rose"],"issue":["FPGA '11: Proceedings of the 19th ACM/SIGDA international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2011","Pages   227\u2013236","https://doi.org/10.1145/1950413.1950457"],"date":"27 February 2011","ref":[{"text":"Stratix IV Device Family Overview. http://www.altera.com/literature/hb/stratix-iv/stx4_siv51001.pdf, 2009.","order":1},{"text":"Xilinx Virtex-6 Family Overview. http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds150.pdf, 2009.","order":2},{"text":"Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA Configurable Logic Block User Guide. http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/ug364.pdf, September 2009.","order":3},{"text":"T.

However, most prior work on pin-constrained biochip design considers droplet routing and the assignment of pins to electrodes as independent problems. We propose aninteger linear programming (ILP)-based optimization method to solve the droplet-routing and the pin-mapping design problems concurrently. The proposed co-optimization method optimizes routing pathways, generates a single pin-assignment, and attempts to minimize the number of control pins. It also overcomes a major limitation of recent work on this problem---the method described in prior work can lead to infeasible designs due to the need to change the mapping of pins to electrodes dynamically during bioassay execution. The effectiveness of the proposed co-optimization method is demonstrated for a commercial biochip that is used to perform n-plex immunoassays, as well as an experimental chip for multiplexed in-vitro diagnostics.","author":["Yang Zhao","Krishnendu Chakrabarty"],"issue":["ISPD '11: Proceedings of the 2011 international symposium on Physical design","March 2011","Pages   69\u201376","https://doi.org/10.1145/1960397.1960413"],"date":"27 March 2011","ref":[{"text":"R.

Both classification and ranking of the nodes (or data objects) in such networks are essential for network analysis. However, so far these approaches have generally been performed separately. In this paper, we combine ranking and classification in order to perform more accurate analysis of a heterogeneous information network. Our intuition is that highly ranked objects within a class should play more important roles in classification. On the other hand, class membership information is important for determining a quality ranking over a dataset. We believe it is therefore beneficial to integrate classification and ranking in a simultaneous, mutually enhancing process, and to this end, propose a novel ranking-based iterative classification framework, called RankClass. Specifically, we build a graph-based ranking model to iteratively compute the ranking distribution of the objects within each class. At each iteration, according to the current ranking results, the graph structure used in the ranking algorithm is adjusted so that the sub-network corresponding to the specific class is emphasized, while the rest of the network is weakened. As our experiments show, integrating ranking with classification not only generates more accurate classes than the state-of-art classification methods on networked data, but also provides meaningful ranking of objects within each class, serving as a more informative view of the data than traditional classification.","author":["Ming Ji","Jiawei Han","Marina Danilevsky"],"issue":["KDD '11: Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2011","Pages   1298\u20131306","https://doi.org/10.1145/2020408.2020603"],"date":"21 August 2011","ref":[{"text":"W.

In this paper, we solve several fundamental problems in the design of MLC flash translation layer. The objective is to reduce the garbage collection overhead so as to reduce the average system response time. We make the key observation that the valid page copy is the essential garbage collection overhead. Based on this observation, we propose two approaches, namely, concentrated mapping and postponed reclamation, to effective reduce the valid page copies. We conduct experiments on a set of benchmarks from both the real world and synthetic traces. The experimental results show that our scheme can achieve a significant reduction in the average system response time compared with the previous work.","author":["Zhiwei Qin","Yi Wang","Duo Liu","Zili Shao","Yong Guan"],"issue":["DAC '11: Proceedings of the 48th Design Automation Conference","June 2011","Pages   17\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/2024724.2024730"],"date":"05 June 2011","ref":[{"text":"OLTP trace from umass trace repository. http://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Storage/Storage.","order":1},{"text":"Samsung Electronics.

Many researchers have reacted to this fact by either inventing new concurrency-control mechanisms, weakening serializability, or both. We adopt a different approach. We assume a user who\u2014has access only to user-level tools such as (1) choosing isolation degrees 1ndash;4, (2) the ability to execute a portion of a transaction using multiversion read consistency, and (3) the ability to reorder the instructions in transaction programs; and \u2014knows the set of transactions that may run during a certain interval (users are likely to have such knowledge for on-line or real-time transactional applications).Given this information, our algorithm finds the finest chopping of a set of transactions TranSet with the following property: If the pieces of the chopping execute serializably, then TranSet executes serializably. This permits users to obtain more concurrency while preserving correctness. Besides obtaining more intertransaction concurrency, chopping transactions in this way can enhance intratransaction parallelism.The algorithm is inexpensive, running in O(n\u00d7(e+m)) time, once conflicts are identified, using a naive implementation, where n is the number of concurrent transactions in the interval, e is the number of edges in the conflict graph among the transactions, and m is the maximum number of accesses of any transaction. This makes it feasible to add as a tuning knob to real systems.","author":["Dennis Shasha","Francois Llirbat","Eric Simon","Patrick Valduriez"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Database Systems","Volume 20","Issue 3","Sept. 1995","pp   325\u2013363","https://doi.org/10.1145/211414.211427"],"date":"01 September 1995","ref":[{"text":"ADLER, D., DAGEVILLE, B., AND WONG, K.-F. 1992.

A more-precise and completer extraction of semantic information will result in a more-effective classification. The most-discernible difference between still images and moving pictures stems from movements and variations. Thus, to go from the realm of still-image repositories to video databases, we must be able to deal with motion. Particularly, we need the ability to classify objects appearing in a video sequence based on their characteristics and features such as shape or color, as well as their movements. By describing the movements that we derive from the process of motion analysis, we introduce a dual hierarchy consisting of spatial and  temporal parts for video sequence representation. This gives us the flexibility to examine arbitrary sequences of frames at various levels of abstraction and to retrieve the associated temporal information (say, object trajectories) in addition to the spatial representation. Our algorithm for motion detection uses the motion compensation component of the MPEG video-encoding scheme and then computes trajectories for objects of interest. The specification of a language for retrieval of video based on the spatial as well as motion characteristics is presented.","author":["Nevenka Dimitrova","Forouzan Golshani"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 13","Issue 4","Oct. 1995","pp   408\u2013439","https://doi.org/10.1145/211430.211433"],"date":"01 October 1995","ref":[{"text":"ALLMEN, M C. 1991.

The use of STT-RAM technology in the last level on-chip caches has been proposed as it minimizes cache leakage power with technology scaling down. Furthermore, the cell area of STT-RAM is only 1/9 ~ 1/3 that of SRAM. This allows for a much larger cache with the same die footprint, improving overall system performance through reducing cache misses. However, deploying STT-RAM technology in L1 caches is challenging because of the long and power-consuming write operations. In this paper, we propose both L1 and lower level cache designs that use STT-RAM. In particular, our designs use STT-RAM cells with various data retention time and write performances, made possible by different magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) designs. For the fast STT-RAM bits with reduced data retention time, a counter controlled dynamic refresh scheme is proposed to maintain the data validity. Our dynamic scheme saves more than 80% refresh energy compared to the simple refresh scheme proposed in previous works. A L1 cache built with ultra low retention STT-RAM coupled with our proposed dynamic refresh scheme can achieve 9.2% in performance improvement, and saves up to 30% of the total energy when compared to one that uses traditional SRAM. For lower level caches with relative large cache capacity, we propose a data migration scheme that moves data between portions of the cache with different retention characteristics so as to maximize the performance and power benefits. Our experiments show that on the average, our proposed multi retention level STT-RAM cache reduces 30 ~ 70% of the total energy compared to previous works, while improving IPC performance for both 2-level and 3-level cache hierarchy.","author":["Zhenyu Sun","Xiuyuan Bi","Hai (Helen) Li","Weng-Fai Wong","Zhong-Liang Ong","Xiaochun Zhu","Wenqing Wu"],"issue":["MICRO-44: Proceedings of the 44th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2011","Pages   329\u2013338","https://doi.org/10.1145/2155620.2155659"],"date":"03 December 2011","ref":[{"text":"http://www.rioshering.com/nvsimwiki/index.php.","order":1},{"text":"CACTI. http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/cacti/.","order":2},{"text":"Y.

This improved performance means that software overheads that had little impact on the performance of flash-based systems can present serious bottlenecks in systems that incorporate these new technologies. We describe a novel storage hardware and software architecture that nearly eliminates two sources of this overhead: Entering the kernel and performing file system permission checks. The new architecture provides a private, virtualized interface for each process and moves file system protection checks into hardware. As a result, applications can access file data without operating system intervention, eliminating OS and file system costs entirely for most accesses. We describe the support the system provides for fast permission checks in hardware, our approach to notifying applications when requests complete, and the small, easily portable changes required in the file system to support the new access model. Existing applications require no modification to use the new interface. We evaluate the performance of the system using a suite of microbenchmarks and database workloads and show that the new interface improves latency and bandwidth for 4 KB writes by 60% and 7.2x, respectively, OLTP database transaction throughput by up to 2.0x, and Berkeley-DB throughput by up to 5.7x. A streamlined asynchronous file IO interface built to fully utilize the new interface enables an additional 5.5x increase in throughput with 1 thread and 2.8x increase in efficiency for 512 B transfers.","author":["Adrian M.

A lot of algorithms on graphs are ad-hoc in the sense that each of them assumes that the underlying graph data can be organized in a certain way that maximizes the performance of the algorithm. In other words, there is no standard graph systems based on which graph algorithms are developed and optimized. In response to this situation, a lot of graph systems have been proposed recently. In this tutorial, we discuss several representative systems. Still, we focus on providing perspectives from a variety of standpoints on the goals and the means for developing a general purpose graph system. We highlight the challenges posed by the graph data, the constraints of architectural design, the different types of application needs, and the power of different programming models that support such needs. This tutorial is complementary to the related tutorial \"Managing and Mining Large Graphs: Patterns and Algorithms\".","author":["Bin Shao","Haixun Wang","Yanghua Xiao"],"issue":["SIGMOD '12: Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","May 2012","Pages   589\u2013592","https://doi.org/10.1145/2213836.2213907"],"date":"20 May 2012","ref":[{"text":"http://neo4j.org/.","order":1},{"text":"https://github.com/twitter/flockdb.","order":2},{"text":"http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics.","order":3},{"text":"http://www.w3.org/.","order":4},{"text":"http://www.worldwidewebsize.com/.","order":5},{"text":"C.

Before these new servers can enhance the productivity of application designers, systems designers must provide simple interfaces to them from both procedural and object-oriented languages. This paper first describes a successful interface between an object server and two procedural languages (C and Pascal). Because C and Pascal do not support the object-oriented paradigm application, designers using these languages must deal with database objects in less than natural ways. Fortunately, workstations supporting object-oriented languages have the potential for interacting with database objects in a much more integrated manner. To integrate these object-oriented workstations with an object server, we provide a design framework based on the notion of workstation agent objects representing principal objects in the database. We distinguish two types of agents: proxies, which forward most messages to the principal objects, and deputies, which can cache state for their principal and act with more autonomy. The interaction of cache, transaction, and message management strategies makes the implementation of deputies a nontrivial problem. The agent metaphor is being used currently to integrate an object server with a Smalltalk-8O\u2122 workstation.","author":["Alan Purdy","Bruce Schuchardt","David Maier"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 5","Issue 1","Jan. 1987","pp   27\u201347","https://doi.org/10.1145/22890.23000"],"date":"01 January 1987","ref":[{"text":"DECOUCHANT, D.

To effectively increase memory capacity and reduce per bit fabrication cost, multi-level cell (MLC) PCM stores more than one bit per cell by differentiating multiple intermediate resistance levels. However, MLC PCM suffers from significantly shortened endurance due to its large RESET current that initiates the cell state. In this paper, we propose elastic RESET (ER) to construct non-2n-state MLC PCM, e.g., 3-state MLC PCM instead of 4-state one for 2-bit MLC. We then adopt data compression and propose fraction encoding to store compressed data using non-2n-state MLC. By reducing RESET energy, ER significantly reduces write power and prolongs PCM lifetime. On average, we observed 17% RESET power reduction and 32x endurance improvement for 2-bit MLC.","author":["Lei Jiang","Youtao Zhang","Jun Yang"],"issue":["ISLPED '12: Proceedings of the 2012 ACM/IEEE international symposium on Low power electronics and design","July 2012","Pages   39\u201344","https://doi.org/10.1145/2333660.2333672"],"date":"30 July 2012","ref":[{"text":"A.

These choices do not affect the functional behavior but span a design space of different cost-performance tradeoffs. In this paper we present a novel machine learning-based approach that efficiently determines the Pareto-optimal designs while only sampling and synthesizing a fraction of the design space. The approach combines three key components: (1) A regression model based on Gaussian processes to predict area and throughput based on synthesis training data. (2) A \"smart\" sampling strategy, GP-PUCB, to iteratively refine the model by carefully selecting the next design to synthesize to maximize progress. (3) A stopping criterion based on assessing the accuracy of the model without access to complete synthesis data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using IP generators for discrete Fourier transforms and sorting networks. However, our algorithm is not specific to this application and can be applied to a wide range of Pareto front prediction problems.","author":["Marcela Zuluaga","Andreas Krause","Peter Milder","Markus P\u00fcschel"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 47","Issue 5","MAY 2012","pp   119\u2013128","https://doi.org/10.1145/2345141.2248436"],"date":"12 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"C.

We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it used less memory. computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serous errors.

To achieve good user experience, OLDI applications operate under soft-real-time constraints (e.g., 300 ms latency) which imply deadlines for network communication within the applications. Further, OLDI applications typically employ tree-based algorithms which, in the common case, result in bursts of children-to-parent traffic with tight deadlines. Recent work on datacenter network protocols is either deadline-agnostic (DCTCP) or is deadline-aware (D3) but suffers under bursts due to race conditions. Further, D3 has the practical drawbacks of requiring changes to the switch hardware and not being able to coexist with legacy TCP. We propose Deadline-Aware Datacenter TCP (D2TCP), a novel transport protocol, which handles bursts, is deadline-aware, and is readily deployable. In designing D2TCP, we make two contributions: (1) D2TCP uses a distributed and reactive approach for bandwidth allocation which fundamentally enables D2TCP's properties. (2) D2TCP employs a novel congestion avoidance algorithm, which uses ECN feedback and deadlines to modulate the congestion window via a gamma-correction function. Using a small-scale implementation and at-scale simulations, we show that D2TCP reduces the fraction of missed deadlines compared to DCTCP and D3 by 75% and 50%, respectively.","author":["Balajee Vamanan","Jahangir Hasan","T.N.

Three-dimension (3D) CMP architecture has been studied recently for integrating more functionalities and providing higher performance. The high temperature on chip is a critical issue for the 3D architecture. In this article, we propose an online thermal prediction model for 3D chips. Using this model, we propose novel task scheduling algorithms based on rotation scheduling to reduce the peak temperature on chip. We consider data dependencies, especially inter-iteration dependencies that are not well considered in most of the current thermal-aware task scheduling algorithms. Our simulation results show that our algorithms can efficiently reduce the peak temperature up to 8.1\u02c6C.","author":["Jiayin Li","Meikang Qiu","Jian-Wei Niu","Laurence T.

Optical systems provide both types of information, but are confined to a restricted area of capture. Inertial sensing alleviates this restriction, but at the expense of capturing only relative (postural) and not absolute (positional) information. In this paper, we propose an algorithm combining the relative merits of these systems to track both position and posture in challenging environments. Offline, we combine an optical (Kinect) and an inertial sensing (Orient-4) platform to learn a mapping from posture variations to translations, which we encode as a translation manifold. Online, the optical source is removed, and the learned mapping is used to infer positions using the postures computed by the inertial sensors. We first evaluate our approach in simulation, on motion sequences with ground-truth positions for error estimation. Then, the method is deployed on physical sensing platforms to track human subjects. The proposed algorithm is shown to yield a lower average cumulative error than comparable position tracking methods, such as double integration of accelerometer data, on both simulated and real sensory data, and in a variety of motions and capture settings.","author":["Aris Valtazanos","D.

SCA has emerged as a serious threat to many mathematically unbreakable cryptography systems. From an attacker's point of view, the difficulty of mounting SCA largely depends on Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the side-channel information. It has been shown that SNR primarily depends on algorithmic and circuit-level implementation, measurement noise, as well as device thermal noise. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any study on the effect of power delivery network (PDN) on SCA resistance. We note that the PDN plays a significant role in SNR of measured supply current. Furthermore, SCA resistance strongly depends on the operating frequency due to RLC structure of a power grid. In this paper, we analyze the effect of power grid on SCA and provide quantitative results to demonstrate the frequency-dependent SCA resistance due to PDN-induced noise. This property can potentially be exploited by an attacker to facilitate the attack by operating a device at favorable frequency points. On the other hand, from a designer's perspective, one can explore countermeasures to secure the device at all operating frequencies while minimizing the design overhead. Based on this observation, we propose a frequency-dependent noise-injection based compensation technique to efficiently protect against SCA. Simulation results using realistic PDN model as well as experimental measurements using FPGA test board validate the observations on role of PDN in SCA and the efficacy of the proposed compensation approach.","author":["Xinmu Wang","Wen Yueh","Debapriya Basu Roy","Seetharam Narasimhan","Yu Zheng","Saibal Mukhopadhyay","Debdeep Mukhopadhyay","Swarup Bhunia"],"issue":["DAC '13: Proceedings of the 50th Annual Design Automation Conference","May 2013","Article No.: 78","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/2463209.2488830"],"date":"29 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"P.

Two types of flash memory cells are available for building SSD caches, single-level cells (SLC) and multi-level cells (MLC). MLC is more appealing than SLC because it can achieve higher cache capacity at the same cost. However, we see a critical issue for SSD caches to adopt MLC NAND flash: the endurance of modern MLC NAND flash is too low to sustain datacenter workloads. In this paper, we propose DuraCache that addresses the durability issue of SSD caches. DuraCache exploits the fact that SSD caches are write-through caches in datacenters. Therefore, uncorrectable errors in SSD caches can be handled like cache misses which bring in correct data from HDD arrays. In addition, DuraCache gradually allocates more ECC parities associated with data when NAND flash reaches wearout thresholds. This allows SSD caches to continue operating by sacrificing available capacity. We conduct empirical experiments and demonstrate that DuraCache enables MLC SSD caches to achieve 4.1 years of service life assuming a TPC-C workload.","author":["Ren-Shuo Liu","Chia-Lin Yang","Cheng-Hsuan Li","Geng-You Chen"],"issue":["DAC '13: Proceedings of the 50th Annual Design Automation Conference","May 2013","Article No.: 166","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2463209.2488939"],"date":"29 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"Datasheet: NetApp Flash Cache.

This article revisits nearly 100 existing works and surveys how such works have answered the advocacy. The article introduces a fresh treatment that classifies and discusses existing work within three rational aspects: (1) what and how EA components contribute to exploration and exploitation; (2) when and how exploration and exploitation are controlled; and (3) how balance between exploration and exploitation is achieved. With a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of exploration and exploitation, more research in this direction may be motivated and refined.","author":["Matej \u010crepin\u0161ek","Shih-Hsi Liu","Marjan Mernik"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 45","Issue 3","June 2013","Article No.: 35","pp   1\u201333","https://doi.org/10.1145/2480741.2480752"],"date":"03 July 2013","ref":[{"text":"Adra, S.

Unlike fixed-function accelerators, LINQits accelerates a domain-specific query language called LINQ. LINQits does not provide coverage for all possible applications---however, existing applications (re-)written with LINQ in mind benefit extensively from hardware acceleration. Furthermore, the LINQits framework offers a graceful and transparent migration path from software to hardware. LINQits is prototyped on a 2W heterogeneous SoC called the ZYNQ processor, which combines dual ARM A9 processors with an FPGA on a single die in 28nm silicon technology. Our physical measurements show that LINQits improves energy efficiency by 8.9 to 30.6 times and performance by 10.7 to 38.1 times compared to optimized, multithreaded C programs running on conventional ARM A9 processors.","author":["Eric S.

A characteristic shared by many multilabel learning problems is that some labels have significant correlations between them. In this article, we propose a novel multilabel learning method, called MultiLabel Relationship Learning (MLRL), which extends the conventional support vector machine by explicitly learning and utilizing the relationships between labels. Specifically, we model the label relationships using a label covariance matrix and use it to define a new regularization term for the optimization problem. MLRL learns the model parameters and the label covariance matrix simultaneously based on a unified convex formulation. To solve the convex optimization problem, we use an alternating method in which each subproblem can be solved efficiently. The relationship between MLRL and two widely used maximum margin methods for multilabel learning is investigated. Moreover, we also propose a semisupervised extension of MLRL, called SSMLRL, to demonstrate how to make use of unlabeled data to help learn the label covariance matrix. Through experiments conducted on some multilabel applications, we find that MLRL not only gives higher classification accuracy but also has better interpretability as revealed by the label covariance matrix.","author":["Yu Zhang","Dit-Yan Yeung"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data","Volume 7","Issue 2","July 2013","Article No.: 7","pp   1\u201330","https://doi.org/10.1145/2499907.2499910"],"date":"02 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"Argyriou, A., Evgeniou, T., and Pontil, M. 2008a.

Taking the fullest advantage of the low latency and high bandwidths of emerging memories such as phase change memory (PCM), spin torque, and memristor necessitates a serious look at placing these persistent storage technologies on the main memory bus. Doing so, however, introduces critical challenges of not sacrificing the data reliability and consistency that users demand from storage. This paper introduces techniques for (1) robust wear-aware memory allocation, (2) preventing of erroneous writes, and (3) consistency-preserving updates that are cache-efficient. We show through our evaluation that these techniques are efficiently implementable and effective by demonstrating a B+-tree implementation modified to make full use of our toolkit.","author":["Iulian Moraru","David G.

The problem has been shown to be as hard as worst-case lattice problems, and in recent years it has served as the foundation for a plethora of cryptographic applications. Unfortunately, these applications are rather inefficient due to an inherent quadratic overhead in the use of LWE. A main open question was whether LWE and its applications could be made truly efficient by exploiting extra algebraic structure, as was done for lattice-based hash functions (and related primitives).We resolve this question in the affirmative by introducing an algebraic variant of LWE called ring-LWE, and proving that it too enjoys very strong hardness guarantees. Specifically, we show that the ring-LWE distribution is pseudorandom, assuming that worst-case problems on ideal lattices are hard for polynomial-time quantum algorithms. Applications include the first truly practical lattice-based public-key cryptosystem with an efficient security reduction; moreover, many of the other applications of LWE can be made much more efficient through the use of ring-LWE.","author":["Vadim Lyubashevsky","Chris Peikert","Oded Regev"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 60","Issue 6","November 2013","Article No.: 43","pp   1\u201335","https://doi.org/10.1145/2535925"],"date":"01 November 2013","ref":[{"text":"Shweta Agrawal, Dan Boneh, and Xavier Boyen. 2010a.

These writes are performed in units of pages, while space is reclaimed in units of multipage erase blocks, necessitating copying of any remaining valid pages in the block before reclamation. The efficiency of this cleaning process greatly affects performance under random workloads; in particular, in SSDs, the write bottleneck is typically internal media throughput, and write amplificationdue to additional internal copying directly reduces application throughput.We present the first nearly-exact closed-form solution for write amplification under greedy cleaning for uniformly-distributed random traffic, validate its accuracy via simulation, and show that its inaccuracies are negligible for reasonable block sizes and overprovisioning ratios. In addition, we also present the first models which predict performance degradation for both LRW (least-recently-written) cleaning and greedy cleaning under simple nonuniform traffic conditions; simulation results show the first model to be exact and the second to be accurate within 2%. We extend the LRW model to arbitrary combinations of random traffic and demonstrate its use in predicting cleaning performance for real-world workloads.Using these analytic models, we examine the strategy of separating \u201chot\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d data, showing that for our traffic model, such separation eliminates any loss in performance due to nonuniform traffic. We then show how a system which segregates hot and cold data into different block pools may shift free space between these pools in order to achieve improved performance, and how numeric methods may be used with our model to find the optimum operating point, which approaches a write amplification of 1.0 for increasingly skewed traffic. We examine online methods for achieving this optimal operating point and show a control strategy based on our model which achieves high performance for a number of real-world block traces.","author":["Peter Desnoyers"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 10","Issue 2","March 2014","Article No.: 8","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2577384"],"date":"01 March 2014","ref":[{"text":"Agarwal, R. and Marrow, M. 2010.

The presented processor class is a highly parameterizable template which can be tailored before runtime to fulfill costumers' requirements such as performance, area cost, and energy efficiency. These programmable accelerators are well suited for domain-specific computing from the areas of signal, image, and video processing as well as other streaming processing applications. To overcome future scaling issues (e.g., power consumption, reliability, resource management, as well as application parallelization and mapping), TCPAs are inherently designed in way that they support self-adaptivity and resource awareness at hardware level. Here, we follow a recently introduced resource-aware parallel computing paradigm called invasive computing where an application can dynamically claim, execute, and release the resources. Furthermore, we show how invasive computing can be used as an enabler for power management. For the first time, we present a seamless mapping flow for TCPAs, based on a domain-specific language. Moreover, we outline a complete symbolic mapping approach. Finally, we support our claims by comparing a TCPA against an ARM Mali-T604 GPU in terms of performance and energy efficiency.","author":["Frank Hannig","Vahid Lari","Srinivas Boppu","Alexandru Tanase","Oliver Reiche"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 13","Issue 4s","July 2014","Article No.: 133","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/2584660"],"date":"01 April 2014","ref":[{"text":"Volker Baumgarte, Gerd Ehlers, Frank May, Armin N\u00fcckel, Martin Vorbach, and Markus Weinhardt. 2003.

This is a fixed decision that drives the whole architectural design of a database system, i.e., row-stores, column-stores. However, none of those choices is a universally good solution; different workloads require different storage layouts and data access methods in order to achieve good performance. In this paper, we present the H2O system which introduces two novel concepts. First, it is flexible to support multiple storage layouts and data access patterns in a single engine. Second, and most importantly, it decides on-the-fly, i.e., during query processing, which design is best for classes of queries and the respective data parts. At any given point in time, parts of the data might be materialized in various patterns purely depending on the query workload; as the workload changes and with every single query, the storage and access patterns continuously adapt. In this way, H2O makes no a priori and fixed decisions on how data should be stored, allowing each single query to enjoy a storage and access pattern which is tailored to its specific properties. We present a detailed analysis of H2O using both synthetic benchmarks and realistic scientific workloads. We demonstrate that while existing systems cannot achieve maximum performance across all workloads, H2O can always match the best case performance without requiring any tuning or workload knowledge.","author":["Ioannis Alagiannis","Stratos Idreos","Anastasia Ailamaki"],"issue":["SIGMOD '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","June 2014","Pages   1103\u20131114","https://doi.org/10.1145/2588555.2610502"],"date":"18 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"D.

However, these knowledge bases are often incomplete or uncertain. In this paper, we present ProbKB, a probabilistic knowledge base designed to infer missing facts in a scalable, probabilistic, and principled manner using a relational DBMS. The novel contributions we make to achieve scalability and high quality are: 1) We present a formal definition and a novel relational model for probabilistic knowledge bases. This model allows an efficient SQL-based inference algorithm for knowledge expansion that applies inference rules in batches; 2) We implement ProbKB on massive parallel processing databases to achieve further scalability; and 3) We combine several quality control methods that identify erroneous rules, facts, and ambiguous entities to improve the precision of inferred facts. Our experiments show that ProbKB system outperforms the state-of-the-art inference engine in terms of both performance and quality.","author":["Yang Chen","Daisy Zhe Wang"],"issue":["SIGMOD '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","June 2014","Pages   649\u2013660","https://doi.org/10.1145/2588555.2610516"],"date":"18 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"S.

However, many applications in gaming and gesture based interface see more benefits in knowing the detailed shape of a motion. Such trajectory tracing requires a resolution several fold higher than what existing RF-based positioning systems can offer. This paper shows that one can provide a dramatic increase in trajectory tracing accuracy, even with a small number of antennas. The key enabler for our design is a multi-resolution positioning technique that exploits an intrinsic tradeoff between improving the resolution and resolving ambiguity in the location of the RF source. The unique property of this design is its ability to precisely reconstruct the minute details in the trajectory shape, even when the absolute position might have an offset. We built a prototype of our design with commercial off-the-shelf RFID readers and tags and used it to enable a virtual touch screen, which allows a user to interact with a desired computing device by gesturing or writing her commands in the air, where each letter is only a few centimeters wide.","author":["Jue Wang","Deepak Vasisht","Dina Katabi"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM conference on SIGCOMM","August 2014","Pages   235\u2013246","https://doi.org/10.1145/2619239.2626330"],"date":"17 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"AN-900LH 900MHz antenna. rf-links.com/newsite/pdf/an900lh.pdf.","order":1},{"text":"Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array(ALMA). alma.mtk.nao.ac.jp/e/aboutalma/.","order":2},{"text":"Google Acquires Indoor/Outdoor Wireless Location Patents.","order":3},{"text":"MonkeyRunner API. developer.android.com/tools/help/MonkeyRunner.html.","order":4},{"text":"Omni-id exo 800. http://www.omni-id.com/products/.","order":5},{"text":"The corpus of contemporary american english. www.wordfrequency.info/.","order":6},{"text":"Ubi interactive. www.ubi-interactive.com.","order":7},{"text":"Vicon t-series. www.vicon.com/products/documents/Tseries.pdf.","order":8},{"text":"F.

These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide F1 scores up to 10% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.","author":["Bryan Perozzi","Rami Al-Rfou","Steven Skiena"],"issue":["KDD '14: Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2014","Pages   701\u2013710","https://doi.org/10.1145/2623330.2623732"],"date":"24 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"R.

In this paper we develop, for the first time, a complete RTL-to-GDSII design flow for gate-level M3D. Our tool flow is based on commercial tools built for 2D ICs and enhanced with our 3D specific methodologies. We use this flow along with a 28nm PDK to build layouts for the OpenSPARC T2 core.

Building these models is challenging, requiring experimentation, dialogue with vendors or standards bodies, and validation; their scale adds engineering issues akin to those of programming to the task of writing clear and usable mathematics. But language and tool support for specification is lacking. Proof assistants can be used but bring their own difficulties, and a model produced in one, perhaps requiring many person-years effort and maintained over an extended period, cannot be used by those familiar with another. We introduce Lem, a language for engineering reusable large-scale semantic models. The Lem design takes inspiration both from functional programming languages and from proof assistants, and Lem definitions are translatable into OCaml for testing, Coq, HOL4, and Isabelle/HOL for proof, and LaTeX and HTML for presentation. This requires a delicate balance of expressiveness, careful library design, and implementation of transformations - akin to compilation, but subject to the constraint of producing usable and human-readable code for each target. Lem's effectiveness is demonstrated by its use in practice.","author":["Dominic P. Mulligan","Scott Owens","Kathryn E.

They are executed on quantum circuits, which consist of a cascade of quantum gates. However, synthesis of quantum circuits is not straightforward because of the complexity of quantum algorithms.Generally, quantum algorithms contain two parts: classical and quantum. Thus, synthesizing circuits for the two parts separately reduces overall synthesis complexity. In addition, many quantum algorithms use similar subroutines that can be implemented with similar circuit modules. Because of their frequent use, it is important to use automated scripts to generate such modules efficiently. These modules can then be subjected to further synthesis optimizations.This article proposes QLib, a quantum module library, which contains scripts to generate quantum modules of different sizes and specifications for well-known quantum algorithms. Thus, QLib can also serve as a suite of benchmarks for quantum logic and physical synthesis.","author":["Chia-Chun Lin","Amlan Chakrabarti","Niraj K.

It allows for program data to be computed and stored approximately for better energy efficiency. The duration of battery in the smartphones, tablets, etc. is generally more of a concern to users than an application's accuracy or fidelity beyond certain acceptable quality of service. Therefore, relaxing accuracy to improve energy efficiency is an attractive trade-off when permissible by the application's domain. Recent works suggest source code annotations and type qualifiers to facilitate safe approximate computation and data manipulation. It requires rewriting of programs or the availability of source codes for annotations. This may not be feasible as real-world applications tend to be large, with source code that is not readily available.In this paper, we propose a novel sensitivity analysis that automatically generates annotations for programs for the purpose of approximate computing. Our framework, ASAC, extracts information about the sensitivity of the output with respect to program data. We show that the program output is sensitive to only a subset of program data that we deem critical, and hence must be precise. The rest of the data can be computed and stored approximately.We evaluated our analysis on a range of applications, and achieved a 86% accuracy compared to manual annotations by programmers. We validated our analysis by showing that the applications are within the acceptable QoS threshold if we approximate the non-critical data.","author":["Pooja Roy","Rajarshi Ray","Chundong Wang","Weng Fai Wong"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 49","Issue 5","May 2014","pp   95\u2013104","https://doi.org/10.1145/2666357.2597812"],"date":"12 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"J.

However, few of them study how to generate templates automatically. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a join approach for template generation. Given a workload D of SPARQL queries and a set N of natural language questions, the goal is to find some pairs q, n, for q\u2208 D \u2227 n \u2208, N, where SPARQL query q is the best match for natural language question n. These pairs provide promising hints for automatic template generation. Due to the ambiguity of the natural languages, we model the problem above as an uncertain graph join task. We propose several structural and probability pruning techniques to speed up joining. Extensive experiments over real RDF Q/A benchmark datasets confirm both the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.","author":["Weiguo Zheng","Lei Zou","Xiang Lian","Jeffrey Xu Yu","Shaoxu Song","Dongyan Zhao"],"issue":["SIGMOD '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","May 2015","Pages   1809\u20131824","https://doi.org/10.1145/2723372.2747648"],"date":"27 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"L.

Due to global illumination, the temporally varying radiance received at the sensor is a combination of light received along multiple paths. Recovering scene properties (e.g., scene depths) from the received radiance requires separating these contributions, which is challenging due to the complexity of global illumination and the additional temporal dimension of the radiance.We propose phasor imaging, a framework for performing fast inverse light transport analysis using C-ToF sensors. Phasor imaging is based on the idea that, by representing light transport quantities as phasors and light transport events as phasor transformations, light transport analysis can be simplified in the temporal frequency domain. We study the effect of temporal illumination frequencies on light transport and show that, for a broad range of scenes, global radiance (inter-reflections and volumetric scattering) vanishes for frequencies higher than a scene-dependent threshold. We use this observation for developing two novel scene recovery techniques. First, we present micro-ToF imaging, a ToF-based shape recovery technique that is robust to errors due to inter-reflections (multipath interference) and volumetric scattering. Second, we present a technique for separating the direct and global components of radiance. Both techniques require capturing as few as 3--4 images and minimal computations. We demonstrate the validity of the presented techniques via simulations and experiments performed with our hardware prototype.","author":["Mohit Gupta","Shree K. Nayar","Matthias B.

A number of free-to-use high-quality online MT systems are now available and, although imperfect in their translation behavior, are found to produce good performance in Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) applications. Users of these MT systems in CLIR tasks generally assume that they all behave similarly in CLIR applications, and the choice of MT system is often made on the basis of convenience. We present a set of experiments which compare the impact of applying two of the best known online systems, Google and Bing translation, for query translation across multiple language pairs and for two very different CLIR tasks. Our experiments show that the MT systems perform differently on average for different tasks and language pairs, but more significantly for different individual queries. We examine the differing translation behavior of these tools and seek to draw conclusions in terms of their suitability for use in different settings.","author":["Ali Hosseinzadeh Vahid","Piyush Arora","Qun Liu","Gareth J.F.

Multicores and heterogeneous accelerator-based architectures are a by-product of this quest to obtain improvements in the performance of computing platforms at similar or lower power budgets. In light of the need for new innovations to sustain these improvements, we discuss approximate computing, a field that has attracted considerable interest over the last decade. While the core principles of approximate computing---computing efficiently by producing results that are good enough or of sufficient quality---are not new and are shared by many fields from algorithm design to networks and distributed systems, recent e.orts have seen a percolation of these principles to all layers of the computing stack, including circuits, architecture, and software. Approximate computing techniques have also evolved from ad hoc and applicationspecific to more broadly applicable, supported by systematic design methodologies. Finally, the emergence of workloads such as recognition, mining, search, data analytics, inference and vision are greatly increasing the opportunities for approximate computing. We describe the vision and key principles that have guided our work in this area, and outline a holistic cross-layer framework for approximate computing.","author":["Swagath Venkataramani","Srimat T.

Unfortunately, existing virtual memory systems track memory at a larger granularity (e.g., 4 KB pages), inhibiting efficient implementation of such techniques. Simply reducing the page size results in an unacceptable increase in page table overhead and TLB pressure. We propose a new virtual memory framework that enables efficient implementation of a variety of fine-grained memory management techniques. In our framework, each virtual page can be mapped to a structure called a page overlay, in addition to a regular physical page. An overlay contains a subset of cache lines from the virtual page. Cache lines that are present in the overlay are accessed from there and all other cache lines are accessed from the regular physical page. Our page-overlay framework enables cache-line-granularity memory management without significantly altering the existing virtual memory framework or introducing high overheads. We show that our framework can enable simple and efficient implementations of seven memory management techniques, each of which has a wide variety of applications. We quantitatively evaluate the potential benefits of two of these techniques: overlay-on-write and sparse-data-structure computation. Our evaluations show that overlay-on-write, when applied to fork, can improve performance by 15% and reduce memory capacity requirements by 53% on average compared to traditional copy-on-write. For sparse data computation, our framework can outperform a state-of-the-art software-based sparse representation on a number of real-world sparse matrices. Our framework is general, powerful, and effective in enabling fine-grained memory management at low cost.","author":["Vivek Seshadri","Gennady Pekhimenko","Olatunji Ruwase","Onur Mutlu","Phillip B.

Cleve's seminal result (STOC '86) implies that satisfying these properties simultaneously is impossible in the presence of dishonest majorities, and led to several proposals for relaxed notions of fairness. While these works also suggest completeness results (i.e., the ability to design protocols which achieve their fairness notion), their assessment is typically of an all-or-nothing nature. In this work we put forth a new approach for defining relaxed fairness guarantees that allows for a quantitative comparison between protocols with regard to the level of fairness they achieve. The basic idea is to use an appropriate utility function to express the preferences of an adversary who wants to violate fairness. We also show optimal protocols with respect to our notion, in both the two-party and multi-party settings.","author":["Juan Garay","Jonathan Katz","Bj\u00f6rn Tackmann","Vassilis Zikas"],"issue":["PODC '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing","July 2015","Pages   281\u2013290","https://doi.org/10.1145/2767386.2767431"],"date":"21 July 2015","ref":[{"text":"Gilad Asharov, Ran Canetti, and Carmit Hazay.

Preemptive multitasking on CPUs has been primarily supported through context switching. However, the same preemption strategy incurs substantial overhead due to the large context in GPUs. The overhead comes in two dimensions: a preempting kernel suffers from a long preemption latency, and the system throughput is wasted during the switch. Without precise control over the large preemption overhead, multitasking on GPUs has little use for applications with strict latency requirements.In this paper, we propose Chimera, a collaborative preemption approach that can precisely control the overhead for multitasking on GPUs. Chimera first introduces streaming multiprocessor (SM) flushing, which can instantly preempt an SM by detecting and exploiting idempotent execution. Chimera utilizes flushing collaboratively with two previously proposed preemption techniques for GPUs, namely context switching and draining to minimize throughput overhead while achieving a required preemption latency. Evaluations show that Chimera violates the deadline for only 0.2% of preemption requests when a 15us preemption latency constraint is used. For multi-programmed workloads, Chimera can improve the average normalized turnaround time by 5.5x, and system throughput by 12.2%.","author":["Jason Jong Kyu Park","Yongjun Park","Scott Mahlke"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 50","Issue 4","April 2015","pp   593\u2013606","https://doi.org/10.1145/2775054.2694346"],"date":"14 March 2015","ref":[{"text":"Jacob T.

We explore new directions with forecasting weather as a data-intensive challenge that involves inferences across space and time. We study specifically the power of making predictions via a hybrid approach that combines discriminatively trained predictive models with a deep neural network that models the joint statistics of a set of weather-related variables. We show how the base model can be enhanced with spatial interpolation that uses learned long-range spatial dependencies. We also derive an efficient learning and inference procedure that allows for large scale optimization of the model parameters. We evaluate the methods with experiments on real-world meteorological data that highlight the promise of the approach.","author":["Aditya Grover","Ashish Kapoor","Eric Horvitz"],"issue":["KDD '15: Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2015","Pages   379\u2013386","https://doi.org/10.1145/2783258.2783275"],"date":"10 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"M.

Accordingly, researchers and industry practitioners alike have focused a great deal of effort designing network fabrics to efficiently interconnect and manage the traffic within these datacenters in performant yet efficient fashions. Unfortunately, datacenter operators are generally reticent to share the actual requirements of their applications, making it challenging to evaluate the practicality of any particular design. Moreover, the limited large-scale workload information available in the literature has, for better or worse, heretofore largely been provided by a single datacenter operator whose use cases may not be widespread. In this work, we report upon the network traffic observed in some of Facebook's datacenters. While Facebook operates a number of traditional datacenter services like Hadoop, its core Web service and supporting cache infrastructure exhibit a number of behaviors that contrast with those reported in the literature. We report on the contrasting locality, stability, and predictability of network traffic in Facebook's datacenters, and comment on their implications for network architecture, traffic engineering, and switch design.","author":["Arjun Roy","Hongyi Zeng","Jasmeet Bagga","George Porter","Alex C.

Three themes unify the five generations of datacenter networks detailed in this paper. First, multi-stage Clos topologies built from commodity switch silicon can support cost-effective deployment of building-scale networks. Second, much of the general, but complex, decentralized network routing and management protocols supporting arbitrary deployment scenarios were overkill for single-operator, pre-planned datacenter networks. We built a centralized control mechanism based on a global configuration pushed to all datacenter switches. Third, modular hardware design coupled with simple, robust software allowed our design to also support inter-cluster and wide-area networks. Our datacenter networks run at dozens of sites across the planet, scaling in capacity by 100x over ten years to more than 1Pbps of bisection bandwidth.","author":["Arjun Singh","Joon Ong","Amit Agarwal","Glen Anderson","Ashby Armistead","Roy Bannon","Seb Boving","Gaurav Desai","Bob Felderman","Paulie Germano","Anand Kanagala","Jeff Provost","Jason Simmons","Eiichi Tanda","Jim Wanderer","Urs H\u00f6lzle","Stephen Stuart","Amin Vahdat"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Conference on Special Interest Group on Data Communication","August 2015","Pages   183\u2013197","https://doi.org/10.1145/2785956.2787508"],"date":"17 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"Ahn, J.

MCSC extends the vision of participatory sensing by leveraging both participatory sensory data from mobile devices (offline) and user-contributed data from mobile social networking services (online). Further, it explores the complementary roles and presents the fusion/collaboration of machine and human intelligence in the crowd sensing and computing processes. This article characterizes the unique features and novel application areas of MCSC and proposes a reference framework for building human-in-the-loop MCSC systems. We further clarify the complementary nature of human and machine intelligence and envision the potential of deep-fused human--machine systems. We conclude by discussing the limitations, open issues, and research opportunities of MCSC.","author":["Bin Guo","Zhu Wang","Zhiwen Yu","Yu Wang","Neil Y.

Recently, various studies on power consumptions are conducted. In this study, we have executed system development, experiments by subjects, analysis of correlation between life-pattern and power consumptions and proposal of electrical power reduction for the purpose of reducing home power consumption. At present, we are working on analysis of correlation between a life pattern and electrical power consumption of the residents. We asked the residents for inputting their activities for around several minutes per day using a system that we have developed. We were able to collect approximately 11,745 activity inputs, approximately 7.14GB of sensor data, and power consumption data of 237,280 hours corresponding to about 4 months from 35 homes. Using the collected data, we carried out the multiple regression analysis taking an estimated time of activity and sustained period as explanation variables and average power consumption per day as an objective variable. As the result, it was known that there is correlation between life-pattern and power consumption. In this paper, we will show that it becomes possible to execute concrete analysis of relationship between power consumption and activities of residents by using the label data of resident's life pattern.","author":["Xincheng Pan","Tomohiro Minezaki","Tatsuya Isoda","Shota Tanaka","Yuri Uchino","Sozo Inoue"],"issue":["UbiComp/ISWC'15 Adjunct: Adjunct Proceedings of the 2015 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and Proceedings of the 2015 ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers","September 2015","Pages   1443\u20131452","https://doi.org/10.1145/2800835.2801615"],"date":"07 September 2015","ref":[{"text":"Tokyo University, \"GreenICT Project\", http://www.gutp.jp/","order":1},{"text":"Matteo Muratori, Matthew C.

However, the data sets that can be processed with current implementations are severely constrained by the limited amount of main memory available in these architectures. In this paper, we propose an extension of the embedded array language Accelerate with a notion of sequences, resulting in a two level hierarchy which allows the programmer to specify a partitioning strategy which facilitates automatic resource allocation. Depending on the available memory, the runtime system processes the overall data set in streams of chunks appropriate to the hardware parameters. In this paper, we present the language design for the sequence operations, as well as the compilation and runtime support, and demonstrate with a set of benchmarks the feasibility of this approach.","author":["Frederik M.

The main idea is to divide the space into spatial beams originating from the light source, and identify each beam with a unique timed sequence of light signals. This sequence is created by a coded shade that covers and rotates around the LED, blocking the light or allowing it to pass through according to pre-defined patterns. The receiver, equipped with a light sensor, is able to determine its spatial beam by detecting the light signals, followed by optimization schemes to refine its location within that beam. We present both 2D and 3D localization designs, demonstrated by a prototype implementation. Experiments show that SpinLight produces a median location error of 3.8 cm, with a 95th percentile of 6.8 cm. The receiver design is very low power and thus can operate for months to years from a button coin battery.","author":["Bo Xie","Guang Tan","Tian He"],"issue":["SenSys '15: Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems","November 2015","Pages   211\u2013223","https://doi.org/10.1145/2809695.2809713"],"date":"01 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"Analog Devices, Inc.

In a model inversion attack, recently introduced in a case study of linear classifiers in personalized medicine by Fredrikson et al., adversarial access to an ML model is abused to learn sensitive genomic information about individuals. Whether model inversion attacks apply to settings outside theirs, however, is unknown. We develop a new class of model inversion attack that exploits confidence values revealed along with predictions. Our new attacks are applicable in a variety of settings, and we explore two in depth: decision trees for lifestyle surveys as used on machine-learning-as-a-service systems and neural networks for facial recognition. In both cases confidence values are revealed to those with the ability to make prediction queries to models. We experimentally show attacks that are able to estimate whether a respondent in a lifestyle survey admitted to cheating on their significant other and, in the other context, show how to recover recognizable images of people's faces given only their name and access to the ML model. We also initiate experimental exploration of natural countermeasures, investigating a privacy-aware decision tree training algorithm that is a simple variant of CART learning, as well as revealing only rounded confidence values. The lesson that emerges is that one can avoid these kinds of MI attacks with negligible degradation to utility.","author":["Matt Fredrikson","Somesh Jha","Thomas Ristenpart"],"issue":["CCS '15: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2015","Pages   1322\u20131333","https://doi.org/10.1145/2810103.2813677"],"date":"12 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"DeepFace: Closing the Gap to Human-Level Performance in Face Verification.

Given the high-stake nature of trial outcomes, implementing accurate and effective computational methods to evaluate the honesty of court testimonies can offer valuable support during the decision making process. In this paper, we address the identification of deception in real-life trial data. We introduce a novel dataset consisting of videos collected from public court trials. We explore the use of verbal and non-verbal modalities to build a multimodal deception detection system that aims to discriminate between truthful and deceptive statements provided by defendants and witnesses. We achieve classification accuracies in the range of 60-75% when using a model that extracts and fuses features from the linguistic and gesture modalities. In addition, we present a human deception detection study where we evaluate the human capability of detecting deception in trial hearings. The results show that our system outperforms the human capability of identifying deceit.","author":["Ver\u00f3nica P\u00e9rez-Rosas","Mohamed Abouelenien","Rada Mihalcea","Mihai Burzo"],"issue":["ICMI '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM on International Conference on Multimodal Interaction","November 2015","Pages   59\u201366","https://doi.org/10.1145/2818346.2820758"],"date":"09 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"M.

However, running with the maximum thread-level parallelism (TLP) does not necessarily lead to the optimal performance due to the excessive thread contention for cache resource. As a result, thread throttling techniques are employed to limit the number of threads that concurrently execute to preserve the data locality. On the other hand, GPUs are equipped with a large register file to enable fast context switch between threads. However, thread throttling techniques that are designed to mitigate cache contention, lead to under utilization of registers. Register allocation is a significant factor for performance as it not just determines the single-thread performance, but indirectly affects the TLP. The design space of register allocation and TLP presents new opportunities for performance optimization. However, the complicated correlation between the two factors inevitably lead to many performance dynamics and uncertainties. In this paper, we propose Coordinated Register Allocation and Thread-level parallelism (CRAT), a compiler-based performance optimization framework. In order to achieve this goal, CRAT first enables effective register allocation. Given a register per-thread limit, CRAT allocates the registers by analyzing the lifetime of variables. To reduce the spilling cost, CRAT spills the registers to shared memory when possible. Then, CRAT explores the design space by first pruning the design points that cause serious Ll cache thrashing and register under utilization. After that, CRAT employs a prediction model to find the best tradeoff between the single-thread performance and TLP. We evaluate CRAT using a set of representative workloads on GPUs. Experimental results indicate that compared to the optimal thread throttling technique, our framework achieves performance improvement up to 1.79X (geometric mean 1.25X).","author":["Xiaolong Xie","Yun Liang","Xiuhong Li","Yudong Wu","Guangyu Sun","Tao Wang","Dongrui Fan"],"issue":["MICRO-48: Proceedings of the 48th International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2015","Pages   395\u2013406","https://doi.org/10.1145/2830772.2830813"],"date":"05 December 2015","ref":[{"text":"\"NVIDIA CUDA programming guide..\" http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide.","order":1},{"text":"T.

In contrast, DRAM access latency stays relatively constant and is trending to increase. Much efforts have been devoted to tolerate memory access latency but these techniques have reached the point of diminishing returns. Having shorter bitline and wordline length in a DRAM device will reduce the access latency. However by doing so it will impact the array efficiency. In the mainstream market, manufacturers are not willing to trade capacity for latency. Prior works had proposed hybrid-bitline DRAM design to overcome this problem. However, those methods are either intrusive to the circuit and layout of the DRAM design, or there is no direct way to migrate data between the fast and slow levels. In this paper, we proposed a novel asymmetric DRAM with capability to perform low cost data migration between subarrays. Having this design we determined a simple management mechanism and explored many management related policies. We showed that with this new design and our simple management technique we could achieve 7.25% and 11.77% performance improvement in single- and multi-programming workloads, respectively, over a system with traditional homogeneous DRAM. This gain is above 80% of the potential performance gain of a system based on a hypothetical DRAM which is made out of short bitlines entirely.","author":["Shih-Lien Lu","Ying-Chen Lin","Chia-Lin Yang"],"issue":["MICRO-48: Proceedings of the 48th International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2015","Pages   255\u2013266","https://doi.org/10.1145/2830772.2830827"],"date":"05 December 2015","ref":[{"text":"T.-Y.

Thus, advances in top-N recommendation have far-ranging consequences in practical applications. In this paper, we present a novel method, called Collaborative Denoising Auto-Encoder (CDAE), for top-N recommendation that utilizes the idea of Denoising Auto-Encoders. We demonstrate that the proposed model is a generalization of several well-known collaborative filtering models but with more flexible components. Thorough experiments are conducted to understand the performance of CDAE under various component settings. Furthermore, experimental results on several public datasets demonstrate that CDAE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art top-N recommendation methods on a variety of common evaluation metrics.","author":["Yao Wu","Christopher DuBois","Alice X.

Glitches arise from imbalances in the combinational path delays to a signal, which may cause the signal to toggle multiple times in a given clock cycle before settling to its final value. In this paper, we propose a low-cost circuit structure that is able to eliminate a majority of glitches. The structure, which is incorporated into the output buffers of FPGA logic elements, suppresses pulses on buffer outputs whose duration is shorter than a configurable time window (set at the time of FPGA configuration). Glitches are thereby eliminated \"at the source\" ensuring they do not propagate into the high-capacitance FPGA interconnect, saving power.

Most of this inability to achieve high throughput is explained by the fundamental constraints involved in guaranteeing ACID --- the addition of cores results in more concurrent transactions accessing the same contended data for which access must be serialized in order to guarantee isolation. Thus, linear scalability for contended workloads is impossible. However, there exist flaws in many modern architectures that exacerbate their poor scalability, and result in throughput that is much worse than fundamentally required by the workload. In this paper we identify two prevalent design principles that limit the multi-core scalability of many (but not all) transactional database systems on contended workloads: the multi-purpose nature of execution threads in these systems, and the lack of advanced planning of data access. We demonstrate the deleterious results of these design principles by implementing a prototype system, Orthrus, that is motivated by the principles of separation of database component functionality and advanced planning of transactions. We find that these two principles alone result in significantly improved scalability on high-contention workloads, and an order of magnitude increase in throughput for a non-trivial subset of these contended workloads.","author":["Kun Ren","Jose M.

Although the most advanced CNN accelerators can deliver high computational throughput, the performance is highly unstable. Once changed to accommodate a new network with different parameters like layers and kernel size, the fixed hardware structure, may no longer well match the data flows. Consequently, the accelerator will fail to deliver high performance due to the underutilization of either logic resource or memory bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we proposed a novel deep learning accelerator, which offers multiple types of data-level parallelism: inter-kernel, intra-kernel and hybrid. Our design can adaptively switch among the three types of parallelism and the corresponding data tiling schemes to dynamically match different networks or even different layers of a single network. No matter how we change the hardware configurations or network types, the proposed network mapping strategy ensures the optimal performance and energy-efficiency. Compared with previous state-of-the-art NN accelerators, it is possible to achieve a speedup of 4.0x-8.3x for some layers of the well-known large scale CNNs. For the whole phase of network forward-propagation, our design achieves 28.04% PE energy saving, 90.3% on-chip memory energy saving on average.","author":["Lili Song","Ying Wang","Yinhe Han","Xin Zhao","Bosheng Liu","Xiaowei Li"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 123","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2897995"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"Krizhevsky, A., et al., ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.","order":1},{"text":"Hinton, G., et al., Deep Neural Networks for Acoustic Modeling in Speech Recognition.","order":2},{"text":"Simonyan, K., et al., Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition.","order":3},{"text":"LeCun, Y., et al., Deep learning.","order":4},{"text":"Coates, A., et al.

Attackers can utilize CRAs to hijack the control flow of programs to perform malicious actions without injecting any codes. Existing defenses against CRAs often incur high memory and performance overheads or require extending the existing processors' instruction set architectures (ISAs). To tackle these issues, we propose a hardware-based control flow integrity (CFI) that employs physical unclonable functions (PUF)-based linear encryption architecture (LEA) to protect against CRAs with negligible hardware extending and run time overheads. The proposed method can protect ret and indirect jmp instructions from return oriented programming (ROP) and jump oriented programming (JOP) without any additional software manipulations and extending ISAs. The pre-process will be conducted on codes once the executable binary is loaded into memory, and the real-time control flow verification based on LEA can be done while ret and jmp instructions are executed. Performance evaluations on benchmarks show that the proposed method only introduces 0.61% run-time overhead and 0.63% memory overhead on average.","author":["Pengfei Qiu","Yongqiang Lyu","Jiliang Zhang","Xingwei Wang","Di Zhai","Dongsheng Wang","Gang Qu"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 75","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898061"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"S.

Here we propose a fast and effective algorithm for salient object detection. First, a novel method is proposed to approximately locate the foreground object by using the convex hull from Harris corner. On this basis, we divide the saliency values of different regions into two parts and generate the corresponding cue maps (foreground and background), which are combined into a convex hull prior map. Then a new prior based on distance to the convex hull center is proposed to replace the center prior. Finally, the convex hull prior map and the convex hull center-biased map are combined to be the saliency map, which is then optimized to get the final result. Compared with eighteen existing algorithms and tested on several datasets, the present algorithm performs well in terms of precision and recall.","author":["Hengliang Zhu","Bin Sheng","Xiao Lin","Yangyang Hao","Lizhuang Ma"],"issue":["ICMR '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval","June 2016","Pages   111\u2013118","https://doi.org/10.1145/2911996.2912008"],"date":"06 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"R.

Due to the complex hardware organization of advanced computer architectures the development of optimal level 3 BLAS code is costly and time consuming. However, it is possible to develop a portable and high-performance level 3 BLAS library mainly relying on a highly optimized GEMM, the routine for the general matrix multiply and add operation. With suitable partitioning, all the other level 3 BLAS can be defined in terms of GEMM and a small amount of level 1 and level 2 computations. Our contribution is twofold. First, the model implementations in Fortran 77 of the GEMM-based level 3 BLAS are structured to reduced effectively data traffic in a memory hierarchy. Second, the GEMM-based level 3 BLAS performance evaluation benchmark is a tool for evaluating and comparing different implementations of the level 3 BLAS with the GEMM-based model implementations.","author":["Bo K\u00e5gstr\u00f6m","Per Ling","Charles van Loan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software","Volume 24","Issue 3","Sept. 1998","pp   268\u2013302","https://doi.org/10.1145/292395.292412"],"date":"01 September 1998","ref":[{"text":"AGARWAL, R., GUSTAVSON, F., AND ZUBAIR, Z. 1994a.

Generally, these data are stored in isolated data systems, separated from each other by significant political, regulatory, economic, and technological divides. These realities aside, integrating aviation data into a single, queryable, big data store could enable insights leading to major efficiency, safety, and cost advantages. In this paper, we describe an implemented system for combining heterogeneous air traffic management data using semantic integration techniques. The system transforms data from its original disparate source formats into a unified semantic representation within an ontology-based triple store. Our initial prototype stores only a small sliver of air traffic data covering one day of operations at a major airport. The paper also describes our analysis of difficulties ahead as we prepare to scale up data storage to accommodate successively larger quantities of data -- eventually covering all US commercial domestic flights over an extended multi-year timeframe. We review several approaches to mitigating scale-up related query performance concerns.","author":["Richard M. Keller","Shubha Ranjan","Mei Y. Wei","Michelle M.

In fact, although being more energy-efficient than SRAM, STT-MRAM caches at higher levels (e.g. L3) still incur a high energy consumption due to 1) high leakage in their read and write circuits and 2) high dynamic write energy in their bit-cells. To address this problem, we propose a novel normally-off STT-MRAM cache that exploits the fact that most applications access zero-byte patterns very frequently. In this architecture, writing of zero-bytes is avoided to reduce write energy. In addition, all read and write circuits are by default power gated (i.e. normally-off) to reduce leakage power. Then, dynamically at runtime, only those circuits required for the ongoing operation are activated. Our evaluations for an L3-cache of a multi-core microprocessor show that this approach reduces the energy consumption by 60% compared to state-of-the-art, while its impact on performance is negligible.","author":["Fabian Oboril","Fazal Hameed","Rajendra Bishnoi","Ali Ahari","Helia Naeimi","Mehdi Tahoori"],"issue":["ISLPED '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","August 2016","Pages   236\u2013241","https://doi.org/10.1145/2934583.2934629"],"date":"08 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"A.

This source of information has been ignored by most of the current recommender systems while it can potentially alleviate the sparsity problem and improve the quality of recommendations. In this paper, we present a deep model to learn item properties and user behaviors jointly from review text. The proposed model, named Deep Cooperative Neural Networks (DeepCoNN), consists of two parallel neural networks coupled in the last layers. One of the networks focuses on learning user behaviors exploiting reviews written by the user, and the other one learns item properties from the reviews written for the item. A shared layer is introduced on the top to couple these two networks together. The shared layer enables latent factors learned for users and items to interact with each other in a manner similar to factorization machine techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepCoNN significantly outperforms all baseline recommender systems on a variety of datasets.","author":["Lei Zheng","Vahid Noroozi","Philip S.

The FPGA clusters are created using a logical kernel description describing how a group of FPGA kernels are to be connected (independent of which FPGA these kernels are on), and an FPGA mapping file. The kernels within a cluster can be replicated with simple directives within this framework. The FPGAs can communicate to any other network device in the data center, including CPUs, GPUs, and IoT devices (such as sensors). This heterogeneous cloud manages these devices with the use of OpenStack. We observe that our infrastructure is limited due to the physical infrastructure such as the 1~Gb Ethernet connection. Our framework however can be ported to other physical infrastructures. We tested our infrastructure with a database acceleration application. This application was replicated six times across three FPGAs within our cluster and we observed a throughput increase of six times as this scaled linearly. Our framework generates the OpenStack calls needed to reserve the compute devices, creates the network connections (and retrieve MAC addresses), generate the bitstreams, programs the devices, and configure the devices with the appropriate MAC addresses, creating a ready-to-use network device that can interact with any other network device in the data center.","author":["Naif Tarafdar","Thomas Lin","Eric Fukuda","Hadi Bannazadeh","Alberto Leon-Garcia","Paul Chow"],"issue":["FPGA '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2017","Pages   237\u2013246","https://doi.org/10.1145/3020078.3021742"],"date":"22 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"Andrew Putnum et al.

A fundamental query on such data is to determine if there is a path in the graph from a given source vertex to a given target vertex, using only edges with labels in a restricted subset of the edge labels in the graph. Such label-constrained reachability (LCR) queries play an important role in graph analytics, for example, as a core fragment of the so-called regular path queries which are supported in practical graph query languages such as the W3C's SPARQL 1.1, Neo4j's Cypher, and Oracle's PGQL. Current solutions for LCR evaluation, however, do not scale to large graphs which are increasingly common in a broad range of application domains. In this paper we present the first practical solution for efficient LCR evaluation, leveraging landmark-based indexes for large graphs. We show through extensive experiments that our indexes are significantly smaller than state-of-the-art LCR indexing techniques, while supporting up to orders of magnitude faster query evaluation times. Our complete C++ codebase is available as open source for further research.","author":["Lucien D.J. Valstar","George H.L.

Using PTM, the external debugger can extract execution behaviors of applications running on an ARM processor. Recently, some researchers have been using this feature for other purposes, such as fault-tolerant computation and security monitoring. This motivated us to develop an external security monitor that can detect control hijacking attacks, of which the goal is to maliciously manipulate the control flow of victim applications at an attacker\u2019s disposal. This article focuses on detecting a special type of attack called code reuse attacks (CRA), which use a recently introduced technique that allows attackers to perform arbitrary computation without injecting their code by reusing only existing code fragments. Our external monitor is attached to the outside of the host system via the system bus and ARM CoreSight PTM, and is fed with execution traces of a victim application running on the host. As a majority of CRAs violates the normal execution behaviors of a program, our monitor constantly watches and analyzes the execution traces of the victim application and detects a symptom of attacks when the execution behaviors violate certain rules that normal applications are known to adhere. We present two different implementations for this purpose: a hardware-based solution in which all CRA detection components are implemented in hardware, and a hardware/software mixed solution that can be employed in a more resource-constrained environment where the deployment of full hardware-level CRA detection is burdensome.","author":["Yongje Lee","Jinyong Lee","Ingoo Heo","Dongil Hwang","Yunheung Paek"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 22","Issue 3","May 2017","Article No.: 52","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/3035965"],"date":"21 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Mihai Budiu, Ulfar Erlingsson, and Jay Ligatti. 2005.

Existing CGRAs support reconfigurability for operations, but not communications because of the static neighbor-to-neighbor interconnect, leading to both performance loss and increased complexity of the compiler. In this paper, we introduce HyCUBE, a novel CGRA architecture with a reconfigurable interconnect providing single-cycle communications between distant FUs, resulting in a new formulation of the application mapping problem that leads to the design of an efficient compiler. HyCUBE achieves 1.5X and 3X better performance-per-watt compared to a CGRA with standard NoC and a CGRA with neighbor-to-neighbor connectivity, respectively.","author":["Manupa Karunaratne","Aditi Kulkarni Mohite","Tulika Mitra","Li-Shiuan Peh"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 45","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062262"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Arm cortex-a5. https://goo.gl/pGytB2.","order":1},{"text":"Bouwens et al.

To apply standard machine learning techniques, these categorical predictors are always converted to a set of binary features via one-hot encoding, making the resultant feature vector highly sparse. To learn from such sparse data effectively, it is crucial to account for the interactions between features. Factorization Machines (FMs) are a popular solution for efficiently using the second-order feature interactions. However, FM models feature interactions in a linear way, which can be insufficient for capturing the non-linear and complex inherent structure of real-world data. While deep neural networks have recently been applied to learn non-linear feature interactions in industry, such as the Wide&Deep by Google and DeepCross by Microsoft, the deep structure meanwhile makes them difficult to train. In this paper, we propose a novel model Neural Factorization Machine (NFM) for prediction under sparse settings. NFM seamlessly combines the linearity of FM in modelling second-order feature interactions and the non-linearity of neural network in modelling higher-order feature interactions. Conceptually, NFM is more expressive than FM since FM can be seen as a special case of NFM without hidden layers. Empirical results on two regression tasks show that with one hidden layer only, NFM significantly outperforms FM with a 7.3% relative improvement. Compared to the recent deep learning methods Wide&Deep and DeepCross, our NFM uses a shallower structure but offers better performance, being much easier to train and tune in practice.","author":["Xiangnan He","Tat-Seng Chua"],"issue":["SIGIR '17: Proceedings of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2017","Pages   355\u2013364","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080777"],"date":"07 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"L.

However, programmers now need to deal with ensuring the atomicity of transactions on SCM-resident data and maintaining consistency between the persistent and in-memory execution orders of concurrent transactions. The problem is specially challenging when high-performance isolation mechanisms like Hardware Transaction Memory (HTM) are used for concurrency control. In this work we show how SCM-based HTM transactions can be ordered correctly using existing CPU instructions, without requiring any changes to existing processor cache hardware or HTM protocols. We describe a method that employs HTM for concurrency control and enforces atomic persistence and consistency with a novel software protocol and back-end external memory controller. In contrast, previous approaches require significant hardware changes to existing processor microarchitectures.","author":["Ellis Giles","Kshitij Doshi","Peter Varman"],"issue":["SPAA '17: Proceedings of the 29th ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures","July 2017","Pages   375\u2013378","https://doi.org/10.1145/3087556.3087589"],"date":"24 July 2017","ref":[{"text":"Hillel Avni and Trevor Brown. 2016.

These methods are attractive because they enable targeted clustering around a given seed node and are faster than traditional global graph clustering methods because their runtime does not depend on the size of the input graph. However, current local graph partitioning methods are not designed to account for the higher-order structures crucial to the network, nor can they effectively handle directed networks. Here we introduce a new class of local graph clustering methods that address these issues by incorporating higher-order network information captured by small subgraphs, also called network motifs. We develop the Motif-based Approximate Personalized PageRank (MAPPR) algorithm that finds clusters containing a seed node with minimal \\emph{motif conductance}, a generalization of the conductance metric for network motifs. We generalize existing theory to prove the fast running time (independent of the size of the graph) and obtain theoretical guarantees on the cluster quality (in terms of motif conductance). We also develop a theory of node neighborhoods for finding sets that have small motif conductance, and apply these results to the case of finding good seed nodes to use as input to the MAPPR algorithm. Experimental validation on community detection tasks in both synthetic and real-world networks, shows that our new framework MAPPR outperforms the current edge-based personalized PageRank methodology.","author":["Hao Yin","Austin R.

Considerable effort has been directed towards improving understanding of such systems in recent years, and many different proposals have been made and applications suggested. This high level of activity has not yielded a single agreed-upon standard approach to the integration of active functionality with conventional database systems, but has led to improved understanding of active behavior description languages, execution models, and architectures. This survey presents the fundamental characteristics of active database systems, describes a collection of representative systems within a common framework, considers  the consequences for implementations of certain design decisions, and discusses tools for developing active applications.","author":["Norman W.

Satisfying this bandwidth demand within an acceptable energy budget is a challenge in these extreme bandwidth memory systems. We propose a new high-bandwidth DRAM architecture, Fine-Grained DRAM (FGDRAM), which improves bandwidth by 4\u00d7 and improves the energy efficiency of DRAM by 2\u00d7 relative to the highest-bandwidth, most energy-efficient contemporary DRAM, High Bandwidth Memory (HBM2). These benefits are in large measure achieved by partitioning the DRAM die into many independent units, called grains, each of which has a local, adjacent I/O. This approach unlocks the bandwidth of all the banks in the DRAM to be used simultaneously, eliminating shared buses interconnecting various banks. Furthermore, the on-DRAM data movement energy is significantly reduced due to the much shorter wiring distance between the cell array and the local I/O. This FGDRAM architecture readily lends itself to leveraging existing techniques to reducing the effective DRAM row size in an area efficient manner, reducing wasteful row activate energy in applications with low locality. In addition, when FGDRAM is paired with a memory controller optimized to exploit the additional concurrency provided by the independent grains, it improves GPU system performance by 19% over an iso-bandwidth and iso-capacity future HBM baseline. Thus, this energy-efficient, high-bandwidth FGDRAM architecture addresses the needs of future extreme-bandwidth memory systems.","author":["Mike O'Connor","Niladrish Chatterjee","Donghyuk Lee","John Wilson","Aditya Agrawal","Stephen W.

In this work, we propose a new technique, called quantized table lookup, for approximating the meta-functions used in the core computational kernels of error-resilient applications. In contrast to prior work that directly approximates the functionality of the meta-functions, the proposed technique instead approximates the input data to the meta-functions by reducing/quantizing them to a much smaller set of values that we call quantized inputs. The small number of quantized inputs enables us to completely replace the energy-intensive arithmetic units in the meta-function with small and energy-efficient lookup tables (called quantized lookup tables or qLUT) that contain precomputed output values corresponding to the quantized inputs. The proposed approximation technique is not only highly generic, but also inherently quality-configurable and input-aware. Quality-configurability and input-awareness are achieved by modulating the size of the qLUT as well as selecting the values of the quantized inputs judiciously based on the statistics of the original input data. To evaluate the proposed technique, we have implemented the dominant meta-functions of nine error-resilient application benchmarks as quantized table lookup based hardware accelerators using 45nm technology. Experimental results demonstrate average energy savings of 46% at the application-level for minimal (<1%) loss in output quality.","author":["Arnab Raha","Vijay Raghunathan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 16","Issue 5s","October 2017","Article No.: 130","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3126531"],"date":"27 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"V.

However, simply deploying LSM-tree-based key-value stores on commercial SSDs is inefficient and induces heavy write amplification and severe garbage collection overhead under write-intensive conditions. The main cause of these critical issues comes from the triple redundant management functionalities lying in the LSM-tree, file system and flash translation layer, which block the awareness between key-value stores and flash devices. Furthermore, we observe that the performance of LSM-tree-based key-value stores is improved little by only eliminating these redundant layers, as the I/O stacks, including the cache and scheduler, are not optimized for LSM-tree\u2019s unique I/O patterns.To address the issues above, we propose FlashKV, an LSM-tree based key-value store running on open-channel SSDs. FlashKV eliminates the redundant management and semantic isolation by directly managing the raw flash devices in the application layer. With the domain knowledge of LSM-tree and the open-channel information, FlashKV employs a parallel data layout to exploit the internal parallelism of the flash device, and optimizes the compaction, caching and I/O scheduling mechanisms specifically. Evaluations show that FlashKV effectively improves system performance by 1.5\u00d7 to 4.5\u00d7 and decreases up to 50% write traffic under heavy write conditions, compared to LevelDB.","author":["Jiacheng Zhang","Youyou Lu","Jiwu Shu","Xiongjun Qin"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 16","Issue 5s","October 2017","Article No.: 139","pp   1\u201319","https://doi.org/10.1145/3126545"],"date":"27 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"Nitin Agrawal, Vijayan Prabhakaran, Ted Wobber, John D.

While distributed computation frameworks have moved beyond a simple map-reduce model, many users are still left to struggle with complex cluster management and configuration tools, even for running simple embarrassingly parallel jobs. We argue that stateless functions represent a viable platform for these users, eliminating cluster management overhead, fulfilling the promise of elasticity. Furthermore, using our prototype implementation, PyWren, we show that this model is general enough to implement a number of distributed computing models, such as BSP, efficiently. Extrapolating from recent trends in network bandwidth and the advent of disaggregated storage, we suggest that stateless functions are a natural fit for data processing in future computing environments.","author":["Eric Jonas","Qifan Pu","Shivaram Venkataraman","Ion Stoica","Benjamin Recht"],"issue":["SoCC '17: Proceedings of the 2017 Symposium on Cloud Computing","September 2017","Pages   445\u2013451","https://doi.org/10.1145/3127479.3128601"],"date":"24 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"Abadi, M., Barham, P., Chen, J., Chen, Z., Davis, A., Dean, J., Devin, M., Ghemawat, S., Irving, G., Isard, M., et al.

A representative work is to utilize deep learning for modeling complex user-item interactions. However, similar to traditional latent factor models by factorizing user-item interactions, they tend to be ineffective to capture localized information. Localized information, such as neighborhood, is important to recommender systems in complementing the user-item interaction data. Based on this consideration, we propose a novel Neighborhood-based Neural Collaborative Filtering model (NNCF). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the neighborhood information is integrated into the neural collaborative filtering methods. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for the implicit recommendation task.","author":["Ting Bai","Ji-Rong Wen","Jun Zhang","Wayne Xin Zhao"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   1979\u20131982","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133083"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"Iv\u00e1n Cantador, Peter Brusilovsky, and Tsvi Kuflik. 2011.

Most existing methods are based on the assumption that a knowledge graph is a set of separate triples, ignoring rich graph features, i.e., structural information in the graph. In this paper, we take advantages of structures in knowledge graphs, especially local structures around a triple, which we refer to as triple context. We then propose a Triple-Context-based knowledge Embedding model (TCE). For each triple, two kinds of structure information are considered as its context in the graph; one is the outgoing relations and neighboring entities of an entity and the other is relation paths between a pair of entities, both of which reflect various aspects of the triple. Triples along with their contexts are represented in a unified framework, in which way structural information in triple contexts can be embodied. The experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for link prediction.","author":["Jun Shi","Huan Gao","Guilin Qi","Zhangquan Zhou"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   2299\u20132302","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133119"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

Feature matching algorithms usually fail to identify most of the object having no texture, hence deep learning methods have been employed for better performance. Although basic shallow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) easily identifies the presence of an object within a frame, it is very difficult to localize the object location within the frame. This work primarily focuses on finding a solution for an accurate localization for robot grasping. In literature, YOLO (You Only Look Once) is found to be providing a very robust result on existing object recognition datasets. Due to high inaccuracy and presence of a huge redundant area within the bounding box, an algorithm was needed which will segment the object accurately and make the picking task easier. This was done through semantic segmentation using deep CNNs. Although time consuming, RESNET has been found to be very efficient as its post processed output helps to identify items in a significantly difficult task environment. This work has been done in light of recently held AMAZON robotics challenge 2017 where the robot successfully classified and distinguished a list of everyday items from a cluttered scenario. This work provides a performance analysis study comparing YOLO and RESNET based object recognition methods; and justifying through performance metrics (IOU - Intersection over Union) and ViG -Visual Grasping Score) that semantic segmentation (via RESNET) provides convenient results for robot vision module.","author":["Arijit Mallick","Angel P. del Pobil","Enric Cervera"],"issue":["IMCOM '18: Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication","January 2018","Article No.: 30","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/3164541.3164628"],"date":"05 January 2018","ref":[{"text":"Herbert Bay, Andreas Ess, Tinne Tuytelaars, and Luc Van Gool. 2008.

We decouple the NN applications from the target hardware by introducing a compiler that can transform an existing trained, unrestricted NN into an equivalent network that meets the given hardware's constraints. We propose multiple techniques to make the transformation adaptable to different kinds of NN chips, and reliable for restrict hardware constraints. We have built such a software tool that supports both spiking neural networks (SNNs) and traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). We have demonstrated its effectiveness with a fabricated neuromorphic chip and a processing-in-memory (PIM) design. Tests show that the inference error caused by this solution is insignificant and the transformation time is much shorter than the retraining time. Also, we have studied the parameter-sensitivity evaluations to explore the tradeoffs between network error and resource utilization for different transformation strategies, which could provide insights for co-design optimization of neuromorphic hardware and software.","author":["Yu Ji","Youhui Zhang","Wenguang Chen","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["ASPLOS '18: Proceedings of the Twenty-Third International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2018","Pages   448\u2013460","https://doi.org/10.1145/3173162.3173205"],"date":"19 March 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mart'\u0131n Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen, Craig Citro, Gregory S.

Application-specific adaptations like selective hardening of floating-point operations and instruction set subsetting would mitigate the high area and power demands of soft GPUs. This work explores the capabilities and limitations of soft General Purpose Computing on GPUs (GPGPU) for both fixed- and floating point arithmetic. For this purpose, we have developed FGPU: a configurable, scalable, and portable GPU architecture designed especially for FPGAs. FGPU is open-source and implemented entirely in RTL. It can be programmed in OpenCL and controlled through a Python API. This article introduces its hardware architecture as well as its tool flow. We evaluated the proposed GPGPU approach against multiple other solutions. In comparison to homogeneous Multi-Processor System-On-Chips (MPSoCs), we found that using a soft GPU is a Pareto-optimal solution regarding throughput per area and energy consumption. On average, FGPU has a 2.9\u00d7 better compute density and 11.2\u00d7 less energy consumption than a single MicroBlaze processor when computing in IEEE-754 floating-point format. An average speedup of about 4\u00d7 over the ARM Cortex-A9 supported with the NEON vector co-processor has been measured for fixed- or floating-point benchmarks. In addition, the biggest FGPU cores we could implement on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 System-On-Chip (SoC) can deliver similar performance to equivalent implementations with High-Level Synthesis (HLS).","author":["Muhammed Al Kadi","Benedikt Janssen","Jones Yudi","Michael Huebner"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 11","Issue 1","March 2018","Article No.: 5","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/3173548"],"date":"24 January 2018","ref":[{"text":"A.

In this context, electronic design automation (EDA) must deliver \"design-based equivalent scaling\" to help continue essential industry trajectories. A powerful lever for this will be the use of machine learning techniques, both inside and \"around\" design tools and flows. This paper reviews opportunities for machine learning with a focus on IC physical implementation. Example applications include (1) removing unnecessary design and modeling margins through correlation mechanisms, (2) achieving faster design convergence through predictors of downstream flow outcomes that comprehend both tools and design instances, and (3) corollaries such as optimizing the usage of design resources licenses and available schedule. The paper concludes with open challenges for machine learning in IC physical design.","author":["Andrew B.

Unfortunately, adoption of these architectures has been limited by their programming models. HDLs lack abstractions for productivity and are difficult to target from higher level languages. HLS tools are more productive, but offer an ad-hoc mix of software and hardware abstractions which make performance optimizations difficult.   In this work, we describe a new domain-specific language and compiler called Spatial for higher level descriptions of application accelerators. We describe Spatial's hardware-centric abstractions for both programmer productivity and design performance, and summarize the compiler passes required to support these abstractions, including pipeline scheduling, automatic memory banking, and automated design tuning driven by active machine learning. We demonstrate the language's ability to target FPGAs and CGRAs from common source code. We show that applications written in Spatial are, on average, 42% shorter and achieve a mean speedup of 2.9x over SDAccel HLS when targeting a Xilinx UltraScale+ VU9P FPGA on an Amazon EC2 F1 instance.","author":["David Koeplinger","Matthew Feldman","Raghu Prabhakar","Yaqi Zhang","Stefan Hadjis","Ruben Fiszel","Tian Zhao","Luigi Nardi","Ardavan Pedram","Christos Kozyrakis","Kunle Olukotun"],"issue":["PLDI 2018: Proceedings of the 39th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation","June 2018","Pages   296\u2013311","https://doi.org/10.1145/3192366.3192379"],"date":"11 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"2015.

Due to a massive amount of computing for CNN, CNN running on an embedded platform may not meet the performance requirement. In this paper, we propose a system-on-chip (SoC) CNN architecture synthesized by high level synthesis (HLS). HLS is an effective hardware (HW) synthesis method in terms of both development effort and performance. However, the implementation should be optimized carefully in order to achieve a satisfactory performance. Thus, we apply several optimization techniques to the proposed CNN architecture to satisfy the performance requirement. The proposed CNN architecture implemented on a Xilinx's Zynq platform has achieved 23% faster and 9.05 times better throughput per energy consumption than an implementation on an Intel i7 Core processor.","author":["Sang-Soo Park","Kyeong-Bin Park","Ki-Seok Chung"],"issue":["ICDSP 2018: Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","February 2018","Pages   161\u2013165","https://doi.org/10.1145/3193025.3193041"],"date":"25 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Szegedy, C., Liu, W., Jia, Y., Sermanet, P., Reed, S., Anguelov, D., ... & Rabinovich, A.

In this work, we present a novel paradigm to synthesize approximate circuits using Boolean matrix factorization (BMF). In our methodology the truth table of a sub-circuit of the design is approximated using BMF to a controllable approximation degree, and the results of the factorization are used to synthesize a less complex subcircuit. To scale our technique to large circuits, we devise a circuit decomposition method and a subcircuit design-space exploration technique to identify the best order for subcircuit approximations. Our method leads to a smooth trade-off between accuracy and full circuit complexity as measured by design area and power consumption. Using an industrial strength design flow, we extensively evaluate our methodology on a number of testcases, where we demonstrate that the proposed methodology can achieve up to 63% in power savings, while introducing an average relative error of 5%. We also compare our work to previous works in Boolean circuit synthesis and demonstrate significant improvements in design metrics for same accuracy targets.","author":["Soheil Hashemi","Hokchhay Tann","Sherief Reda"],"issue":["DAC '18: Proceedings of the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2018","Article No.: 55","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3196001"],"date":"24 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Jason Cong and Yuzheng Ding. 1994.

In this paper, we propose DrAcc, a novel DRAM-based processing-in-memory CNN accelerator. DrAcc achieves high inference accuracy by implementing a ternary weight network using in-DRAM bit operation with simple enhancements. The data partition and mapping strategies can be flexibly configured for the best trade-off among performance, power and energy consumption, and DRAM data reuse factors. Our experimental results show that DrAcc achieves 84.8 FPS (frame per second) at 2W and 2.9\u00d7 power efficiency improvement over the process-near-memory design.","author":["Quan Deng","Lei Jiang","Youtao Zhang","Minxuan Zhang","Jun Yang"],"issue":["DAC '18: Proceedings of the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2018","Article No.: 168","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3196029"],"date":"24 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Y.

This paper considers the file allocation problem for Cartesian product files, which can be stated as follows: Given a k-attribute Cartesian product file and an m-disk system, allocate buckets among the m disks in such a way that, for all possible partial match queries, the concurrency of disk accesses is maximized. The Disk Modulo (DM) allocation method is described first, and it is shown to be strict optimal under many conditions commonly occurring in practice, including all possible partial match queries when the number of disks is 2 or 3. It is also shown that although it has good performance, the DM allocation method is not strict optimal for all possible partial match queries when the number of disks is greater than 3. The General Disk Modulo (GDM) allocation method is then described, and a sufficient but not necessary condition for strict optimality of the GDM method for all partial match queries and any number of disks is then derived. Simulation studies comparing the DM and random allocation methods in terms of the average number of disk accesses, in response to various classes of partial match queries, show the former to be significantly more effective even when the number of disks is greater than 3, that is, even in cases where the DM method is not strict optimal. The results that have been derived formally and shown by simulation can be used for more effective design of optimal file systems for partial match queries. When considering multiple-disk systems with independent access paths, it is important to ensure that similar records are clustered into the same or similar buckets, while similar buckets should be dispersed uniformly among the disks.","author":["H.

The open SYCL standard addresses this by providing parallel processing through a single-source programming model enabling the same standard C++ code to be used on the CPU and accelerator. This allows high-level C++ abstractions and templates to be used to quickly configure device and host code to cover specific features of the platform.

One of the most promising solutions to enhance power and energy-efficiency in error tolerant applications is approximate computing that balances accuracy, area, delay, and power consumption based on the computational needs. By trading accuracy of computation, approximate computing may achieve significant improvements in speed, power, and area consumption. Adders are important arithmetic units widely used in almost every digital processing system, which contribute to significant amounts of power dissipation. With the emergence of deep learning tasks and fault tolerant big data processing in every aspect of today's computing, the demand for low-power and energy-efficient approximate adders has increased significantly. Numerous designs have been proposed in the literature that build multi-bit adders using novel approximate full adder circuits. Regrettably, relying on single-bit building blocks only limits the design space of approximate adders and prevents the designers from achieving the most significant benefits of approximate circuits. This paper presents a novel approach to designing imprecise multi-bit adders, based on four novel approximate 2 and 3-bit adder building blocks. The proposed circuits are evaluated and compared with the existing low power adders in terms of various design characteristics, such as area, delay, power, and error tolerance. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed adders achieve more than 60% reduction in power and area consumption compared to the state-of-the-art approximate adders while introducing 12-17% less error in computation.","author":["Sarvenaz Tajasob","Morteza Rezaalipour","Masoud Dehyadegari","Mahdi Nazm Bojnordi"],"issue":["ISLPED '18: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","July 2018","Article No.: 13","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3218603.3218638"],"date":"23 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"D.

It is more realistic and practical to study recommender systems with inputs of streaming data. User-generated streaming data presents unique properties such as temporally ordered, continuous and high-velocity, which poses tremendous new challenges for the once very successful recommendation techniques. Although a few temporal or sequential recommender models have recently been developed based on recurrent neural models, most of them can only be applied to the session-based recommendation scenario, due to their short-term memories and the limited capability of capturing users' long-term stable interests. In this paper, we propose a streaming recommender model based on neural memory networks with external memories to capture and store both long-term stable interests and short-term dynamic interests in a unified way. An adaptive negative sampling framework based on Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) is developed to optimize our proposed streaming recommender model, which effectively overcomes the limitations of classical negative sampling approaches and improves both effectiveness and efficiency of the model parameter inference. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two large-scale recommendation datasets, and the experimental results show the superiority of our proposed streaming recommender model in the streaming recommendation scenario.","author":["Qinyong Wang","Hongzhi Yin","Zhiting Hu","Defu Lian","Hao Wang","Zi Huang"],"issue":["KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2018","Pages   2467\u20132475","https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3220004"],"date":"19 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Trapit Bansal, David Belanger, and Andrew McCallum . 2016.

Consequently, an effective social influence prediction for each user is critical for a variety of applications such as online recommendation and advertising. Conventional social influence prediction approaches typically design various hand-crafted rules to extract user- and network-specific features. However, their effectiveness heavily relies on the knowledge of domain experts. As a result, it is usually difficult to generalize them into different domains. Inspired by the recent success of deep neural networks in a wide range of computing applications, we design an end-to-end framework, DeepInf, to learn users' latent feature representation for predicting social influence. In general, DeepInf takes a user's local network as the input to a graph neural network for learning her latent social representation. We design strategies to incorporate both network structures and user-specific features into convolutional neural and attention networks. Extensive experiments on Open Academic Graph, Twitter, Weibo, and Digg, representing different types of social and information networks, demonstrate that the proposed end-to-end model, DeepInf, significantly outperforms traditional feature engineering-based approaches, suggesting the effectiveness of representation learning for social applications.","author":["Jiezhong Qiu","Jian Tang","Hao Ma","Yuxiao Dong","Kuansan Wang","Jie Tang"],"issue":["KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2018","Pages   2110\u20132119","https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3220077"],"date":"19 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Lada A Adamic and Eytan Adar . 2003.

While it is promising to balance resource and accuracy by selecting a suitable NN configuration (e.g., the resolution and frame rate of the input video), one must also address the significant dynamics of the NN configuration's impact on video analytics accuracy. We present Chameleon, a controller that dynamically picks the best configurations for existing NN-based video analytics pipelines. The key challenge in Chameleon is that in theory, adapting configurations frequently can reduce resource consumption with little degradation in accuracy, but searching a large space of configurations periodically incurs an overwhelming resource overhead that negates the gains of adaptation. The insight behind Chameleon is that the underlying characteristics (e.g., the velocity and sizes of objects) that affect the best configuration have enough temporal and spatial correlation to allow the search cost to be amortized over time and across multiple video feeds. For example, using the video feeds of five traffic cameras, we demonstrate that compared to a baseline that picks a single optimal configuration offline, Chameleon can achieve 20-50% higher accuracy with the same amount of resources, or achieve the same accuracy with only 30--50% of the resources (a 2-3X speedup).","author":["Junchen Jiang","Ganesh Ananthanarayanan","Peter Bodik","Siddhartha Sen","Ion Stoica"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '18: Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication","August 2018","Pages   253\u2013266","https://doi.org/10.1145/3230543.3230574"],"date":"07 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"Amazon aws deeplens. https://aws.amazon.com/deeplens/.","order":1},{"text":"Artificial Intelligence Surveillance Cameras Security. https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16907238/artificial-intelligence-surveillance-cameras-security.","order":2},{"text":"AWS Lambda. https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/.","order":3},{"text":"Azure Functions. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/.","order":4},{"text":"Google clips. https://store.google.com/us/product/google_clips?hl=en-US.","order":5},{"text":"New Search Engine Revolutionizes Video Surveillance. https://i-hls.com/archives/80734.","order":6},{"text":"Tensorflow detection model zoo. https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md.","order":7},{"text":"Tensorflow-slim image classification model library. https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim.","order":8},{"text":"Yolo. https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/.","order":9},{"text":"FFmpeg. http://ffmpeg.org/, 2000--2018.","order":10},{"text":"S.

Existing methods either attempt to align the cross-domain distributions, or perform manifold subspace learning. However, there are two significant challenges: (1) degenerated feature transformation, which means that distribution alignment is often performed in the original feature space, where feature distortions are hard to overcome. On the other hand, subspace learning is not sufficient to reduce the distribution divergence. (2) unevaluated distribution alignment, which means that existing distribution alignment methods only align the marginal and conditional distributions with equal importance, while they fail to evaluate the different importance of these two distributions in real applications. In this paper, we propose a Manifold Embedded Distribution Alignment (MEDA) approach to address these challenges. MEDA learns a domain-invariant classifier in Grassmann manifold with structural risk minimization, while performing dynamic distribution alignment to quantitatively account for the relative importance of marginal and conditional distributions. To the best of our knowledge, MEDA is the first attempt to perform dynamic distribution alignment for manifold domain adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MEDA shows significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art traditional and deep methods.","author":["Jindong Wang","Wenjie Feng","Yiqiang Chen","Han Yu","Meiyu Huang","Philip S.

However, this task remains a challenging computer vision problem due to wide variations in the appearance, style, brand and layering of clothing items. We present a new database called ModaNet, a large-scale collection of images based on Paperdoll dataset. Our dataset provides 55,176 street images, fully annotated with polygons on top of the 1 million weakly annotated street images in Paperdoll. ModaNet aims to provide a technical benchmark to fairly evaluate the progress of applying the latest computer vision techniques that rely on large data for fashion understanding. The rich annotation of the dataset allows to measure the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms for object detection, semantic segmentation and polygon prediction on street fashion images in detail.","author":["Shuai Zheng","Fan Yang","M.

It is a waste of resources because repeated dynamic IR drop simulations take a very long time on very similar designs. In this work, we train a machine learning model, based on data before ECO, and predict IR drop after ECO. To increase our prediction accuracy, we propose 17 timing-aware, power-aware, and physical-aware features. Our method is scalable because the feature dimension is fixed (937), independent of design size and cell library. Also, we propose to build regional models for cell instances near IR drop violations to improves both prediction accuracy and training time. Our experiments show that our prediction correlation coefficient is 0.97 and average error is 3.0mV on a 5-million-cell industry design. Our IR drop prediction for 100K cell instances can be completed within 2 minutes. Our proposed method provides a fast IR drop prediction to speedup ECO.","author":["Yen-Chun Fang","Heng-Yi Lin","Min-Yan Su","Chien-Mo Li","Eric Jia-Wei Fang"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 17","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240823"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"K.

Most of these multipliers are highly parallelized and structurally complex. Therefore, the existing formal verification techniques fail to verify them. In recent years, formal multiplier verification based on Symbolic Computer Algebra (SCA) has shown superior results in comparison to all other existing proof techniques. However, for non-trivial architectures still a monomial explosion can be observed. A common understanding is that this is caused by redundant monomials also known as vanishing monomials. While several approaches have been proposed to overcome the explosion, the problem itself is still not fully understood. In this paper we present a new theory for the origin of vanishing monomials and how they can be handled to prevent the explosion during backward rewriting. We implement our new approach as the SCA-verifier PolyCleaner. The experimental results show the efficiency of our proposed method in verification of non-trivial million-gate multipliers.","author":["Alireza Mahzoon","Daniel Gro\u00dfe","Rolf Drechsler"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 129","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240837"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"Arithmetic module generator based on ACG. www.aoki.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/arith/.","order":1},{"text":"M.

In computer animation, so do cameras. The rotations of these objects are best described using a four coordinate system, quaternions, as is shown in this paper. Of all quaternions, those on the unit sphere are most suitable for animation, but the question of how to construct curves on spheres has not been much explored. This paper gives one answer by presenting a new kind of spline curve, created on a sphere, suitable for smoothly in-betweening (i.e. interpolating) sequences of arbitrary rotations. Both theory and experiment show that the motion generated is smooth and natural, without quirks found in earlier methods.","author":["Ken Shoemake"],"issue":["ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics","Volume 19","Issue 3","Jul. 1985","pp   245\u2013254","https://doi.org/10.1145/325165.325242"],"date":"01 July 1985","ref":[{"text":"BEZlER, P.E., Numerical Control Mathematics and Applications, John Wiley and Sons, London 0o72).","order":1},{"text":"BOEHM, WOLFGANG, \"Inserting new knots into }3- upline curves,\" Computer-Aided Design 12(4)pp. 199-201 (July 1980).","order":2},{"text":"BRADY, MICHAEL, ':Trajectory Planning,\" in Robot Motion: Planning and Control~ ed.

The advantage of natural language editing interfaces is strongest when performing semantic operations at the sub-scene level, acting on groups of objects. We learn how to manipulate these sub-scenes by analyzing existing 3D scenes. We perform edits by first parsing a natural language command from the user and transforming it into a semantic scene graph that is used to retrieve corresponding sub-scenes from the databases that match the command. We then augment this retrieved sub-scene by incorporating other objects that may be implied by the scene context. Finally, a new 3D scene is synthesized by aligning the augmented sub-scene with the user's current scene, where new objects are spliced into the environment, possibly triggering appropriate adjustments to the existing scene arrangement. A suggestive modeling interface with multiple interpretations of user commands is used to alleviate ambiguities in natural language. We conduct studies comparing our approach against both prior text-to-scene work and artist-made scenes and find that our method significantly outperforms prior work and is comparable to handmade scenes even when complex and varied natural sentences are used.","author":["Rui Ma","Akshay Gadi Patil","Matthew Fisher","Manyi Li","S\u00f6ren Pirk","Binh-Son Hua","Sai-Kit Yeung","Xin Tong","Leonidas Guibas","Hao Zhang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 37","Issue 6","November 2018","Article No.: 212","pp   1\u201316","https://doi.org/10.1145/3272127.3275035"],"date":"04 December 2018","ref":[{"text":"Alan Agresti and Brent A Coull. 1998.

The resistive random access memory (ReRAM) has shown its advantage to accelerate such tasks with high energy-efficiency. However, the ReRAM-based pipeline architecture suffers from the low utilization of computing resource, caused by the imbalanced data throughput in different pipeline stages because of the inherent down-sampling effect in CNNs and the inflexible usage of ReRAM cells. In this paper, we propose a novel ReRAM-based bidirectional pipeline architecture, named HUBPA, to accelerate the training with higher utilization of the computing resource. Two stages of the CNN training, forward and backward propagations, are scheduled in HUBPA dynamically to share the computing resource. We design an accessory control scheme for the context switch of these two tasks. We also propose an efficient algorithm to allocate computing resource for each neural network layer. Our experiment results show that, compared with state-of-the-art ReRAM pipeline architecture, HUBPA improves the performance by 1.7X and reduces the energy consumption by 1.5X, based on the current benchmarks.","author":["Houxiang Ji","Li Jiang","Tianjian Li","Naifeng Jing","Jing Ke","Xiaoyao Liang"],"issue":["ASPDAC '19: Proceedings of the 24th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2019","Pages   249\u2013254","https://doi.org/10.1145/3287624.3287674"],"date":"21 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Yu-Hsin Chen, Joel Emer, and Vivienne Sze. 2016.

However, existing methods mainly focus on networks with single-typed nodes/edges and cannot scale well to handle large networks. Many real-world networks consist of billions of nodes and edges of multiple types, and each node is associated with different attributes. In this paper, we formalize the problem of embedding learning for the Attributed Multiplex Heterogeneous Network and propose a unified framework to address this problem. The framework supports both transductive and inductive learning. We also give the theoretical analysis of the proposed framework, showing its connection with previous works and proving its better expressiveness. We conduct systematical evaluations for the proposed framework on four different genres of challenging datasets: Amazon, YouTube, Twitter, and Alibaba. Experimental results demonstrate that with the learned embeddings from the proposed framework, we can achieve statistically significant improvements (e.g., 5.99-28.23% lift by F1 scores; p<<0.01, t-test) over previous state-of-the-art methods for link prediction. The framework has also been successfully deployed on the recommendation system of a worldwide leading e-commerce company, Alibaba Group. Results of the offline A/B tests on product recommendation further confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the framework in practice.","author":["Yukuo Cen","Xu Zou","Jianwei Zhang","Hongxia Yang","Jingren Zhou","Jie Tang"],"issue":["KDD '19: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2019","Pages   1358\u20131368","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292500.3330964"],"date":"25 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"Smriti Bhagat, Graham Cormode, and S Muthukrishnan. 2011.

Time and location are the two most important contextual factors in the user\u2019s decision-making for choosing a POI to visit. In this article, we focus on the spatiotemporal context-aware POI recommendation, which considers the joint effect of time and location for POI recommendation. Inspired by the recent advances in knowledge graph embedding, we propose a spatiotemporal context-aware and translation-based recommender framework (STA) to model the third-order relationship among users, POIs, and spatiotemporal contexts for large-scale POI recommendation. Specifically, we embed both users and POIs into a \u201ctransition space\u201d where spatiotemporal contexts (i.e., a <time, location> pair) are modeled as translation vectors operating on users and POIs. We further develop a series of strategies to exploit various correlation information to address the data sparsity and cold-start issues for new spatiotemporal contexts, new users, and new POIs. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our STA framework achieves the superior performance in terms of high recommendation accuracy, robustness to data sparsity, and effectiveness in handling the cold-start problem.","author":["Tieyun Qian","Bei Liu","Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen","Hongzhi Yin"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 37","Issue 2","March 2019","Article No.: 18","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/3295499"],"date":"27 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Gediminas Adomavicius, Bamshad Mobasher, Francesco Ricci, and Alex Tuzhilin. 2011.

However, since communication is very expensive in these devices, applications will require inference \"beyond the edge\" to avoid wasting precious energy on pointless communication. We show that application performance is highly sensitive to inference accuracy. Unfortunately, accurate inference requires large amounts of computation and memory, and energy-harvesting systems are severely resource-constrained. Moreover, energy-harvesting systems operate intermittently, suffering frequent power failures that corrupt results and impede forward progress. This paper overcomes these challenges to present the first full-scale demonstration of DNN inference on an energy-harvesting system. We design and implement SONIC, an intermittence-aware software system with specialized support for DNN inference. SONIC introduces loop continuation, a new technique that dramatically reduces the cost of guaranteeing correct intermittent execution for loop-heavy code like DNN inference. To build a complete system, we further present GENESIS, a tool that automatically compresses networks to optimally balance inference accuracy and energy, and TAILS, which exploits SIMD hardware available in some microcontrollers to improve energy efficiency. Both SONIC & TAILS guarantee correct intermittent execution without any hand-tuning or performance loss across different power systems. Across three neural networks on a commercially available microcontroller, SONIC & TAILS reduce inference energy by 6.9\u00d7 and 12.2\u00d7, respectively, over the state-of-the-art.","author":["Graham Gobieski","Brandon Lucia","Nathan Beckmann"],"issue":["ASPLOS '19: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","April 2019","Pages   199\u2013213","https://doi.org/10.1145/3297858.3304011"],"date":"04 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"Jorge Albericio, Patrick Judd, Tayler Hetherington, Tor Aamodt, Natalie Enright Jerger, and Andreas Moshovos. 2016.

Our small modification has a powerful impact on RowHammer's ability to bypass memory protection mechanisms and achieve a successful attack. Specifically, we identify two types of DRAM cells: true-cells and anti-cells. In a true-cell, a leaking capacitor will induce a '1'->'0' error, while in anti-cells, errors flow from '0'->'1'. We then create DRAM cell-type-aware memory allocation which enables a \"monotonicity property\" for a given data object. The monotonicity property is able to counter RowHammer attacks (and, to a broader extent, other memory attacks) by allocating only one type of cells for an object, thereby restricting error direction. We apply the monotonicity property to pointers in page tables by placing all page tables in true-cells that are above a \"low water mark\". We show that this approach successfully defends against page-table-based privilege escalation RowHammer attacks. Using established RowHammer-induced bit-flip error statistics, we provide proofs of the soundness and completeness of our technique and show that with our technique only one out of 2.04x10 5  systems is vulnerable to the attack, and the expected attack time on the vulnerable system is 231 days. We also provide application performance results from prototypes implemented through modifications to Linux kernels. Our cross-layer approach avoids undesirable energy cost, hardware changes, performance overhead, and high software complexity associated with prior countermeasures.","author":["Xin-Chuan Wu","Timothy Sherwood","Frederic T.

The optimisation problem is posed to minimise travelling time and jerk subject to velocity, acceleration and jerk constraints. The design variables include joint position and velocity at intermediate positions (passing position), and moving time from the initial position to the intermediate position and from the intermediate position to the final position. Several MOMHs are used to solve the trajectory multiobjective optimisation problem of robot manipulators while their performances are investigated. Based on this study, the best MOMH for multiobjective time-jerk robot trajectory planning is found while the results obtained from such a method are set as the baseline for further study of robot trajectory planning multiobjective optimisation.","author":["Nantiwat Pholdee","Sujin Bureerat"],"issue":["ICNCC 2018: Proceedings of the 2018 VII International Conference on Network, Communication and Computing","December 2018","Pages   352\u2013356","https://doi.org/10.1145/3301326.3301356"],"date":"14 December 2018","ref":[{"text":"Tangpattanakul, P., and Artrit, P. 2009.

However, due to the tightly coupled crossbar structure, exploiting sparsity for ReRAM-based NN accelerator is a less explored area. Existing architectural studies on ReRAM-based NN accelerators assume that an entire crossbar array can be activated in a single cycle. However, due to inference accuracy considerations, matrix-vector computation must be conducted in a smaller granularity in practice, called Operation Unit (OU). An OU-based architecture creates a new opportunity to exploit DNN sparsity. In this paper, we propose the first practical Sparse ReRAM Engine that exploits both weight and activation sparsity. Our evaluation shows that the proposed method is effective in eliminating ineffectual computation, and delivers significant performance improvement and energy savings.","author":["Tzu-Hsien Yang","Hsiang-Yun Cheng","Chia-Lin Yang","I-Ching Tseng","Han-Wen Hu","Hung-Sheng Chang","Hsiang-Pang Li"],"issue":["ISCA '19: Proceedings of the 46th International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2019","Pages   236\u2013249","https://doi.org/10.1145/3307650.3322271"],"date":"22 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"J.

In general, the attributes are not isolated but connected with each other, which forms a knowledge graph (KG). In this paper, we propose Knowledge Graph Convolutional Networks (KGCN), an end-to-end framework that captures inter-item relatedness effectively by mining their associated attributes on the KG. To automatically discover both high-order structure information and semantic information of the KG, we sample from the neighbors for each entity in the KG as their receptive field, then combine neighborhood information with bias when calculating the representation of a given entity. The receptive field can be extended to multiple hops away to model high-order proximity information and capture users' potential long-distance interests. Moreover, we implement the proposed KGCN in a minibatch fashion, which enables our model to operate on large datasets and KGs. We apply the proposed model to three datasets about movie, book, and music recommendation, and experiment results demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong recommender baselines.","author":["Hongwei Wang","Miao Zhao","Xing Xie","Wenjie Li","Minyi Guo"],"issue":["WWW '19: The World Wide Web Conference","May 2019","Pages   3307\u20133313","https://doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313417"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Alberto Garcia-Duran, Jason Weston, and Oksana Yakhnenko. 2013.

However, existing methods largely assume that a KG is complete and simply transfer the \u201dknowledge\u201d in KG at the shallow level of entity raw data or embeddings. This may lead to suboptimal performance, since a practical KG can hardly be complete, and it is common that a KG has missing facts, relations, and entities. Thus, we argue that it is crucial to consider the incomplete nature of KG when incorporating it into recommender system.  In this paper, we jointly learn the model of recommendation and knowledge graph completion. Distinct from previous KG-based recommendation methods, we transfer the relation information in KG, so as to understand the reasons that a user likes an item. As an example, if a user has watched several movies directed by (relation) the same person (entity), we can infer that the director relation plays a critical role when the user makes the decision, thus help to understand the user's preference at a finer granularity.  Technically, we contribute a new translation-based recommendation model, which specially accounts for various preferences in translating a user to an item, and then jointly train it with a KG completion model by combining several transfer schemes. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KG-based recommendation methods. Further analysis verifies the positive effect of joint training on both tasks of recommendation and KG completion, and the advantage of our model in understanding user preference.

Traditional solutions for stock prediction are based on time-series models. With the recent success of deep neural networks in modeling sequential data, deep learning has become a promising choice for stock prediction.However, most existing deep learning solutions are not optimized toward the target of investment, i.e., selecting the best stock with the highest expected revenue. Specifically, they typically formulate stock prediction as a classification (to predict stock trends) or a regression problem (to predict stock prices). More importantly, they largely treat the stocks as independent of each other. The valuable signal in the rich relations between stocks (or companies), such as two stocks are in the same sector and two companies have a supplier-customer relation, is not considered.In this work, we contribute a new deep learning solution, named Relational Stock Ranking (RSR), for stock prediction. Our RSR method advances existing solutions in two major aspects: (1) tailoring the deep learning models for stock ranking, and (2) capturing the stock relations in a time-sensitive manner. The key novelty of our work is the proposal of a new component in neural network modeling, named Temporal Graph Convolution, which jointly models the temporal evolution and relation network of stocks. To validate our method, we perform back-testing on the historical data of two stock markets, NYSE and NASDAQ. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our RSR method. It outperforms state-of-the-art stock prediction solutions achieving an average return ratio of 98% and 71% on NYSE and NASDAQ, respectively.","author":["Fuli Feng","Xiangnan He","Xiang Wang","Cheng Luo","Yiqun Liu","Tat-Seng Chua"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 37","Issue 2","March 2019","Article No.: 27","pp   1\u201330","https://doi.org/10.1145/3309547"],"date":"05 March 2019","ref":[{"text":"Ayodele Ariyo Adebiyi, Aderemi Oluyinka Adewumi, and Charles Korede Ayo. 2014.

In the literature, many libraries of elementary approximate circuits have already been proposed to simplify the design process of approximate accelerators. Because these libraries contain from tens to thousands of approximate implementations for a single arithmetic operation it is intractable to find an optimal combination of approximate circuits in the library even for an application consisting of a few operations. An open problem is \"how to effectively combine circuits from these libraries to construct complex approximate accelerators\". This paper proposes a novel methodology for searching, selecting and combining the most suitable approximate circuits from a set of available libraries to generate an approximate accelerator for a given application. To enable fast design space generation and exploration, the methodology utilizes machine learning techniques to create computational models estimating the overall quality of processing and hardware cost without performing full synthesis at the accelerator level. Using the methodology, we construct hundreds of approximate accelerators (for a Sobel edge detector) showing different but relevant tradeoffs between the quality of processing and hardware cost and identify a corresponding Pareto-frontier. Furthermore, when searching for approximate implementations of a generic Gaussian filter consisting of 17 arithmetic operations, the proposed approach allows us to identify approximately 103 highly relevant implementations from 1023 possible solutions in a few hours, while the exhaustive search would take four months on a high-end processor.","author":["Vojtech Mrazek","Muhammad Abdullah Hanif","Zdenek Vasicek","Lukas Sekanina","Muhammad Shafique"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 123","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317781"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"S.

Knowledge of the human visual system can help establish methods for objective quality assessment of in-the-wild videos. In this work, we show two eminent effects of the human visual system, namely, content-dependency and temporal-memory effects, could be used for this purpose. We propose an objective no-reference video quality assessment method by integrating both effects into a deep neural network. For content-dependency, we extract features from a pre-trained image classification neural network for its inherent content-aware property. For temporal-memory effects, long-term dependencies, especially the temporal hysteresis, are integrated into the network with a gated recurrent unit and a subjectively-inspired temporal pooling layer. To validate the performance of our method, experiments are conducted on three publicly available in-the-wild video quality assessment databases: KoNViD-1k, CVD2014, and LIVE-Qualcomm, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms five state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, specifically, 12.39%, 15.71%, 15.45%, and 18.09% overall performance improvements over the second-best method VBLIINDS, in terms of SROCC, KROCC, PLCC and RMSE, respectively. Moreover, the ablation study verifies the crucial role of both the content-aware features and the modeling of temporal-memory effects. The PyTorch implementation of our method is released at https://github.com/lidq92/VSFA.","author":["Dingquan Li","Tingting Jiang","Ming Jiang"],"issue":["MM '19: Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Multimedia","October 2019","Pages   2351\u20132359","https://doi.org/10.1145/3343031.3351028"],"date":"15 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Christos George Bampis, Zhi Li, Anush Krishna Moorthy, Ioannis Katsavounidis, Anne Aaron, and Alan Conrad Bovik. 2017.

However, the great success comes at the cost of excessive computation due to the over-provisioned parameter space. To improve the computation efficiency of neural networks, many pruning techniques have been proposed to reduce the amount of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, which results in high sparsity in the networks. Unfortunately, the sparse neural networks often run slower than their dense counterparts on modern GPUs due to their poor device utilization rate. In particular, as the sophisticated hardware primitives (e.g., Tensor Core) have been deployed to boost the performance of dense matrix multiplication by an order of magnitude, the performance of sparse neural networks lags behind significantly. In this work, we propose an algorithm and hardware co-design methodology to accelerate the sparse neural networks. A novel pruning algorithm is devised to improve the workload balance and reduce the decoding overhead of the sparse neural networks. Meanwhile, new instructions and micro-architecture optimization are proposed in Tensor Core to adapt to the structurally sparse neural networks. Our experimental results show that the pruning algorithm can achieve 63% performance gain with model accuracy sustained. Furthermore, the hardware optimization gives an additional 58% performance gain with negligible area overhead.","author":["Maohua Zhu","Tao Zhang","Zhenyu Gu","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["MICRO '52: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","October 2019","Pages   359\u2013371","https://doi.org/10.1145/3352460.3358269"],"date":"12 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"[n. d.].

Several metrics have been proposed for describing mulitilinguality at the level of a whole knowledge graph. Albeit enabling the understanding of the ecosystem of knowledge graphs in terms of the utilized languages, they are unable to capture a fine-grained description of the languages in which the different entities and properties of the knowledge graph are represented. This lack of representation prevents the comparison of existing knowledge graphs in order to decide which are the most appropriate for a multilingual application. In this work, we approach the problem of ranking knowledge graphs based on their language features and propose LINGVO, a framework able to capture mulitilinguality at different levels of granularity. Grounded in knowledge graph descriptions, LINGVO is, additionally, able to solve the problem of ranking knowledge graphs according to a degree of mulitilinguality of the represented entities. We have empirically studied the effectiveness of LINGVO in a benchmark of queries to be executed against existing knowledge graphs. The observed results provide evidence that LINGVO captures the mulitilinguality of the studied knowledge graphs similarly than a crowd-sourced gold standard.","author":["Lucie-Aim\u00e9e Kaffee","Kemele M.

The majority of existing work overwhelmingly learn node embeddings in the context of static, plain or attributed, homogeneous graphs. However, many real-world applications frequently involve bipartite graphs with temporal and attributed interaction edges, named temporal interaction graphs. The temporal interactions usually imply different facets of interest and might even evolve over time, thus putting forward huge challenges in learning effective node representations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named TigeCMN to learn node representations from a sequence of temporal interactions. Specifically, we devise two coupled memory networks to store and update node embeddings in external matrices explicitly and dynamically, which forms deep matrix representations and could enhance the expressiveness of the node embeddings. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets and the experimental results empirically demonstrate that TigeCMN can outperform the state-of-the-arts with different gains.","author":["Zhen Zhang","Jiajun Bu","Martin Ester","Jianfeng Zhang","Chengwei Yao","Zhao Li","Can Wang"],"issue":["WWW '20: Proceedings of The Web Conference 2020","April 2020","Pages   3049\u20133055","https://doi.org/10.1145/3366423.3380076"],"date":"20 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"Smriti Bhagat, Graham Cormode, and S Muthukrishnan. 2011.

Heterogeneous graph embedding is to embed rich structural and semantic information of a heterogeneous graph into low-dimensional node representations. Existing models usually define multiple metapaths in a heterogeneous graph to capture the composite relations and guide neighbor selection. However, these models either omit node content features, discard intermediate nodes along the metapath, or only consider one metapath. To address these three limitations, we propose a new model named Metapath Aggregated Graph Neural Network (MAGNN) to boost the final performance. Specifically, MAGNN employs three major components, i.e., the node content transformation to encapsulate input node attributes, the intra-metapath aggregation to incorporate intermediate semantic nodes, and the inter-metapath aggregation to combine messages from multiple metapaths. Extensive experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets for node classification, node clustering, and link prediction show that MAGNN achieves more accurate prediction results than state-of-the-art baselines.","author":["Xinyu Fu","Jiani Zhang","Ziqiao Meng","Irwin King"],"issue":["WWW '20: Proceedings of The Web Conference 2020","April 2020","Pages   2331\u20132341","https://doi.org/10.1145/3366423.3380297"],"date":"20 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"James Atwood and Don Towsley. 2016.

However, major deep learning frameworks currently only provide APIs to evaluate a model's accuracy. In order to comprehensively assess a deep learning model, framework users and researchers often need to implement new metrics by themselves, which is a tedious job. What is worse, due to the large number of hyper-parameters and inadequate documentation, evaluation results of some deep learning models are hard to reproduce, especially when the models and metrics are both new. To ease the model evaluation in deep learning systems, we have developed EvalDNN, a user-friendly and extensible toolbox supporting multiple frameworks and metrics with a set of carefully designed APIs. Using EvalDNN, evaluation of a pre-trained model with respect to different metrics can be done with a few lines of code. We have evaluated EvalDNN on 79 models from TensorFlow, Keras, GluonCV, and PyTorch. As a result of our effort made to reproduce the evaluation results of existing work, we release a performance benchmark of popular models, which can be a useful reference to facilitate future research. The tool and benchmark are available at https://github.com/yqtianust/EvalDNN and https://yqtianust.github.io/EvalDNN-benchmark/, respectively.

Significant research is being done on developing systems and algorithms improving accuracy, performance, area, and power consumption for related problems. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown to give outstanding accuracies for problems such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. While CNNs are pioneering the development of high accuracy systems, their excessive computational complexity presents a barrier for a more permeated deployment. Although Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), due to their massively parallel architecture, have shown to give performance orders of magnitude better than general purpose processors, the former are limited by their high power consumption and generality. Consequently, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are being explored to implement CNN architectures, as they also provide massively parallel logic resources but with a relatively lower power consumption than GPUs. In this article, we present FFConv, an efficient FPGA-based fast convolutional layer accelerator for CNNs. We design a pipelined, high-throughput convolution engine based on the Winograd minimal filtering (also called Fast Convolution) algorithms for computing the convolutional layers of three popular CNN architectures: VGG16, Alexnet, and Shufflenet. We implement our accelerator on a Virtex-7 FPGA platform where we exploit the computational parallelization to the maximum while exploring optimizations aimed at improving performance. The resultant design loses only 0.43%, 0.47%, and 0.61% Top-1 classification accuracy for VGG16, Alexnet, and Shufflenet-v1, respectively, while significantly improving throughput, resource, and power efficiency compared to previous state-of-the-art designs.","author":["Afzal Ahmad","Muhammad Adeel Pasha"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 19","Issue 2","March 2020","Article No.: 15","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/3380548"],"date":"11 March 2020","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, the non-volatile feature of the ReRAM introduces some security vulnerabilities. The weight parameters of a well-trained NN model deployed on the ReRAM based accelerator are persisted even after the chip is powered off. The adversaries who have the physical access to the accelerator can hence launch the model stealing attack and extract these weights by some micro-probing methods. Run time encryption of the weights is intuitive to protect the NN model but degrades execution performance and device endurance largely. While obfuscation of the weight rows needs to pay the tremendous hardware area overhead in order to achieve the high security. In view of above mentioned problems, in this paper we propose a low cost weight obfuscation scheme to secure the NN model deployed on the ReRAM based accelerators from the model stealing attack. We partition the crossbar into many virtual operation units (VOUs) and perform full permutation on the weights of the VOUs along the column dimension. Without the keys, the attacker cannot perform the correct NN computations even if they have obtained the obfuscated model. Compared with the weight rows based obfuscation, our scheme can achieve the same level of security with less an order of magnitude in the hardware area and power overheads.","author":["Yuhang Wang","Song Jin","Tao Li"],"issue":["ASPDAC '21: Proceedings of the 26th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2021","Pages   499\u2013504","https://doi.org/10.1145/3394885.3431599"],"date":"18 January 2021","ref":[{"text":"M Prezioso, F Merrikh-Bayat, B.

Technologies such as Wi-Fi, wireless sensor, and infrared have been used to localize and track people living in care homes and office buildings. However, the presence of multiple residents introduces further challenges, such as the ambiguity in sensor measurements and target identity, to localization and tracking. In this article, we survey the latest development of device-free indoor localization and tracking in the multi-resident environment. We first present the fundamentals of device-free localization and tracking. Then, we discuss and compare the technologies used in device-free indoor localization and tracking. After discussing the steps involved in multi-resident localization and tracking including target detection, target counting, target identification, localization, and tracking, the techniques related to each step are classified and discussed in detail along with the performance metrics. Finally, we identify the research gap and point out future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the most comprehensive work that covers a wide spectrum of the research area of device-free indoor localization and tracking.","author":["Kan Ngamakeur","Sira Yongchareon","Jian Yu","Saeed Ur Rehman"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 53","Issue 4","July 2021","Article No.: 71","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/3396302"],"date":"11 July 2020","ref":[{"text":"A.

Numerous hardware accelerators have been developed to speed up the performance of neural network applications and reduce power consumption; however, most focus on data centers and full-fledged systems. Acceleration in ultra-low-power systems has been only partially addressed. In this article, we present multiPULPly, an accelerator that integrates memristive technologies within standard low-power CMOS technology, to accelerate multiplication in neural network inference on ultra-low-power systems. This accelerator was designated for PULP, an open-source microcontroller system that uses low-power RISC-V processors. Memristors were integrated into the accelerator to enable power consumption only when the memory is active, to continue the task with no context-restoring overhead, and to enable highly parallel analog multiplication. To reduce the energy consumption, we propose novel dataflows that handle common multiplication scenarios and are tailored for our architecture. The accelerator was tested on FPGA and achieved a peak energy efficiency of 19.5 TOPS/W, outperforming state-of-the-art accelerators by 1.5\u00d7 to 4.5\u00d7.","author":["Adi Eliahu","Ronny Ronen","Pierre-Emmanuel Gaillardon","Shahar Kvatinsky"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 17","Issue 2","April 2021","Article No.: 24","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/3432815"],"date":"15 April 2021","ref":[{"text":"GAP9. 2021.

This article investigates such monolithically integrated CPU\u2013main memory chips. We exploit non-volatile memories employing 3D crosspoint subarrays, such as resistive RAM (ReRAM), and integrate them over the CPU\u2019s last-level cache (LLC). The regular structure of cache arrays enables co-design of the LLC and ReRAM main memory for area efficiency. We also develop a streamlined LLC/main memory interface that employs a single shared internal interconnect for both the cache and main memory arrays, and uses a unified controller to service both LLC and main memory requests.We apply our monolithic design ideas to a many-core CPU by integrating 3D ReRAM over each core\u2019s LLC slice. We find that co-design of the LLC and ReRAM saves 27% of the total LLC\u2013main memory area at the expense of slight increases in delay and energy. The streamlined LLC/main memory interface saves an additional 12% in area. Our simulation results show monolithic integration of CPU and main memory improves performance by 5.3\u00d7 and 1.7\u00d7 over HBM2 DRAM for several graph and streaming kernels, respectively. It also reduces the memory system\u2019s energy by 6.0\u00d7 and 1.7\u00d7, respectively. Moreover, we show that the area savings of co-design permits the CPU to have 23% more cores and main memory, and that streamlining the LLC/main memory interface incurs a small 4% performance penalty.","author":["Candace Walden","Devesh Singh","Meenatchi Jagasivamani","Shang Li","Luyi Kang","Mehdi Asnaashari","Sylvain Dubois","Bruce Jacob","Donald Yeung"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 18","Issue 4","December 2021","Article No.: 48","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/3462632"],"date":"16 July 2021","ref":[{"text":"Neha Agarwal and Thomas F.

This paper studies the hardware implementation of a form of execute-only memory (XOM) that allows instructions stored in memory to be executed but not otherwise manipulated. To support XOM code we use a machine that supports internal compartments---a process in one compartment cannot read data from another compartment. All data that leaves the machine is encrypted, since we assume external memory is not secure. The design of this machine poses some interesting trade-offs between security, efficiency, and flexibility. We explore some of the potential security issues as one pushes the machine to become more efficient and flexible. Although security carries a performance penalty, our analysis indicates that it is possible to create a normal multi-tasking machine where nearly all applications can be run in XOM mode. While a virtual XOM machine is possible, the underlying hardware needs to support a unique private key, private memory, and traps on cache misses. For efficient operation, hardware assist to provide fast symmetric ciphers is also required.","author":["David Lie","Chandramohan Thekkath","Mark Mitchell","Patrick Lincoln","Dan Boneh","John Mitchell","Mark Horowitz"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 35","Issue 11","Nov. 2000","pp   168\u2013177","https://doi.org/10.1145/356989.357005"],"date":"01 November 2000","ref":[{"text":"Business Software Alliance, 2000. h t t p ://~m , bsa. org.]]","order":1},{"text":"The Trusted Computing Platform Allicance, 2000. h t t p ://~, trustedpc, com.]]","order":2},{"text":"It.

The information gained by starting the match at the end of the pattern often allows the algorithm to proceed in large jumps through the text being searched. Thus the algorithm has the unusual property that, in most cases, not all of the first i characters of string are inspected. The number of characters actually inspected (on the average) decreases as a function of the length of pat. For a random English pattern of length 5, the algorithm will typically inspect i/4 characters of string before finding a match at i. Furthermore, the algorithm has been implemented so that (on the average) fewer than i + patlen machine instructions are executed. These conclusions are supported with empirical evidence and a theoretical analysis of the average behavior of the algorithm. The worst case behavior of the algorithm is linear in i + patlen, assuming the availability of array space for tables linear in patlen plus the size of the alphabet.","author":["Robert S. Boyer","J.

Although straightforward hardware and time redundancy based concurrent error detection (CED) architectures can be used to thwart such attacks, they entail significant overhead (either area or performance). In this paper we investigate systematic approaches to low-cost, low-latency CED for symmetric encryption algorithms based on the inverse relationship that exists between encryption and decryption at algorithm level, round level and operation level and develop CED architectures that explore the trade-off between area overhead, performance penalty and error detection latency.

Oscillations in geophysical systems, for example, are sometimes characterized by principal oscillation patterns, eigenmodes of estimated autoregressive (AR) models of first order. This paper describes the estimation of eigenmodes of AR models of arbitrary order. AR processes of any order can be decomposed into eigenmodes with characteristic oscillation periods, damping times, and excitations. Estimated eigenmodes and confidence intervals for the eigenmodes and their oscillation periods and damping times can be computed from estimated models parameters. As a computationally efficient method of estimating the parameters of AR models  from high-dimensional data, a stepwise least squares algorithm is proposed. This algorithm computes models of successively decreasing order. Numerical simulations indicate that, with the least squares algorithm, the AR model coefficients and the eigenmodes derived from the coefficients and eigenmodes are rough approximations of the confidence intervals inferred from the simulaitons.","author":["Arnold Neumaier","Tapio Schneider"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software","Volume 27","Issue 1","March 2001","pp   27\u201357","https://doi.org/10.1145/382043.382304"],"date":"01 March 2001","ref":[{"text":"AKAIKE, H. 1971.

A core problem in language model estimation is smoothing, which adjusts the maximum likelihood estimator so as to correct the inaccuracy due to data sparseness.

The resulting input/output communication (or I/O) between fast internal memory and slower external memory (such as disks) can be a major performance bottleneck. In this article we survey the state of the art in the design and analysis of external memory (or EM) algorithms and data structures, where the goal is to exploit locality in order to reduce the I/O costs. We consider a variety of EM paradigms for solving batched and online problems efficiently in external memory. For the batched problem of sorting and related problems such as permuting and fast Fourier transform, the key paradigms include distribution and merging. The paradigm of disk striping offers an elegant way to use multiple disks in parallel. For sorting, however,  disk striping can be nonoptimal with respect to I/O, so to gain further improvements we discuss distribution and merging techniques for using the disks independently. We also consider useful techniques for batched EM problems involving matrices (such as matrix multiplication and transposition), geometric data (such as finding intersections and constructing convex hulls), and graphs (such as list ranking, connected components, topological sorting, and shortest paths). In the online domain, canonical EM applications include dictionary lookup and range searching. The two important classes of indexed data structures are based upon extendible hashing and B-trees. The paradigms of filtering and bootstrapping provide a convenient means in online data structures to make effective use of the data accessed from disk. We also reexamine some of the above EM problems in slightly different settings, such as when the data items are moving, when the data items are variable-length (e.g., text strings), or when the allocated amount of internal memory can change dynamically. Programming tools and environments are available for simplifying the EM programming task. During the course of the survey, we report on some experiments in the domain of spatial databases using the TPIE system (transparent parallel I/O programming environment). The newly developed EM algorithms and data structures that incorporate the paradigms we discuss are significantly faster than methods currently used in practice.","author":["Jeffrey Scott Vitter"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 33","Issue 2","June 2001","pp   209\u2013271","https://doi.org/10.1145/384192.384193"],"date":"01 June 2001","ref":[{"text":"ABEL, D.

This form of speculation belongs to a class of aggressive code motion techniques that enable movement of operations through and beyond conditionals and loops. We show that, when used during scheduling in a high-level synthesis system, this particular code motion has positive effect on latency and controller complexity, e.g., up to 35% reduction in longest path cycles and the number of states in the finite state machine (FSM) of the controller. However, it is not enough to determine complexity by the number of states in the control FSM. Indeed, the greater resource sharing opportunities afforded by speculation actually increase the total control cost (in terms of multiplexing and steering logic). This also adversely affects the clock period. We examine the effect of the various code motions on the total synthesis cost and propose techniques to reduce costs to make the transformations useful in real-life behavioral design descriptions. Using the MPEG-1 and ADPCM benchmarks, we show total reductions in schedule lengths of up to 50% while keeping control and area costs down.","author":["Sumit Gupta","Nick Savoiu","Nikil Dutt","Rajesh Gupta","Alex Nicolau"],"issue":["ISSS '01: Proceedings of the 14th international symposium on Systems synthesis","September 2001","Pages   171\u2013176","https://doi.org/10.1145/500001.500040"],"date":"30 September 2001","ref":[{"text":"D.

This lack of support substantially increases the complexity and the burden on designers in the mapping of applications to FPGA-based computing engines. In this paper we address the problem of external memory interfacing and aggressive scheduling of memory operations by proposing a decoupled architecture with two components - one component captures the specific target architecture timing while the other component uses application specific memory access pattern information. Our results support the claim that it is possible to exploit application specific information and integrate that knowledge into custom schedulers that mix pipelined and non-pipelined access modes aimed at reducing the overhead associated with external memory accesses. The results also reveal that the additional design complexity of the scheduler, and its impact in the overall design is minimal.","author":["Joonseok Park","Pedro C.

This patch-based sampling algorithm is fast and it makes high-quality texture synthesis a real-time process. For generating textures of the same size and comparable quality, patch-based sampling is orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms. The patch-based sampling algorithm works well for a wide variety of textures ranging from regular to stochastic. By sampling patches according to a nonparametric estimation of the local conditional MRF density function, we avoid mismatching features across patch boundaries. We also experimented with documented cases for which pixel-based nonparametric sampling algorithms cease to be effective but our algorithm continues to work well.","author":["Lin Liang","Ce Liu","Ying-Qing Xu","Baining Guo","Heung-Yeung Shum"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 20","Issue 3","July 2001","pp   127\u2013150","https://doi.org/10.1145/501786.501787"],"date":"01 July 2001","ref":[{"text":"ARYA, S., MOUNT, D.

We show that nontrivial quantum codes exist that have no classical counterparts. On the other hand, we show that quantum encoding cannot save more than a logarithmic additive factor over the best classical encoding. The proof is based on an entropy coalescence principle that is obtained by viewing Holevo's theorem from a new perspective.In the existing implementations of quantum computing, qubits are a very expensive resource. Moreover, it is difficult to reinitialize existing bits during the computation. In particular, reinitialization is impossible in NMR quantum computing, which is perhaps the most advanced implementation of quantum computing at the moment. This motivates the study of quantum computation with restricted memory and no reinitialization, that is, of quantum finite automata. It was known that there are languages that are recognized by quantum finite automata with sizes exponentially smaller than those of corresponding classical automata. Here, we apply our technique to show the surprising result that there are languages for which quantum finite automata take exponentially more states than those of corresponding classical automata.","author":["Andris Ambainis","Ashwin Nayak","Amnon Ta-Shma","Umesh Vazirani"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 49","Issue 4","July 2002","pp   496\u2013511","https://doi.org/10.1145/581771.581773"],"date":"01 July 2002","ref":[{"text":"Aharonov, D., Kitaev, A., and Nisan, N. 1998.

An active line of research in this area is concerned with classification when one has information about pairwise relationships among the objects to be classified; this issue is one of the principal motivations for the framework of Markov random fields, and it arises in areas such as image processing, biometry, and document analysis. In its most basic form, this style of analysis seeks to find a classification that optimizes a combinatorial function consisting of assignment costs---based on the individual choice of label we make for each object---and separation costs---based on the pair of choices we make for two \"related\" objects.We formulate a general classification problem of this type, the metric labeling problem; we show that it contains as special cases a number of standard classification frameworks, including several arising from the theory of Markov random fields. From the perspective of combinatorial optimization, our problem can be viewed as a substantial generalization of the multiway cut problem, and equivalent to a type of uncapacitated quadratic assignment problem.We provide the first nontrivial polynomial-time approximation algorithms for a general family of classification problems of this type. Our main result is an O(log k log log k)-approximation algorithm for the metric labeling problem, with respect to an arbitrary metric on a set of k labels, and an arbitrary weighted graph of relationships on a set of objects. For the special case in which the labels are endowed with the uniform metric---all distances are the same---our methods provide a 2-approximation algorithm.","author":["Jon Kleinberg","\u00c9va Tardos"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 49","Issue 5","September 2002","pp   616\u2013639","https://doi.org/10.1145/585265.585268"],"date":"01 September 2002","ref":[{"text":"bartal Y. 1996.

They appear naturally in different condition estimation problems for matrix equations and various eigenspace computations, and as reduced systems in standard algorithms. Building on our successful recursive approach applied to one-sided matrix equations (Part I), we now present novel recursive blocked algorithms for two-sided matrix equations, which include matrix product terms such as AXBT. Examples are the discrete-time standard and generalized Sylvester and Lyapunov equations. The means for achieving high performance is the recursive variable blocking, which has the potential of matching the memory hierarchies of today's high-performance computing systems, and level-3 computations which mainly are performed as GEMM operations. Different implementation issues are discussed, including the design of efficient new algorithms for two-sided matrix products. We present uniprocessor and SMP parallel performance results of recursive blocked algorithms and routines in the state-of-the-art SLICOT library. Although our recursive algorithms with optimized kernels for the two-sided matrix equations perform more operations, the performance improvements are remarkable, including 10-fold speedups or more, compared to standard algorithms.","author":["Isak Jonsson","Bo K\u00e5gstr\u00f6m"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software","Volume 28","Issue 4","December 2002","pp   416\u2013435","https://doi.org/10.1145/592843.592846"],"date":"01 December 2002","ref":[{"text":"Anderson, E., Bai, Z., Demmel, J., Dongarra, J., Du Croz, J., Greenbaum, A., Hammarling, S., McKenney, A., Ostrouchov, S., and Sorensen, D. 1999.

Breakpoints are usually thought of as a feature of an interactive debugger, in which case the breakpoints need not be particularly fast. In our environment breakpoints are often used for non-interactive information gathering; for example, procedure call count and statement execution count profiling [Swinehart, et al.]. When used non-interactively, breakpoints should be as fast as possible, so as to perturb the execution of the program as little as possible. Even in interactive debuggers, a conditional breakpoint facility would benefit from breakpoints that could transfer to the evaluation of the condition rapidly, and continue expeditiously if the condition were not satisfied. Such conditional breakpoints could be used to check assertions, etc. Program advising could also make use of fast breakpoints [Teitelman]. Examples of advising include tracing, timing, and even animation, all of which should be part of an advanced programming environment.We have ported the Cedar environment from a machine with microcode support for breakpoints [Lampson and Pier] to commercial platforms running C code [Atkinson, et al.]. Most of our ports run under the Unix* operating system, so one choice for implementing breakpoints for Cedar was to use the breakpoint facility provided by that system. The breakpoints provided by the Unix operating system are several orders of magnitude too slow (and also several process switches too complicated) for the applications we have in mind. So we designed a breakpoint system that was fast enough for our purposes.Breakpoints for uni-processors running single threads of control used to be fast and simple to implement. This paper shows that breakpoints can still be fast, even with multiple threads of control on multi-processors. This paper describes problems in the design of a breakpoint package for modern computer architectures and programming styles, and our solutions to them for a particular architecture.","author":["Peter B.

User-based collaborative filtering is the most successful technology for building recommender systems to date and is extensively used in many commercial recommender systems. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of these methods grows linearly with the number of customers, which in typical commercial applications can be several millions. To address these scalability concerns model-based recommendation techniques have been developed. These techniques analyze the user--item matrix to discover relations between the different items and use these relations to compute the list of recommendations.In this article, we present one such class of model-based recommendation algorithms that first determines the similarities between the various items and then uses them to identify the set of items to be recommended. The key steps in this class of algorithms are (i) the method used to compute the similarity between the items, and (ii) the method used to combine these similarities in order to compute the similarity between a basket of items and a candidate recommender item. Our experimental evaluation on eight real datasets shows that these item-based algorithms are up to two orders of magnitude faster than the traditional user-neighborhood based recommender systems and provide recommendations with comparable or better quality.","author":["Mukund Deshpande","George Karypis"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 22","Issue 1","January 2004","pp   143\u2013177","https://doi.org/10.1145/963770.963776"],"date":"01 January 2004","ref":[{"text":"Aggarwal, C., Wolf, J., Wu, K., and Yu, P. 1999.

This is typically done by modelling the surface as a perfect diffuser, sometimes with a specular component added for the simulation of hilights. This paper presents a more accurate function for the generation of hilights which is based on some experimental measurements of how light reflects from real surfaces. It differs from previous models in that the intensity of the hilight changes with the direction of the light source. Also the position and shape of the hilights is somewhat different from that generated by simpler models. Finally, the hilight function generates different results when simulating metallic vs. nonmetallic surfaces. Many of the effects so generated are somewhat subtle and are apparent only during movie sequences. Some representative still frames from such movies are included.","author":["James F.

Compiler writers choose a single \"compilation sequence\", or perhaps a couple of compilation sequences. In choosing a sequence, they may consider performance of benchmarks or other important codes. These sequences are intended as general-purpose tools, accessible through command-line flags such as -O2 and -O3.Specific compilation sequences make a significant difference in the quality of the generated code, whether compiling for speed, for space, or for other metrics. A single universal compilation sequence does not produce the best results over all programs [8, 10, 29, 32]. Finding an optimal program-specific compilation sequence is difficult because the space of potential sequences is huge and the interactions between optimizations are poorly understood. Moreover, there is no systematic exploration of the costs and benefits of searching for good (i.e., within a certain percentage of optimal) program-specific compilation sequences.In this paper, we perform a large experimental study of the space of compilation sequences over a set of known benchmarks, using our prototype adaptive compiler. Our goal is to characterize these spaces and to determine if it is cost-effective to construct custom compilation sequences. We report on five exhaustive enumerations which demonstrate that 80% of the local minima in the space are within 5 to 10% of the optimal solution. We describe three algorithms tailored to search such spaces and report on experiments that use these algorithms to find good compilation sequences. These experiments suggest that properties observed in the enumerations hold for larger search spaces and larger programs. Our findings indicate that for the cost of 200 to 4,550 compilations, we can find custom sequences that are 15 to 25% better than the human-designed fixed-sequence originally used in our compiler.","author":["L.

Still, the growing popularity of the RDF format arguably calls for an effort to offset these drawbacks. Viewed from a relational-database perspective, these constraints are derived from the very nature of the RDF data model, which is based on a triple format. Recent research has attempted to address these constraints using a vertical-partitioning approach, in which separate two-column tables are constructed for each property. However, as we show, this approach suffers from similar scalability drawbacks on queries that are not bound by RDF property value. In this paper, we propose an RDF storage scheme that uses the triple nature of RDF as an asset. This scheme enhances the vertical partitioning idea and takes it to its logical conclusion. RDF data is indexed in six possible ways, one for each possible ordering of the three RDF elements. Each instance of an RDF element is associated with two vectors; each such vector gathers elements of one of the other types, along with lists of the third-type resources attached to each vector element. Hence, a sextuple-indexing scheme emerges. This format allows for quick and scalable general-purpose query processing; it confers significant advantages (up to five orders of magnitude) compared to previous approaches for RDF data management, at the price of a worst-case five-fold increase in index space. We experimentally document the advantages of our approach on real-world and synthetic data sets with practical queries.","author":["Cathrin Weiss","Panagiotis Karras","Abraham Bernstein"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 1","Issue 1","August 2008","pp   1008\u20131019","https://doi.org/10.14778/1453856.1453965"],"date":"01 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"Longwell browser, http://simile.mit.edu/longwell.","order":1},{"text":"MIT Libraries Barton Catalog Data. http://simile.mit.edu/rdf-test-data/barton/.","order":2},{"text":"The SIMILE Project, http://simile.mit.edu/.","order":3},{"text":"D.

Column-stores, in a nutshell, store each database table column separately, with attribute values belonging to the same column stored contiguously, compressed, and densely packed, as opposed to traditional database systems that store entire records (rows) one after the other. Reading a subset of a table's columns becomes faster, at the potential expense of excessive disk-head seeking from column to column for scattered reads or updates. After several dozens of research papers and at least a dozen of new column-store start-ups, several questions remain. Are these a new breed of systems or simply old wine in new bottles? How easily can a major row-based system achieve column-store performance? Are column-stores the answer to effortlessly support large-scale data-intensive applications? What are the new, exciting system research problems to tackle? What are the new applications that can be potentially enabled by column-stores? In this tutorial, we present an overview of column-oriented database system technology and address these and other related questions.","author":["Daniel J. Abadi","Peter A.

However, the resulting heavy utilization of core database services also causes resource contention within the database engine itself and limits scalability. Meanwhile, many database workloads consist of short transactions which access only a few database records each, often with stringent response time requirements. Performance of these short transactions is determined largely by the amount of overhead the database engine imposes for services such as logging, locking, and transaction management.This paper highlights the negative scalability impact of database locking, an effect which is especially severe for short transactions running on highly concurrent multicore hardware. We propose and evaluate Speculative Lock Inheritance, a technique where hot database locks pass directly from transaction to transaction, bypassing the lock manager bottleneck. We implement SLI in the Shore-MT storage manager and show that lock inheritance fundamentally improves scalability by decoupling the number of simultaneous requests for popular locks from the number of threads in the system, eliminating contention within the lock manager even as core counts continue to increase. We achieve this effect with only minor changes to the lock manager and without changes to consistency or other application-visible effects.","author":["Ryan Johnson","Ippokratis Pandis","Anastasia Ailamaki"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 2","Issue 1","August 2009","pp   479\u2013489","https://doi.org/10.14778/1687627.1687682"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"Ailamaki, A., DeWitt, D.

MapReduce jobs are amenable to many traditional database query optimizations (B+Trees for selections, column-store-style techniques for projections, etc), but existing systems do not apply them, substantially because free-form user code obscures the true data operation being performed. For example, a selection in SQL is easily detected, but a selection in a MapReduce program is embedded in Java code along with lots of other program logic. We could ask the programmer to provide explicit hints about the program's data semantics, but one of MapReduce's attractions is precisely that it does not ask the user for such information.This paper covers Manimal, which automatically analyzes MapReduce programs and applies appropriate data-aware optimizations, thereby requiring no additional help at all from the programmer. We show that Manimal successfully detects optimization opportunities across a range of data operations, and that it yields speedups of up to 1,121% on previously-written MapReduce programs.","author":["Eaman Jahani","Michael J.

However, existing solutions suffer from two limitations: 1) they cannot answer SPARQL queries with wildcards in a scalable manner; and 2) they cannot handle frequent updates in RDF repositories efficiently. Thus, most of them have to reprocess the dataset from scratch. In this paper, we propose a graph-based approach to store and query RDF data. Rather than mapping RDF triples into a relational database as most existing methods do, we store RDF data as a large graph. A SPARQL query is then converted into a corresponding subgraph matching query. In order to speed up query processing, we develop a novel index, together with some effective pruning rules and efficient search algorithms. Our method can answer exact SPARQL queries and queries with wildcards in a uniform manner. We also propose an effective maintenance algorithm to handle online updates over RDF repositories. Extensive experiments confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our solution.","author":["Lei Zou","Jinghui Mo","Lei Chen","M.

Most of previous methods in this area find connected minimal trees that cover all the query keywords. Recently, it has been shown that finding subgraphs rather than trees can be more useful and informative for the users. However, the current tree or graph based methods may produce answers in which some content nodes (i.e., nodes that contain input keywords) are not very close to each other. In addition, when searching for answers, these methods may explore the whole graph rather than only the content nodes. This may lead to poor performance in execution time. To address the above problems, we propose the problem of finding r-cliques in graphs. An r-clique is a group of content nodes that cover all the input keywords and the distance between each two nodes is less than or equal to r. An exact algorithm is proposed that finds all r-cliques in the input graph. In addition, an approximation algorithm that produces r-cliques with 2-approximation in polynomial delay is proposed. Extensive performance studies using two large real data sets confirm the efficiency and accuracy of finding r-cliques in graphs.","author":["Mehdi Kargar","Aijun An"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 4","Issue 10","July 2011","pp   681\u2013692","https://doi.org/10.14778/2021017.2021025"],"date":"01 July 2011","ref":[{"text":"E.

Many algorithmic and control techniques in current database technology were devised for disk-based systems where I/O dominated the performance. In this work we take a new look at the well-known sort-merge join which, so far, has not been in the focus of research in scalable massively parallel multi-core data processing as it was deemed inferior to hash joins. We devise a suite of new massively parallel sort-merge (MPSM) join algorithms that are based on partial partition-based sorting. Contrary to classical sort-merge joins, our MPSM algorithms do not rely on a hard to parallelize final merge step to create one complete sort order. Rather they work on the independently created runs in parallel. This way our MPSM algorithms are NUMA-affine as all the sorting is carried out on local memory partitions. An extensive experimental evaluation on a modern 32-core machine with one TB of main memory proves the competitive performance of MPSM on large main memory databases with billions of objects. It scales (almost) linearly in the number of employed cores and clearly outperforms competing hash join proposals -- in particular it outperforms the \"cutting-edge\" Vectorwise parallel query engine by a factor of four.","author":["Martina-Cezara Albutiu","Alfons Kemper","Thomas Neumann"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 5","Issue 10","June 2012","pp   1064\u20131075","https://doi.org/10.14778/2336664.2336678"],"date":"01 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"S.

However, most people consider a database merely as a data repository that supports data storage and retrieval rather than one or a set of heterogeneous information networks that contain rich, inter-related, multi-typed data and information. Most network science researchers only study homogeneous networks, without distinguishing the different types of objects and links in the networks. In this tutorial, we view database and other interconnected data as heterogeneous information networks, and study how to leverage the rich semantic meaning of types of objects and links in the networks. We systematically introduce the technologies that can effectively and efficiently mine useful knowledge from such information networks.","author":["Yizhou Sun","Jiawei Han","Xifeng Yan","Philip S.

Automated tools are often uncertain about schema matchings they suggest, and this uncertainty is inherent since it arises from the inability of the schema to fully capture the semantics of the represented data. Human common sense can often help. Inspired by the popularity and the success of easily accessible crowdsourcing platforms, we explore the use of crowdsourcing to reduce the uncertainty of schema matching.Since it is typical to ask simple questions on crowdsourcing platforms, we assume that each question, namely Correspondence Correctness Question (CCQ), is to ask the crowd to decide whether a given correspondence should exist in the correct matching. We propose frameworks and efficient algorithms to dynamically manage the CCQs, in order to maximize the uncertainty reduction within a limited budget of questions. We develop two novel approaches, namely \"Single CCQ\" and \"Multiple CCQ\", which adaptively select, publish and manage the questions. We verified the value of our solutions with simulation and real implementation.","author":["Chen Jason Zhang","Lei Chen","H. V.

However, despite the large memory available with modern hardware, data skew, shifting workloads, and complex mixed workloads make it difficult to guarantee that a working set will fit in memory. Hence, some recent work has focused on enabling in-memory databases to protect performance when the working data set almost fits in memory. Contrary to those prior efforts, we enable buffer pool designs to match in-memory performance while supporting the \"big data\" workloads that continue to require secondary storage, thus providing the best of both worlds. We introduce here a novel buffer pool design that adapts pointer swizzling for references between system objects (as opposed to application objects), and uses it to practically eliminate buffer pool overheads for memoryresident data. Our implementation and experimental evaluation demonstrate that we achieve graceful performance degradation when the working set grows to exceed the buffer pool size, and graceful improvement when the working set shrinks towards and below the memory and buffer pool sizes.","author":["Goetz Graefe","Haris Volos","Hideaki Kimura","Harumi Kuno","Joseph Tucek","Mark Lillibridge","Alistair Veitch"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 1","September 2014","pp   37\u201348","https://doi.org/10.14778/2735461.2735465"],"date":"01 September 2014","ref":[{"text":"T.

For example, the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud now consists of thousands of RDF data sets with over 30 billion triples, and the number and size of the data sets is continuously growing. Many of the data sets in the LOD cloud provide public SPARQL endpoints to allow issuing queries over them. These end-points enable users to retrieve data using precise and highly expressive SPARQL queries. However, in order to do so, the user must have sufficient knowledge about the data sets that she wishes to query, that is, the structure of data, the vocabulary used within the data set, the exact values of literals, their data types, etc. Thus, while SPARQL is powerful, it is not easy to use. An alternative to SPARQL that does not require as much prior knowledge of the data is some form of keyword search over the structured data. Keyword search queries are easy to use, but inherently ambiguous in describing structured queries.This demonstration introduces Sapphire, a system for querying RDF data that strikes a middle ground between ambiguous keyword search and difficult-to-use SPARQL. Our system does not replace either, but utilizes both where they are most effective. Sapphire helps the user construct expressive SPARQL queries that represent her information needs without requiring detailed knowledge about the queried data sets. These queries are then executed over public SPARQL endpoints from the LOD cloud. Sapphire guides the user in the query writing process by showing suggestions of query terms based on the queried data, and by recommending changes to the query based on a predictive user model.","author":["Ahmed El-Roby","Khaled Ammar","Ashraf Aboulnaga","Jimmy Lin"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 9","Issue 13","September 2016","pp   1481\u20131484","https://doi.org/10.14778/3007263.3007289"],"date":"01 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"S.

It is utilized to solve many data management problems, especially for thresholded similarity searches. Despite many pigeonhole principle-based solutions proposed in the last few decades, the condition stated by the principle is weak. It only constrains the number of items in a single box. By organizing the boxes in a ring, we propose a new principle, called the pigeonring principle, which constrains the number of items in multiple boxes and yields stronger conditions.To utilize the new principle, we focus on problems defined in the form of identifying data objects whose similarities or distances to the query is constrained by a threshold. Many solutions to these problems utilize the pigeonhole principle to find candidates that satisfy a filtering condition. By the new principle, stronger filtering conditions can be established. We show that the pigeonhole principle is a special case of the new principle. This suggests that all the pigeonhole principle-based solutions are possible to be accelerated by the new principle. A universal filtering framework is introduced to encompass the solutions to these problems based on the new principle. Besides, we discuss how to quickly find candidates specified by the new principle. The implementation requires only minor modifications on top of existing pigeonhole principle-based algorithms. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the applicability of the new principle as well as the superior performance of the algorithms based on the new principle.","author":["Jianbin Qin","Chuan Xiao"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 12","Issue 1","September 2018","pp   28\u201342","https://doi.org/10.14778/3275536.3275539"],"date":"01 September 2018","ref":[{"text":"N.

They have been studied to support object identification, knowledge fusion, and social network reconciliation. Existing key constraints identify entities as the matches of a graph pattern by subgraph isomorphism, which enforce label equality on node types. These constraints can be too restrictive to characterize structures and node labels that are syntactically different but semantically equivalent. We propose a new class of key constraints, Ontological Graph Keys (OGKs) that extend conventional graph keys by ontological subgraph matching between entity labels and an external ontology. We show that the implication and validation problems for OGKs are each NP-complete. To reduce the entity matching cost, we also provide an algorithm to compute a minimal cover for OGKs. We then study the entity matching problem with OGKs, and a practical variant with a budget on the matching cost. We develop efficient algorithms to perform entity matching based on a (budgeted) Chase procedure. Using real-world graphs, we experimentally verify the efficiency and accuracy of OGK-based entity matching.","author":["Hanchao Ma","Morteza Alipourlangouri","Yinghui Wu","Fei Chiang","Jiaxing Pi"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 12","Issue 10","June 2019","pp   1195\u20131207","https://doi.org/10.14778/3339490.3339501"],"date":"01 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"Full version. http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~alipoum/full.pdf.","order":1},{"text":"S.

We regard its resolution as equivalent to word sense disambiguation, and make use of the classical vector space model in information retrieval to formulate the contexts of ambiguous words. A variation form of TFIDF weighting is proposed and a Chinese thesaurus is additionally utilized to cope with data sparseness problem. We select 90 frequent cases of covering ambiguities as the target. The training set includes 77654 sentences, and the test set includes 19242 sentences. The experimental results showed that our model has achieved 96.58% accuracy, outperforming the original form of TFIDF weighting as well as another baseline model, the hidden Markov model.","author":["Xiao Luo","Maosong Sun","Benjamin K.

The techniques were based on Bayesian decision theory, neural, networks, and content vectors as used in information retrieval. To understand these methods better, we posed a very specific problem: given a set of contexts, each containing the noun line in a known sense, construct a classifier that selects the correct sense of line for new contexts. To see how the degree of polysemy affects performance, results from three- and six-sense tasks are compared.The results demonstrate that each of the techniques is able to distinguish six senses of line with an accuracy greater than 70%. Furthermore, the response patterns of the classifiers are, for the most part, statistically indistinguishable from one another. Comparison of the two tasks suggests that the degree of difficulty involved in resolving individual senses is a greater performance factor than the degree of polysemy.","author":["Claudia Leacock","Geoffrey Towell","Ellen Voorhees"],"issue":["HLT '93: Proceedings of the workshop on Human Language Technology","March 1993","Pages   260\u2013265","https://doi.org/10.3115/1075671.1075730"],"date":"21 March 1993","ref":[{"text":"Miller, G.

The problem is that words are generally built by concatenating several prefixes and suffixes to the word roots. Together with compounding and inflections this leads to millions of different, but still frequent word forms. Due to inflections, ambiguity and other phenomena, it is also not trivial to automatically split the words into meaningful parts. Rule-based morphological analyzers can perform this splitting, but due to the handcrafted rules, they also suffer from an out-of-vocabulary problem. In this paper we apply a recently proposed fully automatic and rather language and vocabulary independent way to build sub-word lexica for three different agglutinative languages. We demonstrate the language portability as well by building a successful large vocabulary speech recognizer for each language and show superior recognition performance compared to the corresponding word-based reference systems.","author":["Mikko Kurimo","Antti Puurula","Ebru Arisoy","Vesa Siivola","Teemu Hirsim\u00e4ki","Janne Pylkk\u00f6nen","Tanel Alum\u00e4e","Murat Saraclar"],"issue":["HLT-NAACL '06: Proceedings of the main conference on Human Language Technology Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association of Computational Linguistics","June 2006","Pages   487\u2013494","https://doi.org/10.3115/1220835.1220897"],"date":"04 June 2006","ref":[{"text":"Cyril Allauzen, Mehryar Mohri, Michael Riley, and Brian Roark. 2004.

As described in [GJW86], the process of centering attention on entities in the discourse gives rise to the intersentential transitional states of continuing, retaining and shifting. We propose an extension to these states which handles some additional cases of multiple ambiguous pronouns. The algorithm has been implemented in an HPSG natural language system which serves as the interface to a database query application.","author":["Susan E. Brennan","Marilyn W. Friedman","Carl J.

Two groups of English and Chinese verbs are examined to show that lexical selection must be based on interpretation of the sentences as well as selection restrictions placed on the verb arguments. A novel representation scheme is suggested, and is compared to representations with selection restrictions used in transfer-based MT. We see our approach as closely aligned with knowledge-based MT approaches (KBMT), and as a separate component that could be incorporated into existing systems. Examples and experimental results will show that, using this scheme, inexact matches can achieve correct lexical selection.","author":["Zhibiao Wu","Martha Palmer"],"issue":["ACL '94: Proceedings of the 32nd annual meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics","June 1994","Pages   133\u2013138","https://doi.org/10.3115/981732.981751"],"date":"27 June 1994","ref":[{"text":"DORR, B.

This approach integrates a diverse set of knowledge sources to disambiguate word sense, including part of speech of neighboring words, morphological form, the unordered set of surrounding words, local collocations, and verb-object syntactic relation. We tested our WSD program, named LEXAS, on both a common data set used in previous work, as well as on a large sense-tagged corpus that we separately constructed.

The l2 regression (or least-squares fit) problem takes as input a matrix A \u2208 Rn\u00d7d (where we assume n > d) and a target vector b \u2208 Rn, and it returns as output Z = minx\u2208Rd |b - Ax|2. Also of interest is xopt = A+b, where A+ is the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse, which is the minimum-length vector achieving the minimum. Our algorithm randomly samples r rows from the matrix A and vector b to construct an induced l2 regression problem with many fewer rows, but with the same number of columns. A crucial feature of the algorithm is the nonuniform sampling probabilities. These probabilities depend in a sophisticated manner on the lengths, i.e., the Euclidean norms, of the rows of the left singular vectors of A and the manner in which b lies in the complement of the column space of A. Under appropriate assumptions, we show relative error approximations for both Z and xopt. Applications of this sampling methodology are briefly discussed.","author":["Petros Drineas","Michael W.

The paper gives a very efficient algorithm to compute it. This kernel is also an improvement over the word subsequence kernel because it only counts linguistically meaningful word subsequences which are based on word dependencies. It overcomes some of the difficulties encountered by syntactic tree kernels as well. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of this kernel over word subsequence and syntactic tree kernels.","author":["Rohit J.
