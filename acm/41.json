A key requirement is that the wrapper generation process should be automated to the largest extent, in order to allow for large-scale extraction tasks even in presence of changes in the underlying sites. So far, however, only semi-automatic proposals have appeared in the literature.We present a novel approach to information extraction from websites, which reconciles recent proposals for supervised wrapper induction with the more traditional field of grammar inference. Grammar inference provides a promising theoretical framework for the study of unsupervised---that is, fully automatic---wrapper generation algorithms. However, due to some unrealistic assumptions on the input, these algorithms are not practically applicable to Web information extraction tasks.The main contributions of the article stand in the definition of a class of regular languages, called the prefix mark-up languages, that abstract the structures usually found in HTML pages, and in the definition of a polynomial-time unsupervised learning algorithm for this class. The article shows that, differently from other known classes, prefix mark-up languages and the associated algorithm can be practically used for information extraction purposes.A system based on the techniques described in the article has been implemented in a working prototype. We present some experimental results on known Websites, and discuss opportunities and limitations of the proposed approach.","author":["Valter Crescenzi","Giansalvatore Mecca"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 51","Issue 5","September 2004","pp   731\u2013779","https://doi.org/10.1145/1017460.1017462"],"date":"01 September 2004","ref":[{"text":"Adelberg, B. 1998.

Such loops iteratively modify the same array elements over different time steps, which presents opportunities for the compiler to improve the temporal data locality through loop tiling. This article presents a compiler framework for automatic tiling of iterative stencil loops, with the objective of improving the cache performance. The article first presents a technique which allows loop tiling to satisfy data dependences in spite of the difficulty created by imperfectly nested inner loops. It does so by skewing the inner loops over the time steps and by applying a uniform skew factor to all loops at the same nesting level. Based on a memory cost analysis, the article shows that the skew factor must be minimized at every loop level in order to minimize cache misses. A graph-theoretical algorithm, which takes polynomial time, is presented to determine the minimum skew factor. Furthermore, the memory-cost analysis derives the tile size which minimizes capacity misses. Given the tile size, an efficient and general <i>array-padding</i> scheme is applied to remove conflict misses. Experiments were conducted on 16 test programs and preliminary results showed an average speedup of 1.58 and a maximum speedup of 5.06 across those test programs.","author":["Zhiyuan Li","Yonghong Song"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems","Volume 26","Issue 6","November 2004","pp   975\u20131028","https://doi.org/10.1145/1034774.1034777"],"date":"01 November 2004","ref":[{"text":"Admas, J.

This is achieved by using run-length encoding followed by Huffman encoding. This combination is especially effective when the percentage of don't cares in a test set is high, which is a common case in today's large systems-on-chips (SoCs). Our analysis and experimental results confirm that achieving up to an 89% compression ratio and a 93% scan-in power reduction is possible for scan-testable circuits such as ISCAS89 benchmarks.","author":["Mehrdad Nourani","Mohammad H.

Acquisitional issues are those that pertain to where, when, and how often data is physically acquired (sampled) and delivered to query processing operators. By focusing on the locations and costs of acquiring data, we are able to significantly reduce power consumption over traditional passive systems that assume the a priori existence of data. We discuss simple extensions to SQL for controlling data acquisition, and show how acquisitional issues influence query optimization, dissemination, and execution. We evaluate these issues in the context of TinyDB, a distributed query processor for smart sensor devices, and show how acquisitional techniques can provide significant reductions in power consumption on our sensor devices.","author":["Samuel R.

What are \"normal\" growth patterns in social, technological, and information networks? Many studies have discovered patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a large network, or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena, and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time.Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time, with the number of edges growing super-linearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time, in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)).Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior, even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a \"forest fire\" spreading process, that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires very few parameters (like the \"flammability\" of nodes), and produces graphs exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present study.","author":["Jure Leskovec","Jon Kleinberg","Christos Faloutsos"],"issue":["KDD '05: Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery in data mining","August 2005","Pages   177\u2013187","https://doi.org/10.1145/1081870.1081893"],"date":"21 August 2005","ref":[{"text":"J.

The design philosophy of the Blue Gene/L architecture relies on large numbers of power efficient nodes (whose technology is derived from the world of embedded microprocessors) to enable packing of many such nodes into a small volume to achieve high performance. In order for an application to exploit the potential of this architecture, the application must scale well to large node counts. Because the scientific goals of the project entail simulating very long time-scales, up to microseconds, strong scaling of a fixed size problem to these large node counts is a requirement. In pursuit of this objective we have considered a variety of parallel decompositions and explored ways to exploit and map algorithms onto the two primary high performance interconnects provided by the Blue Gene architecture, the 3D-torus network and the collective network. Our current version of the application continues to speed up through 4096 nodes and is being used for studies of a protein/lipid system (for which some results have already been published) and for protein folding/unfolding simulations.","author":["Robert S.

However the challenge of effectively analyzing this massive data source for anomaly diagnosis is as yet unmet. We argue that the distributions of packet features (IP addresses and ports) observed in flow traces reveals both the presence and the structure of a wide range of anomalies. Using entropy as a summarization tool, we show that the analysis of feature distributions leads to significant advances on two fronts: (1) it enables highly sensitive detection of a wide range of anomalies, augmenting detections by volume-based methods, and (2) it enables automatic classification of anomalies via unsupervised learning. We show that using feature distributions, anomalies naturally fall into distinct and meaningful clusters. These clusters can be used to automatically classify anomalies and to uncover new anomaly types. We validate our claims on data from two backbone networks (Abilene and Geant) and conclude that feature distributions show promise as a key element of a fairly general network anomaly diagnosis framework.","author":["Anukool Lakhina","Mark Crovella","Christophe Diot"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 35","Issue 4","October 2005","pp   217\u2013228","https://doi.org/10.1145/1090191.1080118"],"date":"22 August 2005","ref":[{"text":"Abilene Network Operations Center Weekly Reports.

As the availability of these services grows, we are witnessing an increase in the number and sophistication of attacks that target them. In particular, SQL injection, a class of code-injection attacks in which specially crafted input strings result in illegal queries to a database, has become one of the most serious threats to web applications. In this paper we present and evaluate a new technique for detecting and preventing SQL injection attacks. Our technique uses a model-based approach to detect illegal queries before they are executed on the database. In its static part, the technique uses program analysis to automatically build a model of the legitimate queries that could be generated by the application. In its dynamic part, the technique uses runtime monitoring to inspect the dynamically-generated queries and check them against the statically-built model. We developed a tool, AMNESIA, that implements our technique and used the tool to evaluate the technique on seven web applications. In the evaluation we targeted the subject applications with a large number of both legitimate and malicious inputs and measured how many attacks our technique detected and prevented. The results of the study show that our technique was able to stop all of the attempted attacks without generating any false positives.","author":["William G. J.

Concurrency, storage capacity, and interconnection network topology influence algorithmic efficiency, while quantum error correction and necessary quantum state measurement are the ultimate drivers of logical clock speed. We discuss several proposed technologies.

PinPoint is a distributed algorithm that enables a set of $n$ nodes to determine the RF propagation delays between every pair of nodes, from which the inter-node distances and hence the spatial topology can be readily determined. PinPoint does not require any calibration of the area of interest and thus is rapidly deployable. Unlike existing time-of-arrival techniques, PinPoint does not require an infrastructure of accurate clocks (e.g., GPS) nor does it incur the o(n2) message exchanges of \"echoing\" techniques. PinPoint can work with nodes having inexpensive crystal oscillator clocks, and incurs a constant number of message exchanges per node to determine the location of $n$ nodes. Each node's clock is assumed to run reliably but asynchronously with respect to the other nodes, i.e., they can run at slightly different rates because of hardware (oscillator) inaccuracies. PinPoint provides a mathematical way to compensate for these clock differences in order to arrive at a very precise timestamp recovery that in turn leads to a precise distance determination. Moreover, each node is able to determine the clock characteristics of other nodes in its neighborhood allowing network synchronization. We present a prototype implementation for PinPoint and discusses the practical issues in implementing the mathematical framework and how PinPoint handles the different sources of error affecting its accuracy. Evaluation of the prototype in typical indoor and outdoor environments shows that PinPoint gives an average accuracy of four to six feet, in different environments, allowing PinPoint to support accurate rapidly deployable localization scenarios.","author":["Moustafa Youssef","Adel Youssef","Chuck Rieger","Udaya Shankar","Ashok Agrawala"],"issue":["MobiSys '06: Proceedings of the 4th international conference on Mobile systems, applications and services","June 2006","Pages   165\u2013176","https://doi.org/10.1145/1134680.1134698"],"date":"19 June 2006","ref":[{"text":"http://www.atheros.com.","order":1},{"text":"R.

The optimization works by alternating DAG-aware AIG rewriting, which reduces area by sharing common logic without increasing delay, and algebraic AIG balancing, which minimizes delay without increasing area. The new technology-independent flow is implemented in a public-domain tool ABC. Experiments on large industrial benchmarks show that the proposed methodology scales to very large designs and is several orders of magnitude faster than SIS and MVSIS while offering comparable or better quality when measured by the quality of the network after mapping.","author":["Alan Mishchenko","Satrajit Chatterjee","Robert Brayton"],"issue":["DAC '06: Proceedings of the 43rd annual Design Automation Conference","July 2006","Pages   532\u2013535","https://doi.org/10.1145/1146909.1147048"],"date":"24 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"Berkeley Logic Synthesis and Verification Group.

While they offer several other advantages, it is expected that the benefits from this technology can potentially be off-set by thermal considerations which impact chip performance and reliability. The work presented in this paper is the first attempt to study the performance benefits of 3-D technology under the influence of such thermal constraints. Using a processor-cache-memory system and carefully chosen applications encompassing different memory behaviors, the performance of 3-D architecture is compared with a conventional planar (2-D) design. It is found that the substantial increase in memory bus frequency and bus width contribute to a significant reduction in execution time with a 3-D design. It is also found that increasing the clock frequency translates into larger gains in system performance with 3-D designs than for planar 2-D designs in memory intensive applications. The thermal profile of the vertically stacked chip is generated taking into account the highly temperature sensitive leakage power dissipation. The maximum allowed operating frequency imposed by temperature constraint is shown to be lower for 3-D than for 2-D designs. In spite of these constraints, it is shown that the 3-D system registers large performance improvement for memory intensive applications.","author":["Gian Luca Loi","Banit Agrawal","Navin Srivastava","Sheng-Chih Lin","Timothy Sherwood","Kaustav Banerjee"],"issue":["DAC '06: Proceedings of the 43rd annual Design Automation Conference","July 2006","Pages   991\u2013996","https://doi.org/10.1145/1146909.1147160"],"date":"24 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), 2004 edition, (http://public.itrs.net/)","order":1},{"text":"P.

A first step towards exploiting this data automatically could be to extract pairs of a given semantic relation from text documents - for example all pairs of a person and her birthdate. One strategy for this task is to find text patterns that express the semantic relation, to generalize these patterns, and to apply them to a corpus to find new pairs. In this paper, we show that this approach profits significantly when deep linguistic structures are used instead of surface text patterns. We demonstrate how linguistic structures can be represented for machine learning, and we provide a theoretical analysis of the pattern matching approach.

Most high performance systems that perform deep packet inspection implement simple string matching algorithms to match packets against a large, but finite set of strings. owever, there is growing interest in the use of regular expression-based pattern matching, since regular expressions offer superior expressive power and flexibility. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) representations are typically used to implement regular expressions. However, DFA representations of regular expression sets arising in network applications require large amounts of memory, limiting their practical application.In this paper, we introduce a new representation for regular expressions, called the Delayed Input DFA (D2FA), which substantially reduces space equirements as compared to a DFA. A D2FA is constructed by transforming a DFA via incrementally replacing several transitions of the automaton with a single default transition. Our approach dramatically reduces the number of distinct transitions between states. For a collection of regular expressions drawn from current commercial and academic systems, a D2FA representation reduces transitions by more than 95%. Given the substantially reduced space equirements, we describe an efficient architecture that can perform deep packet inspection at multi-gigabit rates. Our architecture uses multiple on-chip memories in such a way that each remains uniformly occupied and accessed over a short duration, thus effectively distributing the load and enabling high throughput. Our architecture can provide ostffective packet content scanning at OC-192 rates with memory requirements that are consistent with current ASIC technology.","author":["Sailesh Kumar","Sarang Dharmapurikar","Fang Yu","Patrick Crowley","Jonathan Turner"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 36","Issue 4","October 2006","pp   339\u2013350","https://doi.org/10.1145/1151659.1159952"],"date":"11 August 2006","ref":[{"text":"R.

Demand paging with NAND flash memory has recently been proposed as an alternative which requires less RAM. This scheme is even more attractive for OneNAND flash, which consists of a NAND flash array with SRAM buffers, and supports eXecute-In-Place (XIP), which allows limited random access to data on the SRAM buffers.We introduce a novel demand paging method for OneNAND flash memory with XIP feature. The proposed on-line demand paging method with XIP adopts finite size sliding window to capture the paging history and thus predict future page demands. We particularly focus on non-critical code accesses which can disturb real-time code.Experimental results show that our method outperforms conventional LRU-based demand paging by 57% in terms of execution time and by 63% in terms of energy consumption. It even beats the optimal solution obtained from MIN, which is a conventional off-line demand paging technique by 30% and 40% respectively.","author":["Yongsoo Joo","Yongseok Choi","Chanik Park","Sung Woo Chung","EuiYoung Chung","Naehyuck Chang"],"issue":["CODES+ISSS '06: Proceedings of the 4th international conference on Hardware/software codesign and system synthesis","October 2006","Pages   229\u2013234","https://doi.org/10.1145/1176254.1176310"],"date":"22 October 2006","ref":[{"text":"C.

We consider the classification problem on a corpus that has been processed primarily for the purpose of searching, and thus our access to documents is solely through the inverted index of a large scale search engine. Our main goal is to build the \"best\" short query that characterizes a document class using operators normally available within large engines. We show that surprisingly good classification accuracy can be achieved on average over multiple classes by queries with as few as 10 terms. Moreover, we show that optimizing the efficiency of query execution by careful selection of these terms can further reduce the query costs. More precisely, we show that on our set-up the best 10 terms query canachieve 90% of the accuracy of the best SVM classifier (14000 terms), and if we are willing to tolerate a reduction to 86% of the best SVM, we can build a 10 terms query that can be executed more than twice as fast as the best 10 terms query.","author":["Aris Anagnostopoulos","Andrei Z.

More recently, computer manufacturers started launching new lines of mobile or portable computers that did away with magnetic disk drives altogether, replacing them with tens of gigabytes of NAND flash memory. Like EEPROM and magnetic disk drives, flash memory is non-volatile and retains its contents even when the power is turned off. As its capacity increases and price drops, flash memory will compete more successfully with lower-end, lower-capacity disk drives. It is thus not inconceivable to consider running a full database system on the flash-only computing platforms or running an embedded database system on the lightweight computing devices. In this paper, we present a new design called in-page logging (IPL) for flash memory based database servers. This new design overcomes the limitations of flash memory such as high write latency, and exploits unique characteristics of flash memory to achieve the best attainable performance for flash-based database servers. We show empirically that the IPL approach can yield considerable performance benefit over traditional design for disk-based database servers. We also show that the basic design of IPL can be elegantly extended to support transactional database recovery.","author":["Sang-Won Lee","Bongki Moon"],"issue":["SIGMOD '07: Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data","June 2007","Pages   55\u201366","https://doi.org/10.1145/1247480.1247488"],"date":"11 June 2007","ref":[{"text":"Brad Adelberg, Ben Kao, and Hector Garcia-Molina.

For such applications, the majority of lines traverse from the MRU position to the LRU position without receiving any cache hits, resulting in inefficient use of cache space. Cache performance can be improved if some fraction of the working set is retained in the cache so that at least that fraction of the working set can contribute to cache hits.We show that simple changes to the insertion policy can significantly reduce cache misses for memory-intensive workloads. We propose the LRU Insertion Policy (LIP) which places the incoming line in the LRU position instead of the MRU position. LIP protects the cache from thrashing and results in close to optimal hitrate for applications that have a cyclic reference pattern. We also propose the Bimodal Insertion Policy (BIP) as an enhancement of LIP that adapts to changes in the working set while maintaining the thrashing protection of LIP. We finally propose a Dynamic Insertion Policy (DIP) to choose between BIP and the traditional LRU policy depending on which policy incurs fewer misses. The proposed insertion policies do not require any change to the existing cache structure, are trivial to implement, and have a storage requirement of less than two bytes. We show that DIP reduces the average MPKI of the baseline 1MB 16-way L2 cache by 21%, bridging two-thirds of the gap between LRU and OPT.","author":["Moinuddin K. Qureshi","Aamer Jaleel","Yale N.

However, prior studies were carried out using displays that provided a level of detail far short of what the human visual system is capable of resolving. Therefore, we undertook a graph comprehension study using a very high resolution stereoscopic display. In our first experiment, we examined the effect of stereoscopic display, kinetic depth, and using 3D tubes versus lines to display the links. The results showed a much greater benefit for 3D viewing than previous studies. For example, with both motion and stereoscopic depth cues, unskilled observers could see paths between nodes in 333 node graphs with less than a 10% error rate. Skilled observers could see up to a 1000-node graph with less than a 10% error rate. This represented an order of magnitude increase over 2D display. In our second experiment, we varied both nodes and links to understand the constraints on the number of links and the size of graph that can be reliably traced. We found the difference between number of links and number of nodes to best account for error rates and suggest that this is evidence for a \u201cperceptual phase transition.\u201d These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for information display.","author":["Colin Ware","Peter Mitchell"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Applied Perception","Volume 5","Issue 1","January 2008","Article No.: 2","pp   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/1279640.1279642"],"date":"30 January 2008","ref":[{"text":"Arthur, K., Booth, K.

However, programming these perpetual systems is challenging. In response to changing energy levels, programmers can adjust the execution frequency of energy-intensive tasks, or provide higher service levels when energy is plentiful and lower service levels when energy is scarce. However, it is often difficult for programmers to predict the energy consumption resulting from these adjustments. Worse, explicit energy management can tie a program to a particular hardware platform, limiting portability. This paper introduces Eon, a programming language and runtime system designed to support the development of perpetual systems. To our knowledge, Eon is the first energy-aware programming language. Eon is a declarative coordination language that lets programmers compose programs from components written in C or nesC. Paths through the program (\"flows\") may be annotated with different energy states. Eon's automatic energy management then dynamically adapts these states to current and predicted energy levels. It chooses flows to execute and adjusts their rates of execution, maximizing the quality of service under available energy constraints. We demonstrate the utility and portability of Eon by deploying two perpetual applications on widely different hardware platforms: a GPS-based location tracking sensor deployed on a threatened species of turtle and on automobiles, and a solar-powered camera sensor for remote, ad-hoc deployments. We also evaluate the simplicity and effectiveness of Eon with a user study, in which novice Eon programmers produced more efficient efficient energy-adaptive systems in substantially less time than experienced C programmers.","author":["Jacob Sorber","Alexander Kostadinov","Matthew Garber","Matthew Brennan","Mark D.

However, when coupled with the ease of VM migration, this trend increases the potential surface for security attacks. Further, the simplified management of VMs, including creation, cloning and migration, makes it imperative to monitor and guarantee the integrity of software components running within VMs.This paper presents the IBM Trusted Virtual Datacenter (TVDc) technology developed to address the need for strong isolation and integrity guarantees, thus significantly enhancing security and systems management capabilities, in virtualized environments. It signifies the first effort to incorporate trusted computing technologies directly into virtualization and systems management software. We present and discuss various components that constitute TVDc: the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), the virtual TPM, the IBM hypervisor security architecture (sHype) and the associated systems management software.","author":["Stefan Berger","Ram\u00f3n C\u00e1ceres","Dimitrios Pendarakis","Reiner Sailer","Enriquillo Valdez","Ronald Perez","Wayne Schildhauer","Deepa Srinivasan"],"issue":["ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","Volume 42","Issue 1","January 2008","pp   40\u201347","https://doi.org/10.1145/1341312.1341321"],"date":"01 January 2008","ref":[{"text":"J.

Most leading companies use large clusters of server computers to achieve acceptable turn-around time. Thus co-processor acceleration is very attractive for obtaining increased computational performance with reduced power consumption. This paper describes an implementation of a customized accelerator on FPGA using a polygon-based simulation model. An application-specific memory partitioning scheme is designed to meet the bandwidth requirements for a large number of processing elements. Deep loop pipelining and ping-pong buffer based function block pipelining are also implemented in our design. Initial results show a 15X speedup versus the software implementation running on a microprocessor, and more speedup is expected via further performance tuning. The implementation also leverages state-of-art C-to-RTL synthesis tools. At the same time, we also identified the need for manual architecture-level exploration for parallel implementations","author":["Jason Cong","Yi Zou"],"issue":["FPGA '08: Proceedings of the 16th international ACM/SIGDA symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2008","Pages   67\u201376","https://doi.org/10.1145/1344671.1344683"],"date":"24 February 2008","ref":[{"text":"Datasheet of calibre nmopc.

However, there are many choices involved in creating a CWS system such as various specifications and CWS methods. The choices made will create a new CWS scheme, but whether it will produce a superior or inferior translation has remained unknown to date. This article examines the relationship between CWS and SMT. The effects of CWS on SMT were investigated using different specifications and CWS methods. Four specifications were selected for investigation: Beijing University (PKU), Hong Kong City University (CITYU), Microsoft Research (MSR), and Academia SINICA (AS). We created 16 CWS schemes under different settings to examine the relationship between CWS and SMT. Our experimental results showed that the MSR's specifications produced the lowest quality translations. In examining the effects of CWS methods, we tested dictionary-based and CRF-based approaches and found there was no significant difference between the two in the quality of the resulting translations. We also found the correlation between the CWS F-score and SMT BLEU score was very weak. We analyzed CWS errors and their effect on SMT by evaluating systems trained with and without these errors. This article also proposes two methods for combining advantages of different specifications: a simple concatenation of training data and a feature interpolation approach in which the same types of features of translation models from various CWS schemes are linearly interpolated.

A wide range of biologically interesting phenomena, however, occur over timescales on the order of a millisecond---several orders of magnitude beyond the duration of the longest current MD simulations.We describe a massively parallel machine called Anton, which should be capable of executing millisecond-scale classical MD simulations of such biomolecular systems. The machine, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2008, is based on 512 identical MD-specific ASICs that interact in a tightly coupled manner using a specialized highspeed communication network. Anton has been designed to use both novel parallel algorithms and special-purpose logic to dramatically accelerate those calculations that dominate the time required for a typical MD simulation. The remainder of the simulation algorithm is executed by a programmable portion of each chip that achieves a substantial degree of parallelism while preserving the flexibility necessary to accommodate anticipated advances in physical models and simulation methods.","author":["David E.

Phase Change Random Access Memory (PRAM), a high density, fast access, non-volatile memory is being considered as a candidate for future universal memory technologies. In this paper, we investigate the architectural challenges in integrating a PRAM based memory into the conventional cache hierarchy. First, we develop PRAM cache delay and energy models. We then propose a hybrid PRAM architecture for L1 instruction caches on embedded processors. We also propose a PRAM based unified cache architecture for L2 caches on high-end microprocessors. Finally, we evaluate the proposed architectures, in terms of area, performance, and energy. The experimental results show that the PRAM based cache architectures achieve close to 80% reduction in the leakage energy consumption of a L1-L2 cache hierarchy.","author":["Prasanth Mangalagiri","Karthik Sarpatwari","Aditya Yanamandra","VijayKrishnan Narayanan","Yuan Xie","Mary Jane Irwin","Osama Awadel Karim"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '08: Proceedings of the 18th ACM Great Lakes symposium on VLSI","May 2008","Pages   395\u2013398","https://doi.org/10.1145/1366110.1366204"],"date":"04 May 2008","ref":[{"text":"International technology roadmap for semiconductors, 2006 report. http:http://www.itrs.net/reports.html.","order":1},{"text":"D.

Machine learning systems, such as Kylin, use these infoboxes as training data, accurately extracting even more semantic knowledge from natural language text. But in order to realize the full power of this information, it must be situated in a cleanly-structured ontology. This paper introduces KOG, an autonomous system for refining Wikipedia's infobox-class ontology towards this end. We cast the problem of ontology refinement as a machine learning problem and solve it using both SVMs and a more powerful joint-inference approach expressed in Markov Logic Networks. We present experiments demonstrating the superiority of the joint-inference approach and evaluating other aspects of our system. Using these techniques, we build a rich ontology, integrating Wikipedia's infobox-class schemata with WordNet. We demonstrate how the resulting ontology may be used to enhance Wikipedia with improved query processing and other features.","author":["Fei Wu","Daniel S.

The most recent GPU features include support for writing to random memory locations, efficient inter-processor communication, and a programming model for general-purpose computing. Taking advantage of these new features, we design a set of data-parallel primitives such as split and sort, and use these primitives to implement indexed or non-indexed nested-loop, sort-merge and hash joins. Our algorithms utilize the high parallelism as well as the high memory bandwidth of the GPU, and use parallel computation and memory optimizations to effectively reduce memory stalls. We have implemented our algorithms on a PC with an NVIDIA G80 GPU and an Intel quad-core CPU. Our GPU-based join algorithms are able to achieve a performance improvement of 2-7X over their optimized CPU-based counterparts.","author":["Bingsheng He","Ke Yang","Rui Fang","Mian Lu","Naga Govindaraju","Qiong Luo","Pedro Sander"],"issue":["SIGMOD '08: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data","June 2008","Pages   511\u2013524","https://doi.org/10.1145/1376616.1376670"],"date":"09 June 2008","ref":[{"text":"A.

SystemCoDesigner offers a fast design space exploration and rapid prototyping of behavioral SystemC models. Together with Forte Design Systems, a fully automated approach was developed by integrating behavioral synthesis into the design flow. Starting from a behavioral SystemC model, hardware accelerators can be generated automatically using Forte Cynthesizer and can be added to the design space. The resulting design space is explored automatically by optimizing several objectives simultaneously using state of the art multi-objective optimization algorithms. As a result, SystemCoDesigner presents optimized hardware/software solutions to the designer who can select any of them for rapid prototyping on an FPGA basis. Thus, SystemCoDesigner bridges the gap from ESL to RTL and increases the confidence in early design decisions.","author":["Christian Haubelt","Thomas Schlichter","Joachim Keinert","Mike Meredith"],"issue":["DAC '08: Proceedings of the 45th annual Design Automation Conference","June 2008","Pages   580\u2013585","https://doi.org/10.1145/1391469.1391616"],"date":"08 June 2008","ref":[{"text":"S.

Larrabee uses multiple in-order x86 CPU cores that are augmented by a wide vector processor unit, as well as some fixed function logic blocks. This provides dramatically higher performance per watt and per unit of area than out-of-order CPUs on highly parallel workloads. It also greatly increases the flexibility and programmability of the architecture as compared to standard GPUs. A coherent on-die 2nd level cache allows efficient inter-processor communication and high-bandwidth local data access by CPU cores. Task scheduling is performed entirely with software in Larrabee, rather than in fixed function logic. The customizable software graphics rendering pipeline for this architecture uses binning in order to reduce required memory bandwidth, minimize lock contention, and increase opportunities for parallelism relative to standard GPUs. The Larrabee native programming model supports a variety of highly parallel applications that use irregular data structures. Performance analysis on those applications demonstrates Larrabee's potential for a broad range of parallel computation.","author":["Larry Seiler","Doug Carmean","Eric Sprangle","Tom Forsyth","Michael Abrash","Pradeep Dubey","Stephen Junkins","Adam Lake","Jeremy Sugerman","Robert Cavin","Roger Espasa","Ed Grochowski","Toni Juan","Pat Hanrahan"],"issue":["SIGGRAPH '08: ACM SIGGRAPH 2008 papers","August 2008","Article No.: 18","Pages   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/1399504.1360617"],"date":"01 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"Akenine-M\u00f6ller, T., Haines, E. 2002.","doi":"10.5555/553838","order":1},{"text":"Aila, T., Laine, S. 2004.

For the first time at such a large scale, we study individual node arrival and edge creation processes that collectively lead to macroscopic properties of networks. Using a methodology based on the maximum-likelihood principle, we investigate a wide variety of network formation strategies, and show that edge locality plays a critical role in evolution of networks. Our findings supplement earlier network models based on the inherently non-local preferential attachment. Based on our observations, we develop a complete model of network evolution, where nodes arrive at a prespecified rate and select their lifetimes. Each node then independently initiates edges according to a \"gap\" process, selecting a destination for each edge according to a simple triangle-closing model free of any parameters. We show analytically that the combination of the gap distribution with the node lifetime leads to a power law out-degree distribution that accurately reflects the true network in all four cases. Finally, we give model parameter settings that allow automatic evolution and generation of realistic synthetic networks of arbitrary scale.","author":["Jure Leskovec","Lars Backstrom","Ravi Kumar","Andrew Tomkins"],"issue":["KDD '08: Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2008","Pages   462\u2013470","https://doi.org/10.1145/1401890.1401948"],"date":"24 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"R.

This algorithm achieves real-time performance by exploiting the GPU's streaming architecture at all stages of kd-tree construction. Unlike previous parallel kd-tree algorithms, our method builds tree nodes completely in BFS (breadth-first search) order. We also develop a special strategy for large nodes at upper tree levels so as to further exploit the fine-grained parallelism of GPUs. For these nodes, we parallelize the computation over all geometric primitives instead of nodes at each level. Finally, in order to maintain kd-tree quality, we introduce novel schemes for fast evaluation of node split costs.As far as we know, ours is the first real-time kd-tree algorithm on the GPU. The kd-trees built by our algorithm are of comparable quality as those constructed by off-line CPU algorithms. In terms of speed, our algorithm is significantly faster than well-optimized single-core CPU algorithms and competitive with multi-core CPU algorithms. Our algorithm provides a general way for handling dynamic scenes on the GPU. We demonstrate the potential of our algorithm in applications involving dynamic scenes, including GPU ray tracing, interactive photon mapping, and point cloud modeling.","author":["Kun Zhou","Qiming Hou","Rui Wang","Baining Guo"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 27","Issue 5","December 2008","Article No.: 126","pp   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/1409060.1409079"],"date":"01 December 2008","ref":[{"text":"Carr, N.

In this paper, it is proven that genus g graphs can be embedded in O(g) pages, thus disproving the conjecture. An \u03a9(g1/2) lower bound is also derived. The first algorithm in the literature for embedding an arbitrary graph in a book with a non-trivial upper bound on the number of pages is presented. First, the algorithm computes the genus g of a graph using the algorithm of Filotti, Miller, Reif (1979), which is polynomial-time for fixed genus. Second, it applies an optimal-time algorithm for obtaining an O(g)-page book  embedding. Separate book embedding   algorithms are given for the cases of graphs embedded in orientable and nonorientable surfaces. An important aspect of the construction is a new decomposition theorem, of independent interest, for a graph embedded on a surface. Book embedding has application in several areas, two of which are directly related to the results obtained: fault-tolerant VLSI and complexity theory.","author":["Lenwood S.

The method applies to permutations that can be represented as linear mappings on the bit-level representation of the data locations. This subclass includes many important permutations such as stride permutations (corner turn, perfect shuffle, etc.), the bit reversal, the Hadamard reordering, and the Gray code reordering.The datapath for performing the streaming permutation consists of several independent banks of memory and two interconnection networks. These structures are built for a given streaming width (i.e., number of inputs and outputs per cycle) and operate at full throughput for this streaming width.We provide an algorithm that completely specifies the datapath and control logic given the desired permutation and streaming width. Further, we provide lower bounds on the achievable cost of a solution and show that for an important subclass of permutations our solution is optimal.We apply our algorithm to derive datapaths for several important permutations, including a detailed example that carefully illustrates each aspect of the design process. Lastly, we compare our permutation structures to those of J\u00e4rvinen et al. [2004], which are specialized for stride permutations.","author":["Markus P\u00fcschel","Peter A. Milder","James C.

Much of this energy is wasted in idle systems: in typical deployments, server utilization is below 30%, but idle servers still consume 60% of their peak power draw. Typical idle periods though frequent--last seconds or less, confounding simple energy-conservation approaches. In this paper, we propose PowerNap, an energy-conservation approach where the entire system transitions rapidly between a high-performance active state and a near-zero-power idle state in response to instantaneous load. Rather than requiring fine-grained power-performance states and complex load-proportional operation from each system component, PowerNap instead calls for minimizing idle power and transition time, which are simpler optimization goals. Based on the PowerNap concept, we develop requirements and outline mechanisms to eliminate idle power waste in enterprise blade servers. Because PowerNap operates in low-efficiency regions of current blade center power supplies, we introduce the Redundant Array for Inexpensive Load Sharing (RAILS), a power provisioning approach that provides high conversion efficiency across the entire range of PowerNap's power demands. Using utilization traces collected from enterprise-scale commercial deployments, we demonstrate that, together, PowerNap and RAILS reduce average server power consumption by 74%.","author":["David Meisner","Brian T.

Failures are costly both in terms of hardware replacement costs and service disruption. While a large body of work exists on DRAM in laboratory conditions, little has been reported on real DRAM failures in large production clusters. In this paper, we analyze measurements of memory errors in a large fleet of commodity servers over a period of 2.5 years. The collected data covers multiple vendors, DRAM capacities and technologies, and comprises many millions of DIMM days. The goal of this paper is to answer questions such as the following: How common are memory errors in practice? What are their statistical properties? How are they affected by external factors, such as temperature and utilization, and by chip-specific factors, such as chip density, memory technology and DIMM age? We find that DRAM error behavior in the field differs in many key aspects from commonly held assumptions. For example, we observe DRAM error rates that are orders of magnitude higher than previously reported, with 25,000 to 70,000 errors per billion device hours per Mbit and more than 8% of DIMMs affected by errors per year. We provide strong evidence that memory errors are dominated by hard errors, rather than soft errors, which previous work suspects to be the dominant error mode. We find that temperature, known to strongly impact DIMM error rates in lab conditions, has a surprisingly small effect on error behavior in the field, when taking all other factors into account. Finally, unlike commonly feared, we don't observe any indication that newer generations of DIMMs have worse error behavior.","author":["Bianca Schroeder","Eduardo Pinheiro","Wolf-Dietrich Weber"],"issue":["SIGMETRICS '09: Proceedings of the eleventh international joint conference on Measurement and modeling of computer systems","June 2009","Pages   193\u2013204","https://doi.org/10.1145/1555349.1555372"],"date":"15 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"Mosys adds soft-error protection, correction.

Unfortunately, conventional DVFS, relying on off-chip regulators, faces limitations in terms of temporal granularity and high costs when considered for future multi-core systems. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents thread motion (TM), a fine-grained power-management scheme for chip multiprocessors (CMPs). Instead of incurring the high cost of changing the voltage and frequency of different cores, TM enables rapid movement of threads to adapt the time-varying computing needs of running applications to a mixture of cores with fixed but different power/performance levels. Results show that for the same power budget, two voltage/frequency levels are sufficient to provide performance gains commensurate to idealized scenarios using per-core voltage control. Thread motion extends workload-based power management into the nanosecond realm and, for a given power budget, provides up to 20% better performance than coarse-grained DVFS.","author":["Krishna K.

Unfortunately, off-chip memory bandwidth capacity is projected to grow slowly compared to the desired growth in the number of cores. This creates a situation in which each core will have a decreasing amount of off-chip bandwidth that it can use to load its data from off-chip memory. The situation in which off-chip bandwidth is becoming a performance and throughput bottleneck is referred to as the bandwidth wall problem.In this study, we seek to answer two questions: (1) to what extent does the bandwidth wall problem restrict future multicore scaling, and (2) to what extent are various bandwidth conservation techniques able to mitigate this problem. To address them, we develop a simple but powerful analytical model to predict the number of on-chip cores that a CMP can support given a limited growth in memory traffic capacity. We find that the bandwidth wall can severely limit core scaling. When starting with a balanced 8-core CMP, in four technology generations the number of cores can only scale to 24, as opposed to 128 cores under proportional scaling, without increasing the memory traffic requirement. We find that various individual bandwidth conservation techniques we evaluate have a wide ranging impact on core scaling, and when combined together, these techniques have the potential to enable super-proportional core scaling for up to 4 technology generations.","author":["Brian M.

This enables global illumination for real-time applications as well as accelerating it for offline rendering. Image Space Photon Mapping (ISPM) rasterizes a light-space bounce map of emitted photons surviving initial-bounce Russian roulette sampling on a GPU. It then traces photons conventionally on the CPU. Traditional photon mapping estimates final radiance by gathering photons from a k-d tree. ISPM instead scatters indirect illumination by rasterizing an array of photon volumes. Each volume bounds a filter kernel based on the a priori probability density of each photon path. These two steps exploit the fact that initial path segments from point lights and final ones into a pinhole camera each have a common center of projection. An optional step uses joint bilateral upsampling of irradiance to reduce the fill requirements of rasterizing photon volumes. ISPM preserves the accurate and physically-based nature of photon mapping, supports arbitrary BSDFs, and captures both high- and low-frequency illumination effects such as caustics and diffuse color interreflection. An implementation on a consumer GPU and 8-core CPU renders highquality global illumination at up to 26 Hz at HD (1920x1080) resolution, for complex scenes containing moving objects and lights.","author":["Morgan McGuire","David Luebke"],"issue":["HPG '09: Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Graphics 2009","August 2009","Pages   77\u201389","https://doi.org/10.1145/1572769.1572783"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"Appel, A. 1968.

The historical reasons for this paradox no longer apply, but their legacy remains. This limits researchers who see the open-source software movement as an opportunity to make a scholarly contribution. Expanded definitions of scholarship acknowledge both application and discovery as important components.1 One obstacle remains: evaluation. To raise software to the status of a first-class contribution, we propose \"best practices\" for the evaluation of the scholarly contribution of open-source software.Typically, scholars who develop software do not include it as a primary contribution for performance reviews. Instead, they write articles about the software and present the articles as contributions. This conflation of articles and software serves neither medium well. An article describes an original intellectual contribution consisting of an idea, the argument for its importance and correctness, and supporting data. In contrast, software is more often an implementation of prior ideas in a usable form. It bridges the often considerable gap between an idea and the practical application of that idea. The original idea and its implementation represent distinct kinds of contribution.The critical gap is the perceived incomparability of these two contributions. Lacking a concise description adapted to the traditional practices of performance review committees, software is difficult to evaluate as a scholarly contribution and is often relegated to second-class status. We propose a framework for common assessment based on widely accepted definitions of scholarship. Within this general framework, we consider the material and procedures that a performance review committee uses to evaluate a publication. We then describe how software can be summarized in a compatible form of bibliographic citation and supplementary material.","author":["Lou Hafer","Arthur E.

This setting, in which scheduling computations close to their data is crucial for performance, is increasingly common and arises in systems such as MapReduce, Hadoop, and Dryad as well as many grid-computing environments. We argue that data-intensive computation benefits from a fine-grain resource sharing model that differs from the coarser semi-static resource allocations implemented by most existing cluster computing architectures. The problem of scheduling with locality and fairness constraints has not previously been extensively studied under this resource-sharing model. We introduce a powerful and flexible new framework for scheduling concurrent distributed jobs with fine-grain resource sharing. The scheduling problem is mapped to a graph datastructure, where edge weights and capacities encode the competing demands of data locality, fairness, and starvation-freedom, and a standard solver computes the optimal online schedule according to a global cost model. We evaluate our implementation of this framework, which we call Quincy, on a cluster of a few hundred computers using a varied workload of data-and CPU-intensive jobs. We evaluate Quincy against an existing queue-based algorithm and implement several policies for each scheduler, with and without fairness constraints. Quincy gets better fairness when fairness is requested, while substantially improving data locality. The volume of data transferred across the cluster is reduced by up to a factor of 3.9 in our experiments, leading to a throughput increase of up to 40%.","author":["Michael Isard","Vijayan Prabhakaran","Jon Currey","Udi Wieder","Kunal Talwar","Andrew Goldberg"],"issue":["SOSP '09: Proceedings of the ACM SIGOPS 22nd symposium on Operating systems principles","October 2009","Pages   261\u2013276","https://doi.org/10.1145/1629575.1629601"],"date":"11 October 2009","ref":[{"text":"The hadoop fair scheduler. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-3746.","order":1},{"text":"Open MPI. http://www.open-mpi.org/.","order":2},{"text":"Hadoop wiki. http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/, April 2008.","order":3},{"text":"P.

Rather than striping each file separately, Zebra forms all the new data from each client into a single stream, which it then stripes using an approach similar to a log-structured file system. This provides high performance for writes of small files as well as for reads and writes of large files. Zebra also writes parity information in each stripe in the style of RAID disk arrays; this increases storage costs slightly but allows the system to continue operation even while a single storage server is unavailable. A prototype implementation of Zebra, built in the Sprite operating system, provides 4--5 times the throughput of the standard Sprite file system or NFS for large files and a 20%-3x improvement for writing small files.","author":["John H.

We cluster documents based on the documents they cite in common using the Streemer clustering method, which finds cohesive foreground clusters (the knowledge communities) embedded in a diffuse background. We build predictive models with features based on the citation structure, the vocabulary of the papers, and the affiliations and prestige of the authors and use these models to study the drivers of community growth and the predictors of how widely a paper will be cited. We find that scientific knowledge communities tend to grow more rapidly if their publications build on diverse information and use narrow vocabulary and that papers that lie on the periphery of a community have the highest impact, while those not in any community have the lowest impact.","author":["Vasileios Kandylas","S.

An important characteristic of Twitter is its real-time nature. For example, when an earthquake occurs, people make many Twitter posts (tweets) related to the earthquake, which enables detection of earthquake occurrence promptly, simply by observing the tweets. As described in this paper, we investigate the real-time interaction of events such as earthquakes in Twitter and propose an algorithm to monitor tweets and to detect a target event. To detect a target event, we devise a classifier of tweets based on features such as the keywords in a tweet, the number of words, and their context. Subsequently, we produce a probabilistic spatiotemporal model for the target event that can find the center and the trajectory of the event location. We consider each Twitter user as a sensor and apply Kalman filtering and particle filtering, which are widely used for location estimation in ubiquitous/pervasive computing. The particle filter works better than other comparable methods for estimating the centers of earthquakes and the trajectories of typhoons. As an application, we construct an earthquake reporting system in Japan. Because of the numerous earthquakes and the large number of Twitter users throughout the country, we can detect an earthquake with high probability (96% of earthquakes of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) seismic intensity scale 3 or more are detected) merely by monitoring tweets. Our system detects earthquakes promptly and sends e-mails to registered users. Notification is delivered much faster than the announcements that are broadcast by the JMA.","author":["Takeshi Sakaki","Makoto Okazaki","Yutaka Matsuo"],"issue":["WWW '10: Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web","April 2010","Pages   851\u2013860","https://doi.org/10.1145/1772690.1772777"],"date":"26 April 2010","ref":[{"text":"S.

Our approach uses a natural language processing task called \u201cinformation extraction\u201d as a basis for high-precision text classification. We present three algorithms that use varying amounts of extracted information to classify texts. The relevancy signatures algorithm uses linguistic phrases; the augmented relevancy signatures algorithm uses phrases and local context; and the case-based text classification algorithm uses larger pieces of context. Relevant phrases and contexts are acquired automatically using a training corpus. We evaluate the algorithms on the basis  of two test sets from the MUC-4 corpus. All three algorithms achieved high precision on both test sets, with the augmented relevancy signatures algorithm and the case-based algorithm reaching 100% precision with over 60% recall on one set. Additionally, we compare the algorithms on a larger collection of 1700 texts and describe an automated method for empirically deriving appropriate threshold values. The results suggest that information extraction techniques can support high-precision text classification and, in general, that using more extracted information improves performance. As a practical matter, we also explain how the text classification system can be easily ported across  domains.","author":["Ellen Riloff","Wendy Lehnert"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 12","Issue 3","July 1994","pp   296\u2013333","https://doi.org/10.1145/183422.183428"],"date":"01 July 1994","ref":[{"text":"ASHLEY, K 1990 Modelhng Legal Argument: Reasonzng w~th Cases and Hypothetzcals.

Structured grid applications include stencil codes and other code structures using a dense, regular grid as the primary data structure. Fluid dynamics and heat distribution, which both solve partial differential equations on a discretized representation of space, are representative of many important structured grid applications. Using the information available through variable-length array syntax, standardized in C99 and other modern languages, we have enabled automatic data layout transformations for structured grid codes with dynamically allocated arrays. We also present how a tool can guide these transformations to statically choose a good layout given a model of the memory system, using a modern GPU as an example. A transformed layout that distributes concurrent memory requests among parallel memory system components provides substantial speedup for structured grid applications by improving their achieved memory-level parallelism. Even with the overhead of more complex address calculations, we observe up to 560% performance increases over the language-defined layout, and a 7% performance gain in the worst case, in which the language-defined layout and access pattern is already well-vectorizable by the underlying hardware.","author":["I-Jui Sung","John A.

However, the data sparsity problem of the involved user-item matrix seriously affects the recommendation quality. Many existing approaches to recommender systems cannot easily deal with users who have made very few ratings. In view of the exponential growth of information generated by online users, social contextual information analysis is becoming important for many Web applications. In this article, we propose a factor analysis approach based on probabilistic matrix factorization to alleviate the data sparsity and poor prediction accuracy problems by incorporating social contextual information, such as social networks and social tags. The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets since it scales linearly with the number of observations. Moreover, the experimental results show that our method performs much better than the state-of-the-art approaches, especially in the circumstance that users have made few ratings.","author":["Hao Ma","Tom Chao Zhou","Michael R.

PowerDial transforms static configuration parameters into dynamic knobs that the PowerDial control system can manipulate to dynamically trade off the accuracy of the computation in return for reductions in the computational resources that the application requires to produce its results. These reductions translate directly into performance improvements and power savings.Our experimental results show that PowerDial can enable our benchmark applications to execute responsively in the face of power caps that would otherwise significantly impair responsiveness. They also show that PowerDial can significantly reduce the number of machines required to service intermittent load spikes, enabling reductions in power and capital costs.","author":["Henry Hoffmann","Stelios Sidiroglou","Michael Carbin","Sasa Misailovic","Anant Agarwal","Martin Rinard"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 39","Issue 1","March 2011","pp   199\u2013212","https://doi.org/10.1145/1961295.1950390"],"date":"05 March 2011","ref":[{"text":"Intel Xeon Processor. http://www.intel.com/technology/Xeon.","order":1},{"text":"Project Gutenberg. http://www.gutenberg.org/.","order":2},{"text":"Intel Atom Processor. http://www.intel.com/technology/atom.","order":3},{"text":"Wattsup .net meter. http://www.wattsupmeters.com/.","order":4},{"text":"Xiph.org. http://xiph.org.","order":5},{"text":"D.

Because of their reconfigurability, FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) can be configured with a specialized circuit each time the parameter values change. This technique is called dynamic data folding. The specialized circuits are smaller and faster than their generic counterparts. However, the overhead involved in generating the configurations for the specialized circuits at runtime is very large when conventional tools are used, and this overhead will in many cases negate the benefit of using optimized configurations.This article introduces an automatic method for generating runtime parameterizable configurations from arbitrary Boolean circuits. These configurations, in which some of the configuration bits are expressed as a closed-form Boolean expression of a set of parameters, enable very fast run-time specialization, since specialization only involves evaluating these expressions. Our approach is validated on a ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM). We show that the specialized configurations, produced by our method use 2.82 times fewer LUTs than the generic configuration, and even 1.41 times fewer LUTs than the implementation generated by Xilinx Coregen. Moreover, while Coregen needs hand-crafted generators for each type of circuit, our toolflow can be applied to any VHDL design. Using our automatic and generally applicable method, run-time hardware optimization suddenly becomes feasible for a large class of applications.","author":["Karel Bruneel","Wim Heirman","Dirk Stroobandt"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 16","Issue 4","October 2011","Article No.: 43","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/2003695.2003703"],"date":"27 October 2011","ref":[{"text":"Altera. 2001.

Such volumetric attenuators recreate a 4D light field or high-contrast 2D image when illuminated by a uniform backlight. Since arbitrary oblique views may be inconsistent with any single attenuator, iterative tomographic reconstruction minimizes the difference between the emitted and target light fields, subject to physical constraints on attenuation. As multi-layer generalizations of conventional parallax barriers, such displays are shown, both by theory and experiment, to exceed the performance of existing dual-layer architectures. For 3D display, spatial resolution, depth of field, and brightness are increased, compared to parallax barriers. For a plane at a fixed depth, our optimization also allows optimal construction of high dynamic range displays, confirming existing heuristics and providing the first extension to multiple, disjoint layers. We conclude by demonstrating the benefits and limitations of attenuation-based light field displays using an inexpensive fabrication method: separating multiple printed transparencies with acrylic sheets.","author":["Gordon Wetzstein","Douglas Lanman","Wolfgang Heidrich","Ramesh Raskar"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 30","Issue 4","July 2011","Article No.: 95","pp   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2010324.1964990"],"date":"25 July 2011","ref":[{"text":"Agocs, et al. 2006.

To date, such computations typically use ad-hoc, domain-specific techniques developed specifically for the computation at hand. Loop perforation provides a general technique to trade accuracy for performance by transforming loops to execute a subset of their iterations. A criticality testing phase filters out critical loops (whose perforation produces unacceptable behavior) to identify tunable loops (whose perforation produces more efficient and still acceptably accurate computations). A perforation space exploration algorithm perforates combinations of tunable loops to find Pareto-optimal perforation policies. Our results indicate that, for a range of applications, this approach typically delivers performance increases of over a factor of two (and up to a factor of seven) while changing the result that the application produces by less than 10%.","author":["Stelios Sidiroglou-Douskos","Sasa Misailovic","Henry Hoffmann","Martin Rinard"],"issue":["ESEC/FSE '11: Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGSOFT symposium and the 13th European conference on Foundations of software engineering","September 2011","Pages   124\u2013134","https://doi.org/10.1145/2025113.2025133"],"date":"09 September 2011","ref":[{"text":"Xiph.org.","order":1},{"text":"D.

Parameterized tiled loops, where the tile sizes remain symbolic parameters until runtime, are quite useful for iterative compilers and autotuners that produce highly optimized libraries and codes. Although it is easy to generate such loops for (hyper-) rectangular iteration spaces tiled with (hyper-) rectangular tiles, many important computations do not fall into this restricted domain. In the past, parameterized tiled code generation for the general case of convex iteration spaces being tiled by (hyper-) rectangular tiles has been solved with bounding box approaches or with sophisticated and expensive machinery.We present a novel formulation of the parameterized tiled loop generation problem using a polyhedral set called the outset. By reducing the problem of parameterized tiled code generation to that of generating standard loops and simple postprocessing of these loops, the outset method achieves a code generation efficiency that is comparable to existing code generation techniques, including those for fixed tile sizes. We compare the performance of our technique with several other tiled loop generation methods on kernels from BLAS3 and scientific computations. The simplicity of our solution makes it well suited for use in production compilers\u2014in particular, the IBM XL compiler uses the inset-based technique introduced in this article for register tiling. We also provide a complete coverage of parameterized tiling of perfect loop nests by describing three related techniques: (i) a scheme for separating full and partial tiles; (ii) a scheme for generating tiled loops directly from the abstract syntax tree representation of loops; (iii) a formal characterization of parameterized loop tiling using bilinear forms and a Symbolic Fourier-Motzkin Elimination (SFME)-based parameterized tiled loop generation method.","author":["Lakshminarayanan Renganarayanan","Daegon Kim","Michelle Mills Strout","Sanjay Rajopadhye"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems","Volume 34","Issue 1","April 2012","Article No.: 3","pp   1\u201341","https://doi.org/10.1145/2160910.2160912"],"date":"04 May 2012","ref":[{"text":"Amarasinghe, S. 1997.

An abstract description of the required services is provided at design-time, and matching service offers are located at runtime. With the growing number of Web services that provide the same functionality but differ in quality parameters (e.g., availability, response time), a decision needs to be made on which services should be selected such that the user's end-to-end QoS requirements are satisfied. Although very efficient, local selection strategy fails short in handling global QoS requirements. Solutions based on global optimization, on the other hand, can handle global constraints, but their poor performance renders them inappropriate for applications with dynamic and realtime requirements. In this article we address this problem and propose a hybrid solution that combines global optimization with local selection techniques to benefit from the advantages of both worlds. The proposed solution consists of two steps: first, we use mixed integer programming (MIP) to find the optimal decomposition of global QoS constraints into local constraints. Second, we use distributed local selection to find the best Web services that satisfy these local constraints. The results of experimental evaluation indicate that our approach significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of computation time while achieving close-to-optimal results.","author":["Mohammad Alrifai","Thomas Risse","Wolfgang Nejdl"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on the Web","Volume 6","Issue 2","May 2012","Article No.: 7","pp   1\u201331","https://doi.org/10.1145/2180861.2180864"],"date":"04 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"Akbar, M.

DSI eliminates invalidation messages by having a processor automatically invalidate its local copy of a cache block before a conflicting access by another processor. Eliminating invalidation overhead is particularly important under sequential consistency, where the latency of invalidating outstanding copies can increase a program's critical path.DSI is applicable to software, hardware, and hybrid coherence schemes. In this paper we evaluate DSI in the context of hardware directory-based write-invalidate coherence protocols. Our results show that DSI reduces execution time of a sequentially consistent full-map coherence protocol by as much as 41%. This is comparable to an implementation of weak consistency that uses a coalescing write-buffer to allow up to 16 outstanding requests for exclusive blocks. When used in conjunction with weak consistency, DSI can exploit tear-off blocks---which eliminate both invalidation and acknowledgment messages---for a total reduction in messages of up to 26%.","author":["Alvin R.

Computations involving these maps generally require a computer, and although the numerical aspects of these transformations have been studied, there are few software implementations that are widely available and suited for general use. The Schwarz-Christoffel Toolbox for MATLAB is a new implementation of Schwarz-Christoffel formulas for maps from the disk, half-plane, strip, and rectangle domains to polygon interiors, and from the disk to polygon exteriors. The toolbox, written entirely in the MATLAB script language, exploits the high-level functions, interactive environment, visualization tools, and  graphical user interface elements supplied by current versions of MATLAB, and is suitable for use both as a standalone tool and as a library for applications written in MATLAB, Fortran, or C. Several examples and simple applications are presented to demonstrate the toolbox's capabilities.","author":["Tobin A.

Data centers typically comprise three subsystems: IT equipment provides services to customers; power infrastructure supports the IT and cooling equipment; and the cooling infrastructure removes heat generated by these subsystems. This work presents a novel approach to model the energy flows in a data center and optimize its operation. Traditionally, supply-side constraints such as energy or cooling availability were treated independently from IT workload management. This work reduces electricity cost and environmental impact using a holistic approach that integrates renewable supply, dynamic pricing, and cooling supply including chiller and outside air cooling, with IT workload planning to improve the overall sustainability of data center operations. Specifically, we first predict renewable energy as well as IT demand. Then we use these predictions to generate an IT workload management plan that schedules IT workload and allocates IT resources within a data center according to time varying power supply and cooling efficiency. We have implemented and evaluated our approach using traces from real data centers and production systems. The results demonstrate that our approach can reduce both the recurring power costs and the use of non-renewable energy by as much as 60% compared to existing techniques, while still meeting the Service Level Agreements.","author":["Zhenhua Liu","Yuan Chen","Cullen Bash","Adam Wierman","Daniel Gmach","Zhikui Wang","Manish Marwah","Chris Hyser"],"issue":["ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review","Volume 40","Issue 1","June 2012","pp   175\u2013186","https://doi.org/10.1145/2318857.2254779"],"date":"11 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"X.

It provides highly-reliable and highly-available persistent storage for objects, and supports safe sharing of these objects by applications written in different programming languages.Safe heterogeneous sharing of long-lived objects requires encapsulation: the system must guarantee that applications interact with objects only by invoking methods. Although safety concerns are important, most object-oriented databases forgo safety to avoid paying the associated performance costs.This paper gives an overview of Thor's design and implementation. We focus on two areas that set Thor apart from other object-oriented databases. First, we discuss safe sharing and techniques for ensuring it; we also discuss ways of improving application performance without sacrificing safety. Second, we describe our approach to cache management at client machines, including a novel adaptive prefetching strategy.The paper presents performance results for Thor, on several OO7 benchmark traversals. The results show that adaptive prefetching is very effective, improving both the elapsed time of traversals and the amount of space used in the client cache. The results also show that the cost of safe sharing can be negligible; thus it is possible to have both safety and high performance.","author":["B. Liskov","A. Adya","M. Castro","S. Ghemawat","R.

In addition, SSDs employ flash firmware to manage the internal resources and NAND flash characteristics. As a result, the performance of SSDs can be influenced by various underlying complexities in the firmware including garbage collection and page allocations. Unfortunately, since flash firmware is oblivious of the host-level system information and limited to manage their internal resources relying solely on incoming I/O requests, SSDs can be plagued by enormous performance variations across different I/O requests. In this poster, we propose MiFi, a Middleware and Firmware co-operative approach, which primarily targets overcoming the device-level management limitations by being aware of the host-level information as well as the underlying SSD complexities.","author":["Myoungsoo Jung","Mahmut Kandemir"],"issue":["Middleware '12: Proceedings of the Posters and Demo Track","December 2012","Article No.: 5","Pages   1\u20132","https://doi.org/10.1145/2405153.2405158"],"date":"03 December 2012","ref":[{"text":"IOR user guide.

As cache sizes increase, associativity becomes less of a win. At the same time, since costs of going to DRAM increase, it becomes more valuable to be able to pin critical data in the cache---a problem if a cache is direct-mapped or has a low degree of associativity. Something else which is a problem for caches of low associativity is reducing misses by using a better replacement policy. This paper proposes that L2 cache sizes are now starting to reach the point where it makes more sense to manage them as the main memory of the computer, and relegate the traditional DRAM main memory to the role of a paging device. The paper details advantages of an SRAM main memory, as well as problems that need to be solved, in managing an extra level of virtual to physical translation.","author":["Philip Machanick"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 24","Issue 5","Dec. 1996","pp   23\u201330","https://doi.org/10.1145/242694.242709"],"date":"01 December 1996","ref":[{"text":"Bershad","doi":"10.1145/195473.195527","order":1},{"text":"Boland and A Dollas [1994] K Boland and A Dollas.

Most notably, internal flash media bandwidth can be significantly (2-4x or more) higher than the external bandwidth with which the SSD is connected to a host system, and the higher internal bandwidth can be exploited within an iSSD. Also, SSD bandwidth is projected to increase rapidly over time, creating a substantial energy cost for streaming of data to an external CPU for processing, which can be avoided via iSSD processing. This paper makes a case for iSSDs by detailing these trends, quantifying the potential benefifits across a range of application activities, describing how SSD architectures could be extended cost-effectively, and demonstrating the concept with measurements of a prototype iSSD running simple data scan functions. Our analyses indicate that, with less than a 2% increase in hardware cost over a traditional SSD, an iSSD can provide 2-4x performance increases and 5-27x energy efficiency gains for a range of data-intensive computations.","author":["Sangyeun Cho","Chanik Park","Hyunok Oh","Sungchan Kim","Youngmin Yi","Gregory R.

Flash memory integrated within a microcontroller typically requires the entire chip to operate on a common supply voltage almost twice as much as what the CPU portion requires. Our software approach allows the flash memory to tolerate a lower supply voltage so that the CPU may operate in a more energy-efficient manner. Energy-efficient coding algorithms then cope with flash memory writes that behave unpredictably.Our software-only coding algorithms (in-place writes, multiple-place writes, RS-Berger codes, and slow writes) enable reliable storage at low voltages on unmodified hardware by exploiting the electrically cumulative nature of half-written data in write-once bits. For a sensor monitoring application using the MSP430, coding with in-place writes reduces the overall energy consumption by 34%. In-place writes are competitive when the time spent on low-voltage operations such as computation are at least four times greater than the time spent on writes to flash memory. Our evaluation shows that tightly maintaining the digital abstraction for storage in embedded flash memory comes at a significant cost to energy consumption with minimal gain in reliability. We find our techniques most effective for embedded workloads that have significant duty cycling, rare writes, or energy harvesting.","author":["Mastooreh Salajegheh","Yue Wang","Anxiao (Andrew) Jiang","Erik Learned-Miller","Kevin Fu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 12","Issue 2s","May 2013","Article No.: 91","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2465787.2465793"],"date":"01 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"Agrawal, D., Li, B., Cao, Z., Ganesan, D., Diao, Y., and Shenoy, P. 2010.

As such, GPU architects require robust tools that will enable them to quickly explore new ways to optimize GPGPUs for energy efficiency. We propose a new GPGPU power model that is configurable, capable of cycle-level calculations, and carefully validated against real hardware measurements. To achieve configurability, we use a bottom-up methodology and abstract parameters from the microarchitectural components as the model's inputs. We developed a rigorous suite of 80 microbenchmarks that we use to bound any modeling uncertainties and inaccuracies. The power model is comprehensively validated against measurements of two commercially available GPUs, and the measured error is within 9.9% and 13.4% for the two target GPUs (GTX 480 and Quadro FX5600). The model also accurately tracks the power consumption trend over time. We integrated the power model with the cycle-level simulator GPGPU-Sim and demonstrate the energy savings by utilizing dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and clock gating. Traditional DVFS reduces GPU energy consumption by 14.4% by leveraging within-kernel runtime variations. More finer-grained SM cluster-level DVFS improves the energy savings from 6.6% to 13.6% for those benchmarks that show clustered execution behavior. We also show that clock gating inactive lanes during divergence reduces dynamic power by 11.2%.","author":["Jingwen Leng","Tayler Hetherington","Ahmed ElTantawy","Syed Gilani","Nam Sung Kim","Tor M.

Analysis of systematically selected corpora of computing publications demonstrates that several of these question areas are well covered, while others are ripe for further exploration. It also provides insight into which of these questions tend to be addressed by different communities within sustainable computing. The framework itself reveals discursive similarities between other existing environmental discourses, enabling reflection and participation with the broader sustainability debate. It is argued that the current computing discourse on sustainability is reformist and premised in a Triple Bottom Line construction of sustainability. A radical, Quadruple Bottom Line alternative is explored as a new vista for computing research.","author":["Bran Knowles","Lynne Blair","Mike Hazas","Stuart Walker"],"issue":["UbiComp '13: Proceedings of the 2013 ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and ubiquitous computing","September 2013","Pages   305\u2013314","https://doi.org/10.1145/2493432.2493474"],"date":"08 September 2013","ref":[{"text":"Baumer, E.

It is based on copy-on-write, allowing for efficient snapshots and clones. It uses B-trees as its main on-disk data structure. The design goal is to work well for many use cases and workloads. To this end, much effort has been directed to maintaining even performance as the filesystem ages, rather than trying to support a particular narrow benchmark use-case.Linux filesystems are installed on smartphones as well as enterprise servers. This entails challenges on many different fronts.---Scalability. The filesystem must scale in many dimensions: disk space, memory, and CPUs.---Data integrity. Losing data is not an option, and much effort is expended to safeguard the content. This includes checksums, metadata duplication, and RAID support built into the filesystem.---Disk diversity. The system should work well with SSDs and hard disks. It is also expected to be able to use an array of different sized disks, which poses challenges to the RAID and striping mechanisms.This article describes the core ideas, data structures, and algorithms of this filesystem. It sheds light on the challenges posed by defragmentation in the presence of snapshots, and the tradeoffs required to maintain even performance in the face of a wide spectrum of workloads.","author":["Ohad Rodeh","Josef Bacik","Chris Mason"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 9","Issue 3","August 2013","Article No.: 9","pp   1\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/2501620.2501623"],"date":"01 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"Bonwick, J. and Moore, B.

In this paper, we present a template-based optimization framework, AUGEM, which can automatically generate fully optimized assembly code for several dense linear algebra (DLA) kernels, such as GEMM, GEMV, AXPY and DOT, on varying multi-core CPUs without requiring any manual interference from developers. In particular, based on domain-specific knowledge about algorithms of the DLA kernels, we use a collection of parameterized code templates to formulate a number of commonly occurring instruction sequences within the optimized low-level C code of these DLA kernels. Then, our framework uses a specialized low-level C optimizer to identify instruction sequences that match the pre-defined code templates and thereby translates them into extremely efficient SSE/AVX instructions. The DLA kernels generated by our template-based approach surpass the implementations of Intel MKL and AMD ACML BLAS libraries, on both Intel Sandy Bridge and AMD Piledriver processors.","author":["Qian Wang","Xianyi Zhang","Yunquan Zhang","Qing Yi"],"issue":["SC '13: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2013","Article No.: 25","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2503210.2503219"],"date":"17 November 2013","ref":[{"text":"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.","order":1},{"text":"G.

To broaden the applicability of approximate computing, we propose quality programmable processors, in which the notion of quality is explicitly codified in the HW/SW interface, i.e., the instruction set. The ISA of a quality programmable processor contains instructions associated with quality fields to specify the accuracy level that must be met during their execution. We show that this ability to control the accuracy of instruction execution greatly enhances the scope of approximate computing, allowing it to be applied to larger parts of programs. The micro-architecture of a quality programmable processor contains hardware mechanisms that translate the instruction-level quality specifications into energy savings. Additionally, it may expose the actual error incurred during the execution of each instruction (which may be less than the specified limit) back to software. As a first embodiment of quality programmable processors, we present the design of Quora, an energy efficient, quality programmable vector processor. Quora utilizes a 3-tiered hierarchy of processing elements that provide distinctly different energy vs. quality trade-offs, and uses hardware mechanisms based on precision scaling with error monitoring and compensation to facilitate quality programmable execution. We evaluate an implementation of Quora with 289 processing elements in 45nm technology. The results demonstrate that leveraging quality-programmability leads to 1.05X-1.7X savings in energy for virtually no loss (< 0.5%) in application output quality, and 1.18X-2.1X energy savings for modest impact (<2.5%) on output quality. Our work suggests that quality programmable processors are a significant step towards bringing approximate computing to the mainstream.","author":["Swagath Venkataramani","Vinay K. Chippa","Srimat T.

LBSNs usually have complex structures, involving heterogeneous nodes and links. Many recommendation services in LBSNs (e.g., friend and location recommendation) can be cast as link prediction problems (e.g., social link and location link prediction). Traditional link prediction researches on LBSNs mostly focus on predicting either social links or location links, assuming the prediction tasks of different types of links to be independent. However, in many real-world LBSNs, the prediction tasks for social links and location links are strongly correlated and mutually influential. Another key challenge in link prediction on LBSNs is the data sparsity problem (i.e., \"new network\" problem), which can be encountered when LBSNs branch into new geographic areas or social groups. Actually, nowadays, many users are involved in multiple networks simultaneously and users who just join one LBSN may have been using other LBSNs for a long time. In this paper, we study the problem of predicting multiple types of links simultaneously for a new LBSN across partially aligned LBSNs and propose a novel method TRAIL (TRAnsfer heterogeneous lInks across LBSNs). TRAIL can accumulate information for locations from online posts and extract heterogeneous features for both social links and location links. TRAIL can predict multiple types of links simultaneously. In addition, TRAIL can transfer information from other aligned networks to the new network to solve the problem of lacking information. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world aligned LBSNs show that TRAIL can achieve very good performance and substantially outperform the baseline methods.","author":["Jiawei Zhang","Xiangnan Kong","Philip S.

We developed a novel design methodology for dependable wireless communication systems which exploits the mutual trade-offs of system performance, hardware reliability, and implementation complexity. Our cross-layer approach combines resilience techniques on hardware level with algorithmic techniques exploiting the available flexibility in the receiver. The overhead is minimized by recovering only from those hardware errors that have a strong impact on the system behavior. We apply our new methodology on a double-iterative MIMO-BICM receiver which belongs to the most complex systems in current communication standards.","author":["Christina Gimmler-Dumont","Norbert Wehn"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 13","Issue 4s","July 2014","Article No.: 137","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/2584666"],"date":"01 April 2014","ref":[{"text":"R.

This paper proposes HYDRA, a solution framework which consists of three key steps: (I) modeling heterogeneous behavior by long-term behavior distribution analysis and multi-resolution temporal information matching; (II) constructing structural consistency graph to measure the high-order structure consistency on users' core social structures across different platforms; and (III) learning the mapping function by multi-objective optimization composed of both the supervised learning on pair-wise ID linkage information and the cross-platform structure consistency maximization. Extensive experiments on 10 million users across seven popular social network platforms demonstrate that HYDRA correctly identifies real user linkage across different platforms, and outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms by at least 20% under different settings, and 4 times better in most settings.","author":["Siyuan Liu","Shuhui Wang","Feida Zhu","Jinbo Zhang","Ramayya Krishnan"],"issue":["SIGMOD '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","June 2014","Pages   51\u201362","https://doi.org/10.1145/2588555.2588559"],"date":"18 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"T.

Whereas considerable work has focused on speeding up databases on modern hardware, communication reduction has received less attention. Existing parallel DBMSs rely on algorithms designed for disks with minor modifications for networks. A more complicated algorithm may burden the CPUs, but could avoid redundant transfers of tuples across the network. We introduce track join, a novel distributed join algorithm that minimizes network traffic by generating an optimal transfer schedule for each distinct join key. Track join extends the trade-off options between CPU and network. Our evaluation based on real and synthetic data shows that track join adapts to diverse cases and degrees of locality. Considering both network traffic and execution time, even with no locality, track join outperforms hash join on the most expensive queries of real workloads.","author":["Orestis Polychroniou","Rajkumar Sen","Kenneth A.

Since linear-time algorithms are known to compute embeddings of any bounded Euler genus, one can always assume to work with embedded graphs and, thus, obtain fast algorithms for many problems on any class of graphs of bounded Euler genus. Problems on graphs of bounded Euler genus are also important from the perspective of finding space-efficient algorithms, mostly focusing on problems related to finding paths and matchings in graphs. So far, known space-bounded approaches needed the severe assumption that an embedding is given as part of the input since no space-efficient embedding procedure for nonplanar graphs was known. The present work sidesteps this assumption and shows that embeddings of any bounded Euler genus can be computed in deterministic logarithmic space (logspace); allowing to generalize results on the space complexity of path and matching problems from embedded graphs to graphs of bounded Euler genus. The techniques developed for the embedding procedure also allow to compute canonical representations and, thus, solve the isomorphism problem for graphs of bounded Euler genus in logspace.","author":["Michael Elberfeld","Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi"],"issue":["STOC '14: Proceedings of the forty-sixth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing","May 2014","Pages   383\u2013392","https://doi.org/10.1145/2591796.2591865"],"date":"31 May 2014","ref":[{"text":"I.

The widening latency gap between high speed cores and memory has led to the evolution of multi-level SRAM/DRAM cache hierarchies that exploit the latency benefits of smaller caches (e.g. private L1 and L2 SRAM caches) and the capacity benefits of larger caches (e.g. shared L3 SRAM and shared L4 DRAM cache). The main problem of employing large L3/L4 caches is their high tag lookup latency. To solve this problem, we introduce the novel concept of small and low latency SRAM/DRAM Tag-Cache structures that can quickly determine whether an access to the large L3/L4 caches will be a hit or a miss. The performance of the proposed Tag-Cache architecture depends upon the Tag-Cache hit rate and to improve it we propose a novel Tag-Cache insertion policy and a DRAM row buffer mapping policy that reduce the latency of memory requests. For a 16-core system, this improves the average harmonic mean instruction per cycle throughput of latency sensitive applications by 13.3% compared to state-of-the-art.","author":["Fazal Hameed","Lars Bauer","J\u00f6rg Henkel"],"issue":["DAC '14: Proceedings of the 51st Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2014","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2593069.2593197"],"date":"01 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"S.

Models from diverse application areas such as computer vision, coding theory, cryptographic protocols, biology and reliability analysis can be written as probabilistic programs.   Probabilistic inference is the problem of computing an explicit representation of the probability distribution implicitly specified by a probabilistic program. Depending on the application, the desired output from inference may vary---we may want to estimate the expected value of some function f with respect to the distribution, or the mode of the distribution, or simply a set of samples drawn from the distribution.   In this paper, we describe connections this research area called ``Probabilistic Programming\" has with programming languages and software engineering, and this includes language design, and the static and dynamic analysis of programs. We survey current state of the art and speculate on promising directions for future research.","author":["Andrew D. Gordon","Thomas A. Henzinger","Aditya V. Nori","Sriram K.

Recently, hybrid PRAM and DRAM memory architectures have been proposed. It combines the advantages of DRAM and PRAM, such as low leakage power in PRAM and short write latency in DRAM. However, the leakage power in DRAM is still considerable in hybrid memories. The leakage power can only be reduced by turning DRAM into sleep state. In this paper, a novel proximity concept is proposed to guide the variable partitioning to maximize the possibility of turning DRAM into sleep mode. A novel Sleep-Aware Variable Partition Algorithm (SAVPA) is then proposed with the objective of maximizing the sleep time of DRAM while satisfying the performance and endurance constraints. The experiment results show that SAVPA reduces the energy consumption by 11.25% in average (up to 15.84%) compared to the state-of-art work with simple sleep technique.","author":["Chenchen Fu","Mengying Zhao","Chun Jason Xue","Alex Orailoglu"],"issue":["ISLPED '14: Proceedings of the 2014 international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2014","Pages   75\u201380","https://doi.org/10.1145/2627369.2627616"],"date":"11 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"CACTI: http://http://www.cacti.net/.","order":1},{"text":"MediaBench: http://euler.slu.edu/~fritts/mediabench/.","order":2},{"text":"P.

However, when considering data and code storage in Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs), such as NAND flash memories, reliability and performance become a serious concern for systems designers. Designing NAND flash-based systems based on worst-case scenarios leads to waste of resources in terms of performance, power consumption, and storage capacity. This is clearly in contrast with the request for runtime reconfigurability, adaptivity, and resource optimization in modern computing systems. There is a clear trend toward supporting differentiated access modes in flash memory controllers, each one setting a differentiated tradeoff point in the performance-reliability optimization space. This is supported by the possibility of tuning the NAND flash memory performance, reliability, and power consumption through several tuning knobs such as the flash programming algorithm and the flash error correcting code. However, to successfully exploit these degrees of freedom, it is mandatory to clearly understand the effect that the combined tuning of these parameters has on the full NVM subsystem. This article performs a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the benefits provided by the runtime reconfigurability of an MLC NAND flash controller through the combined effect of an adaptable memory programming circuitry coupled with runtime adaptation of the ECC correction capability. The full NVM subsystem is taken into account, starting from a characterization of the low-level circuitry to the effect of the adaptation on a wide set of realistic benchmarks in order to provide readers a clear view of the benefit this combined adaptation may provide at the system level.","author":["Davide Bertozzi","Stefano Di Carlo","Salvatore Galfano","Marco Indaco","Piero Olivo","Paolo Prinetto","Cristian Zambelli"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 14","Issue 1","January 2015","Article No.: 7","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/2629562"],"date":"21 January 2015","ref":[{"text":"G.

Particle filter is often used to improve accuracy. However, most of existing particle filter based approaches either are heavily affected by motion estimation errors, which makes the system unreliable, or impose strong restrictions on smartphone such as fixed phone orientation, which is not practical for real-life use. In this paper, we present an indoor localization system named MaLoc, built on our proposed augmented particle filter. We create several innovations on the motion model, the measurement model and the resampling model to enhance the traditional particle filter. To minimize errors in motion estimation and improve the robustness of particle filter, we augment the particle filter with a dynamic step length estimation algorithm and a heuristic particle resampling algorithm. We use a hybrid measurement model which combines a new magnetic fingerprinting model and the existing magnitude fingerprinting model to improve the system performance and avoid calibrating different smartphone magnetometers. In addition, we present a novel localization quality estimation method and a localization failure detection method to address the \"Kidnapped Robot Problem\" and improve the overall usability. Our experimental studies show that MaLoc achieves a localization accuracy of 1~2.8m on average in a large building.","author":["Hongwei Xie","Tao Gu","Xianping Tao","Haibo Ye","Jian Lv"],"issue":["UbiComp '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing","September 2014","Pages   243\u2013253","https://doi.org/10.1145/2632048.2632057"],"date":"13 September 2014","ref":[{"text":"https://www.indooratlas.com/.","order":1},{"text":"Angermann, M., Frassl, M., Doniec, M., Julian, B.

To distinguish between different potential stored values, conventional techniques to read data from flash memory employ a single set of reference voltage values, which are determined based on the overall threshold voltage distribution of flash cells. Unfortunately, the phenomenon of program interference, in which a cell's threshold voltage unintentionally changes when a neighboring cell is programmed, makes this conventional approach increasingly inaccurate in determining the values of cells.This paper makes the new empirical observation that identifying the value stored in the immediate-neighbor cell makes it easier to determine the data value stored in the cell that is being read. We provide a detailed statistical and experimental characterization of threshold voltage distribution of flash memory cells conditional upon the immediate-neighbor cell values, and show that such conditional distributions can be used to determine a set of read reference voltages that lead to error rates much lower than when a single set of reference voltage values based on the overall distribution are used. Based on our analyses, we propose a new method for correcting errors in a flash memory page, neighbor-cell assisted correction (NAC). The key idea is to re-read a flash memory page that fails error correction codes (ECC) with the set of read reference voltage values corresponding to the conditional threshold voltage distribution assuming a neighbor cell value and use the re-read values to correct the cells that have neighbors with that value. Our simulations show that NAC effectively improves flash memory lifetime by 33% while having no (at nominal lifetime) or very modest (less than 5% at extended lifetime) performance overhead.","author":["Yu Cai","Gulay Yalcin","Onur Mutlu","Erich F.

In contrast to the past work, this work presents a PCM translation layer that considers how the main memory is used by the operating system together with the usage patterns of storage by trading their performance and reliability. In particular, a joint management scheme is proposed to improve the capability of PCM as both main memory and storage so as to enhance the performance of the entire system. The endurance issue of PCM for main memory is resolved by utilizing the potentially large capacity of the PCM storage space with limited modifications to the existing operating system implementations. Moreover, three commands are proposed to help operating system engineers to take advantage of PCM as main memory and storage by reducing I/O overheads and speeding up both the initialization and termination of program executions. The experimental results show that the performance of PCM as both main memory and storage can be significantly improved with reasonable lifetime, while the system overhead is very limited under coarse-grained wear leveling.","author":["Bing-Jing Chang","Yuan-Hao Chang","Hung-Sheng Chang","Tei-Wei Kuo","Hsiang-Pang Li"],"issue":["CODES '14: Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis","October 2014","Article No.: 6","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2656075.2656078"],"date":"12 October 2014","ref":[{"text":"M.

We present an interaction framework in which groups of learners are formed on demand and then proceed through a sequence of activities that include synchronous group discussion about learner-generated responses. Via controlled experiments with crowdworkers, we show that discussing challenging problems leads to better outcomes than working individually, and incentivizing people to help one another yields still better results. We then show that providing a mini-lesson in which workers consider the principles underlying the tested concept and justify their answers leads to further improvements. Combining the mini-lesson with the discussion of the multiple-choice question leads to significant improvements on that question. We also find positive subjective responses to the peer interactions, suggesting that discussions can improve morale in remote work or learning settings.","author":["D.

The designed system must be able to detect the occurrence of faults globally and autonomously, in order to recover or to mitigate their effects. Two categories of faults are identified, based on their impact on the device elements; (i) recoverable faults, transient problems that can be fixed without causing a lasting effect namely and (ii) nonrecoverable faults, those that cause a permanent problem, making the portion of the fabric unusable. While some aspects can be taken from previous solutions available in literature, several open issues exist. In fact, no complete design methodology handling all the peculiar issues of the considered scenario has been proposed yet, a gap we aim at filling with our work. The final system exposes reliability properties and increases its overall lifetime and availability.","author":["Cristiana Bolchini","Chiara Sandionigi"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 20","Issue 1","November 2014","Article No.: 16","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/2676551"],"date":"18 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"P.

We present findings on the prevalence of this effect in an online platform: r/SuicideWatch on Reddit. We examine both the posting activity and post content after the death of ten high-profile suicides. Posting activity increases following reports of celebrity suicides, and post content exhibits considerable changes that indicate increased suicidal ideation. Specifically, we observe that post-celebrity suicide content is more likely to be inward focused, manifest decreased social concerns, and laden with greater anxiety, anger, and negative emotion. Topic model analysis further reveals content in this period to switch to a more derogatory tone that bears evidence of self-harm and suicidal tendencies. We discuss the implications of our findings in enabling better community support to psychologically vulnerable populations, and the potential of building suicide prevention interventions following high-profile suicides.","author":["Mrinal Kumar","Mark Dredze","Glen Coppersmith","Munmun De Choudhury"],"issue":["HT '15: Proceedings of the 26th ACM Conference on Hypertext & Social Media","August 2015","Pages   85\u201394","https://doi.org/10.1145/2700171.2791026"],"date":"24 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, existing consistency-control schemes negatively affect system performance because they frequently issue write commands to the storage device in order to guarantee data consistency and durability. Especially, when a storage class memory (SCM) is attached to memory bus as storage device, existing consistency-control schemes should be revisited because the buffer cache layer can be potentially eliminated. In this paper, we propose a novel consistency-control scheme, called MinL2R, which guarantees system reliability in the systems that have SCM device attached to memory bus. MinL2R significantly reduces the amount of backup data by performing data logging that records the original data related to updates at the granularity of a byte. In addition, MinL2R supports pointer logging in order to further reduce the logging overhead, when the size of updates is larger than the size of half of a block. To evaluate our scheme, we implemented the MinL2R prototype with SCM-aware file systems, such as BPFS and Shortcut-JFS. Then, we compared the performance of MinL2R against different file systems including Ext4, BPFS, and Shortcut-JFS, by using several I/O benchmarks. The experimental results clearly show that MinL2R outperforms by up to 286%, 291%, and 395% on BPFS, Shortcut-JFS, and the Ext4 file system with journal mode, respectively.","author":["Hyun Ku Lee","Junghoon Kim","Dong Hyun Kang","Young Ik Eom"],"issue":["IMCOM '15: Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication","January 2015","Article No.: 53","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2701126.2701227"],"date":"08 January 2015","ref":[{"text":"Everspin's CEO explains the company's technology and business. http://www.mram-info.com/everspins-ceo-explains-companys-technology-and-business, 2014.","order":1},{"text":"Everspin: 256Mb ST-MRAM chips coming soon. http://www.mram-info.com/everspin-256-mbit-st-mram-chips-coming-soon, 2014.","order":2},{"text":"R.

However existing distributed matrix computation systems generally incur heavy communication cost during the runtime, which degrades the overall performance. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix computation system, named DMac, which exploits the matrix dependencies in matrix programs for efficient matrix computation in the distributed environment. We decompose each matrix program into a sequence of operations, and reveal the matrix dependencies between operations in the program. We next design a dependency-oriented cost model to select an optimal execution strategy for each operation, and generate a communication efficient execution plan for the matrix computation program. To facilitate the matrix computation in distributed systems, we further divide the execution plan into multiple un-interleaved stages which can run in a distributed cluster with efficient local execution strategy on each worker. The DMac system has been implemented on a popular general-purpose data processing framework, Spark. The experimental results demonstrate that our techniques can significantly improve the performance of a wide range of matrix programs.","author":["Lele Yu","Yingxia Shao","Bin Cui"],"issue":["SIGMOD '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","May 2015","Pages   93\u2013105","https://doi.org/10.1145/2723372.2723712"],"date":"27 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"BLAS. http://www.netlib.org/blas/.","order":1},{"text":"Hadoop. http://hadoop.apache.org/.","order":2},{"text":"LAPACK. http://www.netlib.org/lapack/.","order":3},{"text":"Mahout. https://mahout.apache.org/.","order":4},{"text":"ScaLAPACK. http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/.","order":5},{"text":"J.

Lattice-based cryptography is one of the important candidates because of its reasonable complexity combined with reasonable signature sizes. However, in a postquantum world, not only the cryptography will change but also the computing platforms. Large amounts of resource-constrained embedded systems will connect to a cloud of powerful server computers. We present an optimization technique for lattice-based signature generation on such embedded systems; our goal is to optimize latency rather than throughput. Indeed, on an embedded system, the latency of a single signature for user identification or message authentication is more important than the aggregate signature generation rate. We build a high-performance implementation using hardware/software codesign techniques. The key idea is to partition the signature generation scheme into offline and online phases. The signature scheme allows this separation because a large portion of the computation does not depend on the message to be signed and can be handled before the message is given. Then, we can map complex precomputation operations in software on a low-cost processor and utilize hardware resources to accelerate simpler online operations. To find the optimum hardware architecture for the target platform, we define and explore the design space and implement two design configurations. We realize our solutions on the Altera Cyclone-IV CGX150 FPGA. The implementation consists of a NIOS soft-core processor and a low-latency hash and polynomial multiplication engine. On average, the proposed low-latency architecture can generate a signature with a latency of 96 clock cycles at 40MHz, resulting in a response time of 2.4\u03bcs for a signing request. On equivalent platforms, this corresponds to a performance improvement of 33 and 105 times compared to previous hardware and software implementations, respectively.","author":["Aydin Aysu","Bilgiday Yuce","Patrick Schaumont"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 14","Issue 3","May 2015","Article No.: 43","pp   1\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/2724714"],"date":"30 April 2015","ref":[{"text":"Aydin Aysu, Cameron Patterson, and Patrick Schaumont. 2013.

Most existing systems perform MER as a post-processing step on top of the MED results. In order to leverage the mutual benefits of the two tasks, we propose a joint framework that simultaneously detects high-level events and localizes the indicative concepts of the events. Our premise is that a good recounting algorithm should not only explain the detection result, but should also be able to assist detection in the first place. Coupled in a joint optimization framework, recounting improves detection by pruning irrelevant noisy concepts while detection directs recounting to the most discriminative evidences. To better utilize the powerful and interpretable semantic video representation, we segment each video into several shots and exploit the rich temporal structures at shot level. The consequent computational challenge is carefully addressed through a significant improvement of the current ADMM algorithm, which, after eliminating all inner loops and equipping novel closed-form solutions for all intermediate steps, enables us to efficiently process extremely large video corpora. We test the proposed method on the large scale TRECVID MEDTest 2014 and MEDTest 2013 datasets, and obtain very promising results for both MED and MER.","author":["Xiaojun Chang","Yao-Liang Yu","Yi Yang","Alexander G.

At array level, by considering the exact cells, both replacement and truncation schemes are introduced for approximate array divider design. A comprehensive evaluation of approximation at both cell and divider level is pursued. Different circuit metrics including complexity and power dissipation are evaluated by HSPICE simulation.

We evaluated our technique with 12 high-level synthesis benchmarks using FPGA emulated netlist-level error injection. We observe coverages of 99.13% for stuck-at faults, 99.46% for soft errors, and 99.67% for timing errors with a 25.7% area cost and negligible performance impact. Leveraging error detection latencies on the order of 10 cycles (3 orders of magnitude faster than end result check) for soft errors, we also explore a rollback recovery method with an additional area cost of 28.0%, observing a 175x increase in reliability against soft errors.","author":["Keith A.

The three major sources of LDEs, well proximity, length of oxide diffusion, and oxide-to-oxide spacing, significantly affect the threshold voltage and mobility of devices. In this paper, we propose the first work to consider the three major sources of LDEs during analog placement. We first transform the three LDE models into nonlinear analytical placement models. Then an LDE-aware analytical analog placement algorithm is presented to mitigate the influence of the LDEs while improving circuit performance. Experimental results show that our placement algorithm can effectively and efficiently reduce the LDE-induced variations and improve circuit performance.","author":["Hung-Chih Ou","Kai-Han Tseng","Jhao-Yan Liu","I-Peng Wu","Yao-Wen Chang"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 189","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744865"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"T.-C.

Among the considered objective functions are area, timing, congestion and heat distribution. The iterative nature of the algorithm assures that timing requirements are precisely met.

One promising approach to energy-efficient computation, approximate computing, trades off output accuracy for significant gains in energy efficiency. However, debugging the actual cause of output quality problems in approximate programs is challenging. This paper presents dynamic techniques to debug and monitor the quality of approximate computations. We propose both offline debugging tools that instrument code to determine the key sources of output degradation and online approaches that monitor the quality of deployed applications.We present two offline debugging techniques and three online monitoring mechanisms. The first offline tool identifies correlations between output quality and the execution of individual approximate operations. The second tracks approximate operations that flow into a particular value. Our online monitoring mechanisms are complementary approaches designed for detecting quality problems in deployed applications, while still maintaining the energy savings from approximation.We present implementations of our techniques and describe their usage with seven applications. Our online monitors control output quality while still maintaining significant energy efficiency gains, and our offline tools provide new insights into the effects of approximation on output quality.","author":["Michael Ringenburg","Adrian Sampson","Isaac Ackerman","Luis Ceze","Dan Grossman"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 50","Issue 4","April 2015","pp   399\u2013411","https://doi.org/10.1145/2775054.2694365"],"date":"14 March 2015","ref":[{"text":"Carlos Alvarez, Jesus Corbal, and Mateo Valero.

This has been in part due to the increasing availability and granularity of large-scale diffusion data, which, in principle, allows for understanding and modeling not only macroscopic diffusion but also microscopic (node-level) diffusion. To this aim, a bottom-up approach has been typically considered, which starts by considering how particular ideas, pieces of information, products, or, more generally, contagions spread locally from node to node apparently at random to later produce global, macroscopic patterns at a network level.However, this bottom-up approach also raises significant modeling, algorithmic and computational challenges which require leveraging methods from machine learning, probabilistic modeling, temporal point processes and graph theory, as well as the nascent field of network science. In this tutorial, we will present several diffusion models designed for fine-grained large-scale diffusion and social event data, present some canonical research problem in the context of diffusion, and introduce state-of-the-art algorithms to solve some of these problems, in particular, network estimation, influence estimation and control, and rumor source identification.","author":["Manuel Gomez Rodriguez","Le Song"],"issue":["KDD '15: Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2015","Pages   2315\u20132316","https://doi.org/10.1145/2783258.2789991"],"date":"10 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"B.

However, compared with numerous researches on exploiting use-after-free vulnerabilities in the user applications, few efforts studied how to exploit use-after-free vulnerabilities in Linux kernel due to the difficulties that mainly come from the uncertainty of the kernel memory layout. Without specific information leakage, attackers could only conduct a blind memory overwriting strategy trying to corrupt the critical part of the kernel, for which the success rate is negligible. In this work, we present a novel memory collision strategy to exploit the use-after-free vulnerabilities in Linux kernel reliably. The insight of our exploit strategy is that a probabilistic memory collision can be constructed according to the widely deployed kernel memory reuse mechanisms, which significantly increases the success rate of the attack. Based on this insight, we present two practical memory collision attacks: An object-based attack that leverages the memory recycling mechanism of the kernel allocator to achieve freed vulnerable object covering, and a physmap-based attack that takes advantage of the overlap between the physmap and the SLAB caches to achieve a more flexible memory manipulation. Our proposed attacks are universal for various Linux kernels of different architectures and could successfully exploit systems with use-after-free vulnerabilities in kernel. Particularly, we achieve privilege escalation on various popular Android devices (kernel version>=4.3) including those with 64-bit processors by exploiting the CVE-2015-3636 use-after-free vulnerability in Linux kernel. To our knowledge, this is the first generic kernel exploit for the latest version of Android. Finally, to defend this kind of memory collision, we propose two corresponding mitigation schemes.","author":["Wen Xu","Juanru Li","Junliang Shu","Wenbo Yang","Tianyi Xie","Yuanyuan Zhang","Dawu Gu"],"issue":["CCS '15: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2015","Pages   414\u2013425","https://doi.org/10.1145/2810103.2813637"],"date":"12 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"Attacking the Core: Kernel Exploiting Notes. http://phrack.org/issues/64/6.html.","order":1},{"text":"CVE-2010--1807. https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010--1807.","order":2},{"text":"CVE-2014--1776. http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014--1776.","order":3},{"text":"CVE-2015--3636. http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015--3636.","order":4},{"text":"Exploiting 64-bit Linux like a boss. http://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2013/02/exploiting-64-bit-linux-%like-boss.html.","order":5},{"text":"Exploiting NVMAP to escape the Chrome sandbox-CVE-2014--5332. http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/01/exploiting-nvmap-to-escap%e-chrome.html.","order":6},{"text":"GCC stack protector support. http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/arch/x86/include/asm/stackprotecto%r.h.","order":7},{"text":"Google Chromium source. https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink/","order":8},{"text":"/master/Source/wtf/PartitionAlloc.h.","order":9},{"text":"Microsoft Internet Explorer: CVE security vulnerabilities, versions and detailed reports.","order":10},{"text":"Short users guide for SLUB. https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/slub.txt.","order":11},{"text":"Understanding Valgrind memory leak reports. http://es.gnu.org/~aleksander/valgrind/valgrind-memcheck.pdf.","order":12},{"text":"J.

The high performance of DrTM are enabled by mostly offloading concurrency control within a local machine into HTM and leveraging the strong consistency between RDMA and HTM to ensure serializability among concurrent transactions across machines. We further build an efficient hash table for DrTM by leveraging HTM and RDMA to simplify the design and notably improve the performance. We describe how DrTM supports common database features like read-only transactions and logging for durability. Evaluation using typical OLTP workloads including TPC-C and SmallBank show that DrTM scales well on a 6-node cluster and achieves over 5.52 and 138 million transactions per second for TPC-C and SmallBank Respectively.

However programming such architectures is extremely difficult due to the need to implement the application using multiple programming models and combine them together in ad-hoc ways. To optimize distributed applications both for modern hardware and for modern programmers we need a programming model that is sufficiently expressive to support a variety of parallel applications, sufficiently performant to surpass hand-optimized sequential implementations, and sufficiently portable to support a variety of heterogeneous hardware. Unfortunately existing systems tend to fall short of these requirements. In this paper we introduce the Distributed Multiloop Language (DMLL), a new intermediate language based on common parallel patterns that captures the necessary semantic knowledge to efficiently target distributed heterogeneous architectures. We show straightforward analyses that determine what data to distribute based on its usage as well as powerful transformations of nested patterns that restructure computation to enable distribution and optimize for heterogeneous devices. We present experimental results for a range of applications spanning multiple domains and demonstrate highly efficient execution compared to manually-optimized counterparts in multiple distributed programming models.","author":["Kevin J.

Heterogeneity, however, increases design complexity in terms of hardware-software interactions, access to shared resources, and diminished regularity of the design. Embedded Scalable Platforms are a novel approach to SoC design and programming that addresses these design-complexity challenges by combining an architecture and a methodology. The flexible socketed architecture simplifies the integration of heterogeneous components by balancing regularity and specialization. The companion methodology raises the level of abstraction to system-level design, thus promoting closer collaboration among software programmers and hardware engineers. The architecture is supported by a scalable communication infrastructure. The methodology leverages compositional design-space exploration with high-level synthesis. The case for Embedded Scalable Platforms is made based on experiments on the development of various full-system prototypes and experience in teaching these concepts in a new graduate course.","author":["Luca P.

Despite an increasing need to analyze and manipulate large networks, only a limited number of tools are available for this task.Here, we describe the Stanford Network Analysis Platform (SNAP), a general-purpose, high-performance system that provides easy-to-use, high-level operations for analysis and manipulation of large networks. We present SNAP functionality, describe its implementational details, and give performance benchmarks. SNAP has been developed for single big-memory machines, and it balances the trade-off between maximum performance, compact in-memory graph representation, and the ability to handle dynamic graphs in which nodes and edges are being added or removed over time. SNAP can process massive networks with hundreds of millions of nodes and billions of edges. SNAP offers over 140 different graph algorithms that can efficiently manipulate large graphs, calculate structural properties, generate regular and random graphs, and handle attributes and metadata on nodes and edges. Besides being able to handle large graphs, an additional strength of SNAP is that networks and their attributes are fully dynamic; they can be modified during the computation at low cost. SNAP is provided as an open-source library in C++ as well as a module in Python.We also describe the Stanford Large Network Dataset, a set of social and information real-world networks and datasets, which we make publicly available. The collection is a complementary resource to our SNAP software and is widely used for development and benchmarking of graph analytics algorithms.","author":["Jure Leskovec","Rok Sosi\u010d"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology","Volume 8","Issue 1","October 2016","Article No.: 1","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/2898361"],"date":"15 July 2016","ref":[{"text":"S.

NASD provides scalable storage bandwidth without the cost of servers used primarily, for transferring data from peripheral networks (e.g. SCSI) to client networks (e.g. ethernet). Increasing datuset sizes, new attachment technologies, the convergence of peripheral and interprocessor switched networks, and the increased availability of on-drive transistors motivate and enable this new architecture. NASD is based on four main principles: direct transfer to clients, secure interfaces via cryptographic support, asynchronous non-critical-path oversight, and variably-sized data objects. Measurements of our prototype system show that these services can be cost-effectively integrated into a next generation disk drive ASK. End-to-end measurements of our prototype drive andfilesysterns suggest that NASD cun support conventional distributed filesystems without performance degradation. More importantly, we show scaluble bandwidth for NASD-specialized filesystems. Using a parallel data mining application, NASD drives deliver u linear scaling of 6.2 MB/s per clientdrive pair, tested with up to eight pairs in our lab.","author":["Garth A. Gibson","David F.

Our method has been built and evaluated on more than 30000 disks from two major manufacturers, monitored over 17 months.

In this paper, we describe the architecture of an interactive natural language query interface for relational databases. Through a carefully limited interaction with the user, we are able to correctly interpret complex natural language queries, in a generic manner across a range of domains. By these means, a logically complex English language sentence is correctly translated into a SQL query, which may include aggregation, nesting, and various types of joins, among other things, and can be evaluated against an RDBMS.We have constructed a\\ system, NaLIR (Natural Language Interface for Relational databases), embodying these ideas. Our experimental assessment, through user studies, demonstrates that NaLIR is good enough to be usable in practice: even naive users are able to specify quite complex ad-hoc queries.","author":["Fei Li","H.

Using DNA to archive data is an attractive possibility because it is extremely dense, with a raw limit of 1 exabyte/mm3 (109 GB/mm3), and long-lasting, with observed half-life of over 500 years. This paper presents an architecture for a DNA-based archival storage system. It is structured as a key-value store, and leverages common biochemical techniques to provide random access. We also propose a new encoding scheme that offers controllable redundancy, trading off reliability for density. We demonstrate feasibility, random access, and robustness of the proposed encoding with wet lab experiments involving 151 kB of synthesized DNA and a 42 kB random-access subset, and simulation experiments of larger sets calibrated to the wet lab experiments. Finally, we highlight trends in biotechnology that indicate the impending practicality of DNA storage for much larger datasets.","author":["James Bornholt","Randolph Lopez","Douglas M.

In this paper, we present a novel approach for EM checking using physics-based models of EM degradation, which effectively removes the inaccuracy, with negligible impact on run-time. Our main contribution is to extend the existing physical models for EM in metal branches to track the degradation in multi-branch interconnect trees. We also propose effective filtering and predictor-based schemes to speed up our implementation, with minimal impact on accuracy. Our results, for a number of IBM power grid benchmarks, confirm that Black's model is overly inaccurate. The lifetimes found using our physics-based approach are on average 3x longer than those based on a (calibrated) Black's model, such as currently used in industry. For the two largest IBM benchmarks (700K branches each), our runtime is comparable to that of the Black's based approach, requiring 3 hours for the largest grid.","author":["Sandeep Chatterjee","Valeriy Sukharev","Farid N.

Additionally, the usage of multi-bit flip-flops or flop trays to save power creates large cells that further complicate critical design tasks, such as placement. Detailed placement happens to be a key optimization transform, which is repeatedly invoked during the design closure flow to improve design parameters, such as, wirelength, timing, and local wiring congestion. Advanced node designs, with hundreds of thousands of multiple-row cells, require a paradigm change for this critical design closure transform. The traditional approach of fixing multiple-row cells during detailed placement and only optimizing the locations of single-row standard cells can no longer obtain appreciable quality of results. It is imperative to have new techniques that can simultaneously optimize both multiple- and single-row high cell locations during detailed placement. In this paper, we propose a new density-aware detailed placer for heterogeneous-sized netlists. Our approach consists of a chain move scheme that generalizes the movement of heterogeneous-sized cells as well as a nested dynamic programming based approach for wirelength and density optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in wirelength minimization and density smoothing compared with the most recent detailed placer for designs with heterogeneous-sized cells.","author":["Yibo Lin","Bei Yu","Xiaoqing Xu","Jhih-Rong Gao","Natarajan Viswanathan","Wen-Hao Liu","Zhuo Li","Charles J.

Despite of their great promise in improving performance and energy efficiency, most existing works are built on the inherent matrix-vector multiplication capability of RRAM crossbar structure, and thus lack the flexibility to adapt to future market/technology induced changes in data-intensive applications. To address these challenges, we propose an in-memory reconfigurable architecture based on RRAM crossbar structure. For the first time, it achieves a full programmability across computation and storage, and thereby provides more flexibilities of partitioning the hardware resources based on applications' needs. We further develop two complete CAD design flows to facilitate development of applications written in hardware description languages (HDLs) for our architecture, based on: 1) adaption from existing tool set developed for FPGA, 2) a custom tool design optimized towards the new architecture. Our experiments show that, both design flows are effective in exploiting flexible resources offered by our architecture and thus achieves better efficiency than state-of-art FPGAs (30% improvement in performance with 66% reduction in area).

Because traditional activity recognition utilizes supervised machine learning, unknown activity classes which do not appear in the training dataset is unable to be estimated. For this problem, zero-shot machine learning method is proposed, but it requires the preparation of semantic codes. As semantic codes, we utilize word vectors constructed from semantic word vectors and Twitter timestamps. To evaluate the proposed method, we evaluated whether we could estimate unknown activity classes, with the sensor data set collected from 20 households for 4 months, along with the user-generated labels using the web system which can estimate, modify, and add new activity types. As a result, the proposed method could even estimate unknown activity classes. Moreover, by utilizing Twitter timestamps and semantic word vectors from the Japanese Wikipedia in word vectors, the method could estimate 9 unknown activity classes.","author":["Moe Matsuki","Sozo Inoue"],"issue":["UbiComp '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing: Adjunct","September 2016","Pages   823\u2013830","https://doi.org/10.1145/2968219.2968292"],"date":"12 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"Heng-tze Cheng, Martin Griss, Paul Davis, Jianguo Li, and Di You. 2013.

The use of word embeddings in information retrieval, however, has only begun to be studied. In this paper, we explore the use of word embeddings to enhance the accuracy of query language models in the ad-hoc retrieval task. To this end, we propose to use word embeddings to incorporate and weight terms that do not occur in the query, but are semantically related to the query terms. We describe two embedding-based query expansion models with different assumptions. Since pseudo-relevance feedback methods that use the top retrieved documents to update the original query model are well-known to be effective, we also develop an embedding-based relevance model, an extension of the effective and robust relevance model approach. In these models, we transform the similarity values obtained by the widely-used cosine similarity with a sigmoid function to have more discriminative semantic similarity values. We evaluate our proposed methods using three TREC newswire and web collections. The experimental results demonstrate that the embedding-based methods significantly outperform competitive baselines in most cases. The embedding-based methods are also shown to be more robust than the baselines.","author":["Hamed Zamani","W.

Our experiments demonstrate that the large asymmetry in the channel access methodologies employed by WiFi and LTE (carrier sensing/notification in WiFi, energy sensing alone in LTE-U), can result LTE-U completely blocking WiFi transmissions, and causing significant degradation to either technologies from collisions. We address this critical sensing asymmetry with Ultron, a LTE-WiFi co-existence solution that integrates WiFi's carrier sensing and notification mechanisms into LTE, without any modifications to the LTE PHY standard. Ultron operates at the LTE base station and consists of two key components: (a) WiFi embedding that embeds appropriate data into the LTE-subframes through an intelligent reverse-engineering of the LTE PHY, so as to realize a WiFi PLCP preamble-header transmission over the air directly using the LTE PHY; and (b) scalable WiFi sensing that employs a single WiFi interface and maximizes its carrier sensing benefits to all the unlicensed channels operating at the LTE node. Our evaluations demonstrate that Ultron can increase the WiFi and LTE throughput by 5x and 6x respectively, resulting from a sharp reduction in LTE-WiFi interference.","author":["Eugene Chai","Karthik Sundaresan","Mohammad A.

However, existing efforts either describe probabilistic (and thus unreliable) attacks or rely on special (and often unavailable) memory management features to place victim objects in vulnerable physical memory locations. Moreover, prior work only targets x86 and researchers have openly wondered whether Rowhammer attacks on other architectures, such as ARM, are even possible. We show that deterministic Rowhammer attacks are feasible on commodity mobile platforms and that they cannot be mitigated by current defenses. Rather than assuming special memory management features, our attack, DRAMMER, solely relies on the predictable memory reuse patterns of standard physical memory allocators. We implement DRAMMER on Android/ARM, demonstrating the practicability of our attack, but also discuss a generalization of our approach to other Linux-based platforms. Furthermore, we show that traditional x86-based Rowhammer exploitation techniques no longer work on mobile platforms and address the resulting challenges towards practical mobile Rowhammer attacks. To support our claims, we present the first Rowhammer-based Android root exploit relying on no software vulnerability, and requiring no user permissions. In addition, we present an analysis of several popular smartphones and find that many of them are susceptible to our DRAMMER attack. We conclude by discussing potential mitigation strategies and urging our community to address the concrete threat of faulty DRAM chips in widespread commodity platforms.","author":["Victor van der Veen","Yanick Fratantonio","Martina Lindorfer","Daniel Gruss","Clementine Maurice","Giovanni Vigna","Herbert Bos","Kaveh Razavi","Cristiano Giuffrida"],"issue":["CCS '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2016","Pages   1675\u20131689","https://doi.org/10.1145/2976749.2978406"],"date":"24 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"Low RAM Con guration. https://source.android.com/devices/tech/con g/low-ram.html.","order":1},{"text":"Transparent Hugepage Support. https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/transhuge.txt.","order":2},{"text":"L.

Recently, linked data that contains both attribute and link information has become ubiquitous in various domains. For example, social media data is inherently linked via social relations and web data is networked via hyperlinks. It is evident from recent work that link information can enhance a number of real-world applications such as clustering and recommendations. Therefore, link information has the potential to advance RBMs for better representation learning. However, the majority of existing RBMs have been designed for independent and identically distributed data and are unequipped for linked data. In this paper, we aim to design a new type of Restricted Boltzmann Machines that takes advantage of linked data. In particular, we propose a paired Restricted Boltzmann Machine (pRBM), which is able to leverage the attribute and link information of linked data for representation learning. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework pRBM.","author":["Suhang Wang","Jiliang Tang","Fred Morstatter","Huan Liu"],"issue":["CIKM '16: Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2016","Pages   1753\u20131762","https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983756"],"date":"24 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"Jonathan Chang and David M Blei.

One of them is Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) --- byte-addressable, high-endurance non-volatile memory with slightly higher access time than DRAM. In this study, we conduct a preliminary assessment of HPC system performance impact with STT-MRAM main memory with recent industry estimations. Reliable timing parameters of STT-MRAM devices are unavailable, so we also perform a sensitivity analysis that correlates overall system slowdown trend with respect to average device latency. Our results demonstrate that the overall system performance of large HPC clusters is not particularly sensitive to main-memory latency. Therefore, STT-MRAM, as well as any other emerging non-volatile memories with comparable density and access time, can be a viable option for future HPC memory system design.","author":["Kazi Asifuzzaman","Milan Pavlovic","Milan Radulovic","David Zaragoza","Ohseong Kwon","Kyung-Chang Ryoo","Petar Radojkovi\u0107"],"issue":["MEMSYS '16: Proceedings of the Second International Symposium on Memory Systems","October 2016","Pages   40\u201349","https://doi.org/10.1145/2989081.2989082"],"date":"03 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"Peter Kogge, Keren Bergman, Shekhar Borkar, Dan Campbell, William Carlson, William Dally, Monty Denneau, Paul Franzon, William Harrod, Kerry Hill, Jon Hiller, Sherman Karp, Stephen Keckler, Dean Klein, Robert Lucas, Mark Richards, Al Scarpelli, Steven Scott, Allan Snavely, Thomas Sterling, R.

Firedrake adopts the domain-specific language for the finite element method of the FEniCS project, but with a pure Python runtime-only implementation centered on the composition of several existing and new abstractions for particular aspects of scientific computing. The result is a more complete separation of concerns that eases the incorporation of separate contributions from computer scientists, numerical analysts, and application specialists. These contributions may add functionality or improve performance.Firedrake benefits from automatically applying new optimizations. This includes factorizing mixed function spaces, transforming and vectorizing inner loops, and intrinsically supporting block matrix operations. Importantly, Firedrake presents a simple public API for escaping the UFL abstraction. This allows users to implement common operations that fall outside of pure variational formulations, such as flux limiters.","author":["Florian Rathgeber","David A.

Recent success in developing proof-of-principle QPUs has prompted the question of how to integrate these emerging processors into modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems. We examine how QPUs can be integrated into current and future HPC system architectures by accounting for functional and physical design requirements. We identify two integration pathways that are differentiated by infrastructure constraints on the QPU and the use cases expected for the HPC system. This includes a tight integration that assumes infrastructure bottlenecks can be overcome as well as a loose integration that assumes they cannot. We find that the performance of both approaches is likely to depend on the quantum interconnect that serves to entangle multiple QPUs. We also identify several challenges in assessing QPU performance for HPC, and we consider new metrics that capture the interplay between system architecture and the quantum parallelism underlying computational performance.","author":["Keith A.

The problem is studied for a set of semi-synchronous robots under SSY NC model when the robots may become faulty (crash fault). Depending upon the capabilities of the robots, the algorithms are designed to tolerate maximum number of faults. This work assumes weak multiplicity detection capability of the robots. The contribution of this work is in two folds. First, a distributed algorithm is presented which can tolerate at most (\u230an/2 - 1\u230b) crash faults for n \u2265 7 robots with weak multiplicity detection only. For the second algorithm, it is also assumed that robots know the mobility capacity of all the robots. The algorithm presented here can tolerate at most (n - 6) crash faults for n \u2265 7 robots.","author":["Subhash Bhagat","Krishnendu Mukhopadyaya"],"issue":["ICDCN '17: Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Networking","January 2017","Article No.: 6","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3007748.3007781"],"date":"05 January 2017","ref":[{"text":"C.

However current techniques have fundamental performance and concurrency limitations for update-heavy workloads. In this paper, we investigate the potential advantages of deferred and batched verification rather than the per-operation verification used in prior work. We present Concerto, a comprehensive key-value store designed around this idea. Using Concerto, we argue that deferred verification preserves the utility of online verification and improves concurrency resulting in orders-of-magnitude performance improvement. On standard benchmarks, the performance of Concerto is within a factor of two when compared to state-of-the-art key-value stores without integrity.","author":["Arvind Arasu","Ken Eguro","Raghav Kaushik","Donald Kossmann","Pingfan Meng","Vineet Pandey","Ravi Ramamurthy"],"issue":["SIGMOD '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data","May 2017","Pages   251\u2013266","https://doi.org/10.1145/3035918.3064030"],"date":"09 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

Its basic cell, the magnetic tunnel junction, can also be used in a low-energy stochastic regime and implement a \"synaptic\" function. It can then be the basic element for learning-capable neuromorphic chips that do not separate logic and memory and exploit the magnetic tunnel junctions with an optimum energy efficiency. Implementing this vision, however, raises challenges at the circuit level. Proper addressing of the junctions can perturb their synaptic function. In this work, we investigate several architectures for a system based on stochastic synapses, and compare them in terms of reliability and energy efficiency. These results show the high potential of this technology, and pinpoint some main design challenges and tradeoff.","author":["Adrien F.

Recently, it has been shown that for Curve25519 an efficient implementations in hardware along with side-channel protection is feasible -- yet results for the high-security Curve448 are missing. In this work we demonstrate that Curve448 can indeed be efficiently and securely implemented in hardware.

The problem is expected to become more severe in future DRAMs mostly due to increased inter-row coupling at advanced technology. In order to address this problem, we present a probabilistically managed table (called PRoHIT) implemented on the DRAM chip. The table keeps track of victim row candidates in a probabilistic way and, in case of auto-refresh, the topmost entry is additionally refreshed thereby mitigating the row hammering problem. Our experiments with PARSEC benchmark and synthetic traces show that PRoHIT outperforms the state-of-the-art method, PARA, by 35.7% (PARSEC) in terms of the reduction ratio of row-hammer cases. Our proposed method also shows constantly superior performance to PARA for synthetic traces.","author":["Mungyu Son","Hyunsun Park","Junwhan Ahn","Sungjoo Yoo"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 55","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062281"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"S.

This poses larger memory and storage space demands, however, most mobile systems have limited memory space, which in turn affects user satisfaction. For example, application response time could become longer due to limited memory capacity. Swapping is an effective way to extend memory capacity, but often lead to poor performance in smartphones. In this paper, we propose predictive process-level swapping that predicts the most rarely used (MRU) applications and dynamically swaps processes ahead-of-time. Trace-based evaluations show up to 30% increase in application launch performance compared to the worst case brought by flash-based swap. The system could retains more than 50% processes in the background with energy cost of no more than 0.03% of battery life for each trigger.","author":["Xiao Zhu","Duo Liu","Kan Zhong","Jinting Ren","Tao Li"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 22","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062317"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"J.

It also supports graceful transitions between decentralized requests in normal mode (i.e., no failures) and coordinated requests in degraded mode (i.e., with failures).

As Moore's law slows down, and the number of transistors per die no longer grows at historical rates, the performance curve of single monolithic GPUs will ultimately plateau. However, the need for higher performing GPUs continues to exist in many domains. To address this need, in this paper we demonstrate that package-level integration of multiple GPU modules to build larger logical GPUs can enable continuous performance scaling beyond Moore's law. Specifically, we propose partitioning GPUs into easily manufacturable basic GPU Modules (GPMs), and integrating them on package using high bandwidth and power efficient signaling technologies. We lay out the details and evaluate the feasibility of a basic Multi-Chip-Module GPU (MCM-GPU) design. We then propose three architectural optimizations that significantly improve GPM data locality and minimize the sensitivity on inter-GPM bandwidth. Our evaluation shows that the optimized MCM-GPU achieves 22.8% speedup and 5x inter-GPM bandwidth reduction when compared to the basic MCM-GPU architecture. Most importantly, the optimized MCM-GPU design is 45.5% faster than the largest implementable monolithic GPU, and performs within 10% of a hypothetical (and unbuildable) monolithic GPU. Lastly we show that our optimized MCM-GPU is 26.8% faster than an equally equipped Multi-GPU system with the same total number of SMs and DRAM bandwidth.","author":["Akhil Arunkumar","Evgeny Bolotin","Benjamin Cho","Ugljesa Milic","Eiman Ebrahimi","Oreste Villa","Aamer Jaleel","Carole-Jean Wu","David Nellans"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   320\u2013332","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080231"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"2005.

However, state-of-the-art image wearables available in the market are limited to capturing images periodically and do not provide any real-time analysis of the data that might be useful for the wearers. In this paper, we present DeepEye - a match-box sized wearable camera that is capable of running multiple cloud-scale deep learn- ing models locally on the device, thereby enabling rich analysis of the captured images in near real-time without offloading them to the cloud. DeepEye is powered by a commodity wearable processor (Snapdragon 410) which ensures its wearable form factor. The software architecture for DeepEye addresses a key limitation with executing multiple deep learning models on constrained hardware, that is their limited runtime memory. We propose a novel inference software pipeline that targets the local execution of multiple deep vision models (specifically, CNNs) by interleaving the execution of computation-heavy convolutional layers with the loading of memory-heavy fully-connected layers. Beyond this core idea, the execution framework incorporates: a memory caching scheme and a selective use of model compression techniques that further minimizes memory bottlenecks. Through a series of experiments, we show that our execution framework outperforms the baseline approaches significantly in terms of inference latency, memory requirements and energy consumption.","author":["Akhil Mathur","Nicholas D.

Thus, it is of the utmost importance that governments and organizations are able to successfully hold non-fraudulent representative elections. Several methods are employed in order to allow citizens to cast their votes, such as Ballot-based voting, purely electronic methods, and Electronic Voting Machines, among others. However, we argue that current methods, specially those based on electronic platforms, provide unsatisfactory levels of transparency to voters, thus harming the trust voters have that the vote they cast was the same one counted by election officials, a problem known as voter confidence. Instead of stepping back to traditional and inefficient offline strategies, we suggest the modernization of State structures by the use of emerging technologies. In this research, we explore the possibility of using Blockchain technology to help in solving those transparency and confidence problems. First, we give an overview of Blockchain itself and other uses focused on societal problems and their respective analysis. We then analyze how the adoption of Blockchain into a digital government repertoire can contribute to common e-voting issues and also promote elections transparency, increase auditability, enhance voter confidence and strengthen democracy. By attending to this poster presentation, visitors will have a clear understanding of what is Blockchain and its basic concepts, why are market and researchers so excited about it, how it can help to solve common voting systems issues, who is already using it and the benefits and potential risks of its adoption.","author":["Teogenes Moura","Alexandre Gomes"],"issue":["dg.o '17: Proceedings of the 18th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research","June 2017","Pages   574\u2013575","https://doi.org/10.1145/3085228.3085263"],"date":"07 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Response to electronic voting inquiry. pages 3--7, 2016.","order":1},{"text":"V.

In this paper, we propose a new model which learns compact topic embeddings and captures topic correlations through the closeness between the topic vectors. Our method enables efficient inference in the low-dimensional embedding space, reducing previous cubic or quadratic time complexity to linear w.r.t the topic size. We further speedup variational inference with a fast sampler to exploit sparsity of topic occurrence. Extensive experiments show that our approach is capable of handling model and data scales which are several orders of magnitude larger than existing correlation results, without sacrificing modeling quality by providing competitive or superior performance in document classification and retrieval.","author":["Junxian He","Zhiting Hu","Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick","Ying Huang","Eric P.

Algorand ensures that users never have divergent views of confirmed transactions, even if some of the users are malicious and the network is temporarily partitioned. In contrast, existing cryptocurrencies allow for temporary forks and therefore require a long time, on the order of an hour, to confirm transactions with high confidence. Algorand uses a new Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol to reach consensus among users on the next set of transactions. To scale the consensus to many users, Algorand uses a novel mechanism based on Verifiable Random Functions that allows users to privately check whether they are selected to participate in the BA to agree on the next set of transactions, and to include a proof of their selection in their network messages. In Algorand's BA protocol, users do not keep any private state except for their private keys, which allows Algorand to replace participants immediately after they send a message. This mitigates targeted attacks on chosen participants after their identity is revealed. We implement Algorand and evaluate its performance on 1,000 EC2 virtual machines, simulating up to 500,000 users. Experimental results show that Algorand confirms transactions in under a minute, achieves 125x Bitcoin's throughput, and incurs almost no penalty for scaling to more users.","author":["Yossi Gilad","Rotem Hemo","Silvio Micali","Georgios Vlachos","Nickolai Zeldovich"],"issue":["SOSP '17: Proceedings of the 26th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","October 2017","Pages   51\u201368","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132747.3132757"],"date":"14 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"M.

Most existing approaches learn node embeddings by exploring the structure of networks and are mainly focused on static non-attributed graphs. However, many real-world applications, such as stock markets and public review websites, involve bipartite graphs with dynamic and attributed edges, called attributed interaction graphs. Different from conventional graph data, attributed interaction graphs involve two kinds of entities (e.g. investors/stocks and users/businesses) and edges of temporal interactions with attributes (e.g. transactions and reviews). In this paper, we study the problem of node embedding in attributed interaction graphs. Learning embeddings in interaction graphs is highly challenging due to the dynamics and heterogeneous attributes of edges. Different from conventional static graphs, in attributed interaction graphs, each edge can have totally different meanings when the interaction is at different times or associated with different attributes. We propose a deep node embedding method called IGE (Interaction Graph Embedding). IGE is composed of three neural networks: an encoding network is proposed to transform attributes into a fixed-length vector to deal with the heterogeneity of attributes; then encoded attribute vectors interact with nodes multiplicatively in two coupled prediction networks that investigate the temporal dependency by treating incident edges of a node as the analogy of a sentence in word embedding methods. The encoding network can be specifically designed for different datasets as long as it is differentiable, in which case it can be trained together with prediction networks by back-propagation. We evaluate our proposed method and various comparing methods on four real-world datasets. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the learned embeddings by IGE on both node clustering and classification tasks.","author":["Yao Zhang","Yun Xiong","Xiangnan Kong","Yangyong Zhu"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   397\u2013406","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132918"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"Mikhail Belkin and Partha Niyogi.

A huge challenge is how to understand the question clearly so as to translate the unstructured question into a structured query. In this paper, we present a data + oracle approach to answer NLQs over knowledge graphs. We let users verify the ambiguities during the query understanding. To reduce the interaction cost, we formalize an interaction problem and design an efficient strategy to solve the problem. We also propose a query prefetch technique by exploiting the latency in the interactions with users. Extensive experiments over the QALD dataset demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective as it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both precision and recall.","author":["Weiguo Zheng","Hong Cheng","Lei Zou","Jeffrey Xu Yu","Kangfei Zhao"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   217\u2013226","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132977"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"Jonathan Berant, Andrew Chou, Roy Frostig, and Percy Liang. 2013.

High performance and extreme energy efficiency are critical for deployments of CNNs, especially in mobile platforms such as autonomous vehicles, cameras, and electronic personal assistants. This paper introduces the Sparse CNN (SCNN) accelerator architecture, which improves performance and energy efficiency by exploiting the zero-valued weights that stem from network pruning during training and zero-valued activations that arise from the common ReLU operator. Specifically, SCNN employs a novel dataflow that enables maintaining the sparse weights and activations in a compressed encoding, which eliminates unnecessary data transfers and reduces storage requirements. Furthermore, the SCNN dataflow facilitates efficient delivery of those weights and activations to a multiplier array, where they are extensively reused; product accumulation is performed in a novel accumulator array. On contemporary neural networks, SCNN can improve both performance and energy by a factor of 2.7x and 2.3x, respectively, over a comparably provisioned dense CNN accelerator.","author":["Angshuman Parashar","Minsoo Rhu","Anurag Mukkara","Antonio Puglielli","Rangharajan Venkatesan","Brucek Khailany","Joel Emer","Stephen W.

The obtained low-dimensional vector representations of nodes preserve their proximity in terms of both network topology and node attributes, upon which different analysis algorithms can be applied. Recent advances in explanation-based learning and human-in-the-loop models show that by involving experts, the performance of many learning tasks can be enhanced. It is because experts have a better cognition in the latent information such as domain knowledge, conventions, and hidden relations. It motivates us to employ experts to transform their meaningful cognition into concrete data to advance network embedding. However, learning and incorporating the expert cognition into the embedding remains a challenging task. Because expert cognition does not have a concrete form, and is difficult to be measured and laborious to obtain. Also, in a real-world network, there are various types of expert cognition such as the comprehension of word meaning and the discernment of similar nodes. It is nontrivial to identify the types that could lead to a significant improvement in the embedding. In this paper, we study a novel problem of exploring expert cognition for attributed network embedding and propose a principled framework NEEC. We formulate the process of learning expert cognition as a task of asking experts a number of concise and general queries. Guided by the exemplar theory and prototype theory in cognitive science, the queries are systematically selected and can be generalized to various real-world networks. The returned answers from the experts contain their valuable cognition. We model them as new edges and directly add into the attributed network, upon which different embedding methods can be applied towards a more informative embedding representation. Experiments on real-world datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of NEEC.","author":["Xiao Huang","Qingquan Song","Jundong Li","Xia Hu"],"issue":["WSDM '18: Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2018","Pages   270\u2013278","https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159655"],"date":"02 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Elke Achtert, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Erich Schubert, and Arthur Zimek. 2013.

Loopy Belief Propagation(LBP) is a graph inference algorithm widely used in various applications including social network analysis, malware detection, recommendation, and image restoration. The algorithm calculates approximate marginal probabilities of vertices in a graph within a linear running time proportional to the number of edges. However, when it comes to real-world graphs with millions or billions of vertices and edges, this cost overwhelms the computing power of a single machine. Moreover, this kind of large-scale graphs does not fit into the memory of a single machine. Although several distributed LBP methods have been proposed, previous works do not consider the properties of real-world graphs, especially the effect of power-law degree distribution on LBP. Therefore, our work focuses on developing a fast and scalable LBP for such large real-world graphs on distributed environment. In this paper, we propose DLBP, a Distributed Loopy Belief Propagation algorithm which efficiently computes LBP in a distributed manner across multiple machines. By setting the correct convergence criterion and carefully scheduling the computations, DLBP provides up to 10.7x speed up compared to standard distributed LBP. We show that DLBP demonstrates near-linear scalability with respect to the number of machines as well as the number of edges.","author":["Saehan Jo","Jaemin Yoo","U Kang"],"issue":["WSDM '18: Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2018","Pages   297\u2013305","https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159722"],"date":"02 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Lada A.

In this paper, we address this problem by investigating the impacts of human-robot similarity, trust in a robot, and the risk of physical danger on individuals' willingness to work with a robot and their willingness to work with a robot over a human co-worker. We report the results from an online experimental study involving 200 participants. Results showed that human-robot similarity promoted trust in a robot, which led to willingness to work with robots and ultimately willingness to work with a robot over a human co-worker. However, the risk of danger moderated not only the positive link between the surface-level similarity and trust in a robot, but also the link between intention to work with the robot and willingness to work with a robot over a human co-worker. We discuss several implications for the theory of human-robot interaction and design of robots.","author":["Sangseok You","Lionel P.

Energy-harvesting devices allow maintenance-free deployment in extreme environments, but requires a power system to provide the right amount of energy when an application needs it. Existing systems must provision energy capacity statically based on an application's peak demand which compromises efficiency and responsiveness when not at peak demand. This work presents Capybara: a co-designed hardware/software power system with dynamically reconfigurable energy storage capacity that meets varied application energy demand. The Capybara software interface allows programmers to specify the energy mode of an application task. Capybara's runtime system reconfigures Capybara's hardware energy capacity to match application demand. Capybara also allows a programmer to write reactive application tasks that pre-allocate a burst of energy that it can spend in response to an asynchronous (e.g., external) event. We instantiated Capybara's hardware design in two EH devices and implemented three reactive sensing applications using its software interface. Capybara improves event detection accuracy by 2x-4x over statically-provisioned energy capacity, maintains response latency within 1.5x of a continuously-powered baseline, and enables reactive applications that are intractable with existing power systems.","author":["Alexei Colin","Emily Ruppel","Brandon Lucia"],"issue":["ASPLOS '18: Proceedings of the Twenty-Third International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2018","Pages   767\u2013781","https://doi.org/10.1145/3173162.3173210"],"date":"19 March 2018","ref":[{"text":"Michael P.

However, irregularities in the structure of scale-free graphs (e.g., social network) limit our ability to analyze these important and growing datasets. A key challenge is the redundant graph computations caused by the presence of high-degree vertices which not only increase the total amount of computations but also incur unnecessary random data access.  In this paper, we present a graph processing system on an FPGA-HMC platform, based on software/hardware co-design and co- optimization. For the first time, we leverage the inherent graph property i.e. vertex degree to co-optimize algorithm and hardware architecture. In particular, we first develop two algorithm optimization techniques:degree-aware adjacency list reordering anddegree-aware vertex index sorting. The former can reduce the number of redundant graph computations, while the latter can create a strong correlation between vertex index and data access frequency, which can be effectively applied to guide the hardware design. We further implement the optimized hybrid graph traversal algorithm on an FPGA-HMC platform. By leveraging the strong correlation between vertex index and data access frequency made by degree-aware vertex index sorting, we develop two platform-dependent hardware optimization techniques, namely degree-aware data placement and degree-aware adjacency list compression. These two techniques together substantially reduce the amount of access to external memory. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on an FPGA-HMC platform to verify the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. To the best of our knowledge, our implementation achieves the highest performance (45.8 billion traversed edges per second) among existing FPGA-based graph processing systems.","author":["Jialiang Zhang","Jing Li"],"issue":["FPGA '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2018","Pages   229\u2013238","https://doi.org/10.1145/3174243.3174245"],"date":"15 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si and R\u00e9ka Albert. 1999.

For instance, a tool for identifying software vulnerabilities may need to rule out the existence of any backdoor to bypass a program\u2019s authentication. One approach would be to test the program using different, possibly random inputs. As the backdoor may only be hit for very specific program workloads, automated exploration of the space of possible inputs is of the essence. Symbolic execution provides an elegant solution to the problem, by systematically exploring many possible execution paths at the same time without necessarily requiring concrete inputs. Rather than taking on fully specified input values, the technique abstractly represents them as symbols, resorting to constraint solvers to construct actual instances that would cause property violations. Symbolic execution has been incubated in dozens of tools developed over the past four decades, leading to major practical breakthroughs in a number of prominent software reliability applications. The goal of this survey is to provide an overview of the main ideas, challenges, and solutions developed in the area, distilling them for a broad audience.","author":["Roberto Baldoni","Emilio Coppa","Daniele Cono D\u2019elia","Camil Demetrescu","Irene Finocchi"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 51","Issue 3","July 2018","Article No.: 50","pp   1\u201339","https://doi.org/10.1145/3182657"],"date":"23 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"Erika Abraham. 2015.

Many computational methods in detecting SCNAs were proposed in recent years, and saas-CNV is among the best performers evaluated with empirical datasets. However, saas-CNV method inefficiently uses the allele dosage information in next-generation sequencing or microarray data. To this regard, we proposed and implemented a novel approach to extract the complete allele signal information for SCNA detection. Evaluated in an empirical dataset of hepatocellular carcinoma, we demonstrated the novel approach enhanced data signal-to-noise ratio, and resulted in improved detection of copy number alternations especially focal genome changes.","author":["Long Cheng","Pengfei Yao","Jianwei Lu","Ke Hao","Zhongyang Zhang"],"issue":["ICBCB 2018: Proceedings of the 2018 6th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","March 2018","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3194480.3194482"],"date":"12 March 2018","ref":[{"text":"Ciriello, G., M.

However, due to the architectural differences between ASICs and FPGAs, comparable performance gains cannot be achieved for FPGA-based systems by using the approximations defined, particularly for ASIC-based systems. This paper exploits the structure of the 6-input lookup tables and associated carry chains of modern FPGAs to define a methodology for designing approximate multipliers optimized for FPGA-based systems. Using our presented methodology, we present SMApproxLib, an open source library of approximate multipliers with different bit-widths, output accuracies and performance gains. Being the first open source library of FPGA-based approximate multipliers, SMAp-proxLib can serve as a benchmark for designing and comparing future FPGA-based approximate arithmetic circuits.","author":["Salim Ullah","Sanjeev Sripadraj Murthy","Akash Kumar"],"issue":["DAC '18: Proceedings of the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2018","Article No.: 157","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3196115"],"date":"24 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Kartikeya Bhardwaj, Pravin S Mane, and Jorg Henkel. 2014.

Conventional approximate computing focuses on balancing the efficiency-accuracy trade-off for existing pre-trained networks, which can lead to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose AxTrain, a hardware-oriented training framework to facilitate approximate computing for NN inference. Specifically, AxTrain leverages the synergy between two orthogonal methods---one actively searches for a network parameters distribution with high error tolerance, and the other passively learns resilient weights by numerically incorporating the noise distributions of the approximate hardware in the forward pass during the training phase. Experimental results from various datasets with near-threshold computing and approximation multiplication strategies demonstrate AxTrain's ability to obtain resilient neural network parameters and system energy efficiency improvement.","author":["Xin He","Liu Ke","Wenyan Lu","Guihai Yan","Xuan Zhang"],"issue":["ISLPED '18: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","July 2018","Article No.: 20","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3218603.3218643"],"date":"23 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"P.

Each nonfaulty processor has a private value of information that must be communicated to each other nonfaulty processor. Nonfaulty processors always communicate honestly, whereas faulty processors may lie. The problem is to devise an algorithm in which processors communicate their own values and relay values received from others that allows each nonfaulty processor to infer a value for each other processor. The value inferred for a nonfaulty processor must be that processor's private value, and the value inferred for a faulty one must be consistent with the corresponding value inferred by each other nonfaulty processor.It is shown that the problem is solvable for, and only for, n \u2265 3m + 1, where m is the number of faulty processors and n is the total number. It is also shown that if faulty processors can refuse to pass on information but cannot falsely relay information, the problem is solvable for arbitrary n \u2265 m \u2265 0.

In the case of FPGA-Based accelerators, we point-out in this work the challenge of Multi-Operand Adders (MOAs) and their high resource utilization in an FPGA implementation of a CNN. To address this challenge, two optimization strategies, that rely on time-multiplexing and approximate computing, are investigated. At first glance, the two strategies looked promising to reduce the footprint of a given architectural mapping, but when synthesized on the device, none of them gave the expected results. Experimental sections analyze the reasons of these unexpected results.","author":["Kamel Abdelouahab","Maxime Pelcat","Francois Berry"],"issue":["SAMOS '18: Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation","July 2018","Pages   157\u2013160","https://doi.org/10.1145/3229631.3235024"],"date":"15 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Kamel Abdelouahab, Maxime Pelcat, Jocelyn Serot, Cedric Bourrasset, and Francois Berry. 2017.

However, they suffer from limited endurance. Therefore, cell degradation considerations are a necessity for practical deployment in non-volatile processors (NVPs). In this paper, we present two bipolar ReRAM-based NVFFs, Hypnos and Morpheus, with enhanced endurance and energy efficiency. Hypnos reduces the ReRAM electrical stress during set operation while keeping the imposed NVFF area overhead at a minimum. In Morpheus, a write-termination circuit is used to further enhance the ReRAM endurance and energy efficiency at the cost of an affordable area overhead. Moreover, both NVFFs feature run-time tunable resistive states to enable online adjustment of the tradeoff among endurance, retention, energy consumption, and restore success rate (in case of approximate computing). Experimental results demonstrate that Hypnos reduces the ReRAM set degradation by 91%, on average. Moreover, the write-termination mechanism in Morpheus further reduces the remaining degradation by 93%/97% in set/reset operation, on average. The results also demonstrate enhanced energy efficiency in both NVFFs.","author":["Mehrdad Biglari","Tobias Lieske","Dietmar Fey"],"issue":["NANOARCH '18: Proceedings of the 14th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","July 2018","Pages   19\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/3232195.3232217"],"date":"17 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"J.

In particular, wavelength-routed optical network-on-chip (WRONoC) is renowned for its high bandwidth and ultra-low signal delay. Current WRONoC topology generation approaches focus on full-connectivity, i.e. all masters are connected to all slaves. This assumption leads to wasted resources for application-specific designs. In this work, we propose CustomTopo: a general solution to the topology generation problem on WRONoCs that supports customized connectivity. CustomTopo models the topology structure and its communication behavior as an integer-linear-programming (ILP) problem, with an adjustable optimization target considering the number of add-drop filters (ADFs), the number of wavelengths, and insertion loss. The time for solving the ILP problem in general positively correlates with the network communication densities. Experimental results show that CustomTopo is applicable for various communication requirements, and the resulting customized topology enables a remarkable reduction in both resource usage and insertion loss.","author":["Mengchu Li","Tsun-Ming Tseng","Davide Bertozzi","Mahdi Tala","Ulf Schlichtmann"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 100","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240789"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"C.

Despite numerous attempts over the last decades to automate the stimuli generation based on coverage feedback, Coverage Directed Test Generation (CDG) has not found the widespread adoption that one would expect. Based on new ideas from the software testing community around coverage-guided mutational fuzz testing, we propose a new approach to the CDG problem which requires minimal setup and takes advantage of FPGA-accelerated simulation for rapid testing. We provide test input and coverage definitions that allow fuzz testing to be applied to RTL circuit verification. In addition we propose and implement a series of transformation passes that make it feasible to reset arbitrary RTL designs quickly, a requirement for deterministic test execution. Alongside this paper we provide rfuzz, a fully featured implementation of our testing methodology which we make available as open-source software to the research community. An empirical evaluation of rfuzz shows promising results on archiving coverage for a wide range of different RTL designs ranging from communication IPs to an industry scale 64-bit CPU.","author":["Kevin Laeufer","Jack Koenig","Donggyu Kim","Jonathan Bachrach","Koushik Sen"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 28","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240842"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"Krste Asanovi\u0107, Rimas Avi\u017eienis, Jonathan Bachrach, Scott Beamer, David Biancolin, Christopher Celio, Henry Cook, Palmer Dabbelt, John Hauser, Adam Izraelevitz, Sagar Karandikar, Benjamin Keller, Donggyu Kim, John Koenig, Yunsup Lee, Eric Love, Martin Maas, Albert Magyar, Howard Mao, Miquel Moreto, Albert Ou, David Patterson, Brian Richards, Colin Schmidt, Stephen Twigg, Huy Vo, and Andrew Waterman. 2016.","order":1},{"text":"Mrinal Bose, Jongshin Shin, Elizabeth M Rudnick, Todd Dukes, and Magdy Abadir. 2001.

Previous designs normally adopt a uniform accelerator architecture that processes all layers of a given CNN model one after another. This homogeneous design methodology usually has dynamic resource underutilization issue due to the tensor shape diversity of different layers. As a result, designs equipped with heterogeneous accelerators specific for different layers were proposed to resolve this issue. However, existing heterogeneous designs sacrifice latency for throughput by concurrent execution of multiple input images on different accelerators. In this paper, we propose an architecture named Tile-Grained Pipeline Architecture (TGPA) for low latency CNN inference. TGPA adopts a heterogeneous design which supports pipelining execution of multiple tiles within a single input image on multiple heterogeneous accelerators. The accelerators are partitioned onto different FPGA dies to guarantee high frequency. A partition strategy is designd to maximize on-chip resource utilization. Experiment results show that TGPA designs for different CNN models achieve up to 40% performance improvement than homogeneous designs, and 3X latency reduction over state-of-the-art designs.","author":["Xuechao Wei","Yun Liang","Xiuhong Li","Cody Hao Yu","Peng Zhang","Jason Cong"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 58","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240856"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"M.

These applications require high computational speed and are run on platforms that are size, weight, and power constrained. With the transistor scaling coming to an end, existing digital hardware architectures will not be able to meet this increasing demand. Analog computation with its rich set of primitives and inherent parallel architecture can be faster, more efficient, and compact for some of these applications. One such primitive is a memristor-CMOS crossbar array-based vector matrix multiplication. In this article, we develop a memristor-CMOS analog coprocessor architecture that can handle floating-point computation. To demonstrate the working of the analog coprocessor at a system level, we use a new electronic design automation tool called PSpice Systems Option, which performs integrated cosimulation of MATLAB/Simulink and PSpice. It is shown that the analog coprocessor has a superior performance when compared to other processors, and a speedup of up to 12 \u00d7 when compared to projected GPU performance is observed. Using the new PSpice Systems Option tool, various application simulations for image processing and solutions to partial differential equations are performed on the analog coprocessor model.<?enlrg 3pt?>","author":["Nihar Athreyas","Wenhao Song","Blair Perot","Qiangfei Xia","Abbie Mathew","Jai Gupta","Dev Gupta","J.

Although there are many optimizing methods to speed up CNN-based detection algorithms, it is still difficult to deploy detection algorithms on real-time low-power systems. Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) has been widely explored as a platform for accelerating CNN due to its promising performance, high energy efficiency, and flexibility. Previous works show that the energy consumption of CNN accelerators is dominated by the memory access. By fusing multiple layers in CNN, the intermediate data transfer can be reduced. However, previous accelerators with the cross-layer scheduling are designed for a particular CNN model. In addition to the memory access optimization, the Winograd algorithm can greatly improve the computational performance of convolution.In this article, to improve the flexibility of hardware, we design an instruction-driven CNN accelerator, supporting the Winograd algorithm and the cross-layer scheduling, for object detection. We modify the loop unrolling order of CNN, so that we can schedule a CNN across different layers with instructions and eliminate the intermediate data transfer. We propose a hardware architecture to support the instructions with Winograd computation units and reach the state-of-the-art energy efficiency. To deploy image detection algorithms onto the proposed accelerator with fixed-point computation units, we adopt the fixed-point fine-tune method, which can guarantee the accuracy of the detection algorithms.We evaluate our accelerator and scheduling policy on the Xilinx KU115 FPGA platform. The intermediate data transfer can be reduced by more than 90% on the VGG-D CNN model with the cross-layer strategy. Thus, the performance of our hardware accelerator reaches 1700GOP/s on the classification model VGG-D. We also implement a framework for object detection algorithms, which achieves 2.3\u00d7 and 50\u00d7 in energy efficiency compared with GPU and CPU, respectively. Compared with floating-point algorithms, the accuracy of the fixed-point detection algorithms only drops by less than 1%.","author":["Jincheng Yu","Guangjun Ge","Yiming Hu","Xuefei Ning","Jiantao Qiu","Kaiyuan Guo","Yu Wang","Huazhong Yang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 11","Issue 3","December 2018","Article No.: 22","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3283452"],"date":"15 December 2018","ref":[{"text":"M.

However, their computational load is significant, motivating the development of CNN-specialized accelerators. This work presents NEURAghe, a flexible and efficient hardware/software solution for the acceleration of CNNs on Zynq SoCs. NEURAghe leverages the synergistic usage of Zynq ARM cores and of a powerful and flexible Convolution-Specific Processor deployed on the reconfigurable logic. The Convolution-Specific Processor embeds both a convolution engine and a programmable soft core, releasing the ARM processors from most of the supervision duties and allowing the accelerator to be controlled by software at an ultra-fine granularity. This methodology opens the way for cooperative heterogeneous computing: While the accelerator takes care of the bulk of the CNN workload, the ARM cores can seamlessly execute hard-to-accelerate parts of the computational graph, taking advantage of the NEON vector engines to further speed up computation. Through the companion NeuDNN SW stack, NEURAghe supports end-to-end CNN-based classification with a peak performance of 169GOps/s, and an energy efficiency of 17GOps/W. Thanks to our heterogeneous computing model, our platform improves upon the state-of-the-art, achieving a frame rate of 5.5 frames per second (fps) on the end-to-end execution of VGG-16 and 6.6fps on ResNet-18.","author":["Paolo Meloni","Alessandro Capotondi","Gianfranco Deriu","Michele Brian","Francesco Conti","Davide Rossi","Luigi Raffo","Luca Benini"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 11","Issue 3","December 2018","Article No.: 18","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/3284357"],"date":"12 December 2018","ref":[{"text":"Altera. 2017.

However, most ReRAM based accelerators cannot support efficient mapping for sparse NN, and we need to map the whole dense matrix onto ReRAM crossbar array to achieve O(1) computation complexity. In this paper, we propose a sparse NN mapping scheme based on elements clustering to achieve better ReRAM crossbar utilization. Further, we propose crossbar-grained pruning algorithm to remove the crossbars with low utilization. Finally, since most current ReRAM devices cannot achieve high precision, we analyze the effect of quantization precision for sparse NN, and propose to complete high-precision composing in the analog field and design related periphery circuits. In our experiments, we discuss how the system performs with different crossbar sizes to choose the optimized design. Our results show that our mapping scheme for sparse NN with proposed pruning algorithm achieves 3 -- 5X energy efficiency and more than 2.5 -- 6X speedup, compared with those accelerators for dense NN. Also, the accuracy experiments show that our pruning method appears to have almost no accuracy loss.","author":["Jilan Lin","Zhenhua Zhu","Yu Wang","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["ASPDAC '19: Proceedings of the 24th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2019","Pages   639\u2013644","https://doi.org/10.1145/3287624.3287715"],"date":"21 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"H.-S.

The underlying computation of HD involves a substantial number of element-wise operations (e.g., addition and multiplications) on ultra-wise hypervectors, in the granularities of as small as a single bit, which can be effectively parallelized and pipelined. In addition, though different HD applications might vary in terms of number of input features and output classes (labels), they generally follow the same computation flow. Such characteristics of HD computing inimitably matches with the intrinsic capabilities of FPGAs, making these devices a unique solution for accelerating these applications. In this paper, we propose F5-HD, a fast and flexible FPGA-based framework for refreshing the performance of HD computing. F5-HD eliminates the arduous task of handcrafted designing of hardware accelerators by automatically generating an FPGA implementation of HD accelerator leveraging a template of optimized processing elements, according to the applications specification and user's constraint. Our evaluations using different classification benchmarks revealed that F5-HD provides 6.9x and 7.8\u00d7 (11.9\u00d7 and 1.7\u00d7) higher energy efficiency improvement and faster training (inference) as compared to an optimized implementation of HD on AMD R9 390 GPU, respectively.","author":["Sahand Salamat","Mohsen Imani","Behnam Khaleghi","Tajana Rosing"],"issue":["FPGA '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2019","Pages   53\u201362","https://doi.org/10.1145/3289602.3293913"],"date":"20 February 2019","ref":[{"text":"P.

Deep RL exploits a DNN to eliminate the need for handcrafted feature engineering that requires prior domain knowledge. The Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) is one of the state-of-the-art Deep RL methods. In this paper, we present an FPGA-based A3C Deep RL platform, called FA3C. Traditionally, FPGA-based DNN accelerators have mainly focused on inference only by exploiting fixed-point arithmetic. Our platform targets both inference and training using single-precision floating-point arithmetic. We demonstrate the performance and energy efficiency of FA3C using multiple A3C agents that learn the control policies of six Atari 2600 games. Its performance is better than a high-end GPU-based platform (NVIDIA Tesla P100). FA3C achieves 27.9% better performance than that of a state-of-the-art GPU-based implementation. Moreover, the energy efficiency of FA3C is 1.62x better than that of the GPU-based implementation.","author":["Hyungmin Cho","Pyeongseok Oh","Jiyoung Park","Wookeun Jung","Jaejin Lee"],"issue":["ASPLOS '19: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","April 2019","Pages   499\u2013513","https://doi.org/10.1145/3297858.3304058"],"date":"04 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"Martin Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, Manjunath Kudlur, Josh Levenberg, Rajat Monga, Sherry Moore, Derek G.

Given a workspace that is characterized by a set of polytopic obstacles, our objective is to compute the set of safe initial states such that a robot trajectory starting from these initial states is guaranteed to avoid the obstacles. Our approach is to construct a finite state abstraction of the system and use standard reachability analysis over the finite state abstraction to compute the set of safe initial states. To mathematically model the imaging function, that maps the robot position to the LiDAR image, we introduce the notion of imaging-adapted partitions of the workspace in which the imaging function is guaranteed to be affine. Given this workspace partitioning, a discrete-time linear dynamics of the robot, and a pre-trained NN controller with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) non-linearity, we utilize a Satisfiability Modulo Convex (SMC) encoding to enumerate all the possible assignments of different ReLUs. To accelerate this process, we develop a pre-processing algorithm that could rapidly prune the space of feasible ReLU assignments. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms using numerical simulations with the increasing complexity of the neural network controller.","author":["Xiaowu Sun","Haitham Khedr","Yasser Shoukry"],"issue":["HSCC '19: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control","April 2019","Pages   147\u2013156","https://doi.org/10.1145/3302504.3311802"],"date":"16 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"Wikipedia, \"List of autonomous car fatalities,\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_autonomous_car_fatalities.","order":1},{"text":"A.

However, it has not been fully considered in graph neural network for heterogeneous graph which contains different types of nodes and links. The heterogeneity and rich semantic information bring great challenges for designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one of the most exciting advancements in deep learning is the attention mechanism, whose great potential has been well demonstrated in various areas. In this paper, we first propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network based on the hierarchical attention, including node-level and semantic-level attentions. Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between a node and its meta-path based neighbors, while the semantic-level attention is able to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learned importance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance of node and meta-path can be fully considered. Then the proposed model can generate node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighbors in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposed model over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate its potentially good interpretability for graph analysis.","author":["Xiao Wang","Houye Ji","Chuan Shi","Bai Wang","Yanfang Ye","Peng Cui","Philip S Yu"],"issue":["WWW '19: The World Wide Web Conference","May 2019","Pages   2022\u20132032","https://doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313562"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2015.

Can this security be guaranteed to classical users of a quantum protocol, who may not even trust the quantum devices used to implement the protocol?This central question dates back to the early 1990s when the challenge of achieving Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (DIQKD) was first formulated. We answer the challenge by rigorously proving the device-independent security of an entanglement-based protocol building on Ekert's original proposal for quantum key distribution. The proof of security builds on techniques from the classical theory of pseudo-randomness to achieve a new quantitative understanding of the non-local nature of quantum correlations.","author":["Umesh Vazirani","Thomas Vidick"],"issue":["Communications of the ACM","Volume 62","Issue 4","April 2019","pp   133","https://doi.org/10.1145/3310974"],"date":"20 March 2019","ref":[{"text":"Ac\u00edn, A., Brunner, N., Gisin, N., Massar, S., Pironio, S., Scarani, V.

Recent research on generative learning have produced powerful image-to-image translation methods in supervised setting, where paired training datasets are available. However, collecting paired training data is difficult, expensive and required manual authoring. We present an evaluation study of recent unsupervised Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models that can learn to translate a facial image from a source domain X to a target domain Y without paired labeled training dataset. Each GAN model is trained on the same facial image dataset and comparable hyperparameters.

The edge computing demand in the Internet-of-Things era has motivated many kinds of computing platforms to accelerate the DNN operations. The most common platforms are CPU, GPU, ASIC, and FPGA. However, these platforms suffer from low performance (i.e., CPU and GPU), large power consumption (i.e., CPU, GPU, ASIC, and FPGA), or low computational flexibility at runtime (i.e., FPGA and ASIC). In this paper, we suggest the NoC-based DNN platform as a new accelerator design paradigm. The NoC-based designs can reduce the off-chip memory accesses through a flexible interconnect that facilitates data exchange between processing elements on the chip. We first comprehensively investigate conventional platforms and methodologies used in DNN computing. Then we study and analyze different design parameters to implement the NoC-based DNN accelerator. The presented accelerator is based on mesh topology, neuron clustering, random mapping, and XY-routing. The experimental results on LeNet, MobileNet, and VGG-16 models show the benefits of the NoC-based DNN accelerator in reducing off-chip memory accesses and improving runtime computational flexibility.","author":["Kun-Chih (Jimmy) Chen","Masoumeh Ebrahimi","Ting-Yi Wang","Yuch-Chi Yang"],"issue":["NOCS '19: Proceedings of the 13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip","October 2019","Article No.: 11","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3313231.3352376"],"date":"17 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"K.

While some works have been done to accelerate the computations required by Linux kernel software, they are either application-specific solutions or tightly coupled with the certain computing platforms and are not able to support the general-purpose in-kernel accelerations using different types of processors. In this article, the general-purpose software framework called Kernel acceleration with OpenCL (KOCL), is proposed to tackle the problem. KOCL exposes a set of the high-level programming interfaces for the Linux kernel module developers to offload compute-intensive tasks on different hardware accelerators without managing and coordinating the platform-specific computing and memory resources. The simplified programming efforts are achieved by the developed platform management and memory models, which provide a systematic means of managing the heterogeneous hardware resources. In addition, the one- and zero-copy data-buffering schemes are offered by KOCL, so that the offloaded tasks deliver high performance on the platforms with different memory architectures. We have developed the prototype system to accelerate the Network-Attached Storage server applications. Significant performance improvements are achieved with the three different types of accelerators, i.e., the multicore processor, the integrated GPU, and the discrete GPU, respectively. We believe that KOCL is useful for the design of embedded appliances to evaluate the performance of design alternatives.","author":["Chia-Heng Tu","Te-Sheng Lin"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 24","Issue 3","June 2019","Article No.: 30","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/3315569"],"date":"28 March 2019","ref":[{"text":"A.

Smart Packets is an Active Networks project focusing on applying active networks technology to network management and monitoring. Messages in active networks are programs that are executed at nodes on the path to one or more target hosts. Smart Packets programs are written in a tightly encoded, safe language specifically designed to support network management and avoid dangerous constructs and accesses. Smart Packets improves the management of large complex networks by (1) moving management decision points closer to the node being managed, (2) targeting specific aspects of the node for information rather than  exhaustive collection via polling, and (3) abstracting the management concepts to language constructs, allowing nimble network control.","author":["Beverly Schwartz","Alden W.

Big data of large-scale wireless networks has the key features of wide variety, high volume, real-time velocity, and huge value leading to the unique research challenges that are different from existing computing systems. In this article, we present a survey of the state-of-art big data analytics (BDA) approaches for large-scale wireless networks. In particular, we categorize the life cycle of BDA into four consecutive stages: Data Acquisition, Data Preprocessing, Data Storage, and Data Analytics. We then present a detailed survey of the technical solutions to the challenges in BDA for large-scale wireless networks according to each stage in the life cycle of BDA. Moreover, we discuss the open research issues and outline the future directions in this promising area.","author":["Hong-Ning Dai","Raymond Chi-Wing Wong","Hao Wang","Zibin Zheng","Athanasios V.

Network coding allows intermediate nodes to perform arbitrary coding operations on Data packets. One salient feature of NDN is its content-based security by protecting each Data packet with a signature signed by its publisher. However, in the network coding-based NDN, it remains unclear how to securely and efficiently sign a recoded Data packet at an intermediate router. This work proposes a mechanism to enable linearly homomorphic signatures in network coding-based NDN so as to directly generate a signature for a recoded Data packet by combining the signatures of those Data packets on which the recoding operation is performed.","author":["Xiaoyan Hu","Shaoqi Zheng","Jian Gong","Guang Cheng","Guoqiang Zhang","Ruidong Li"],"issue":["CFI'19: Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Future Internet Technologies","August 2019","Article No.: 2","Pages   1\u20134","https://doi.org/10.1145/3341188.3341191"],"date":"07 August 2019","ref":[{"text":"{n.d.}.

Recent work has proposed using chargesharing on the bit-lines of a memory in order to compute in-place and with massive parallelism, all without having to move data across the memory bus. Unfortunately, prior work has required modification to RAM designs (e.g. adding multiple row decoders) in order to open multiple rows simultaneously. So far, the competitive and low-margin nature of the DRAM industry has made commercial DRAM manufacturers resist adding any additional logic into DRAM. This paper addresses the need for in-memory computation with little to no change to DRAM designs. It is the first work to demonstrate in-memory computation with off-the-shelf, unmodified, commercial, DRAM. This is accomplished by violating the nominal timing specification and activating multiple rows in rapid succession, which happens to leave multiple rows open simultaneously, thereby enabling bit-line charge sharing. We use a constraint-violating command sequence to implement and demonstrate row copy, logical OR, and logical AND in unmodified, commodity, DRAM. Subsequently, we employ these primitives to develop an architecture for arbitrary, massively-parallel, computation. Utilizing a customized DRAM controller in an FPGA and commodity DRAM modules, we characterize this opportunity in hardware for all major DRAM vendors. This work stands as a proof of concept that in-memory computation is possible with unmodified DRAM modules and that there exists a financially feasible way for DRAM manufacturers to support in-memory compute.","author":["Fei Gao","Georgios Tziantzioulis","David Wentzlaff"],"issue":["MICRO '52: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","October 2019","Pages   100\u2013113","https://doi.org/10.1145/3352460.3358260"],"date":"12 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Shaizeen Aga, Supreet Jeloka, Arun Subramaniyan, Satish Narayanasamy, David Blaauw, and Reetuparna Das. 2017.

Lifted data representations might enable a new class of semantic agents for complex decision-making on the Web, reaching from filling out Web forms and booking flights to mastering any Web-based task. However, exclusively using semantic models has several drawbacks, such as extensive manual efforts for enabling semantic agents to solve Web tasks or limited capabilities to personalize task solutions for end users. While using semantics is a crucial component for guiding prospective semantic agents, we have to find a balance between modelling rich background knowledge and learning optimal agent behaviour through advanced Machine Learning (ML) methods. In this work, we propose a semantic agent framework for (i) modelling agent-related semantic annotations for Web tasks, (ii) using the latter to train statistical agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in an offline simulation as well as in real online use and (iii) feeding back the learned agent behaviour and its provenance information in terms of a semantic model that can be directly used by purely semantics-based agents. We evaluate our approach based on the MiniWob++ benchmark for automatically solving Web tasks. We show that our proposed semantic agent framework enables to (i) warm start agents with semantic background knowledge to faster learn task-dependent optimal behaviour in terms of the expected cumulative reward and (ii) directly reuse the learned behaviour by semantic-based agents that act by automatically derived Notation3 (N3) implication rules.","author":["Nicole Merkle","Patrick Philipp"],"issue":["K-CAP '19: Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Knowledge Capture","September 2019","Pages   205\u2013212","https://doi.org/10.1145/3360901.3364417"],"date":"23 September 2019","ref":[{"text":"J.

However, a key challenge that arises in resistive crossbars is that non-idealities in the synaptic devices, interconnects, and peripheral circuits of resistive crossbars lead to errors in the computations performed. When large-scale DNNs are executed on resistive crossbar systems, these errors compound and result in unacceptable degradation in application-level accuracy. We propose CxDNN, a hardware-software methodology that enables the realization of large-scale DNNs on crossbar systems by compensating for errors due to non-idealities, greatly mitigating the degradation in accuracy. CxDNN is composed of (i) an optimized mapping technique to convert floating-point weights and activations to crossbar conductances and input voltages, (ii) a fast one-time re-training method to recover accuracy loss due to this conversion, and (iii) low-overhead compensation hardware to mitigate dynamic and hardware-instance-specific errors. Unlike previous efforts that are limited to small networks and require the training and deployment of hardware-instance-specific models, CxDNN presents a scalable compensation methodology that can address large DNNs (e.g., ResNet-50 on ImageNet) and maintains the train-once-deploy-anywhere tenet of current DNN application. We evaluated CxDNN on six top DNNs on the ImageNet dataset with 0.5--13.8 million neurons and 0.5--15.5 billion connections. CxDNN achieves 16.9%--49% improvement in the top-1 classification accuracy, effectively mitigating a key challenge to the use of resistive crossbar--based neural fabrics.","author":["Shubham Jain","Anand Raghunathan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 18","Issue 6","January 2020","Article No.: 113","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3362035"],"date":"15 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"A.

Pre-automatic diagnosis seems a good solution to increase the service quality of trouble shooting for information technology outsourcing. Developing an expert system for pre-automatic diagnosis should be the better approach to speed up the service. The main purpose of this study is to explore how IT outsourcing service providers build a case-based reasoning expert system for trouble shooting. To solve problems, a case-based reasoning system retrieves information from one or more previous cases for reference. Then this developed system modifies the cases to adapt to the new situation. By this way, cases can be reused, and previous experiences can be retained. Finally, current cases will be combined into existing knowledge base After searching solutions for references, the study chooses the method of K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to classify clients' problems. This will increase the efficiency and accuracy in searching for the best solution.

However, we are yet to enjoy such improvement in real-world environments, as they lack rich scattering and preclude effective MIMO spatial multiplexing. In this paper, we present ScatterMIMO, which uses smart surface to increase the scattering in the environment, to provide MIMO spatial multiplexing gain. Specifically, smart surface pairs up with a wireless transmitter device say an active AP and re-radiates the same amount of power as any active access point (AP), thereby creating virtual passive APs. ScatterMIMO avoids the synchronization, interference, and power requirements of conventional distributed MIMO systems by leveraging virtual passive APs, allowing its smart surface to provide spatial multiplexing gain, which can be deployed at a very low cost. We show that with optimal placement, these virtual APs can provide signals to their clients with power comparable to real active APs, and can increase the coverage of an AP. Furthermore, we design algorithms to optimize ScatterMIMO's smart surface for each client with minimal measurement overhead and to overcome random per-packet phase offsets during the measurement. Our evaluations show that with commercial off-the-shelf MIMO WiFi (11ac) AP and unmodified clients, ScatterMIMO provides a median throughput improvement of 2 X over the active AP alone.","author":["Manideep Dunna","Chi Zhang","Daniel Sievenpiper","Dinesh Bharadia"],"issue":["MobiCom '20: Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking","April 2020","Article No.: 10","Pages   1\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/3372224.3380887"],"date":"16 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"2015.

We have designed an OpenACC compiler for FPGA to generate the kernel code by using stream processing Domain Specific Language (DSL) called SPGen, with OpenCL. Although, recently, the programming for FPGA has been improved dramatically by High-Level Synthesis (HLS) frameworks such as OpenCL and HLS C, yet it is still too difficult for HPC application developers, and the directive-based programming models such as OpenACC should be supported even for FPGA. OpenCL can be used as a portable intermediate code for OpenACC for FPGA. However, the generation of hardware from OpenCL is not easy to understand and therefore requires expert knowledge. SPGen is a DSL framework for generating stream processing HDL modules from the description of a dataflow graph. The advantage of our approach is that the code generation with SPGen enables more comprehensive low-level optimization in the OpenACC compiler. The preliminary evaluation results show that, for some kernels, the proposed method, which translates the OpenACC C code into OpenCL and SPGen codes, can perform optimization in the lower level more explicitly than the OpenCL-only method, which translates the OpenACC C code into the OpenCL code only. We also observed that more resources might be consumed in the proposed method. However, implementations of both methods are preliminary. We believe improving code generation will fix the problems such as high resource consumption.","author":["Yutaka Watanabe","Jinpil Lee","Kentaro Sano","Taisuke Boku","Mitsuhisa Sato"],"issue":["HPCAsia2020: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing in Asia-Pacific Region Workshops","January 2020","Pages   10\u201316","https://doi.org/10.1145/3373271.3373274"],"date":"15 January 2020","ref":[{"text":"Zohouri, Hamid Reza, Naoya Maruyama, Aaron Smith, Motohiko Matsuda, and Satoshi Matsuoka. \"Evaluating and optimizing OpenCL kernels for high performance computing with FPGAs.\" In SC'16: Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis, pp. 409--420.

The Orlando SoC architecture from STMicroelectronics targets exactly this class of problems by integrating hardware-accelerated convolutional blocks together with DSPs and on-chip memory resources to enable energy-efficient designs of DCNNs. The main advantage of the Orlando platform is to have runtime configurable convolutional accelerators that can adapt to different DCNN workloads. This opens new challenges for mapping the computation to the accelerators and for managing the on-chip resources efficiently. In this work, we propose a runtime design space exploration and mapping methodology for runtime resource management in terms of on-chip memory, convolutional accelerators, and external bandwidth.

As the era of Moore\u2019s law draws to a close, many new non\u2013von Neumann processors are emerging as potential computational accelerators, including those based on the principles of neuromorphic computing, tensor algebra, and quantum information. While development of these new processors is continuing to mature, the potential impact on accelerated computing is anticipated to be profound. We discuss how different processing models can advance computing in key scientific paradigms: machine learning and constraint satisfaction. Significantly, each of these new processor types utilizes a fundamentally different model of computation, and this raises questions about how to best use such processors in the design and implementation of applications. While many processors are being developed with a specific domain target, the ubiquity of spin-glass models and neural networks provides an avenue for multi-functional applications. This also hints at the infrastructure needed to integrate next-generation processing units into future high-performance computing systems.","author":["Kathleen E. Hamilton","Catherine D.

In addition, novel circuit architectures have been proposed that rely on newly discovered or predicted behavior of ReRAM. One such architecture is the memristive Dynamic Adaptive Neural Network Array, developed to emulate the functionality of a biological neuron system. We demonstrated ReRAM devices that show a synaptic tendency by changing their resistance in an analog fashion. The CMOS compatible nanoscale ReRAM devices shown are based on an HfO2 switching layer that sits on a tungsten electrode and is covered by a titanium oxygen scavenger layer and a titanium nitride top electrode. In this work, we showed devices exceeding endurance values of 10B cycles with a discrete Roff/Ron ratio of 15. Multi-level states were achieved by using consecutive ultra-short 5/1.5 ns pulses during the reset operation. A neural network simulation was performed in which the synaptic weights were perturbed with the ReRAM variability, which was extracted from two different characterization methods: (1) via direct write, and (2) via a write/read verification approach during the reset operation. A substantial improvement of the neural network fitness was demonstrated when using the write/read verification approach.","author":["Karsten Beckmann","Wilkie Olin-Ammentorp","Gangotree Chakma","Sherif Amer","Garrett S.

There is a lot of research for English knowledge graph representation. However, for the low-resource languages, such as Tibetan, how to represent sparse knowledge graphs is a key problem. In this article, aiming at scarcity of Tibetan knowledge graphs, we extend the Tibetan knowledge graph by using the triples of the high-resource language knowledge graphs and Point of Information map information. To improve the representation learning of the Tibetan knowledge graph, we propose a joint model to merge structure and entity description information based on the Translating Embeddings and Convolution Neural Networks models. In addition, to solve the segmentation errors, we use character and word embedding to learn more complex information in Tibetan. Finally, the experimental results show that our model can make a better representation of the Tibetan knowledge graph than the baseline.","author":["Yuan Sun","Andong Chen","Chaofan Chen","Tianci Xia","Xiaobing Zhao"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing","Volume 20","Issue 2","April 2021","Article No.: 27","pp   1\u201317","https://doi.org/10.1145/3447248"],"date":"30 March 2021","ref":[{"text":"Kurt Bollacker, Colin Evans, Praveen Paritosh, Tim Sturge, and Jamie Taylor. 2008.

GPSR makes greedy forwarding decisions using only information about a router's immediate neighbors in the network topology. When a packet reaches a region where greedy forwarding is impossible, the algorithm recovers by routing around the perimeter of the region. By keeping state only about the local topology, GPSR scales better in per-router state than shortest-path and ad-hoc routing protocols as the number of network destinations increases. Under mobility's frequent topology changes, GPSR can use local topology information to find correct new routes quickly. We describe the GPSR protocol, and use extensive simulation of mobile wireless networks to compare its performance with that of Dynamic Source Routing. Our simulations demonstrate GPSR's scalability on densely deployed wireless networks.","author":["Brad Karp","H. T.

This paper presents a new benchmarking simulator, SIAM, to evaluate the performance of chiplet-based IMC architectures and explore the potential of such a paradigm shift in IMC architecture design. SIAM integrates device, circuit, architecture, network-on-chip (NoC), network-on-package (NoP), and DRAM access models to realize an end-to-end system. SIAM is scalable in its support of a wide range of deep neural networks (DNNs), customizable to various network structures and configurations, and capable of efficient design space exploration. We demonstrate the flexibility, scalability, and simulation speed of SIAM by benchmarking different state-of-the-art DNNs with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets. We further calibrate the simulation results with a published silicon result, SIMBA. The chiplet-based IMC architecture obtained through SIAM shows 130\\(\\) and 72\\(\\) improvement in energy-efficiency for ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset compared to Nvidia V100 and T4 GPUs.","author":["Gokul Krishnan","Sumit K.

Cryptography provides the mechanisms necessary to implement accountability, accuracy, and confidentiality in communication. As demands for secure communication bandwidth grow, efficient cryptographic processing will become increasingly vital to good system performance.In this paper, we explore techinques to improve the performance of symmetric key cipher algorithms. Eight popular strong encryption algorithms are examined in detail. Analysis reveals the algorithms are computaionally complex and contain little parallelism. Overall throughput on high-end microprocessor is quite poor, a 600 Mhz processor is incapable of saturation a T3 communication line with 3DES (triple DES) encrypted data.We introduce new instructions taht improve the efficiency of the analyzed algorithms. Our approach adds instruction set support for fast substitutions, general permutations, rotates, and modular arithmetic. Performance analysis of the optimized ciphers shows an overall speedup of 59% over a baseline machine with rotate instructions and 74% speedup over a baseline without rotates. Even higher speedups are demonstrated with optimized subtitutions (SBOXes) and additional functional unit resources. our analyses of the original and optimized algorithms suggest future directions for the design of high-performance programmable cryptographic processors.","author":["Jerome Burke","John McDonald","Todd Austin"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 35","Issue 11","Nov. 2000","pp   178\u2013189","https://doi.org/10.1145/356989.357006"],"date":"01 November 2000"},{"_id":"10.1145/358808.358814","doi":"10.1145/358808.358814","title":"Information transfer and area-time tradeoffs for VLSI multiplication","abstract":"The need to transfer information between processing elements can be a major factor in determining the performance of a VLSI circuit.

Instead of supplying the normal inputs to a program (e.g. numbers) one supplies symbols representing arbitrary values.

A particular system called EFFIGY which provides symbolic execution for program testing and debugging is also described. It interpretively executes programs written in a simple PL/I style programming language. It includes many standard debugging features, the ability to manage and to prove things about symbolic expressions, a simple program testing manager, and a program verifier.

However, they have a number of drawbacks. Flash chips are write-once, bulk-erase devices whose contents cannot be updated in-place. They also suffer from slow program times and a limit on the number of program/erase cycles. eNVy uses a copy-on-write scheme, page remapping, a small amount of battery backed SRAM, and high bandwidth parallel data transfers to provide low latency, in-place update semantics. A cleaning algorithm optimized for large Flash arrays is used to reclaim space. The algorithm is designed to evenly wear the array, thereby extending its lifetime.Software simulations of a 2 gigabyte eNVy system show that it can support I/O rates corresponding to approximately 30,000 transactions per second on the TPC-A database benchmark. Despite the added work done to overcome the deficiencies associated with Flash memories, average latencies to the storage system are as low as 180ns for reads and 200ns for writes. The estimated lifetime of this type of storage system is in the 10 year range when exposed to a workload of 10,000 transactions per second.","author":["Michael Wu","Willy Zwaenepoel"],"issue":["ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","Volume 28","Issue 5","Dec. 1994","pp   86\u201397","https://doi.org/10.1145/381792.195506"],"date":"01 November 1994","ref":[{"text":"M.

However, causes for the appearance of such power laws have not been convincingly given. In this paper, we examine four factors in the formation of Internet topologies. These factors are (F1) preferential connectivity of a new node to existing nodes; (F2) incremental growth of the network; (F3) distribution of nodes in space; and (F4) locality of edge connections. In synthetically generated network topologies, we study the relevance of each factor in causing the aforementioned power laws as well as other properties, namely diameter, average path length and clustering coefficient. Different kinds of network topologies are generated: (T1) topologies generated using our parametrized generator, we call BRITE; (T2) random topologies generated using the well-known Waxman model [12]; (T3) Transit-Stub topologies generated using GT-ITM tool [3]; and (T4) regular grid topologies. We observe that some generated topologies may not obey power laws P1 and P2. Thus, the existence of these power laws can be used to validate the accuracy of a given tool in generating representative Internet topologies. Power laws P3 and P4 were observed in nearly all considered topologies, but different topologies showed different values of the power exponent \u03b1. Thus, while the presence of power laws P3 and P4 do not give strong evidence for the representativeness of a generated topology, the value of \u03b1 in P3 and P4 can be used as a litmus test for the representativeness of a generated topology. We also find that factors F1 and F2 are the key contributors in our study which provide the resemblance of our generated topologies to that of the Internet.","author":["Alberto Medina","Ibrahim Matta","John Byers"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 30","Issue 2","April 2000","pp   18\u201328","https://doi.org/10.1145/505680.505683"],"date":"01 April 2000","ref":[{"text":"R.

While the importance of data-layout optimizations has been growing, their deployment has been limited, partly because they lack a unifying framework. We propose a parameterizable framework for data-layout optimization of general-purpose applications. Acknowledging that finding an optimal layout is not only NP-hard, but also poorly approximable, our framework finds a good layout by searching the space of possible layouts, with the help of profile feedback. The search process iteratively prototypes candidate data layouts, evaluating them by \"simulating\" the program on a representative trace of memory accesses. To make the search process practical, we develop space-reduction heuristics and optimize the expensive simulation via memoization. Equipped with this iterative approach, we can synthesize layouts that outperform existing non-iterative heuristics, tune application-specific memory allocators, as well as compose multiple data-layout optimizations.","author":["Shai Rubin","Rastislav Bod\u00edk","Trishul Chilimbi"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 37","Issue 1","Jan. 2002","pp   140\u2013153","https://doi.org/10.1145/565816.503287"],"date":"01 January 2002","ref":[{"text":"ALT,M.,FERDINAND,C.,MARTIN,F.,AND WILHELM,R.

Furthermore, the\nconstant progress of computer hardware technology in the past three\ndecades has led to the availability of powerful computers, data\ncollection equipments, and storage media; this technology provides\na great boost to the database and information industry by allowing\ntransaction management, information retrieval, and data analysis\nover massive amounts of heterogeneous data. Moreover, the explosion\nof Internet increases the availability of data in different\nformats: structured (e.g. relational), semistructured (e.g. HTML,\nXML) and unstructured (e.g. plain text, audio/video) data [2].\nThus, new data management systems, able to take advantage of these\nheterogeneous data, are emerging and will play a vital role in the\ninformation industry. Thus, heterogeneous database systems emerge\nand play a vital role in the information industry.Knowledge Management is concerned with the technological,\neconomic and organizational aspects related to (i) the\ncreation, distribution, diversification and sharing of knowledge in\ncomplex organizations and to (ii) the management of\ninformative flows, processes and interactions with external\nKnowledge [8].Figure 1 summarizes the steps (each represented on a different\nlevel of the pyramid) through which knowledge is typically\nextracted from basic data. The first three levels regard the\nmanagement of explicit knowledge (i.e. codified, structured\nor semistructured and completely available). In particular,\nstarting from the bottom, the first level is concerned with storing\nand exchanging \"factual\" knowledge, essentially corresponding to\nbasic data. Technologies used here comprise Databases [17],\nData Repositories, Archive Sharing tools and the emerging\nExtensible Markup Language (XML) [18].The second level regards \"conceptual knowledge\" modeling, i.e.\nthe definition of concepts and relationships among them. Such\nknowledge is typically represented by means of diagram-based\nformalisms for both information and related processes [9]. The\nUnified Modeling Language (UML) is currently one of the most\npromising modeling languages, oriented towards the\nspecification,implementation and documentation of complex software\nsystems, but also used for modeling company processes not strictly\nrelated to the software.The third level is concerned with organization and integration\nof information represented according to heterogeneous formalisms.\nTechniques used here are essentially those concerning Data\nWarehousing (DW) [10]. Data warehouses are integrated\nrepositories of data extracted from multiple heterogeneous sources,\norganized under a unified schema and at a single site, in order to\nfacilitate management and decision making. Data Warehousing\ntechnologies include data cleaning, data integration, and Online\nAnalytical Processing (OLAP), i.e. analysis techniques based on\naggregation and summarization.The highest level regards Knowledge Discovery, i.e. the\nuncovering of new, implicit and potentially useful\nknowledge from large amounts of data. The core phase of knowledge\ndiscovery is Data Mining [10], an interactive, iterative,\nmulti-step process, comprising in particular pattern searching and\neventual refinements on the basis of domain experts' knowledge.In the context of explicit knowledge management, the Extensible\nMarkup Language takes naturally place. XML is a language for\nsemistructured data [1, 5] of the World Wide Web Consortium\n(W3C) [13] which is designed to allow marking, transferring and\nreusing information by means of a standard method of definition of\nthe documents structure and format. Its metalanguage features have\nbeen used in knowledge management typically for (i) the\nsemi-automatic production of documents, (ii) the reuse of\nsemistructured information and its integration in heterogeneous\nsystems, (iii) the creation of knowledge maps for the\norganization and sharing of information.The increasing quantity of available semistructured data and the\nuse of XML for their description and exchange discovers new\nreaserch themes related to management and knowledge extraction over\nXML data. In this scenario, our proposal consists of a system for\nthe syntesization of XML documents that attempts to extract\ntheir semantics and to derive synthetic versions of them by means\nof a multidimensional interpretation [10]. In the contest of\nKnowledge Management, data synthesization can be regarded as a new\nway for knowledge extraction, by discovering and aggregating\n(useful) core information and by neglecting (useless) details.","author":["Mario Cannataro","Antonella Guzzo","Andrea Pugliese"],"issue":["ACM SIGAPP Applied Computing Review","Volume 10","Issue 1","Spring 2002","pp   33\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/568235.568242"],"date":"01 April 2002","ref":[{"text":"S.

We show that careful matching of resource availability and design complexity during the clustering and placement processes can contribute to spatial uniformity in the placed design, leading to overall device decongestion after routing. We present experimental results to show that appropriate logic depopulation during clustering can have a positive impact on the overall FPGA device area. Our clustering and placement techniques can improve the overall device routing area by as much as 62%, 35% on average, for the same array size, when compared to state-of-the-art FPGA clustering, placement, and routing tools. Power dissipation simulations using a typical buffered pass-transistor-based FPGA interconnect model are also presented.

However, they often include many rare senses while missing corpus/domain-specific senses. We present a clustering algorithm called CBC (Clustering By Committee) that automatically discovers word senses from text. It initially discovers a set of tight clusters called committees that are well scattered in the similarity space. The centroid of the members of a committee is used as the feature vector of the cluster. We proceed by assigning words to their most similar clusters. After assigning an element to a cluster, we remove their overlapping features from the element. This allows CBC to discover the less frequent senses of a word and to avoid discovering duplicate senses. Each cluster that a word belongs to represents one of its senses. We also present an evaluation methodology for automatically measuring the precision and recall of discovered senses.","author":["Patrick Pantel","Dekang Lin"],"issue":["KDD '02: Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","July 2002","Pages   613\u2013619","https://doi.org/10.1145/775047.775138"],"date":"23 July 2002","ref":[{"text":"Cutting, D.

The first approach is to leverage the extensive work on laptop disks and power disks down during periods of idleness. The second approach is to replace high-performance disks with a set of lower power disks that can achieve the same performance and reliability. The third approach is to combine high-performance and laptop disks, such that only one of these two sets of disks is powered on at a time. This approach requires the mirroring (and coherence) of all disk data on the two sets of disks. Finally, the fourth approach is to use multi-speed disks, such that each disk is slowed down for lower energy consumption during periods of light load. We demonstrate that the fourth approach is the only one that can actually provide energy savings for network servers. In fact, our results for Web and proxy servers show that the fourth approach can provide energy savings of up to 23%, in comparison to conventional servers, without any degradation in server performance.","author":["Enrique V.

Recent systems have accomplished this by simply duplicating some essential item of data at several levels. Such duplication makes the storage of even small data bases inefficient; for large masses of data, storage becomes economically unfeasible. Other systems have provided the means to specify and construct hierarchies, but none have provided language that affords control over retrieval and output levels, and control over the scope of output. Within the Time-Shared Data Management System (TDMS), currently being produced at System Development Corporation, a method has been devised for maintaining hierarchical associations within logical entries of a data base. Basically, the technique permits the automatic association of related data through a device known as a repeating group. The term \u201crepeating group\u201d is not new, but the TDMS treatment of the repeating group concept is. This paper describes how this technique is implemented in the language and tables of TDMS.","author":["Robert E.

Hence, it is the method of choice in the simulation literature. However, except for some simple cases where the inverse of the cumulative distribution function is a simple function we need numerical methods. Often inversion by \"brute force\" is used, applying either very slow iterative methods or linear interpolation of the CDF and huge tables. But then the user has to accept unnecessarily large errors or excessive memory requirements, that slow down the algorithm. In this article, we demonstrate that with Hermite interpolation of the inverse CDF we can obtain very small error bounds close to machine precision. Using our adaptive interval splitting method, this accuracy is reached with moderately sized tables that allow for a fast and simple generation procedure.","author":["Wolfgang H\u00f6rmann","Josef Leydold"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation","Volume 13","Issue 4","October 2003","pp   347\u2013362","https://doi.org/10.1145/945511.945517"],"date":"01 October 2003","ref":[{"text":"Ahrens, J.

Current abstractions are intricate and make it hard to design computer systems that are reliable and scalable. We argue that these problems can be addressed by moving to a declarative style of concurrency control in which programmers directly indicate the safety properties that they require. In our scheme the programmer demarks sections of code which execute within lightweight software-based transactions that commit atomically and exactly once. These transactions can update shared data, instantiate objects, invoke library features and so on. They can also block, waiting for arbitrary boolean conditions to become true. Transactions which do not access the same shared memory locations can commit concurrently. Furthermore, in general, no performance penalty is incurred for memory accesses outside transactions.We present a detailed design of this proposal along with an implementation and evaluation. We argue that the resulting system (i) is easier for mainstream programmers to use, (ii) prevents lock-based priority-inversion and deadlock problems and (iii) can offer performance advantages.","author":["Tim Harris","Keir Fraser"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 38","Issue 11","November 2003","pp   388\u2013402","https://doi.org/10.1145/949343.949340"],"date":"26 October 2003","ref":[{"text":"Adve, S.

We see significant diversity in resource usage and application styles, including some interactive and iterative workloads, motivating new tools in the ecosystem. We also observe significant opportunities for optimizations of these workloads. We find that job customization and configuration are used in a narrow scope, suggesting the future pursuit of automatic tuning systems.

Major reasons for the widespread success of database systems and today's multi-billion dollar data management market include data independence, separating physical representation and storage from the actual information, and declarative languages, separating the program specification from its intended execution environment. In contrast, today's big data solutions do not offer data independence and declarative specification. As a result, big data technologies are mostly employed in newly-established companies with IT-savvy employees or in large well-established companies with big IT departments. We argue that current big data solutions will continue to fall short of widespread adoption, due to usability problems, despite the fact that in-situ data analytics technologies achieve a good degree of schema independence. In particular, we consider the lack of a declarative specification to be a major road-block, contributing to the scarcity in available data scientists available and limiting the application of big data to the IT-savvy industries. In particular, data scientists currently have to spend a lot of time on tuning their data analysis programs for specific data characteristics and a specific execution environment. We believe that the research community needs to bring the powerful concepts of declarative specification to current data analysis systems, in order to achieve the broad big data technology adoption and effectively deliver the promise that novel big data technologies offer.","author":["Volker Markl"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 13","August 2014","pp   1730\u20131733","https://doi.org/10.14778/2733004.2733075"],"date":"01 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"A.

Several workloads - like social and service monitoring - often include attributes with implicit clustering because of their time-dependent nature. In addition, solid state disks (SSD) (using flash or other low-level technologies) emerge as viable competitors of hard disk drives (HDD). Capacity and access times of storage devices create a trade-off between SSD and HDD. Slow random accesses in HDD have been replaced by efficient random accesses in SSD, but their available capacity is one or more orders of magnitude more expensive than the one of HDD. Indexing, however, is designed assuming HDD as secondary storage, thus minimizing random accesses at the expense of capacity. Indexing data using SSD as secondary storage requires treating capacity as a scarce resource.To this end, we introduce approximate tree indexing, which employs probabilistic data structures (Bloom filters) to trade accuracy for size and produce smaller, yet powerful, tree indexes, which we name Bloom filter trees (BF-Trees). BF-Trees exploit pre-existing data ordering or partitioning to offer competitive search performance. We demonstrate, both by an analytical study and by experimental results, that by using workload knowledge and reducing indexing accuracy up to some extent, we can save substantially on capacity when indexing on ordered or partitioned attributes. In particular, in experiments with a synthetic workload, approximate indexing offers 2.22x-48x smaller index footprint with competitive response times, and in experiments with TPCH and a monitoring real-life dataset from an energy company, it offers 1.6x-4x smaller index footprint with competitive search times as well.","author":["Manos Athanassoulis","Anastasia Ailamaki"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 14","October 2014","pp   1881\u20131892","https://doi.org/10.14778/2733085.2733094"],"date":"01 October 2014","ref":[{"text":"D.

Trill fulfills a combination of three requirements for a query processor to serve the diverse big data analytics space: (1) Query Model: Trill is based on a tempo-relational model that enables it to handle streaming and relational queries with early results, across the latency spectrum from real-time to offline; (2) Fabric and Language Integration: Trill is architected as a high-level language library that supports rich data-types and user libraries, and integrates well with existing distribution fabrics and applications; and (3) Performance: Trill's throughput is high across the latency spectrum. For streaming data, Trill's throughput is 2-4 orders of magnitude higher than comparable streaming engines. For offline relational queries, Trill's throughput is comparable to a major modern commercial columnar DBMS.Trill uses a streaming batched-columnar data representation with a new dynamic compilation-based system architecture that addresses all these requirements. In this paper, we describe Trill's new design and architecture, and report experimental results that demonstrate Trill's high performance across diverse analytics scenarios. We also describe how Trill's ability to support diverse analytics has resulted in its adoption across many usage scenarios at Microsoft.","author":["Badrish Chandramouli","Jonathan Goldstein","Mike Barnett","Robert DeLine","Danyel Fisher","John C.

However, uninhibited coordination-free execution can compromise application correctness, or consistency. When is coordination necessary for correctness? The classic use of serializable transactions is sufficient to maintain correctness but is not necessary for all applications, sacrificing potential scalability. In this paper, we develop a formal framework, invariant confluence, that determines whether an application requires coordination for correct execution. By operating on application-level invariants over database states (e.g., integrity constraints), invariant confluence analysis provides a necessary and sufficient condition for safe, coordination-free execution. When programmers specify their application invariants, this analysis allows databases to coordinate only when anomalies that might violate invariants are possible. We analyze the invariant confluence of common invariants and operations from real-world database systems (i.e., integrity constraints) and applications and show that many are invariant confluent and therefore achievable without coordination. We apply these results to a proof-of-concept coordination-avoiding database prototype and demonstrate sizable performance gains compared to serializable execution, notably a 25-fold improvement over prior TPC-C New-Order performance on a 200 server cluster.","author":["Peter Bailis","Alan Fekete","Michael J.

Unfortunately, the increase in concurrency usually comes at the cost of transaction serializability. If a database user requests full serializability, modern multi-versioned systems significantly constrain read-write concurrency among conflicting transactions and employ expensive synchronization patterns in their design. In main-memory multi-core settings, these additional constraints are so burdensome that multi-versioned systems are often significantly outperformed by single-version systems.We propose Bohm, a new concurrency control protocol for main-memory multi-versioned database systems. Bohm guarantees serializable execution while ensuring that reads never block writes. In addition, Bohm does not require reads to perform any bookkeeping whatsoever, thereby avoiding the overhead of tracking reads via contended writes to shared memory. This leads to excellent scalability and performance in multi-core settings. Bohm has all the above characteristics without performing validation based concurrency control. Instead, it is pessimistic, and is therefore not prone to excessive aborts in the presence of contention. An experimental evaluation shows that Bohm performs well in both high contention and low contention settings, and is able to dramatically outperform state-of-the-art multi-versioned systems despite maintaining the full set of serializability guarantees.","author":["Jose M.

However, it has also been widely reported that these techniques would create a large amount of long-living data objects in the heap, which may quickly saturate the garbage collector, especially when handling a large dataset, and hence would limit the scalability of the system. To eliminate this problem, we propose a lifetime-based memory management framework, which, by automatically analyzing the user-defined functions and data types, obtains the expected lifetime of the data objects, and then allocates and releases memory space accordingly to minimize the garbage collection overhead. In particular, we present Deca, a concrete implementation of our proposal on top of Spark, which transparently decomposes and groups objects with similar lifetimes into byte arrays and releases their space altogether when their lifetimes come to an end. An extensive experimental study using both synthetic and real datasets shows that, in comparing to Spark, Deca is able to 1) reduce the garbage collection time by up to 99.9%, 2) to achieve up to 22.7x speed up in terms of execution time in cases without data spilling and 41.6x speedup in cases with data spilling, and 3) to consume up to 46.6% less memory.","author":["Lu Lu","Xuanhua Shi","Yongluan Zhou","Xiong Zhang","Hai Jin","Cheng Pei","Ligang He","Yuanzhen Geng"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 9","Issue 12","August 2016","pp   936\u2013947","https://doi.org/10.14778/2994509.2994513"],"date":"01 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"Big data benchmark. http://tinyurl.com/qg93r43.","order":1},{"text":"Cassandra GC tuning. http://tinyurl.com/5u58mzc.","order":2},{"text":"Full version. https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01959.","order":3},{"text":"HiBench suite. http://tinyurl.com/cns79vt.","order":4},{"text":"Project Tungsten. http://tinyurl.com/mzw7hew.","order":5},{"text":"Soot framework. http://sable.github.io/soot/.","order":6},{"text":"Spark GC tuning. http://tinyurl.com/hzf3gqm.","order":7},{"text":"Tuning Java garbage collection for HBase. http://tinyurl.com/j5hsd3x.","order":8},{"text":"Tuning Java garbage collection for Spark applications. http://tinyurl.com/pd8kkau.","order":9},{"text":"G.

The key assumption has been that non-volatile storage is much slower than DRAM and only supports block-oriented read/writes. But the arrival of new non-volatile memory (NVM) storage that is almost as fast as DRAM with fine-grained read/writes invalidates these previous design choices.This paper explores the changes that are required in a DBMS to leverage the unique properties of NVM in systems that still include volatile DRAM. We make the case for a new logging and recovery protocol, called write-behind logging, that enables a DBMS to recover nearly instantaneously from system failures. The key idea is that the DBMS logs what parts of the database have changed rather than how it was changed. Using this method, the DBMS flushes the changes to the database <u>before</u> recording them in the log. Our evaluation shows that this protocol improves a DBMS's transactional throughput by 1.3\u00d7, reduces the recovery time by more than two orders of magnitude, and shrinks the storage footprint of the DBMS on NVM by 1.5\u00d7. We also demonstrate that our logging protocol is compatible with standard replication schemes.","author":["Joy Arulraj","Matthew Perron","Andrew Pavlo"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 4","November 2016","pp   337\u2013348","https://doi.org/10.14778/3025111.3025116"],"date":"01 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"NUMA policy library. http://linux.die.net/man/3/numa.","order":1},{"text":"Peloton Database Management System. http://pelotondb.org.","order":2},{"text":"Persistent memory programming library. http://pmem.io/.","order":3},{"text":"Intel Architecture Instruction Set Extensions Programming Reference. https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/b4/3a/319433-024.pdf, 2016.","order":4},{"text":"R.

It is based on the novel concept of graph virtualization, which efficiently utilizes a cache-coherent hardware accelerator at the storage side to achieve performance and flexibility at the same time. ExtraV consists of four main components: 1) host processor, 2) main memory, 3) AFU (Accelerator Function Unit) and 4) storage. The AFU, a hardware accelerator, sits between the host processor and storage. Using a coherent interface that allows main memory accesses, it performs graph traversal functions that are common to various algorithms while the program running on the host processor (called the host program) manages the overall execution along with more application-specific tasks. Graph virtualization is a high-level programming model of graph processing that allows designers to focus on algorithm-specific functions. Realized by the accelerator, graph virtualization gives the host programs an illusion that the graph data reside on the main memory in a layout that fits with the memory access behavior of host programs even though the graph data are actually stored in a multi-level, compressed form in storage. We prototyped ExtraV on a Power8 machine with a CAPI-enabled FPGA. Our experiments on a real system prototype offer significant speedup compared to state-of-the-art software only implementations.","author":["Jinho Lee","Heesu Kim","Sungjoo Yoo","Kiyoung Choi","H.

Unfortunately, there is no optimization across these libraries, resulting in performance penalties as high as an order of magnitude in many applications. To address this problem, we proposed Weld, a common runtime for existing data analytics libraries that performs key physical optimizations such as pipelining under existing, imperative library APIs. In this work, we further develop the Weld vision by designing an automatic adaptive optimizer for Weld applications, and evaluating its impact on realistic data science workloads. Our optimizer eliminates multiple forms of overhead that arise when composing imperative libraries like Pandas and NumPy, and uses lightweight measurements to make data-dependent decisions at run-time in ad-hoc workloads where no statistics are available, with sub-second overhead. We also evaluate which optimizations have the largest impact in practice and whether Weld can be integrated into libraries incrementally. Our results are promising: using our optimizer, Weld accelerates data science workloads by up to 23X on one thread and 80X on eight threads, and its adaptive optimizations provide up to a 3.75X speedup over rule-based optimization. Moreover, Weld provides benefits if even just 4--5 operators in a library are ported to use it. Our results show that common runtime designs like Weld may be a viable approach to accelerate analytics.","author":["Shoumik Palkar","James Thomas","Deepak Narayanan","Pratiksha Thaker","Rahul Palamuttam","Parimajan Negi","Anil Shanbhag","Malte Schwarzkopf","Holger Pirk","Saman Amarasinghe","Samuel Madden","Matei Zaharia"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 9","May 2018","pp   1002\u20131015","https://doi.org/10.14778/3213880.3213890"],"date":"01 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"M.

Many existing methods construct a structured query for the input question based on a syntactic parser. Once the input question is parsed incorrectly, a false structured query will be generated, which may result in false or incomplete answers. The problem gets worse especially for complex questions. In this paper, we propose a novel systematic method to understand natural language questions by using a large number of binary templates rather than semantic parsers. As sufficient templates are critical in the procedure, we present a low-cost approach that can build a huge number of templates automatically. To reduce the search space, we carefully devise an index to facilitate the online template decomposition. Moreover, we design effective strategies to perform the two-level disambiguations (i.e., entity-level ambiguity and structure-level ambiguity) by considering the query semantics. Extensive experiments over several benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective as it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both precision and recall.","author":["Weiguo Zheng","Jeffrey Xu Yu","Lei Zou","Hong Cheng"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 11","July 2018","pp   1373\u20131386","https://doi.org/10.14778/3236187.3236192"],"date":"01 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"A.

The performance of the system is evaluated on a manually annotated test set, and is also compared with several state-of-the-art systems, taking into account the fact that the definition of Chinese words often varies from system to system.","author":["Jianfeng Gao","Mu Li","Chang-Ning Huang"],"issue":["ACL '03: Proceedings of the 41st Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics - Volume 1","July 2003","Pages   272\u2013279","https://doi.org/10.3115/1075096.1075131"],"date":"07 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"Cheng, Kowk-Shing, Gilbert H.

In this paper, a different approach to formulating a probabilistic model is presented along with a case study of the performance of models produced in this manner for the disambiguation of the noun interest. We describe a method for formulating probabilistic models that use multiple contextual features for word-sense disambiguation, without requiring untested assumptions regarding the form of the model. Using this approach, the joint distribution of all variables is described by only the most systematic variable interactions, thereby limiting the number of parameters to be estimated, supporting computational efficiency, and providing an understanding of the data.","author":["Rebecca Bruce","Janyce Wiebe"],"issue":["ACL '94: Proceedings of the 32nd annual meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics","June 1994","Pages   139\u2013146","https://doi.org/10.3115/981732.981752"],"date":"27 June 1994","ref":[{"text":"Baglivo, J., Olivier, D., and Pagano, M.

Roget's categories serve as approximations of conceptual classes. The categories listed for a word in Roget's index tend to correspond to sense distinctions; thus selecting the most likely category provides a useful level of sense disambiguation. The selection of categories is accomplished by identifying and weighting words that are indicative of each category when seen in context, using a Bayesian theoretical framework.Other statistical approaches have required special corpora or hand-labeled training examples for much of the lexicon. Our use of class models overcomes this knowledge acquisition bottleneck, enabling training on unrestricted monolingual text without human intervention. Applied to the 10 million word Grolier's Encyclopedia, the system correctly disambiguated 92% of the instances of 12 polysemous words that have been previously studied in the literature.","author":["David Yarowsky"],"issue":["COLING '92: Proceedings of the 14th conference on Computational linguistics - Volume 2","August 1992","Pages   454\u2013460","https://doi.org/10.3115/992133.992140"],"date":"23 August 1992","ref":[{"text":"Bar-Hillel (1960), \"Automatic Translation of Languages,\" in Advances in Computers, Donald Booth and R.

Two goals motivate the approach: (i) avoidance of the need for pre-encoded knowledge and (ii) applicability across a wide range of text. We identify a set of lexico-syntactic patterns that are easily recognizable, that occur frequently and across text genre boundaries, and that indisputably indicate the lexical relation of interest. We describe a method for discovering these patterns and suggest that other lexical relations will also be acquirable in this way. A subset of the acquisition algorithm is implemented and the results are used to augment and critique the structure of a large hand-built thesaurus. Extensions and applications to areas such as information retrieval are suggested.","author":["Marti A.

Our system consists of a pipeline of independent, local classifiers that identify the predicate sense, the arguments of the predicates, and the argument labels. Using these local models, we carried out a beam search to generate a pool of candidates. We then reranked the candidates using a joint learning approach that combines the local models and proposition features. To address the multilingual nature of the data, we implemented a feature selection procedure that systematically explored the feature space, yielding significant gains over a standard set of features. Our system achieved the second best semantic score overall with an average labeled semantic F1 of 80.31. It obtained the best F1 score on the Chinese and German data and the second best one on English.","author":["Anders Bj\u00f6rkelund","Love Hafdell","Pierre Nugues"],"issue":["CoNLL '09: Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning: Shared Task","June 2009","Pages   43\u201348"],"date":"04 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"Aljoscha Burchardt, Katrin Erk, Anette Frank, Andrea Kowalski, Sebastian Pad\u00f3, and Manfred Pinkal. 2006.

We use the first heuristic to develop a novel class-based language model that outperforms a baseline word trigram model by 28% in perplexity and 1.9% absolute in speech recognition word-error rate on Wall Street Journal data. We use the second heuristic to motivate a regularized version of minimum discrimination information models and show that this method outperforms other techniques for domain adaptation.","author":["Stanley F.

This learning framework is attractive because it often requires much less training time in practice than batch training algorithms. However, L1-regularization, which is becoming popular in natural language processing because of its ability to produce compact models, cannot be efficiently applied in SGD training, due to the large dimensions of feature vectors and the fluctuations of approximate gradients. We present a simple method to solve these problems by penalizing the weights according to cumulative values for L1 penalty. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method in three applications: text chunking, named entity recognition, and part-of-speech tagging. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can produce compact and accurate models much more quickly than a state-of-the-art quasi-Newton method for L1-regularized loglinear models.","author":["Yoshimasa Tsuruoka","Jun'ichi Tsujii","Sophia Ananiadou"],"issue":["ACL '09: Proceedings of the Joint Conference of the 47th Annual Meeting of the ACL and the 4th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing of the AFNLP: Volume 1 - Volume 1","August 2009","Pages   477\u2013485"],"date":"02 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"Galen Andrew and Jianfeng Gao. 2007.

The recent deployment of a Vietnamese translation tool on a well-known search engine justifies its importance in gaining popularity with the World Wide Web. There are still problems in the translation and retrieval of Vietnamese language as its word recognition is not fully addressed. In this paper we introduce a semi-supervised approach in building a general scalable web corpus for Vietnamese using search engine to facilitate the word segmentation process. Moreover, we also propose a segmentation algorithm which recognizes effectively Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words. The result indicates that our solution is scalable and can be applied for real time translation program and other linguistic applications. This work is here is a continuation of the work of Nguyen D.

We hypothesize that by using this care-receiving robot, we may construct a new educational framework whose goal is to promote children's spontaneous learning by teaching through their teaching the robot. In this paper, we describe the introduction of a care-receiving robot into a classroom at an English language school for Japanese children (3--6 years of age) and then conduct an experiment to evaluate if the care-receiving robot can promote their learning using English verbs. The results suggest that the idea of a care-receiving robot is feasible and that the robot can help children learn new English verbs efficiently. In addition, we report on investigations into several forms of teaching performed by children, which were revealed through observations of the children, parent interviews, and other useful knowledge. These can be used to improve the design of care-receiving robots for educational purposes.","author":["Fumihide Tanaka","Shizuko Matsuzoe"],"issue":["Journal of Human-Robot Interaction","Volume 1","Issue 1","July 2012","pp   78\u201395","https://doi.org/10.5898/JHRI.1.1.Tanaka"],"date":"28 July 2012","ref":[{"text":"Aronson, E.
