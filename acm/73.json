Traditional clustering techniques are inadequate since they don't generate clusters with highly readable names. In this paper, we reformalize the clustering problem as a salient phrase ranking problem. Given a query and the ranked list of documents (typically a list of titles and snippets) returned by a certain Web search engine, our method first extracts and ranks salient phrases as candidate cluster names, based on a regression model learned from human labeled training data. The documents are assigned to relevant salient phrases to form candidate clusters, and the final clusters are generated by merging these candidate clusters. Experimental results verify our method's feasibility and effectiveness.","author":["Hua-Jun Zeng","Qi-Cai He","Zheng Chen","Wei-Ying Ma","Jinwen Ma"],"issue":["SIGIR '04: Proceedings of the 27th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval","July 2004","Pages   210\u2013217","https://doi.org/10.1145/1008992.1009030"],"date":"25 July 2004","ref":[{"text":"Liu B., Chin C.

Recently, an information-theoretic co-clustering approach applicable to empirical joint probability distributions was proposed. In many situations, co-clustering of more general matrices is desired. In this paper, we present a substantially generalized co-clustering framework wherein any Bregman divergence can be used in the objective function, and various conditional expectation based constraints can be considered based on the statistics that need to be preserved. Analysis of the co-clustering problem leads to the minimum Bregman information principle, which generalizes the maximum entropy principle, and yields an elegant meta algorithm that is guaranteed to achieve local optimality. Our methodology yields new algorithms and also encompasses several previously known clustering and co-clustering algorithms based on alternate minimization.","author":["Arindam Banerjee","Inderjit Dhillon","Joydeep Ghosh","Srujana Merugu","Dharmendra S.

The wireless nature of many embedded applications as well as their omnipresence has made the need for security and privacy preserving mechanisms particularly important. Thus, as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) become integral parts of embedded systems, it is imperative to consider their security as a whole. This contribution provides a state-of-the-art description of security issues on FPGAs, both from the system and implementation perspectives. We discuss the advantages of reconfigurable hardware for cryptographic applications, show potential security problems of FPGAs, and provide a list of open research problems. Moreover, we summarize both public and symmetric-key algorithm implementations on FPGAs.","author":["Thomas Wollinger","Jorge Guajardo","Christof Paar"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 3","Issue 3","August 2004","pp   534\u2013574","https://doi.org/10.1145/1015047.1015052"],"date":"01 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"Actel Corporation. 2002.

With a video projector providing structured illumination, reciprocity permits us to generate pictures from the viewpoint of the projector, even though no camera was present at that location. The technique is completely image-based, requiring no knowledge of scene geometry or surface properties, and by its nature automatically includes all transport paths, including shadows, inter-reflections and caustics. In its simplest form, the technique can be used to take photographs without a camera; we demonstrate this by capturing a photograph using a projector and a photo-resistor. If the photo-resistor is replaced by a camera, we can produce a 4D dataset that allows for relighting with 2D incident illumination. Using an array of cameras we can produce a 6D slice of the 8D reflectance field that allows for relighting with arbitrary light fields. Since an array of cameras can operate in parallel without interference, whereas an array of light sources cannot, dual photography is fundamentally a more efficient way to capture such a 6D dataset than a system based on multiple projectors and one camera. As an example, we show how dual photography can be used to capture and relight scenes.","author":["Pradeep Sen","Billy Chen","Gaurav Garg","Stephen R.

Aggregation is a key functional building block for such applications: it refers to a set of functions that provide components of a distributed system access to global information including network size, average load, average uptime, location and description of hotspots, and so on. Local access to global information is often very useful, if not indispensable for building applications that are robust and adaptive. For example, in an industrial control application, some aggregate value reaching a threshold may trigger the execution of certain actions; a distributed storage system will want to know the total available free space; load-balancing protocols may benefit from knowing the target average load so as to minimize the load they transfer. We propose a gossip-based protocol for computing aggregate values over network components in a fully decentralized fashion. The class of aggregate functions we can compute is very broad and includes many useful special cases such as counting, averages, sums, products, and extremal values. The protocol is suitable for extremely large and highly dynamic systems due to its proactive structure---all nodes receive the aggregate value continuously, thus being able to track any changes in the system. The protocol is also extremely lightweight, making it suitable for many distributed applications including peer-to-peer and grid computing systems. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our gossip-based protocol both theoretically and experimentally under a variety of scenarios including node and communication failures.","author":["M\u00e1rk Jelasity","Alberto Montresor","Ozalp Babaoglu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Computer Systems","Volume 23","Issue 3","August 2005","pp   219\u2013252","https://doi.org/10.1145/1082469.1082470"],"date":"01 August 2005","ref":[{"text":"Barab\u00e1si, A.-L. 2002.

These new capabilities present both opportunities and challenges for constructing nanoscale computing systems. The tiny feature sizes offer a path to economically scale down to atomic dimensions. However, the associated bottom-up synthesis techniques only produce highly regular structures and come with high defect rates and minimal control during assembly. To exploit these technologies, we develop nanowire-based architectures which can bridge between lithographic and atomic-scale feature sizes and tolerate defective and stochastic assembly of regular arrays to deliver high density universal computing devices. Using 10nm pitch nanowires, these nanowire-based programmable architectures offer one to two orders of magnitude greater mapped-logic density than defect-free lithographic FPGAs at 22nm.","author":["Andr\u00e9 Dehon"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 1","Issue 2","July 2005","pp   109\u2013162","https://doi.org/10.1145/1084748.1084750"],"date":"01 July 2005","ref":[{"text":"Austin, M.

Storing data in a column-oriented fashion greatly increases the similarity of adjacent records on disk and thus opportunities for compression. The ability to compress many adjacent tuples at once lowers the per-tuple cost of compression, both in terms of CPU and space overheads.In this paper, we discuss how we extended C-Store (a column-oriented DBMS) with a compression sub-system. We show how compression schemes not traditionally used in row-oriented DBMSs can be applied to column-oriented systems. We then evaluate a set of compression schemes and show that the best scheme depends not only on the properties of the data but also on the nature of the query workload.","author":["Daniel Abadi","Samuel Madden","Miguel Ferreira"],"issue":["SIGMOD '06: Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data","June 2006","Pages   671\u2013682","https://doi.org/10.1145/1142473.1142548"],"date":"27 June 2006","ref":[{"text":"{1} http://www.addamark.com/products/sls.htm.","order":1},{"text":"{2} http://www.lzop.org.","order":2},{"text":"{3} C-Store code release under bsd license. http://db.csail.mit.edu/projects/cstore/, 2005.","order":3},{"text":"{4} A.

Most microfluidic biochips today are based on the principle of continuous fluid flow and they rely on permanently etched microchannels, micropumps, and microvalves. We focus here on the automated design of \u201cdigital\u201d droplet-based microfluidic biochips. In contrast to conventional continuous-flow systems, digital microfluidics offers dynamic reconfigurability; groups of cells in a microfluidics array can be reconfigured to change their functionality during the concurrent execution of a set of bioassays. We present a simulated annealing-based technique for module placement in such biochips. The placement procedure not only addresses chip area, but also considers fault tolerance, which allows a microfluidic module to be relocated elsewhere in the system when a single cell is detected to be faulty. Simulation results are presented for case studies involving the polymerase chain reaction and multiplexed in vitro clinical diagnostics.","author":["Fei Su","Krishnendu Chakrabarty"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 11","Issue 3","July 2006","pp   682\u2013710","https://doi.org/10.1145/1142980.1142987"],"date":"07 June 2004","ref":[{"text":"Agnihotri, A.

Additionally, design of I/O links is constrained by a complex set of specifications such as voltage levels, voltage noise, signal deterministic jitter, random jitter, slew rate, BER etc. These specifications lead to complex tradeoffs for both circuits and circuit architecture in order to minimize power. This paper presents a design framework that enables the analysis of tradeoffs in the design of an I/O transmitter. The design framework includes BER analysis with a channel model coupled with logic sizing optimization that is constrained by the desired signaling specification.","author":["Hamid Hatamkhani","Frank Lambrecht","Vladimir Stojanovic","Chih-Kong Ken Yang"],"issue":["DAC '06: Proceedings of the 43rd annual Design Automation Conference","July 2006","Pages   867\u2013872","https://doi.org/10.1145/1146909.1147130"],"date":"24 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"International Technology Roadmap Service, http://public.itrs.net","order":1},{"text":"J.

We propose a design automation method for pin-constrained LoCs that manipulate nanoliter volumes of discrete droplets on a microfluidic array. In contrast to the direct-addressing scheme that has been studied thus far in the literature, we assign a small number of independent control pins to a large number of electrodes in the LoC, thereby reducing design complexity and product cost.

Rather than a blessing, this feature is treated more as an interference-inducing nuisance in most wireless networks today (e.g., IEEE 802.11). The goal of this paper is to show how the concept of network coding can be applied at the physical layer to turn the broadcast property into a capacity-boosting advantage in wireless ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose a physical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions among nodes. In contrast to \"straightforward\" network coding which performs coding arithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes use of the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) waves for equivalent coding operation. PNC can yield higher capacity than straight-forward network coding when applied to wireless networks. We believe this is a first paper that ventures into EM-wave-based network coding at the physical layer and demonstrates its potential for boosting network capacity. PNC opens up a whole new research area because of its implications and new design requirements for the physical, MAC, and network layers of ad hoc wireless stations. The resolution of the many outstanding but interesting issues in PNC may lead to a revolutionary new paradigm for wireless ad hoc networking.","author":["Shengli Zhang","Soung Chang Liew","Patrick P.

However, flash memory has different read and write cost in the aspects of time and energy so the replacement algorithm with flash memory should consider not only the hit count but also the replacement cost caused by selecting dirty victims. The replacement cost of dirty page is higher than that of clean page with regard to both access time and energy consumption. In this paper, we propose the Clean-First LRU (CFLRU) replacement algorithm that exploits the characteristics of flash memory. CFLRU splits the LRU list into the working region and the clean-first region and adopts a policy that evicts clean pages preferentially in the clean-first region until the number of page hits in the working region is preserved in a suitable level. Using the trace-driven simulation, the proposed algorithm reduces the average replacement cost by 28.4% in swap system and by 26.2% in buffer cache, compared with LRU algorithm. We also implement the CFLRU algorithm in the Linux kernel and present some optimization issues.","author":["Seon-yeong Park","Dawoon Jung","Jeong-uk Kang","Jin-soo Kim","Joonwon Lee"],"issue":["CASES '06: Proceedings of the 2006 international conference on Compilers, architecture and synthesis for embedded systems","October 2006","Pages   234\u2013241","https://doi.org/10.1145/1176760.1176789"],"date":"22 October 2006","ref":[{"text":"R.

In the near future, the graphics pipeline is likely to evolve into a general programmable stream processor capable of more than simply feed-forward triangle rendering.In this paper, we evaluate these trends in programmability of the graphics pipeline and explain how ray tracing can be mapped to graphics hardware. Using our simulator, we analyze the performance of a ray casting implementation on next generation programmable graphics hardware. In addition, we compare the performance difference between non-branching programmable hardware using a multipass implementation and an architecture that supports branching. We also show how this approach is applicable to other ray tracing algorithms such as Whitted ray tracing, path tracing, and hybrid rendering algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate that ray tracing on graphics hardware could prove to be faster than CPU based implementations as well as competitive with traditional hardware accelerated feed-forward triangle rendering.","author":["Timothy J.

However, in order to harness the additional compute resources of a CMP, applications must expose their thread-level parallelism to the hardware. One common approach to doing this is to decompose a program into parallel \"tasks\" and allow an underlying software layer to schedule these tasks to different threads. Software task scheduling can provide good parallel performance as long as tasks are large compared to the software overheads. We examine a set of applications from an important emerging domain: Recognition, Mining, and Synthesis (RMS). Many RMS applications are compute-intensive and have abundant thread-level parallelism, and are therefore good targets for running on a CMP. However, a significant number have small tasks for which software task schedulers achieve only limited parallel speedups. We propose Carbon, a hardware technique to accelerate dynamic task scheduling on scalable CMPs. Carbon has relatively simple hardware, most of which can be placed far from the cores. We compare Carbon to some highly tuned software task schedulers for a set of RMS benchmarks with small tasks. Carbon delivers significant performance improvements over the best software scheduler: on average for 64 cores, 68% faster on a set of loop-parallel benchmarks, and 109% faster on aset of task-parallel benchmarks.","author":["Sanjeev Kumar","Christopher J.

To address these challenges, a shift in design paradigm from current-day deterministic designs to \u201cstatistical\u201d or \u201cprobabilistic\u201d designs is deemed inevitable. To respond to this need, in this article, we introduce and study an entirely novel family of probabilistic architectures: the probabilistic system-on-a-chip (psoc). psoc architectures are based on cmos devices rendered probabilistic due to noise, referred to as probabilistic CMOS or PCMOS devices. We demonstrate that in addition to harnessing the probabilistic behavior of pcmos devices, psoc architectures yield significant improvements, both in energy consumed as well as performance in the context of probabilistic or randomized applications with broad utility. All of our application and architectural savings are quantified using the product of the energy and performance, denoted (energy \u00d7 performance): The pcmos-based gains are as high as a substantial multiplicative factor of over 560 when compared to a competing energy-efficient cmos-based realization. Our architectural design is application specific and involves navigating design space spanning the algorithm (application), its architecture (psoc), and the probabilistic technology (pcmos).","author":["Lakshmi N.

One drawback is performance degradation due to the exponentially reduced driving current. This had limited subthreshold circuits to relatively low performance applications such as sensor networks. To retain the excellent energy efficiency while reducing performance loss, we propose to apply subthreshold and near-threshold techniques to chip multi-processors. We show that an architecture where several slower cores are clustered together with a shared faster L1 cache is optimal for energy efficiency, because processor cores and memory operate best at different supply and threshold voltages. In particular, SPLASH2 benchmarks show about a 53% energy improvement over the traditional CMP approach (about 70% over a single core machine).","author":["Bo Zhai","Ronald G.

These forms of NVRAM are currently being developed by major semiconductor companies and are expected to be an everyday component in the near future. The advent of NVRAM may possibly bring about drastic changes to the system software landscape. In this work, we develop a new Flash memory based file system that exploits NVRAM in order to improve system performance. Specifically, we discuss the initial design and implementation of a file system that stores all metadata in NVRAM, while storing all file data in Flash memory. In so doing, we make two contributions in this work. First, we present a model that analyzes the amount of NVRAM that is needed for specific Flash memory storage capacity. Experimentally, we verify that this model represents the exact NVRAM usage in the realistic environment. Second, we present quantitative experimental results that show how much performance gains are possible by exploiting NVRAM. Compared to YAFFS, a popular Flash memory based file system, we show that this file system requires only minimal time for mounting and that the execution time improves by a maximum of 600% and an average of 437% for the realistic workloads that we considered.","author":["In Hwan Doh","Jongmoo Choi","Donghee Lee","Sam H.

In this paper, we study these two operations on graphics processing units (GPUs). With superior computing power and high memory bandwidth, GPUs have become a commodity multiprocessor platform for general-purpose high-performance computing. However, due to the random access nature of gather and scatter, a naive implementation of the two operations suffers from a low utilization of the memory bandwidth and consequently a long, unhidden memory latency. Additionally, the architectural details of the GPUs, in particular, the memory hierarchy design, are unclear to the programmers. Therefore, we design multi-pass gather and scatter operations to improve their data access locality, and develop a performance model to help understand and optimize these two operations. We have evaluated our algorithms in sorting, hashing, and the sparse matrix-vector multiplication in comparison with their optimized CPU counterparts. Our results show that these optimizations yield 2--4X improvement on the GPU bandwidth utilization and 30--50% improvement on the response time. Overall, our optimized GPU implementations are 2--7X faster than their optimized CPU counterparts.","author":["Bingsheng He","Naga K.

The two-layered elastic object consists of inner and outer elastic mass-spring surfaces and compressible internal pressure. The density of the inner layer can be set differently from the density of the outer layer; the motion of the inner layer can be opposite to the motion of the outer layer. These special features, which cannot be achieved by a single layered object, result in improved imitation of a soft body, such as tissue's liquid non-uniform deformation. The inertial behavior of the elastic object is well illustrated in environments with gravity and collisions with walls, ceiling, and floor. The collision detection is defined by elastic collision penalty method and the motion of the object is guided by the Ordinary Differential Equation computation. Users can interact with the modeled objects, deform them, and observe the response to their action in real-time and we provide an extensible framework and its implementation for comparative studies of different physical-based modeling and integration algorithm implementations.","author":["Miao Song","Peter Grogono"],"issue":["C3S2E '08: Proceedings of the 2008 C3S2E conference","May 2008","Pages   145\u2013158","https://doi.org/10.1145/1370256.1370282"],"date":"12 May 2008","ref":[{"text":"N.

A type system designer defines type qualifiers and their semantics, and a compiler plug-in enforces the semantics. Programmers can write the type qualifiers in their programs and use the plug-in to detect or prevent errors. The Checker Framework is useful both to programmers who wish to write error-free code, and to type system designers who wish to evaluate and deploy their type systems. The Checker Framework includes new Java syntax for expressing type qualifiers; declarative and procedural mechanisms for writing type-checking rules; and support for flow-sensitive local type qualifier inference and for polymorphism over types and qualifiers. The Checker Framework is well-integrated with the Java language and toolset. We have evaluated the Checker Framework by writing 5 checkers and running them on over 600K lines of existing code. The checkers found real errors, then confirmed the absence of further errors in the fixed code. The case studies also shed light on the type systems themselves.","author":["Matthew M.

Reliability has become a major concern for SRAM designs in modern technologies. Both local mismatch and scaled VDD degrade read stability and write ability. Several static approaches, including traditional SNM, BL margin, and the N-curve method, can be used to measure static write margin. However, static approaches cannot indicate the impact of dynamic dependencies on cell stability. We propose to analyze dynamic write ability by considering the write operation as a noise event that we analyze using dynamic stability criteria. We also define dynamic write ability as the critical pulse width for a write. By using this dynamic criterion, we evaluate the existing static write margin metrics at normal and scaled supply voltages and assess their limitations. The dynamic write time metric can also be used to improve the accuracy of VCCmin estimation for active VDD scaling designs.","author":["Jiajing Wang","Satyanand Nalam","Benton H.

Many privacy protection algorithms rely on generalization and suppression of \"quasi-identifier\" attributes such as ZIP code and birthdate. Their objective is usually syntactic sanitization: for example, k-anonymity requires that each \"quasi-identifier\" tuple appear in at least k records, while l-diversity requires that the distribution of sensitive attributes for each quasi-identifier have high entropy. The utility of sanitized data is also measured syntactically, by the number of generalization steps applied or the number of records with the same quasi-identifier. In this paper, we ask whether generalization and suppression of quasi-identifiers offer any benefits over trivial sanitization which simply separates quasi-identifiers from sensitive attributes. Previous work showed that k-anonymous databases can be useful for data mining, but k-anonymization does not guarantee any privacy. By contrast, we measure the tradeoff between privacy (how much can the adversary learn from the sanitized records?) and utility, measured as accuracy of data-mining algorithms executed on the same sanitized records. For our experimental evaluation, we use the same datasets from the UCI machine learning repository as were used in previous research on generalization and suppression. Our results demonstrate that even modest privacy gains require almost complete destruction of the data-mining utility. In most cases, trivial sanitization provides equivalent utility and better privacy than k-anonymity, l-diversity, and similar methods based on generalization and suppression.","author":["Justin Brickell","Vitaly Shmatikov"],"issue":["KDD '08: Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2008","Pages   70\u201378","https://doi.org/10.1145/1401890.1401904"],"date":"24 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"D.

One of the major drawbacks of matrix factorization is that once computed, the model is static. For real-world applications dynamic updating a model is one of the most important tasks. Especially when ratings on new users or new items come in, updating the feature matrices is crucial. In this paper, we generalize regularized matrix factorization (RMF) to regularized kernel matrix factorization (RKMF). Kernels provide a flexible method for deriving new matrix factorization methods. Furthermore with kernels nonlinear interactions between feature vectors are possible. We propose a generic method for learning RKMF models. From this method we derive an online-update algorithm for RKMF models that allows to solve the new-user/new-item problem. Our evaluation indicates that our proposed online-update methods are accurate in approximating a full retrain of a RKMF model while the runtime of online-updating is in the range of milliseconds even for huge datasets like Netflix.","author":["Steffen Rendle","Lars Schmidt-Thieme"],"issue":["RecSys '08: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM conference on Recommender systems","October 2008","Pages   251\u2013258","https://doi.org/10.1145/1454008.1454047"],"date":"23 October 2008","ref":[{"text":"R.

Unlike hard disks, flash devices are free from any mechanical moving parts, have no seek or rotational delays and consume lower power. However, the internal idiosyncrasies of flash technology make its performance highly dependent on workload characteristics. The poor performance of random writes has been a cause of major concern, which needs to be addressed to better utilize the potential of flash in enterprise-scale environments. We examine one of the important causes of this poor performance: the design of the Flash Translation Layer (FTL), which performs the virtual-to-physical address translations and hides the erase-before-write characteristics of flash. We propose a complete paradigm shift in the design of the core FTL engine from the existing techniques with our Demand-based Flash Translation Layer (DFTL), which selectively caches page-level address mappings. We develop a flash simulation framework called FlashSim. Our experimental evaluation with realistic enterprise-scale workloads endorses the utility of DFTL in enterprise-scale storage systems by demonstrating: (i) improved performance, (ii) reduced garbage collection overhead and (iii) better overload behavior compared to state-of-the-art FTL schemes. For example, a predominantly random-write dominant I/O trace from an OLTP application running at a large financial institution shows a 78% improvement in average response time (due to a 3-fold reduction in operations of the garbage collector), compared to a state-of-the-art FTL scheme. Even for the well-known read-dominant TPC-H benchmark, for which DFTL introduces additional overheads, we improve system response time by 56%.","author":["Aayush Gupta","Youngjae Kim","Bhuvan Urgaonkar"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 44","Issue 3","March 2009","pp   229\u2013240","https://doi.org/10.1145/1508284.1508271"],"date":"07 March 2009","ref":[{"text":"Amir Ban.

We present a new model, based on the CRBM that preserves its most important computational properties and includes multiplicative three-way interactions that allow the effective interaction weight between two units to be modulated by the dynamic state of a third unit. We factor the three-way weight tensor implied by the multiplicative model, reducing the number of parameters from O(N3) to O(N2). The result is an efficient, compact model whose effectiveness we demonstrate by modeling human motion. Like the CRBM, our model can capture diverse styles of motion with a single set of parameters, and the three-way interactions greatly improve the model's ability to blend motion styles or to transition smoothly among them.","author":["Graham W.

This paper demonstrates that one profitable application of multicore processors is the execution of many similar instantiations of the same program. We identify that this model of execution is used in several practical scenarios and term it as \"multi-execution.\" Often, each such instance utilizes very similar data. In conventional cache hierarchies, each instance would cache its own data independently. We propose the Mergeable cache architecture that detects data similarities and merges cache blocks, resulting in substantial savings in cache storage requirements. This leads to reductions in off-chip memory accesses and overall power usage, and increases in application performance. We present cycle-accurate simulation results of 8 benchmarks (6 from SPEC2000) to demonstrate that our technique provides a scalable solution and leads to significant speedups due to reductions in main memory accesses. For 8 cores running 8 similar executions of the same application and sharing an exclusive 4-MB, 8-way L2 cache, the Mergeable cache shows a speedup in execution by 2.5x on average (ranging from 0.93x to 6.92x), while posing an overhead of only 4.28% on cache area and 5.21% on power when it is used.","author":["Susmit Biswas","Diana Franklin","Alan Savage","Ryan Dixon","Timothy Sherwood","Frederic T.

The key contributions of this paper are the principles of the FAWN architecture and the design and implementation of FAWN-KV--a consistent, replicated, highly available, and high-performance key-value storage system built on a FAWN prototype. Our design centers around purely log-structured datastores that provide the basis for high performance on flash storage, as well as for replication and consistency obtained using chain replication on a consistent hashing ring. Our evaluation demonstrates that FAWN clusters can handle roughly 350 key-value queries per Joule of energy--two orders of magnitude more than a disk-based system.","author":["David G.

However, PCM cells can endure only a maximum of 107 - 108 writes, making a PCM based system have a lifetime of only a few years under ideal conditions. Furthermore, we show that non-uniformity in writes to different cells reduces the achievable lifetime of PCM system by 20x. Writes to PCM cells can be made uniform with Wear-Leveling. Unfortunately, existing wear-leveling techniques require large storage tables and indirection, resulting in significant area and latency overheads. We propose Start-Gap, a simple, novel, and effective wear-leveling technique that uses only two registers. By combining Start-Gap with simple address-space randomization techniques we show that the achievable lifetime of the baseline 16GB PCM-based system is boosted from 5% (with no wear-leveling) to 97% of the theoretical maximum, while incurring a total storage overhead of less than 13 bytes and obviating the latency overhead of accessing large tables. We also analyze the security vulnerabilities for memory systems that have limited write endurance, showing that under adversarial settings, a PCM-based system can fail in less than one minute. We provide a simple extension to Start-Gap that makes PCM-based systems robust to such malicious attacks.","author":["Moinuddin K.

Product perception and popularity are constantly changing as new selection emerges. Similarly, customer inclinations are evolving, leading them to ever redefine their taste. Thus, modeling temporal dynamics is essential for designing recommender systems or general customer preference models. However, this raises unique challenges. Within the ecosystem intersecting multiple products and customers, many different characteristics are shifting simultaneously, while many of them influence each other and often those shifts are delicate and associated with a few data instances. This distinguishes the problem from concept drift explorations, where mostly a single concept is tracked. Classical time-window or instance decay approaches cannot work, as they lose too many signals when discarding data instances. A more sensitive approach is required, which can make better distinctions between transient effects and long-term patterns. We show how to model the time changing behavior throughout the life span of the data. Such a model allows us to exploit the relevant components of all data instances, while discarding only what is modeled as being irrelevant. Accordingly, we revamp two leading collaborative filtering recommendation approaches. Evaluation is made on a large movie-rating dataset underlying the Netflix Prize contest. Results are encouraging and better than those previously reported on this dataset. In particular, methods described in this paper play a significant role in the solution that won the Netflix contest.","author":["Yehuda Koren"],"issue":["Communications of the ACM","Volume 53","Issue 4","April 2010","pp   89\u201397","https://doi.org/10.1145/1721654.1721677"],"date":"01 April 2010","ref":[{"text":"Ali, K., van Stam, W.

Over-provisioning cannot be avoided as these centers must anticipate peak load with bursty behavior. Under-utilization, to date, has also been unavoidable as systems always had to be ready for that sudden burst of requests that loom just around the corner. Previous research has pointed to turning off systems as one solution, albeit, an infeasible one due to its irresponsiveness. In this paper, we present the feasibility of using new Storage Class Memory (SCM, which encompasses specific developments such as PCM, MRAM, or FeRAM) technology to turn systems on and off with minimum overhead. This feature is used to control systems on the whole (in comparison to previous fine-grained component-wise control) in finer time scale for high responsiveness with minimized power lost to idleness. Our empirical study is done by executing \"real trace\"-like workloads on a prototype \"data center\" of embedded systems deploying FeRAM. We quantify the energy savings and performance trade-off by turning idle systems off. We show that our energy savings approach consumes energy in proportion to user requests with configurable service of quality. Based on observations made on this data center, we discuss the requirements for real deployment. Finally, our conclusion is that SCM should not be viewed as just a replacement of RAM, but rather, as a component that could potentially open a whole new field of applications.","author":["In Hwan Doh","Young Jin Kim","Jung Soo Park","Eunsam Kim","Jongmoo Choi","Donghee Lee","Sam H.

However, existing techniques for flow-based networking rely too heavily on centralized controller software that installs rules reactively, based on the first packet of each flow. In this paper, we propose DIFANE, a scalable and efficient solution that keeps all traffic in the data plane by selectively directing packets through intermediate switches that store the necessary rules. DIFANE relegates the controller to the simpler task of partitioning these rules over the switches. DIFANE can be readily implemented with commodity switch hardware, since all data-plane functions can be expressed in terms of wildcard rules that perform simple actions on matching packets. Experiments with our prototype on Click-based OpenFlow switches show that DIFANE scales to larger networks with richer policies.","author":["Minlan Yu","Jennifer Rexford","Michael J.

An example is document rankings returned for the same query by different search engines. A measure of the similarity between incomplete rankings should handle nonconjointness, weight high ranks more heavily than low, and be monotonic with increasing depth of evaluation; but no measure satisfying all these criteria currently exists. In this article, we propose a new measure having these qualities, namely rank-biased overlap (RBO). The RBO measure is based on a simple probabilistic user model. It provides monotonicity by calculating, at a given depth of evaluation, a base score that is non-decreasing with additional evaluation, and a maximum score that is nonincreasing. An extrapolated score can be calculated between these bounds if a point estimate is required. RBO has a parameter which determines the strength of the weighting to top ranks. We extend RBO to handle tied ranks and rankings of different lengths. Finally, we give examples of the use of the measure in comparing the results produced by public search engines and in assessing retrieval systems in the laboratory.","author":["William Webber","Alistair Moffat","Justin Zobel"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 28","Issue 4","November 2010","Article No.: 20","pp   1\u201338","https://doi.org/10.1145/1852102.1852106"],"date":"23 November 2010","ref":[{"text":"Bar-Ilan, J. 2005.

The proposed technique combines the benefits of fast radiation-induced fault detection with fast restoration of the device functionality and small area and power overheads. Experimental results demonstrate that the novel approach significantly improves the availability in hostile radiation environments of FPGA-based designs. When implemented using a Xilinx XC2V1000 Virtex-II device, the presented technique detects and corrects single bit upsets and double, triple and quadruple multi bit upsets, occupying just 1488 slices and dissipating less than 30 mW at a 50MHz running frequency.","author":["M.

Although these systems have been shown to provide orders of magnitude higher performance than solutions using software-based routers, straightforward reconfiguration of hardware-based virtual networks over time is a challenge. In this paper, we present the implementation of a reconfigurable network virtualization substrate that combines several partially-reconfigurable hardware virtual routers with software virtual routers. The update of hardware-based virtual networks in our system is supported via real-time partial FPGA reconfiguration. Hardware virtual networks can be dynamically reconfigured in a fraction of a second without affecting other virtual networks operating in the same FPGA. A heuristic has been developed to allocate virtual networks with diverse bandwidth requirements and network characteristics on this heterogeneous virtualization substrate. Experimental results show that the reconfigurable virtual routers can forward packets at line rate. Partial reconfiguration allows for 20x faster hardware reconfiguration than a previous approach which migrated hardware virtual networks to software.","author":["Dong Yin","Deepak Unnikrishnan","Yong Liao","Lixin Gao","Russell Tessier"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 41","Issue 1","January 2011","pp   125\u2013132","https://doi.org/10.1145/1925861.1925882"],"date":"22 January 2011","ref":[{"text":"OpenVZ project page. http://www.openvz.org/.","order":1},{"text":"M.

Memory is a significant contributor to total system power. This paper introduces Flikker, an application-level technique to reduce refresh power in DRAM memories. Flikker enables developers to specify critical and non-critical data in programs and the runtime system allocates this data in separate parts of memory. The portion of memory containing critical data is refreshed at the regular refresh-rate, while the portion containing non-critical data is refreshed at substantially lower rates. This partitioning saves energy at the cost of a modest increase in data corruption in the non-critical data. Flikker thus exposes and leverages an interesting trade-off between energy consumption and hardware correctness. We show that many applications are naturally tolerant to errors in the non-critical data, and in the vast majority of cases, the errors have little or no impact on the application's final outcome. We also find that Flikker can save between 20-25% of the power consumed by the memory sub-system in a mobile device, with negligible impact on application performance. Flikker is implemented almost entirely in software, and requires only modest changes to the hardware.","author":["Song Liu","Karthik Pattabiraman","Thomas Moscibroda","Benjamin G.

Most optimizations for uniprocessors reduce the number of instructions executed by the program using transformations based on the analysis of scalar quantities and data-flow techniques. In contrast, optimizations for high-performance superscalar, vector, and parallel processors maximize parallelism and memory locality with transformations that rely on tracking the properties of arrays using loop dependence analysis.This survey is a comprehensive overview of the important high-level program restructuring techniques for imperative languages, such as C and Fortran. Transformations for both sequential and various types of parallel architectures are covered in depth. We describe the purpose of each transformation, explain how to determine if it is legal, and give an example of its application.Programmers wishing to enhance the performance of their code can use this survey to improve their understanding of the optimizations that compilers can perform, or as a reference for techniques to be applied manually. Students can obtain an overview of optimizing compiler technology. Compiler writers can use this survey as a reference for most of the important optimizations developed to date, and as bibliographic reference for the details of each optimization. Readers are expected to be familiar with modern computer architecture and basic program compilation techniques.","author":["David F. Bacon","Susan L. Graham","Oliver J.

While increasingly studied in the area of databases, uncertain data processing is often carried out by software, and thus software based solutions are attractive. In particular, Monte Carlo (MC) methods execute software with many samples from the uncertain inputs and observe the statistical behavior of the output. In this paper, we propose a technique to improve the cost-effectiveness of MC methods. Assuming only part of the input is uncertain, the certain part of the input always leads to the same execution across multiple sample runs. We remove such redundancy by coalescing multiple sample runs in a single run. In the coalesced run, the program operates on a vector of values if uncertainty is present and a single value otherwise. We handle cases where control flow and pointers are uncertain. Our results show that we can speed up the execution time of 30 sample runs by an average factor of 2.3 without precision lost or by up to 3.4 with negligible precision lost.","author":["William N.

Under the hood, DBT is typically implemented using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation of frequently executed program regions, also called traces. The main challenge is translating frequently executed program regions as fast as possible into highly efficient native code. As time for JIT compilation adds to the overall execution time, the JIT compiler is often decoupled and operates in a separate thread independent from the main simulation loop to reduce the overhead of JIT compilation. In this paper we present two innovative contributions. The first contribution is a generalized trace compilation approach that considers all frequently executed paths in a program for JIT compilation, as opposed to previous approaches where trace compilation is restricted to paths through loops. The second contribution reduces JIT compilation cost by compiling several hot traces in a concurrent task farm. Altogether we combine generalized light-weight tracing, large translation units, parallel JIT compilation and dynamic work scheduling to ensure timely and efficient processing of hot traces. We have evaluated our industry-strength, LLVM-based parallel DBT implementing the ARCompact ISA against three benchmark suites (EEMBC, BioPerf and SPEC CPU2006) and demonstrate speedups of up to 2.08 on a standard quad-core Intel Xeon machine. Across short- and long-running benchmarks our scheme is robust and never results in a slowdown. In fact, using four processors total execution time can be reduced by on average 11.5% over state-of-the-art decoupled, parallel (or asynchronous) JIT compilation.","author":["Igor B\u00f6hm","Tobias J.K.

However, due to its relatively high price and low capacity, a major system research issue to address is on how to make SSDs play their most effective roles in a high-performance storage system in cost- and performance-effective ways. In this paper, we will answer several related questions with insights based on the design and implementation of a high performance hybrid storage system, called Hystor. We make the best use of SSDs in storage systems by achieving a set of optimization objectives from both system deployment and algorithm design perspectives. Hystor manages both SSDs and hard disk drives (HDDs) as one single block device with minimal changes to existing OS kernels. By monitoring I/O access patterns at runtime, Hystor can effectively identify blocks that (1) can result in long latencies or (2) are semantically critical (e.g. file system metadata), and stores them in SSDs for future accesses to achieve a significant performance improvement. In order to further leverage the exceptionally high performance of writes in the state-of-the-art SSDs, Hystor also serves as a write-back buffer to speed up write requests. Our measurements on Hystor implemented in the Linux kernel 2.6.25.8 show that it can take advantage of the performance merits of SSDs with only a few lines of changes to the stock Linux kernel. Our system study shows that in a highly effective hybrid storage system, SSDs should play a major role as an independent storage where the best suitable data are adaptively and timely migrated in and retained, and it can also be effective to serve as a write-back buffer.","author":["Feng Chen","David A.

GPUs offer a large number of parallel cores and have access to high memory bandwidth; however, data structure layouts in GPU memory often lead to suboptimal performance for programs designed with a CPU memory interface---or no particular memory interface at all!---in mind. This implies that application performance is highly sensitive irregularity in memory access patterns. This issue is all the more important due to the growing disparity between core and DRAM clocks; memory interfaces have increasingly become bottlenecks in computer systems. In this paper, we propose a simple API, Dymaxion, that allows programmers to optimize memory mappings to improve the efficiency of memory accesses on heterogeneous platforms. Use of Dymaxion requires only minimal modifications to existing CUDA programs. Our current framework extends NVIDIA's CUDA API with the addition of memory layout remapping and index transformation. We consider the overhead of layout remapping and effectively hide it through chunking and overlapping with PCI-E transfer. We present the implementation of Dymaxion and its optimizations and evaluate a variety of important memory access patterns. Using four case studies, we are able to achieve 3.3x speedup on GPU kernels and 20% overall performance improvement, including the PCI-E transfer, over the original CUDA implementations on an NVIDIA GTX 480 GPU. We also explore the importance of maintaining per-device data layouts and cross-device data mappings with a case study of concurrent CPU-GPU execution.","author":["Shuai Che","Jeremy W.

In both categories, the underlying file system is a key component for scalable application performance. In this paper, we explore the similarities and differences between PVFS, a parallel file system used in HPC at large scale, and HDFS, the primary storage system used in cloud computing with Hadoop. We integrate PVFS into Hadoop and compare its performance to HDFS using a set of data-intensive computing benchmarks. We study how HDFS-specific optimizations can be matched using PVFS and how consistency, durability, and persistence tradeoffs made by these file systems affect application performance. We show how to embed multiple replicas into a PVFS file, including a mapping with a complete copy local to the writing client, to emulate HDFS's file layout policies. We also highlight implementation issues with HDFS's dependence on disk bandwidth and benefits from pipelined replication.","author":["Wittawat Tantisiriroj","Seung Woo Son","Swapnil Patil","Samuel J.

However, users in online social networks rarely categorize their contacts into \"family\", \"colleagues\", or \"classmates\". While a bulk of research has focused on inferring particular types of relationships in a specific social network, few publications systematically study the generalization of the problem of inferring social ties over multiple heterogeneous networks. In this work, we develop a framework for classifying the type of social relationships by learning across heterogeneous networks. The framework incorporates social theories into a factor graph model, which effectively improves the accuracy of inferring the type of social relationships in a target network by borrowing knowledge from a different source network. Our empirical study on five different genres of networks validates the effectiveness of the proposed framework. For example, by leveraging information from a coauthor network with labeled advisor-advisee relationships, the proposed framework is able to obtain an F1-score of 90% (8-28% improvements over alternative methods) for inferring manager-subordinate relationships in an enterprise email network.","author":["Jie Tang","Tiancheng Lou","Jon Kleinberg"],"issue":["WSDM '12: Proceedings of the fifth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining","February 2012","Pages   743\u2013752","https://doi.org/10.1145/2124295.2124382"],"date":"08 February 2012","ref":[{"text":"L.

The input to our compiler is a na\u00efve GPU kernel function, which is functionally correct but without any consideration for performance optimization. The compiler generates two kernels, one optimized for global memories and the other for texture memories. The proposed compilation process is effective for both AMD/ATI and NVIDIA GPUs.

To configure an array properly, a system administrator must understand the details of both the array and the workload it will support. Incorrect understanding of either, or changes in the workload over time, can lead to poor performance. We present a solution to this problem: a two-level storage hierarchy implemented inside a single disk-array controller. In the upper level of this hierarchy, two copies of active data are stored to provide full redundancy and excellent performance. In the lower level, RAID 5 parity protection is used to provide excellent storage cost for inactive data, at somewhat lower performance. The technology we describe in this article, know as HP AutoRAID, automatically and transparently manages migration of data blocks between these two levels as access patterns change. The result is a fully redundant storage system that is extremely easy to use, is suitable for a wide variety of workloads, is largely insensitive to dynamic workload changes, and performs much better than disk arrays with comparable numbers of spindles and much larger amounts of front-end RAM cache. Because the implementation of the HP AutoRAID technology is almost entirely in software, the additional hardware cost for these benefits is very small. We describe the HP AutoRAID technology in detail, provide performance data for an embodiment of it in a storage array, and summarize the results of simulation studies used to choose algorithms implemented in the array.","author":["John Wilkes","Richard Golding","Carl Staelin","Tim Sullivan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Computer Systems","Volume 14","Issue 1","Feb. 1996","pp   108\u2013136","https://doi.org/10.1145/225535.225539"],"date":"01 February 1996","ref":[{"text":"AKY(~REK, S.

There has been recent interest in using these Energy Storage Devices (ESDs) for demand-response (DR) to either shift peak demand away from high tariff periods, or to shave demand allowing aggressive under-provisioning of the power infrastructure. All such prior work has only considered a single/specific type of ESD (typically re-chargeable lead-acid batteries), and has only employed them at a single level of the power delivery network. Continuing technological advances have provided us a plethora of competitive ESD options ranging from ultra-capacitors, to different kinds of batteries, flywheels and even compressed air-based storage. These ESDs offer very different trade-offs between their power and energy costs, densities, lifetimes, and energy efficiency, among other factors, suggesting that employing hybrid combinations of these may allow more effective DR than with a single technology. Furthermore, ESDs can be placed at different, and possibly multiple, levels of the power delivery hierarchy with different associated trade-offs. To our knowledge, no prior work has studied the extensive design space involving multiple ESD technology provisioning and placement options. This paper intends to fill this critical void, by presenting a theoretical framework for capturing important characteristics of different ESD technologies, the trade-offs of placing them at different levels of the power hierarchy, and quantifying the resulting cost-benefit trade-offs as a function of workload properties.","author":["Di Wang","Chuangang Ren","Anand Sivasubramaniam","Bhuvan Urgaonkar","Hosam Fathy"],"issue":["ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review","Volume 40","Issue 1","June 2012","pp   187\u2013198","https://doi.org/10.1145/2318857.2254780"],"date":"11 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"M.

In optical networks, the vast bandwidth available in an optical fiber is utilized by partitioning it into several channels, each at a different optical wavelength. A connection between two nodes is assigned a specific wavelength, with the constraint that no two connections sharing a link in the network can be assigned the same wavelength. This paper considers optical networks with and without switches, and different types of routing in these networks. It presents optimal or near-optimal constructions of optical networks in these cases and algorithms for routing connections, specifically permutation routing for the networks constructed here.","author":["Alok Aggarwal","Amotz Bar-Noy","Don Coppersmith","Rajiv Ramaswami","Baruch Schieber","Madhu Sudan"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 43","Issue 6","Nov. 1996","pp   973\u20131001","https://doi.org/10.1145/235809.235812"],"date":"01 November 1996","ref":[{"text":"~ARORA, S., LEIGHTON, T.

To support heterogeneous mobile users with high-quality multimedia services, scalable video coding was introduced. In the scalable video coding (SVC), through multidimensional scalability, all types of these scalability can be exploited at the same time. However, the generated video sequences of scalable video coding are not adequate for mobile multimedia service systems since its flexibility makes non contiguous storing and retrieval of partial stream data. In this article, we propose efficient scalable video data reorganization for video servicing systems, which consist of video server and mobile clients. For video server, we reorganize scalable video streams taking into account both of decoding dependency and location in disk array storage, where disk array is widely used for storage systems of video server. In the mobile devices, we place substreams with the consideration of NAND flash memory page and block boundaries, which is storage for mobile devices. The experimental results show that the proposed reorganization of scalable video can improve the performance of mobile multimedia service systems.","author":["Seung-Ho Lim","Min Choi","Young Sik Jeong"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 12","Issue 2","February 2013","Article No.: 27","pp   1\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/2423636.2423645"],"date":"22 February 2013","ref":[{"text":"Ban, A. 1995.

Significant improvements in the execution time can be achieved with effective utilization of on-chip (scratchpad) memories, associated with careful software-based data reuse and communication scheduling techniques. We present a fully automated C-to-FPGA framework to address this problem. Our framework effectively implements data reuse through aggressive loop transformation-based program restructuring. In addition, our proposed framework automatically implements critical optimizations for performance such as task-level parallelization, loop pipelining, and data prefetching. We leverage the power and expressiveness of the polyhedral compilation model to develop a multi-objective optimization system for off-chip communications management. Our technique can satisfy hardware resource constraints (scratchpad size) while still aggressively exploiting data reuse. Our approach can also be used to reduce the on-chip buffer size subject to bandwidth constraint. We also implement a fast design space exploration technique for effective optimization of program performance using the Xilinx high-level synthesis tool.","author":["Louis-Noel Pouchet","Peng Zhang","P.

Our design is based on a physical copying mechanism that multiplies a sensor image into a number of identical copies that still carry the plenoptic information of interest. Via different optical filters, we can then recover the desired information. A minor modification of the design also allows for aperture sub-sampling and, hence, light-field imaging. As the filters in our design are exchangeable, a reconfiguration for different imaging purposes is possible. We show in a prototype setup that high dynamic range, multispectral, polarization, and light-field imaging can be achieved with our design.","author":["Alkhazur Manakov","John F.

Unfortunately, technology limitations, such as process variability and circuit aging, are forcing microprocessor designers to add larger voltage guardbands to their chips. This makes supply voltage increasingly difficult to scale with technology. This paper presents a new mechanism for dynamically reducing voltage margins while maintaining the chip operating frequency constant. Unlike previous approaches that rely on special hardware to detect and recover from timing violations caused by low-voltage execution, our solution is firmware-based and does not require additional hardware. Instead, it relies on error correction mechanisms already built into modern processors. The system dynamically reduces voltage margins and uses correctable error reports raised by the hardware to identify the lowest, safe operating voltage. The solution adapts to core-to-core variability by tailoring supply voltage to each core's safe operating level. In addition, it exploits variability in workload vulnerability to low voltage execution. The system was prototyped on an HP Integrity Server that uses Intel's Itanium 9560 processors. Evaluation using SPECjbb2005 and SPEC CPU2000 workloads shows core power savings ranging from 18% to 23%, with minimal performance impact.","author":["Anys Bacha","Radu Teodorescu"],"issue":["ISCA '13: Proceedings of the 40th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2013","Pages   297\u2013307","https://doi.org/10.1145/2485922.2485948"],"date":"23 June 2013","ref":[{"text":"H.

Previous studies showed promising results using various machine learning algorithms. However, most existing methods can only recognize the activities that were previously seen in the training data. In this paper, we present a new zero-shot learning framework for human activity recognition that can recognize an unseen new activity even when there are no training samples of that activity in the dataset. We propose a semantic attribute sequence model that takes into account both the hierarchical and sequential nature of activity data. Evaluation on datasets in two activity domains show that the proposed zero-shot learning approach achieves 70-75% precision and recall recognizing unseen new activities, and outperforms supervised learning with limited labeled data for the new classes.","author":["Heng-Tze Cheng","Martin Griss","Paul Davis","Jianguo Li","Di You"],"issue":["UbiComp '13: Proceedings of the 2013 ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and ubiquitous computing","September 2013","Pages   355\u2013358","https://doi.org/10.1145/2493432.2493511"],"date":"08 September 2013","ref":[{"text":"Bishop, C.

The distribution of data across processes becomes important on distributed-memory computers with thousands of cores. It has been shown that two-dimensional layouts (edge partitioning) can have significant advantages over traditional one-dimensional layouts. However, simple 2D block distribution does not use the structure of the graph, and more advanced 2D partitioning methods are too expensive for large graphs. We propose a new two-dimensional partitioning algorithm that combines graph partitioning with 2D block distribution. The computational cost of the algorithm is essentially the same as 1D graph partitioning. We study the performance of sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) for scale-free graphs from the web and social networks using several different partitioners and both 1D and 2D data layouts. We show that SpMV run time is reduced by exploiting the graph's structure. Contrary to popular belief, we observe that current graph and hypergraph partitioners often yield relatively good partitions on scale-free graphs. We demonstrate that our new 2D partitioning method consistently outperforms the other methods considered, for both SpMV and an eigensolver, on matrices with up to 1.6 billion nonzeros using up to 16,384 cores.","author":["Erik G.

In this study we strive to develop a series of new latent semantic models with a deep structure that project queries and documents into a common low-dimensional space where the relevance of a document given a query is readily computed as the distance between them. The proposed deep structured semantic models are discriminatively trained by maximizing the conditional likelihood of the clicked documents given a query using the clickthrough data. To make our models applicable to large-scale Web search applications, we also use a technique called word hashing, which is shown to effectively scale up our semantic models to handle large vocabularies which are common in such tasks. The new models are evaluated on a Web document ranking task using a real-world data set. Results show that our best model significantly outperforms other latent semantic models, which were considered state-of-the-art in the performance prior to the work presented in this paper.","author":["Po-Sen Huang","Xiaodong He","Jianfeng Gao","Li Deng","Alex Acero","Larry Heck"],"issue":["CIKM '13: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management","October 2013","Pages   2333\u20132338","https://doi.org/10.1145/2505515.2505665"],"date":"27 October 2013","ref":[{"text":"Bengio, Y., 2009. \"Learning deep architectures for AI.\" Foundumental Trends Machine Learning, vol. 2.","doi":"10.1561/2200000006","order":1},{"text":"Blei, D.

New language standards have extended C and C++ with support for low-level atomic operations and a weak memory model, enabling developers to write portable and efficient multithreaded code. Developing correct low-level concurrent code is well-known to be especially difficult under a weak memory model, where code behavior can be surprising. Building reliable concurrent software using C/C++ low-level atomic operations will likely require tools that help developers discover unexpected program behaviors. In this paper we present CDSChecker, a tool for exhaustively exploring the behaviors of concurrent code under the C/C++ memory model. We develop several novel techniques for modeling the relaxed behaviors allowed by the memory model and for minimizing the number of execution behaviors that CDSChecker must explore. We have used CDSChecker to exhaustively unit test several concurrent data structure implementations on specific inputs and have discovered errors in both a recently published C11 implementation of a work-stealing queue and a single producer, single consumer queue implementation.","author":["Brian Norris","Brian Demsky"],"issue":["OOPSLA '13: Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGPLAN international conference on Object oriented programming systems languages & applications","October 2013","Pages   131\u2013150","https://doi.org/10.1145/2509136.2509514"],"date":"29 October 2013","ref":[{"text":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8115267/writing-a-spinning-thread-barrier-using-c11-atomics.

In multi-threaded applications, critical sections are used to ensure that only one thread accesses shared data at any given time. Critical sections can serialize the execution of threads, which significantly reduces performance and scalability.This paper proposes Accelerated Critical Sections (ACS), a technique that leverages the high-performance core(s) of an Asymmetric Chip Multiprocessor (ACMP) to accelerate the execution of critical sections. In ACS, selected critical sections are executed by a high-performance core, which can execute the critical section faster than the other, smaller cores. As a result, ACS reduces serialization: it lowers the likelihood of threads waiting for a critical section to finish. Our evaluation on a set of 12 critical-section-intensive workloads shows that ACS reduces the average execution time by 34% compared to an equal-area 32T-core symmetric CMP and by 23% compared to an equal-area ACMP. Moreover, for 7 out of the 12 workloads, ACS improves scalability by increasing the number of threads at which performance saturates.","author":["M. Aater Suleman","Onur Mutlu","Moinuddin K.

Control software programs the forwarding plane (e.g., switches and routers) using an open interface, such as OpenFlow. This paper aims to overcomes two limitations in current switching chips and the OpenFlow protocol: i) current hardware switches are quite rigid, allowing ``Match-Action'' processing on only a fixed set of fields, and ii) the OpenFlow specification only defines a limited repertoire of packet processing actions. We propose the RMT (reconfigurable match tables) model, a new RISC-inspired pipelined architecture for switching chips, and we identify the essential minimal set of action primitives to specify how headers are processed in hardware. RMT allows the forwarding plane to be changed in the field without modifying hardware. As in OpenFlow, the programmer can specify multiple match tables of arbitrary width and depth, subject only to an overall resource limit, with each table configurable for matching on arbitrary fields. However, RMT allows the programmer to modify all header fields much more comprehensively than in OpenFlow. Our paper describes the design of a 64 port by 10 Gb/s switch chip implementing the RMT model. Our concrete design demonstrates, contrary to concerns within the community, that flexible OpenFlow hardware switch implementations are feasible at almost no additional cost or power.","author":["Pat Bosshart","Glen Gibb","Hun-Seok Kim","George Varghese","Nick McKeown","Martin Izzard","Fernando Mujica","Mark Horowitz"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 43","Issue 4","October 2013","pp   99\u2013110","https://doi.org/10.1145/2534169.2486011"],"date":"27 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"P.

Despite the rich literature on video and QoE measurement, our understanding of Internet video QoE is limited because of the shift from traditional methods of measuring video quality (e.g., Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and user experience (e.g., opinion scores). These have been replaced by new quality metrics (e.g., rate of buffering, bitrate) and new engagement centric measures of user experience (e.g., viewing time and number of visits). The goal of this paper is to develop a predictive model of Internet video QoE. To this end, we identify two key requirements for the QoE model: (1) it has to be tied in to observable user engagement and (2) it should be actionable to guide practical system design decisions. Achieving this goal is challenging because the quality metrics are interdependent, they have complex and counter-intuitive relationships to engagement measures, and there are many external factors that confound the relationship between quality and engagement (e.g., type of video, user connectivity). To address these challenges, we present a data-driven approach to model the metric interdependencies and their complex relationships to engagement, and propose a systematic framework to identify and account for the confounding factors. We show that a delivery infrastructure that uses our proposed model to choose CDN and bitrates can achieve more than 20\\% improvement in overall user engagement compared to strawman approaches.","author":["Athula Balachandran","Vyas Sekar","Aditya Akella","Srinivasan Seshan","Ion Stoica","Hui Zhang"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 43","Issue 4","October 2013","pp   339\u2013350","https://doi.org/10.1145/2534169.2486025"],"date":"27 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"Buyer's Guide: Content Delivery Networks. http://goo.gl/B6gMK.","order":1},{"text":"Cisco study. http://goo.gl/tMRwM.","order":2},{"text":"Driving Engagement for Online Video. http://goo.gl/pO5Cj.","order":3},{"text":"Microsoft Smooth Streaming. http://goo.gl/6JOXh.","order":4},{"text":"P.800 : Methods for subjective determination of transmission quality. http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.800-199608-I/en.","order":5},{"text":"P.910: Subjective video quality assessment methods for multimedia applications. http://goo.gl/QjFhZ.","order":6},{"text":"Peak signal to noise ratio. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio.","order":7},{"text":"SPEC philosophy. http://www.spec.org/spec/#philosophy.","order":8},{"text":"Turbobytes: How it works. http://www.turbobytes.com/products/optimizer/.","order":9},{"text":"Video quality metrics. http://goo.gl/Ga9Xz.","order":10},{"text":"Vqeg. http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/vqeg/vqeg-home.aspx.","order":11},{"text":"S.

In this paper, we show that Wi-Fi can also extend our senses, enabling us to see moving objects through walls and behind closed doors. In particular, we can use such signals to identify the number of people in a closed room and their relative locations. We can also identify simple gestures made behind a wall, and combine a sequence of gestures to communicate messages to a wireless receiver without carrying any transmitting device. The paper introduces two main innovations. First, it shows how one can use MIMO interference nulling to eliminate reflections off static objects and focus the receiver on a moving target. Second, it shows how one can track a human by treating the motion of a human body as an antenna array and tracking the resulting RF beam. We demonstrate the validity of our design by building it into USRP software radios and testing it in office buildings.","author":["Fadel Adib","Dina Katabi"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 43","Issue 4","October 2013","pp   75\u201386","https://doi.org/10.1145/2534169.2486039"],"date":"27 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"How Signal is affected. www.ci.cumberland.md.us/.

CakeML is implemented as an interactive read-eval-print loop (REPL) in x86-64 machine code. Our correctness theorem ensures that this REPL implementation prints only those results permitted by the semantics of CakeML. Our verification effort touches on a breadth of topics including lexing, parsing, type checking, incremental and dynamic compilation, garbage collection, arbitrary-precision arithmetic, and compiler bootstrapping. Our contributions are twofold. The first is simply in building a system that is end-to-end verified, demonstrating that each piece of such a verification effort can in practice be composed with the others, and ensuring that none of the pieces rely on any over-simplifying assumptions. The second is developing novel approaches to some of the more challenging aspects of the verification. In particular, our formally verified compiler can bootstrap itself: we apply the verified compiler to itself to produce a verified machine-code implementation of the compiler. Additionally, our compiler proof handles diverging input programs with a lightweight approach based on logical timeout exceptions. The entire development was carried out in the HOL4 theorem prover.","author":["Ramana Kumar","Magnus O.

Data center real estate is expensive, and several industry experts we have spoken to have suggested that a significant portion of their data center space is devoted to key value stores. Despite its wide-spread use, there is little in the way of hardware specialization for increasing the efficiency and density of Memcached; it is currently deployed on commodity servers that contain high-end CPUs designed to extract as much instruction-level parallelism as possible. Out-of-order CPUs, however have been shown to be inefficient when running Memcached. To address Memcached efficiency issues, we propose two architectures using 3D stacking to increase data storage efficiency. Our first 3D architecture, Mercury, consists of stacks of ARM Cortex-A7 cores with 4GB of DRAM, as well as NICs. Our second architecture, Iridium, replaces DRAM with NAND Flash to improve density. We explore, through simulation, the potential efficiency benefits of running Memcached on servers that use 3D-stacking to closely integrate low-power CPUs with NICs and memory. With Mercury we demonstrate that density may be improved by 2.9X, power efficiency by 4.9X, throughput by 10X, and throughput per GB by 3.5X over a state-of-the-art server running optimized Memcached. With Iridium we show that density may be increased by 14X, power efficiency by 2.4X, and throughput by 5.2X, while still meeting latency requirements for a majority of requests.","author":["Anthony Gutierrez","Michael Cieslak","Bharan Giridhar","Ronald G.

Current spatial clustering models disregard information about the people who are related to the clustered places. In this paper, we show how the density-based clustering paradigm can be extended to apply on places which are visited by users of a geo-social network. Our model considers both spatial information and the social relationships between users who visit the clustered places. After formally defining the model and the distance measure it relies on, we present efficient algorithms for its implementation, based on spatial indexing. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model via a case study on real data; in addition, we design two quantitative measures, called social entropy and community score to evaluate the quality of the discovered clusters. The results show that geo-social clusters have special properties and cannot be found by applying simple spatial clustering approaches. The efficiency of our index-based implementation is also evaluated experimentally.","author":["Jieming Shi","Nikos Mamoulis","Dingming Wu","David W.

DRAM cells that permanently exhibit short retention times are fairly easy to identify and repair through the use of memory tests and row and column redundancy. However, the retention time of many cells may vary over time due to a property called Variable Retention Time (VRT). Since these cells intermittently transition between failing and non-failing states, they are particularly difficult to identify through memory tests alone. In addition, the high temperature packaging process may aggravate this problem as the susceptibility of cells to VRT increases after the assembly of DRAM chips. A promising alternative to manufacture-time testing is to detect and mitigate retention failures after the system has become operational. Such a system would require mechanisms to detect and mitigate retention failures in the field, but would be responsive to retention failures introduced after system assembly and could dramatically reduce the cost of testing, enabling much longer tests than are practical with manufacturer testing equipment. In this paper, we analyze the efficacy of three common error mitigation techniques (memory tests, guardbands, and error correcting codes (ECC)) in real DRAM chips exhibiting both intermittent and permanent retention failures. Our analysis allows us to quantify the efficacy of recent system-level error mitigation mechanisms that build upon these techniques. We revisit prior works in the context of the experimental data we present, showing that our measured results significantly impact these works' conclusions. We find that mitigation techniques that rely on run-time testing alone [38, 27, 50, 26] are unable to ensure reliable operation even after many months of testing. Techniques that incorporate ECC[4, 52], however, can ensure reliable DRAM operation after only a few hours of testing. For example, VS-ECC[4], which couples testing with variable strength codes to allocate the strongest codes to the most error-prone memory regions, can ensure reliable operation for 10 years after only 19 minutes of testing. We conclude that the viability of these mitigation techniques depend on efficient online profiling of DRAM performed without disrupting system operation.","author":["Samira Khan","Donghyuk Lee","Yoongu Kim","Alaa R.

We propose a Stochastic Recognition and Mining processor (StoRM), which uses Stochastic Computing (SC) to efficiently realize computational kernels from these domains. Stochastic computing facilitates compact, power-efficient realization of arithmetic operations by representing and processing information as pseudo-random bit-streams. However, the overhead of conversion between representations, and the exponential relationship between precision and bit-stream length, are key challenges that limit the efficiency of stochastic designs. The proposed architecture for StoRM consists of a 2D array of Stochastic Processing Elements (StoPEs) with a streaming memory hierarchy, enabling binary-to-stochastic conversion to be amortized across rows or columns of StoPEs. We propos vector processing and segmented stochastic processing in the StoPEs to mitigate the unfavorable tradeoff between precision and bit-stream length. We also exploit the compactness of StoPEs to increase parallelism, thereby improving performance and energy efficiency. Finally, leveraging the resilience of RM applications to approximations in their computations, we design StoRM to support modulation of the stochastic bit-stream length, and utilize this capability to to optimize energy for a desired output quality. StoRM achieves 2-3X energy-delay improvements over a conventional design without sacrificing output quality, and upto 10X (20X) improvements when upto 5% (10%) loss in output quality is allowed. Our results also demonstrate that the proposed design techniques greatly enhance the applicability and benefits of stochastic computing.","author":["Vinay K.

Synchronicity is a location system that aims to push the envelope of highly-accurate localization systems further in both dimensions, requiring less line-of-sight and less infrastructure. With Distributed MIMO network of wireless LAN access points (APs) as a starting point, we leverage the time synchronization that such a network affords to localize with time-difference-of-arrival information at the APs. We contribute novel super-resolution signal processing algorithms and reflection path elimination schemes, yielding superior results even in non-line-of-sight scenarios (with one to two walls separating client and APs). We implement and briefly evaluate Synchronicity on the WARP hardware radio platform using standard 20~MHz wireless LAN channels.","author":["Jie Xiong","Kyle Jamieson","Karthikeyan Sundaresan"],"issue":["HotWireless '14: Proceedings of the 1st ACM workshop on Hot topics in wireless","September 2014","Pages   43\u201348","https://doi.org/10.1145/2643614.2643619"],"date":"11 September 2014","ref":[{"text":"K.

However, research shows that many expert interface components are seldom used and that there is a tendency for users to persistently fail to adopt faster methods for completing their work. This article summarizes and organizes research relevant to supporting users in making successful transitions to expert levels of performance. First, we provide a brief introduction to the underlying human factors of skill acquisition relevant to interaction with computer systems. We then present our focus, which is a review of the state of the art in user interfaces that promote expertise development. The review of interface research is based around four domains of performance improvement: intramodal improvement that occurs as a factor of repetition and practice with a single method of interaction; intermodal improvement that occurs when users switch from one method to another that has a higher performance ceiling; vocabulary extension, in which the user broadens his or her knowledge of the range of functions available; and task mapping, which examines the ways in which users perform their tasks. The review emphasizes the relationship between interface techniques and the human factors that explain their relative success.","author":["Andy Cockburn","Carl Gutwin","Joey Scarr","Sylvain Malacria"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 47","Issue 2","January 2015","Article No.: 31","pp   1\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/2659796"],"date":"12 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"P.

The reliability of the computation is the probability that it will produce an acceptably accurate result. Emerging approximate hardware platforms provide approximate operations that, in return for reduced energy consumption and/or increased performance, exhibit reduced reliability and/or accuracy.  We present Chisel, a system for reliability- and accuracy-aware optimization of approximate computational kernels that run on approximate hardware platforms. Given a combined reliability and/or accuracy specification, Chisel automatically selects approximate kernel operations to synthesize an approximate computation that minimizes energy consumption while satisfying its reliability and accuracy specification.  We evaluate Chisel on five applications from the image processing, scientific computing, and financial analysis domains. The experimental results show that our implemented optimization algorithm enables Chisel to optimize our set of benchmark kernels to obtain energy savings from 8.7% to 19.8% compared to the fully reliable kernel implementations while preserving important reliability guarantees.","author":["Sasa Misailovic","Michael Carbin","Sara Achour","Zichao Qi","Martin C.

However some characteristics of trajectories such as variable lengths and asynchronous sampling rates make it difficult to fit into traditional database systems that are disk-based and tuple-oriented. Motivated by the success of column store and recent development of in-memory databases, we try to explore the potential opportunities of boosting the performance of trajectory data processing by designing a novel trajectory storage within main memory. In contrast to most existing trajectory indexing methods that keep consecutive samples of the same trajectory in the same disk page, we partition the database into frames in which the positions of all moving objects at the same time instant are stored together and aligned in main memory. We found this column-wise storage to be surprisingly well suited for in-memory computing since most frames can be stored in highly compressed form, which is pivotal for increasing the memory throughput and reducing CPU-cache miss. The independence between frames also makes them natural working units when parallelizing data processing on a multi-core environment. Lastly we run a variety of common trajectory queries on both real and synthetic datasets in order to demonstrate advantages and study the limitations of our proposed storage.","author":["Haozhou Wang","Kai Zheng","Jiajie Xu","Bolong Zheng","Xiaofang Zhou","Shazia Sadiq"],"issue":["CIKM '14: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2014","Pages   1409\u20131418","https://doi.org/10.1145/2661829.2661878"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, there has been lacking of scientific and quantitative study to elucidate how social communication may deliver physical activity interventions. In this work we introduce a Community-level Physical Activity Propagation (CPP) model to analyze physical activity propagation and social influence at different granularities (i.e., individual level and community level). CPP is a novel model which is inspired by the well-known Independent Cascade and Community-level Social Influence models. Given a social network, we utilize a hierarchical approach to detect a set of communities and their reciprocal influence strength of physical activities. CPP provides a powerful tool to discover, summarize, and investigate influence patterns of physical activities in a health social network. The detail experimental evaluation shows not only the effectiveness of our approach but also the correlation of the detected communities with various health outcome measures (i.e., both existing ones and our novel measure, named Wellness score, which is a combination of lifestyle parameters, biometrics, and biomarkers).

While there has been significant research on this problem, current state-of-the-art approaches for this task require annotation of facial landmarks, e.g. TSM [25], or annotation of face poses [28, 22]. They also require training dozens of models to fully capture faces in all orientations, e.g. 22 models in HeadHunter method [22]. In this paper we propose Deep Dense Face Detector (DDFD), a method that does not require pose/landmark annotation and is able to detect faces in a wide range of orientations using a single model based on deep convolutional neural networks. The proposed method has minimal complexity; unlike other recent deep learning object detection methods [9], it does not require additional components such as segmentation, bounding-box regression, or SVM classifiers. Furthermore, we analyzed scores of the proposed face detector for faces in different orientations and found that 1) the proposed method is able to detect faces from different angles and can handle occlusion to some extent, 2) there seems to be a correlation between distribution of positive examples in the training set and scores of the proposed face detector. The latter suggests that the proposed method's performance can be further improved by using better sampling strategies and more sophisticated data augmentation techniques. Evaluations on popular face detection benchmark datasets show that our single-model face detector algorithm has similar or better performance compared to the previous methods, which are more complex and require annotations of either different poses or facial landmarks.","author":["Sachin Sudhakar Farfade","Mohammad J.

Low-swing clock trees are used in existing methodologies in order to decrease the dynamic power consumption in a trade-off for 3 issues: (1) the effect of leakage power consumption, which is becoming more dominant when the process scales sub-32nm; (2) the increase in insertion delay, resulting in a high clock skew; and (3) the difficulty in driving the existing DFF sinks with a low-swing clock signal without a timing violation. In this article, a FinFET-based low-swing clocking methodology is introduced to preserve the dynamic power savings of low-swing clocking while minimizing these three negative effects, facilitated through an efficient use of FinFET technology. At scaled performance constraints, the proposed methodology at 20nm FinFET leads to 42% total power savings (clock network+DFF) compared to a FinFET-based full-swing counterpart at the same frequency (3 GHz), thanks to the dynamic power savings of low-swing clocking and 3% power savings compared to a CMOS-based low-swing implementation running at the half frequency (1.5 GHz), thanks to the leakage power savings of FinFET technology.","author":["Can Sitik","Emre Salman","Leo Filippini","Sung Jun Yoon","Baris Taskin"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 12","Issue 2","August 2015","Article No.: 13","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/2701617"],"date":"02 September 2015","ref":[{"text":"F.

BDDs are a canonical representation of Boolean functions with respect to a variable ordering. Finding a variable ordering resulting in a small number of nodes and paths is a primary goal in BDD optimization. There are several approaches minimizing the number of nodes or paths in BDDs, but yet no method has been proposed to minimize both objectives at the same time. In this paper, BDD optimization is carried out as a bi-objective problem using two aforementioned criteria. For this purpose, we have exploited NSGA-II which has been proven to fit problems with a small number of objectives. Furthermore, the algorithm is facilitated with an objective priority scheme that allows to incorporate preference to one of the objectives. Experimental results show that our multi-objective BDD optimization algorithm has achieved a good trade-off between the number of nodes and the number of paths. Comparison of the results obtained by applying priority to the number of nodes or paths with node and path minimization techniques demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can find the minimum of the preferred objective in most cases as well as lowering the other objective simultaneously.","author":["Saeideh Shirinzadeh","Mathias Soeken","Rolf Drechsler"],"issue":["GECCO '15: Proceedings of the 2015 Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation","July 2015","Pages   751\u2013758","https://doi.org/10.1145/2739480.2754718"],"date":"11 July 2015","ref":[{"text":"B.

Existing designs, however, consume significant power and computational resources, and hence cannot be run on low complexity, power constrained backscatter devices. This paper makes two main contributions: (1) we introduce the first multi-antenna cancellation design that operates on backscatter devices while retaining a small form factor and power footprint, (2) we introduce a novel coding mechanism that enables long range communication as well as concurrent transmissions and can be decoded on backscatter devices. We build hardware prototypes of the above designs that can be powered solely using harvested energy from TV and solar sources. The results show that our designs provide benefits for both RFID and ambient backscatter systems: they enable RFID tags to communicate directly with each other at distances of tens of meters and through multiple walls. They also increase the communication rate and range achieved by ambient backscatter systems by 100X and 40X respectively. We believe that this paper represents a substantial leap in the capabilities of backscatter communication.","author":["Aaron N. Parks","Angli Liu","Shyamnath Gollakota","Joshua R.

In this paper, we show that how Dark Silicon together with the manufacturing process induced variability can be harnessed to mitigate reliability threats in the nano-era. In particular, we propose a run-time system Hayat* that harnesses Dark Silicon to decelerate and/or balance temperature-dependent aging, while also considering variability in order to improve the overall system performance for a given lifetime. Experimental evaluation across a range of chips to account for process variations illustrates that our Hayat system can provide a significant aging/performance improvement and decelerates the chip aging by 6 months -- 5 years (depending upon the required lifetime constraint) compared to state-of-the-art techniques.","author":["Dennis Gnad","Muhammad Shafique","Florian Kriebel","Semeen Rehman","Duo Sun","J\u00f6rg Henkel"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 180","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744849"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"M.

DsRem leverages the positioning of dark cores, to efficiently dissipate the heat generated by the active cores. This facilitates increasing the v/f level of the active cores, which leads to further performance improvement. Compared to state-of-the-art thermal-aware task application mapping, DsRem achieves up to 46% performance gain, while avoiding any thermal emergencies.

Different types of social ties have essentially different influences on people. Awareness of the types of social ties can benefit many applications, such as recommendation and community detection. For example, our close friends tend to move in the same circles that we do, while our classmates may be distributed into different communities. Though a bulk of research has focused on inferring particular types of relationships in a specific social network, few publications systematically study the generalization of the problem of predicting social ties across multiple heterogeneous networks.In this work, we develop a framework referred to as TranFG for classifying the type of social relationships by learning across heterogeneous networks. The framework incorporates social theories into a factor graph model, which effectively improves the accuracy of predicting the types of social relationships in a target network by borrowing knowledge from a different source network. We also present several active learning strategies to further enhance the inferring performance. To scale up the model to handle really large networks, we design a distributed learning algorithm for the proposed model.We evaluate the proposed framework (TranFG) on six different networks and compare with several existing methods. TranFG clearly outperforms the existing methods on multiple metrics. For example, by leveraging information from a coauthor network with labeled advisor-advisee relationships, TranFG is able to obtain an F1-score of 90% (8%--28% improvements over alternative methods) for predicting manager-subordinate relationships in an enterprise email network. The proposed model is efficient. It takes only a few minutes to train the proposed transfer model on large networks containing tens of thousands of nodes.","author":["Jie Tang","Tiancheng Lou","Jon Kleinberg","Sen Wu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 34","Issue 2","April 2016","Article No.: 7","pp   1\u201343","https://doi.org/10.1145/2746230"],"date":"13 April 2016","ref":[{"text":"Lada A.

Due to their functional similarities to synapses in the brain, memristors are becoming a key element in the hardware realization of Hebbian Learning systems. By pairing such devices and a perceptron-based neuron model with a threshold activation function, previous work has shown that a neural logic block capable of learning any linearly separable function in real-time can be developed. However, in this configuration, any function with two or more decision boundaries cannot be learned in a single layer. While previous memristor-based neural logic block designs have proven to achieve very low area and high performance when compared to Look-Up Tables (LUT) and Capacitive Threshold Logic (CTL), the limitation on the set of learnable functions has made networks of these logic blocks impractical to scale to realistic applications. By integrating an additional layer of memristors into a neural logic block, this paper proposes a logic block with an adaptive activation function. The resulting logic block is capable of learning any function in a single layer, reducing the number of logic blocks required to implement a single 4-input function by up to 10 and significantly improving training time. When considered as a building block for ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits, the proposed logic block is capable of achieving an Energy-Delay Product (EDP) up to 97.8% lower than a neural logic block with a threshold activation function. Furthermore, the performance improvement over a CMOS LUT implementation ranges from 78.08% to 97.43% for all ISCAS-85 circuits.","author":["Michael Soltiz","Cory Merkel","Dhireesha Kudithipudi","Garrett S.

Examples include question answering systems and dialogue systems, voice search on mobile devices and entity search engines like Facebook's Graph Search or Google's Knowledge Graph. However the performance of textbook information retrieval techniques for such verbose queries is not as good as that for their shorter counterparts. Thus, effective handling of verbose queries has become a critical factor for adoption of information retrieval techniques in this new breed of search applications. Over the past decade, the information retrieval community has deeply explored the problem of transforming natural language verbose queries using operations like reduction, weighting, expansion, reformulation and segmentation into more effective structural representations. However, thus far, there was not a coherent and organized tutorial on this topic. In this tutorial, we aim to put together various research pieces of the puzzle, provide a comprehensive and structured overview of various proposed methods, and also list various application scenarios where effective verbose query processing can make a significant difference.","author":["Manish Gupta","Michael Bendersky"],"issue":["SIGIR '15: Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2015","Pages   1121\u20131124","https://doi.org/10.1145/2766462.2767877"],"date":"09 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"R.

In this paper we learn an embedding for visual search in interior design. Our embedding contains two different domains of product images: products cropped from internet scenes, and products in their iconic form. With such a multi-domain embedding, we demonstrate several applications of visual search including identifying products in scenes and finding stylistically similar products. To obtain the embedding, we train a convolutional neural network on pairs of images. We explore several training architectures including re-purposing object classifiers, using siamese networks, and using multitask learning. We evaluate our search quantitatively and qualitatively and demonstrate high quality results for search across multiple visual domains, enabling new applications in interior design.","author":["Sean Bell","Kavita Bala"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 34","Issue 4","August 2015","Article No.: 98","pp   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2766959"],"date":"27 July 2015","ref":[{"text":"Babenko, A., Slesarev, A., Chigorin, A., and Lempitsky, V.

With their wide coverage, these tables are potentially very useful for filling missing values and extending cross-domain knowledge bases such as DBpedia, YAGO, or the Google Knowledge Graph. As a prerequisite for being able to use table data for knowledge base extension, the HTML tables need to be matched with the knowledge base, meaning that correspondences between table rows/columns and entities/schema elements of the knowledge base need to be found. This paper presents the T2D gold standard for measuring and comparing the performance of HTML table to knowledge base matching systems. T2D consists of 8 700 schema-level and 26 100 entity-level correspondences between the WebDataCommons Web Tables Corpus and the DBpedia knowledge base. In contrast related work on HTML table to knowledge base matching, the Web Tables Corpus (147 million tables), the knowledge base, as well as the gold standard are publicly available. The gold standard is used afterward to evaluate the performance of T2K Match, an iterative matching method which combines schema and instance matching. T2K Match is designed for the use case of matching large quantities of mostly small and narrow HTML tables against large cross-domain knowledge bases. The evaluation using the T2D gold standard shows that T2K Match discovers table-to-class correspondences with a precision of 94%, row-to-entity correspondences with a precision of 90%, and column-to-property correspondences with a precision of 77%.","author":["Dominique Ritze","Oliver Lehmberg","Christian Bizer"],"issue":["WIMS '15: Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Web Intelligence, Mining and Semantics","July 2015","Article No.: 10","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2797115.2797118"],"date":"13 July 2015","ref":[{"text":"V.

However, purchasing, operating, and maintaining the underlying physical resources incurs significant monetary costs and environmental impact. Therefore, cloud providers must optimize the use of physical resources by a careful allocation of VMs to hosts, continuously balancing between the conflicting requirements on performance and operational costs. In recent years, several algorithms have been proposed for this important optimization problem. Unfortunately, the proposed approaches are hardly comparable because of subtle differences in the used problem models. This article surveys the used problem formulations and optimization algorithms, highlighting their strengths and limitations, and pointing out areas that need further research.","author":["Zolt\u00e1n \u00c1d\u00e1m Mann"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 48","Issue 1","September 2015","Article No.: 11","pp   1\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/2797211"],"date":"10 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"Abdulla M.

While Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) offers massive parallelism, achieving high-performance BFS on GPUs entails efficient scheduling of a large number of GPU threads and effective utilization of GPU memory hierarchy. In this paper, we present Enterprise, a new GPU-based BFS system that combines three techniques to remove potential performance bottlenecks: (1) streamlined GPU threads scheduling through constructing a frontier queue without contention from concurrent threads, yet containing no duplicated frontiers and optimized for both top-down and bottom-up BFS. (2) GPU workload balancing that classifies the frontiers based on different out-degrees to utilize the full spectrum of GPU parallel granularity, which significantly increases thread-level parallelism; and (3) GPU based BFS direction optimization quantifies the effect of hub vertices on direction-switching and selectively caches a small set of critical hub vertices in the limited GPU shared memory to reduce expensive random data accesses. We have evaluated Enterprise on a large variety of graphs with different GPU devices. Enterprise achieves up to 76 billion traversed edges per second (TEPS) on a single NVIDIA Kepler K40, and up to 122 billion TEPS on two GPUs that ranks No. 45 in the Graph 500 on November 2014. Enterprise is also very energy-efficient as No. 1 in the GreenGraph 500 (small data category), delivering 446 million TEPS per watt.","author":["Hang Liu","H.

Their input-output behavior serves as a unique IC \u201cfingerprint.\u201d Therefore, they have been envisioned as an IC authentication mechanism, in particular the subclass of so-called strong PUFs. The protocol proposals are typically accompanied with two PUF promises: lightweight and an increased resistance against physical attacks. In this work, we review 19 proposals in chronological order: from the original strong PUF proposal (2001) to the more complicated noise bifurcation and system of PUF proposals (2014). The assessment is aided by a unified notation and a transparent framework of PUF protocol requirements.","author":["Jeroen Delvaux","Roel Peeters","Dawu Gu","Ingrid Verbauwhede"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 48","Issue 2","November 2015","Article No.: 26","pp   1\u201342","https://doi.org/10.1145/2818186"],"date":"12 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"Ramzi Bassil, Wissam El-Beaino, Ayman I.

However, as the emerging workloads are becoming heavily data-intensive and the emerging devices (e.g., NVM storage, high-bandwidth NICs, and GPUs) come to enable low-latency and high-bandwidth device operations, the traditional host-centric server architectures fail to deliver high performance due to their inefficient device handling mechanisms. Furthermore, without resolving the architecture inefficiency, the performance loss will continue to increase as the emerging devices become faster. In this paper, we propose DCS, a novel device-centric server architecture to fully exploit the potential of the emerging devices so that the server performance nicely scales with the performance of the devices. The key idea of DCS is to orchestrate the devices to directly communicate with each other while selectively bypassing the host. The host becomes responsible for only few device-related operations (e.g., filesystem lookup). In this way, DCS achieves high I/O performance by direct inter-device communications and high computation performance by fully utilizing the host-side resources. To implement DCS, we introduce DCS Engine, a custom hardware device to orchestrate devices via standard I/O protocols (i.e., PCIe and NVMe), along with its device driver and user-level library. We show that our FPGA-based DCS prototype significantly improves the performance of emerging server workloads and the architecture will nicely scale with the performance of the devices.","author":["Jaehyung Ahn","Dongup Kwon","Youngsok Kim","Mohammadamin Ajdari","Jaewon Lee","Jangwoo Kim"],"issue":["MICRO-48: Proceedings of the 48th International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2015","Pages   559\u2013571","https://doi.org/10.1145/2830772.2830794"],"date":"05 December 2015","ref":[{"text":"A.

Yet, persistent memory systems need to guarantee a consistent memory state in the event of power loss or a system crash (i.e., crash consistency). To guarantee crash consistency, most prior works rely on programmers to (1) partition persistent and transient memory data and (2) use specialized software interfaces when updating persistent memory data. As a result, taking advantage of persistent memory requires significant programmer effort, e.g., to implement new programs as well as modify legacy programs. Use cases and adoption of persistent memory can therefore be largely limited. In this paper, we propose a hardware-assisted DRAM+NVM hybrid persistent memory design, Transparent Hybrid NVM (ThyNVM), which supports software-transparent crash consistency of memory data in a hybrid memory system. To efficiently enforce crash consistency, we design a new dual-scheme checkpointing mechanism, which efficiently overlaps checkpointing time with application execution time. The key novelty is to enable checkpointing of data at multiple granularities, cache block or page granularity, in a coordinated manner. This design is based on our insight that there is a tradeoff between the application stall time due to checkpointing and the hardware storage overhead of the metadata for checkpointing, both of which are dictated by the granularity of checkpointed data. To get the best of the tradeoff, our technique adapts the checkpointing granularity to the write locality characteristics of the data and coordinates the management of multiple-granularity updates. Our evaluation across a variety of applications shows that ThyNVM performs within 4.9% of an idealized DRAM-only system that can provide crash consistency at no cost.","author":["Jinglei Ren","Jishen Zhao","Samira Khan","Jongmoo Choi","Yongwei Wu","Onur Mutlu"],"issue":["MICRO-48: Proceedings of the 48th International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2015","Pages   672\u2013685","https://doi.org/10.1145/2830772.2830802"],"date":"05 December 2015","ref":[{"text":"J.

We study the performance and energy of a Gen2 HMC on data-centric workloads through a combination of emulation and execution on an HMC FPGA board. An in-house FPGA emulator has been used to obtain memory traces for a small collection of data-centric benchmarks. Our FPGA emulator is based on a 32-bit ARM processor and non-intrusively captures complete memory access traces at only 20X slowdown from real time. We have developed tools to run combined trace fragments from multiple benchmarks on the HMC board, giving a unique capability to characterize HMC performance and power usage under a data parallel workload. We find that the HMC's separate read and write channels are not well exploited by read-dominated data-centric workloads. Our benchmarks achieve between 66% -- 80% of peak bandwidth (80 GB/s for 32-byte packets with 50--50 read/write mix) on the HMC, suggesting that combined read/write channels might show higher utilization on these access patterns. Bandwidth scales linearly up to saturation with increased demand on highly concurrent application workloads with many independent memory requests. There is a corresponding increase in latency, ranging from 80 ns on an extremely light load to 130 ns at high bandwidth.","author":["Maya Gokhale","Scott Lloyd","Chris Macaraeg"],"issue":["IA3 '15: Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Irregular Applications: Architectures and Algorithms","November 2015","Article No.: 7","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/2833179.2833184"],"date":"15 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"Arira Design. http://www.ariradesign.com, accessed 2015.","order":1},{"text":"High bandwidth memory (HBM) DRAM (JEDEC). http://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/docs/jesd235, accessed 2015.","order":2},{"text":"JEDEC Wide IO and Wide IO 2 specs. http://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/results/jesd229-2, accessed 2015.","order":3},{"text":"N.

It is vital that these memory modules operate reliably, as memory failure can require the replacement of the entire socket. To make matters worse, stacked memory designs are susceptible to newer failure modes (e.g., due to faulty through-silicon vias, or TSVs) that can cause large portions of memory, such as a bank, to become faulty. To avoid data loss from large-granularity failures, the memory system may use symbol-based codes that stripe the data for a cache line across several banks (or channels). Unfortunately, such data-striping reduces memory-level parallelism, causing significant slowdown and higher power consumption.This article proposes Citadel, a robust memory architecture that allows the memory system to retain each cache line within one bank. By retaining cache lines within banks, Citadel enables a high-performance and low-power memory system and also efficiently protects the stacked memory system from large-granularity failures. Citadel consists of three components; TSV-Swap, which can tolerate both faulty data-TSVs and faulty address-TSVs; Tri-Dimensional Parity (3DP), which can tolerate column failures, row failures, and bank failures; and Dynamic Dual-Granularity Sparing (DDS), which can mitigate permanent faults by dynamically sparing faulty memory regions either at a row granularity or at a bank granularity. Our evaluations with real-world data for DRAM failures show that Citadel provides performance and power similar to maintaining the entire cache line in the same bank, and yet provides 700 \u00d7 higher reliability than ChipKill-like ECC codes.","author":["Prashant J.

We demonstrate that indiscriminately storing encoded images in approximate memory generates unacceptable and uncontrollable quality degradation. The key finding is that errors in the encoded bit streams have non-uniform impact on the decoded image quality. We develop a methodology to determine the relative importance of encoded bits and store them in an approximate storage substrate. The storage cells are optimized to reduce error rate via biasing and are tuned to meet the desired reliability requirement via selective error correction. In a case study with the progressive transform codec (PTC), a precursor to JPEG XR, the proposed approximate image storage system exhibits a 2.7x increase in density of pixels per silicon volume under bounded error rates, and this achievement is additive to the storage savings of PTC compression.","author":["Qing Guo","Karin Strauss","Luis Ceze","Henrique S.

A wide range of applications critically rely on abundant, high-quality random numbers generated securely. Here, we show how to expand a random seed at an exponential rate without trusting the underlying quantum devices. Our approach is secure against the most general adversaries, and has the following new features: cryptographic level of security, tolerating a constant level of imprecision in devices, requiring only unit size quantum memory (for each device component) in an honest implementation, and allowing a large natural class of constructions for the protocol. In conjunction with a recent work by Chung et al. [2014], it also leads to robust unbounded expansion using just 2 multipart devices. When adapted for distributing cryptographic keys, our method achieves, for the first time, exponential expansion combined with cryptographic security and noise tolerance. The proof proceeds by showing that the R\u00e9nyi divergence of the outputs of the protocol (for a specific bounding operator) decreases linearly as the protocol iterates. At the heart of the proof are a new uncertainty principle on quantum measurements and a method for simulating trusted measurements with untrusted devices.","author":["Carl A.

Unfortunately, converting an algorithm by hand to a hardware description language suitable for compilation on these platforms is frequently too time consuming to be practical. Recent work on hardware synthesis of high-level image processing languages demonstrated that a single-rate pipeline of stencil kernels can be synthesized into hardware with provably minimal buffering. Unfortunately, few advanced image processing or vision algorithms fit into this highly-restricted programming model.In this paper, we present Rigel, which takes pipelines specified in our new multi-rate architecture and lowers them to FPGA implementations. Our flexible multi-rate architecture supports pyramid image processing, sparse computations, and space-time implementation tradeoffs. We demonstrate depth from stereo, Lucas-Kanade, the SIFT descriptor, and a Gaussian pyramid running on two FPGA boards. Our system can synthesize hardware for FPGAs with up to 436 Megapixels/second throughput, and up to 297x faster runtime than a tablet-class ARM CPU.","author":["James Hegarty","Ross Daly","Zachary DeVito","Jonathan Ragan-Kelley","Mark Horowitz","Pat Hanrahan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 35","Issue 4","July 2016","Article No.: 85","pp   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897824.2925892"],"date":"11 July 2016","ref":[{"text":"Adams, A., Talvala, E.-V., Park, S.

Prior efforts on approximate hardware design have largely focused on circuit-level techniques. We propose a new approach, clock overgating, for the design of approximate circuits at the Register Transfer Level (RTL). The key idea is to gate the clock signal to selected Flip-Flops (FFs) in the circuit, even during execution cycles in which the circuit functionality is sensitive to their state. This saves power in the clock tree, the FF itself and in its downstream logic, while a quality loss ensues if the erroneous FF state propagates to the circuit output. We develop a systematic methodology to identify an energy-efficient overgating configuration for any given circuit and quality constraint. Towards this end, we develop 3 key strategies --- significance-based overgating, grouping FFs into overgating islands, and utilizing internal signals of the circuit as triggers for overgating --- that efficiently prune the large space of possible overgating configurations. We evaluate clock overgating by designing approximate versions of 6 machine learning accelerators, and demonstrate energy benefits of 1.36\u00d7 on average (and upto 1.80\u00d7) for negligible (<0.5%) loss in application quality (classification accuracy).","author":["Younghoon Kim","Swagath Venkataramani","Kaushik Roy","Anand Raghunathan"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 15","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898005"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"M.

Utilizing the distinct features of FEFETs, we propose a 2-transistor (2T) FEFET-based nonvolatile memory with separate read and write paths. With proper co-design at the device, cell and array levels, the proposed design achieves non-destructive read and lower write power at iso-write speed compared to standard FERAM. In addition, the FEFET-based memory exhibits high distinguishability with six orders of magnitude difference in the read currents corresponding to the two states. Comparative analysis based on experimentally calibrated models shows significant improvement of access energy-delay. For example, at a fixed write time of 550ps, the write voltage and energy are 58.5% and 67.7% lower than FERAM, respectively. These benefits are achieved with 2.4 times the area overhead. Further exploration of the proposed FEFET memory in energy harvesting nonvolatile processors shows an average improvement of 27% in forward progress over FERAM.","author":["Sumitha George","Kaisheng Ma","Ahmedullah Aziz","Xueqing Li","Asif Khan","Sayeef Salahuddin","Meng-Fan Chang","Suman Datta","John Sampson","Sumeet Gupta","Vijaykrishnan Narayanan"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 118","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898050"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"Y.

To improve the performance and energy-efficiency of the computation-demanding CNN, the FPGA-based acceleration emerges as one of the most attractive alternatives. In this paper we design and implement Caffeine, a hardware/software co-designed library to efficiently accelerate the entire CNN on FPGAs. First, we propose a uniformed convolutional matrix-multiplication representation for both computation-intensive convolutional layers and communication-intensive fully connected (FCN) layers. Second, we design Caffeine with the goal to maximize the underlying FPGA computing and bandwidth resource utilization, with a key focus on the bandwidth optimization by the memory access reorganization not studied in prior work. Moreover, we implement Caffeine in the portable high-level synthesis and provide various hardware/software definable parameters for user configurations. Finally, we also integrate Caffeine into the industry-standard software deep learning framework Caffe. We evaluate Caffeine and its integration with Caffe by implementing VGG16 and AlexNet network on multiple FPGA platforms. Caffeine achieves a peak performance of 365 GOPS on Xilinx KU060 FPGA and 636 GOPS on Virtex7 690t FPGA. This is the best published result to our best knowledge. We achieve more than 100x speedup on FCN layers over previous FPGA accelerators. An end-to-end evaluation with Caffe integration shows up to 7.3x and 43.5x performance and energy gains over Caffe on a 12-core Xeon server, and 1.5x better energy-efficiency over the GPU implementation on a medium-sized FPGA (KU060). Performance projections to a system with a high-end FPGA (Virtex7 690t) shows even higher gains.","author":["Chen Zhang","Zhenman Fang","Peipei Zhou","Peichen Pan","Jason Cong"],"issue":["ICCAD '16: Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2016","Article No.: 12","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967011"],"date":"07 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"Y.

In this paper, we aim at enhancing the performance of the state-of-the-art convolution algorithm (called Winograd convolution) on the GPU. Our work is based on two observations: (1) CNNs often have abundant zero weights and (2) the performance benefit of Winograd convolution is limited mainly due to extra additions incurred during data transformation. In order to exploit abundant zero weights, we propose a low-overhead and efficient hardware mechanism that skips multiplications that will always give zero results regardless of input data (called ZeroSkip). In addition, to leverage the second observation, we present data reuse optimization for addition operations in Winograd convolution (called AddOpt), which improves the utilization of local registers, thereby reducing on-chip cache accesses. Our experiments with a real-world deep CNN, VGG-16, on GPGPU-Sim and Titan X show that the proposed methods, ZeroSkip and AddOpt, achieve 51.8% higher convolution performance than the baseline Winograd convolution. Moreover, even without any hardware modification, AddOpt alone gives 35.6% higher performance on a real hardware platform, Titan X.","author":["Hyunsun Park","Dongyoung Kim","Junwhan Ahn","Sungjoo Yoo"],"issue":["CODES '16: Proceedings of the Eleventh IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis","October 2016","Article No.: 33","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2968456.2968476"],"date":"01 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"A.

Recent schemes enable a verifier with limited resources to delegate large computations and verify their outcome based on succinct arguments: verification complexity is linear in the size of the inputs and outputs (not the size of the computation). However, cloud computing also often involves large amounts of data, which may exceed the local storage and I/O capabilities of the verifier, and thus limit the use of VC. In this paper, we investigate multi-relation hash & prove schemes for verifiable computations that operate on succinct data hashes. Hence, the verifier delegates both storage and computation to an untrusted worker. She uploads data and keeps hashes; exchanges hashes with other parties; verifies arguments that consume and produce hashes; and selectively downloads the actual data she needs to access. Existing instantiations that fit our definition either target restricted classes of computations or employ relatively inefficient techniques. Instead, we propose efficient constructions that lift classes of existing arguments schemes for fixed relations to multi-relation hash & prove schemes. Our schemes (1) rely on hash algorithms that run linearly in the size of the input; (2) enable constant-time verification of arguments on hashed inputs; (3) incur minimal overhead for the prover. Their main benefit is to amortize the linear cost for the verifier across all relations with shared I/O. Concretely, compared to solutions that can be obtained from prior work, our new hash & prove constructions yield a 1,400x speed-up for provers. We also explain how to further reduce the linear verification costs by partially outsourcing the hash computation itself, obtaining a 480x speed-up when applied to existing VC schemes, even on single-relation executions.","author":["Dario Fiore","C\u00e9dric Fournet","Esha Ghosh","Markulf Kohlweiss","Olga Ohrimenko","Bryan Parno"],"issue":["CCS '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2016","Pages   1304\u20131316","https://doi.org/10.1145/2976749.2978368"],"date":"24 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"Ajtai, M.: Generating hard instances of lattice problems (extended abstract).

Domain-wall memory (DWM), also known as racetrack memory, is a promising emerging technology due to its non-volatility and very high density. However, use of DWM presents challenges due to characteristics of both DWM itself (e.g., requirement of shift operations, variable latency) and processor components. Recently, several techniques have been proposed to address these challenges. This article presents a survey of architectural techniques for using DWM for designing components in both CPU and GPU. We discuss techniques related to performance, energy, and reliability and also discuss works that compare DWM with other memory technologies. We also highlight the opportunities and obstacles in using DWM for designing processor components. This survey is expected to spark further research in this area and be useful for researchers, chip designers, and computer architects.","author":["Sparsh Mittal"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 13","Issue 2","March 2017","Article No.: 29","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2994550"],"date":"03 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, the classical Kamada-Kawai algorithm does not scale well when it is used in networks with large numbers of nodes. It also produces poor results in non-convex networks. To address these problems, this article proposes an improved version of the Kamada-Kawai algorithm. The proposed extension includes novel heuristics and algorithms that achieve a faster energy level reduction. Our experimental results show that the improved algorithm can significantly shorten the processing time and detect boundary nodes with an acceptable level of accuracy.","author":["Se-Hang Cheong","Yain-Whar Si"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks","Volume 13","Issue 1","February 2017","Article No.: 3","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/3005718"],"date":"19 December 2016","ref":[{"text":"C.

This is largely due to the energy burden of analog readout circuitry, data traffic, and intensive computation. To promote efficiency, we shift early vision processing into the analog domain. This results in RedEye, an analog convolutional image sensor that performs layers of a convolutional neural network in the analog domain before quantization. We design RedEye to mitigate analog design complexity, using a modular column-parallel design to promote physical design reuse and algorithmic cyclic reuse. RedEye uses programmable mechanisms to admit noise for tunable energy reduction. Compared to conventional systems, RedEye reports an 85% reduction in sensor energy, 73% reduction in cloudlet-based system energy, and a 45% reduction in computation-based system energy.","author":["Robert LiKamWa","Yunhui Hou","Julian Gao","Mia Polansky","Lin Zhong"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 44","Issue 3","June 2016","pp   255\u2013266","https://doi.org/10.1145/3007787.3001164"],"date":"18 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"P.

Different from existing approaches that rely heavily on feature engineering, we propose to use network embedding approach to address the problem, which can automatically represent nodes into lower dimensional feature vectors. However, there are two major limitations in recent studies on network embedding: (1) they are usually general-purpose embedding methods, which are independent of the specific tasks; and (2) most of these approaches can only deal with homogeneous networks, where the heterogeneity of the network is ignored. Hence, challenges faced here are two folds: (1) how to embed the network under the guidance of the author identification task, and (2) how to select the best type of information due to the heterogeneity of the network. To address the challenges, we propose a task-guided and path-augmented heterogeneous network embedding model. In our model, nodes are first embedded as vectors in latent feature space. Embeddings are then shared and jointly trained according to task-specific and network-general objectives. We extend the existing unsupervised network embedding to incorporate meta paths in heterogeneous networks, and select paths according to the specific task. The guidance from author identification task for network embedding is provided both explicitly in joint training and implicitly during meta path selection. Our experiments demonstrate that by using path-augmented network embedding with task guidance, our model can obtain significantly better accuracy at identifying the true authors comparing to existing methods.","author":["Ting Chen","Yizhou Sun"],"issue":["WSDM '17: Proceedings of the Tenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2017","Pages   295\u2013304","https://doi.org/10.1145/3018661.3018735"],"date":"02 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"R.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that BRAMs generated by COFFE can be used to carry out system-level architecture explorations using an area-oriented RAM-mapping flow and the Verilog-To-Routing flow.","author":["Sadegh Yazdanshenas","Kosuke Tatsumura","Vaughn Betz"],"issue":["FPGA '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2017","Pages   115\u2013124","https://doi.org/10.1145/3020078.3021731"],"date":"22 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"Predictive technology model. http://ptm.asu.edu/.","order":1},{"text":"C.

In order to achieve higher prediction accuracy, machine learning scientists have built increasingly larger models. Such large model is both computation intensive and memory intensive. Deploying such bulky model results in high power consumption and leads to a high total cost of ownership (TCO) of a data center. To speedup the prediction and make it energy efficient, we first propose a load-balance-aware pruning method that can compress the LSTM model size by 20x (10x from pruning and 2x from quantization) with negligible loss of the prediction accuracy. The pruned model is friendly for parallel processing. Next, we propose a scheduler that encodes and partitions the compressed model to multiple PEs for parallelism and schedule the complicated LSTM data flow. Finally, we design the hardware architecture, named Efficient Speech Recognition Engine (ESE) that works directly on the sparse LSTM model. Implemented on Xilinx KU060 FPGA running at 200MHz, ESE has a performance of 282 GOPS working directly on the sparse LSTM network, corresponding to 2.52 TOPS on the dense one, and processes a full LSTM for speech recognition with a power dissipation of 41 Watts. Evaluated on the LSTM for speech recognition benchmark, ESE is 43x and 3x faster than Core i7 5930k CPU and Pascal Titan X GPU implementations. It achieves 40x and 11.5x higher energy efficiency compared with the CPU and GPU respectively.","author":["Song Han","Junlong Kang","Huizi Mao","Yiming Hu","Xin Li","Yubin Li","Dongliang Xie","Hong Luo","Song Yao","Yu Wang","Huazhong Yang","William (Bill) J.

Besides the traditional space-pruning techniques such as indexing, type-based optimizations that exploit integrity constraints defined on the types can be used to rewrite queries into more efficient ones. However, such optimizations are only applicable in strongly-typed data and query models which make it a challenge for semi-structured models such as RDF. Consequently, developing techniques for enabling typebased query optimizations will contribute new insight to improving the scalability of RDF processing systems. In this paper, we address the challenge of type-based query optimization for RDF graph pattern queries. The approach comprises of (i) a novel type system for RDF data induced from data and ontologies and (ii) a query optimization and evaluation framework for evaluating graph pattern queries using type-based optimizations. An implementation of this approach integrated into Apache Pig is presented and evaluated. Comprehensive experiments conducted on real-world and synthetic benchmark datasets show that our approach is up to 500X faster than existing approaches","author":["HyeongSik Kim","Padmashree Ravindra","Kemafor Anyanwu"],"issue":["WWW '17: Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web","April 2017","Pages   785\u2013793","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052655"],"date":"03 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"Project Webpage for R-Type: A Typing Model for RDF.small http://research.csc.ncsu.edu/coul/RAPID/SemStorm.","order":1},{"text":"RDF Schema 1.1. https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema.","order":2},{"text":"RDFHive: A Distributed RDF Store Based on top of Apache Hive.small http://tyrex.inria.fr/rdfhive/home.html.","order":3},{"text":"RDFS Entailment Pattern. http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt.","order":4},{"text":"D.

These objects are expected to generate large amounts of data and send the data to the cloud for further processing, especially for knowledge discovery, in order that appropriate actions can be taken. However, in reality sensing all possible data items captured by a smart object and then sending the complete captured data to the cloud is less useful. Further, such an approach would also lead to resource wastage (e.g., network, storage, etc.). The Fog (Edge) computing paradigm has been proposed to counterpart the weakness by pushing processes of knowledge discovery using data analytics to the edges. However, edge devices have limited computational capabilities. Due to inherited strengths and weaknesses, neither Cloud computing nor Fog computing paradigm addresses these challenges alone. Therefore, both paradigms need to work together in order to build a sustainable IoT infrastructure for smart cities. In this article, we review existing approaches that have been proposed to tackle the challenges in the Fog computing domain. Specifically, we describe several inspiring use case scenarios of Fog computing, identify ten key characteristics and common features of Fog computing, and compare more than 30 existing research efforts in this domain. Based on our review, we further identify several major functionalities that ideal Fog computing platforms should support and a number of open challenges toward implementing them, to shed light on future research directions on realizing Fog computing for building sustainable smart cities.","author":["Charith Perera","Yongrui Qin","Julio C.

However, many times the underlying microarchitecture behaves differently when processing varying data inputs, which covertly leaks confidential information through the timing channel. In this paper, we exploit a novel fine-grained microarchitectural timing channel, stalls that occur due to bank conflicts in a GPU's shared memory. Using this attack surface, we develop a differential timing attack that can compromise table-based cryptographic algorithms. We implement our timing attack on an Nvidia Kepler K40 GPU, and successfully recover the complete 128-bit AES encryption key using 10 million samples. We also evaluate the scalability of our attack method by attacking a 8192-thread implementation of the AES encryption algorithm, recovering some key bytes using 1 million samples.","author":["Zhen Hang Jiang","Yunsi Fei","David Kaeli"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '17: Proceedings of the on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI 2017","May 2017","Pages   167\u2013172","https://doi.org/10.1145/3060403.3060462"],"date":"10 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"L.

While RRAM outperforms SRAM by offering high scalability, low leakage power, and near-zero power-on delay, RRAM-FPGAs have limited programming cycles, and different writes frequencies of memory and logic blocks make the challenge more severe. To overcome this endurance challenge, we propose an age-aware placement framework for RRAM-FPGAs with uniform reconfigurable logic/memory units. The framework, consisting of a dynamic reconfiguration region allocation algorithm and a logic/memory co-placement algorithm, balances write distributions across the entire FPGA according to logic and memory write frequency differences. The proposed algorithms have been integrated into the VTR synthesis flow. Experiments show that the framework achieves 94.9% write reduction, thus effectively extending RRAM-FPGA programming cycles.","author":["Yuan Xue","Chengmo Yang","Jingtong Hu"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 1","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062198"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"UltraScale Architecture and Product Overview, Xilinx, 2016.","order":1},{"text":"I.

However, the poor performance portability prevents its wide adoption. To harness the power of FPGAs using OpenCL programming model, it is advantageous to design an analytical performance model to estimate the performance of OpenCL workloads on FPGAs and provide insights into the performance bottlenecks of OpenCL model on FPGA architecture. To this end, this paper presents FlexCL, an analytical performance model for OpenCL workloads on flexible FPGAs. FlexCL estimates the overall performance by tightly coupling the off-chip global memory and on-chip computation models based on the communication mode. Experiments demonstrate that with respect to RTL-based implementation, the average of absolute error of FlexCL is 9.5% and 8.7% for the Rodinia and PolyBench suite, respectively. Moreover, FlexCL enables rapid exploration of the design space within seconds instead of hours or days.","author":["Shuo Wang","Yun Liang","Wei Zhang"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 27","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062251"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"H.

It is known that NOMA provides performance gains over conventional orthogonal-multiple-access, but it comes at the cost of increased decoder complexity. Moreover, the decoder complexity varies with fraction of duration in which the users' transmissions overlap using NOMA. For this scheme, we present a hardware-friendly implementation of an LDPC-code-based multi-user-detector (MUD). We also present a MATLAB-based high-level design-automation tool that generates hardware descriptions of different NOMA-receivers.

Weight pruning reduces DNN model size and the computation by removing redundant weights. However, we implemented weight pruning for several popular networks on a variety of hardware platforms and observed surprising results. For many networks, the network sparsity caused by weight pruning will actually hurt the overall performance despite large reductions in the model size and required multiply-accumulate operations. Also, encoding the sparse format of pruned networks incurs additional storage space overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose Scalpel that customizes DNN pruning to the underlying hardware by matching the pruned network structure to the data-parallel hardware organization. Scalpel consists of two techniques: SIMD-aware weight pruning and node pruning. For low-parallelism hardware (e.g., microcontroller), SIMD-aware weight pruning maintains weights in aligned fixed-size groups to fully utilize the SIMD units. For high-parallelism hardware (e.g., GPU), node pruning removes redundant nodes, not redundant weights, thereby reducing computation without sacrificing the dense matrix format. For hardware with moderate parallelism (e.g., desktop CPU), SIMD-aware weight pruning and node pruning are synergistically applied together. Across the microcontroller, CPU and GPU, Scalpel achieves mean speedups of 3.54x, 2.61x, and 1.25x while reducing the model sizes by 88%, 82%, and 53%. In comparison, traditional weight pruning achieves mean speedups of 1.90x, 1.06x, 0.41x across the three platforms.","author":["Jiecao Yu","Andrew Lukefahr","David Palframan","Ganesh Dasika","Reetuparna Das","Scott Mahlke"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   548\u2013560","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080215"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"2016.

More and more such bandwidth hungry applications and services are proposed like immersive media services such as virtual reality and, specifically omnidirectional/360-degree videos. The adaptive streaming of omnidirectional video over HTTP imposes an important challenge on today's video delivery infrastructures which calls for dedicated, thoroughly designed techniques for content generation, delivery, and consumption.; [email\u00a0protected] paper describes the usage of tiles --- as specified within modern video codecs such HEVC/H.265 and VP9 --- enabling bandwidth efficient adaptive streaming of omnidirectional video over HTTP and we define various streaming strategies. Therefore, the parameters and characteristics of a dataset for omnidirectional video are proposed and exemplary instantiated to evaluate various aspects of such an ecosystem, namely bitrate overhead, bandwidth requirements, and quality aspects in terms of viewport PSNR. The results indicate bitrate savings from 40% (in a realistic scenario with recorded head movements from real users) up to 65% (in an ideal scenario with a centered/fixed viewport) and serve as a baseline and guidelines for advanced techniques including the outline of a research roadmap for the near future.","author":["Mario Graf","Christian Timmerer","Christopher Mueller"],"issue":["MMSys'17: Proceedings of the 8th ACM on Multimedia Systems Conference","June 2017","Pages   261\u2013271","https://doi.org/10.1145/3083187.3084016"],"date":"20 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Gisle Bj\u00f8ntegaard. 2001.

Despite the abundance of recently proposed schemes, state-of-the-art ABR algorithms suffer from a key limitation: they use fixed control rules based on simplified or inaccurate models of the deployment environment. As a result, existing schemes inevitably fail to achieve optimal performance across a broad set of network conditions and QoE objectives. We propose Pensieve, a system that generates ABR algorithms using reinforcement learning (RL). Pensieve trains a neural network model that selects bitrates for future video chunks based on observations collected by client video players. Pensieve does not rely on pre-programmed models or assumptions about the environment. Instead, it learns to make ABR decisions solely through observations of the resulting performance of past decisions. As a result, Pensieve automatically learns ABR algorithms that adapt to a wide range of environments and QoE metrics. We compare Pensieve to state-of-the-art ABR algorithms using trace-driven and real world experiments spanning a wide variety of network conditions, QoE metrics, and video properties. In all considered scenarios, Pensieve outperforms the best state-of-the-art scheme, with improvements in average QoE of 12%--25%. Pensieve also generalizes well, outperforming existing schemes even on networks for which it was not explicitly trained.","author":["Hongzi Mao","Ravi Netravali","Mohammad Alizadeh"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '17: Proceedings of the Conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication","August 2017","Pages   197\u2013210","https://doi.org/10.1145/3098822.3098843"],"date":"07 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"M.

These failures are called data-dependent failures. Detecting and mitigating these failures online, while the system is running in the field, enables various optimizations that improve reliability, latency, and energy efficiency of the system. For example, a system can improve performance and energy efficiency by using a lower refresh rate for most cells and mitigate the failing cells using higher refresh rates or error correcting codes. All these system optimizations depend on accurately detecting every possible data-dependent failure that could occur with any content in DRAM. Unfortunately, detecting all data-dependent failures requires the knowledge of DRAM internals specific to each DRAM chip. As internal DRAM architecture is not exposed to the system, detecting data-dependent failures at the system-level is a major challenge. In this paper, we decouple the detection and mitigation of data-dependent failures from physical DRAM organization such that it is possible to detect failures without knowledge of DRAM internals. To this end, we propose MEMCON, a memory content-based detection and mitigation mechanism for data-dependent failures in DRAM. MEMCON does not detect every possible data-dependent failure. Instead, it detects and mitigates failures that occur only with the current content in memory while the programs are running in the system. Such a mechanism needs to detect failures whenever there is a write access that changes the content of memory. As detection of failure with a runtime testing has a high overhead, MEMCON selectively initiates a test on a write, only when the time between two consecutive writes to that page (i.e., write interval) is long enough to provide significant benefit by lowering the refresh rate during that interval. MEMCON builds upon a simple, practical mechanism that predicts the long write intervals based on our observation that the write intervals in real workloads follow a Pareto distribution: the longer a page remains idle after a write, the longer it is expected to remain idle. Our evaluation shows that compared to a system that uses an aggressive refresh rate, MEMCON reduces refresh operations by 65--74%, leading to a 10%/17%/40% (min) to 12%/22%/50% (max) performance improvement for a single-core and 10%/23%/52% (min) to 17%/29%/65% (max) performance improvement for a 4-core system using 8/16/32 Gb DRAM chips.","author":["Samira Khan","Chris Wilkerson","Zhe Wang","Alaa R.

However, recent research on DNNs has indicated ever-increasing concern on the robustness to adversarial examples, especially for security-critical tasks such as traffic sign identification for autonomous driving. Studies have unveiled the vulnerability of a well-trained DNN by demonstrating the ability of generating barely noticeable (to both human and machines) adversarial images that lead to misclassification. Furthermore, researchers have shown that these adversarial images are highly transferable by simply training and attacking a substitute model built upon the target model, known as a black-box attack to DNNs. Similar to the setting of training substitute models, in this paper we propose an effective black-box attack that also only has access to the input (images) and the output (confidence scores) of a targeted DNN. However, different from leveraging attack transferability from substitute models, we propose zeroth order optimization (ZOO) based attacks to directly estimate the gradients of the targeted DNN for generating adversarial examples. We use zeroth order stochastic coordinate descent along with dimension reduction, hierarchical attack and importance sampling techniques to efficiently attack black-box models. By exploiting zeroth order optimization, improved attacks to the targeted DNN can be accomplished, sparing the need for training substitute models and avoiding the loss in attack transferability. Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR10 and ImageNet show that the proposed ZOO attack is as effective as the state-of-the-art white-box attack (e.g., Carlini and Wagner's attack) and significantly outperforms existing black-box attacks via substitute models.","author":["Pin-Yu Chen","Huan Zhang","Yash Sharma","Jinfeng Yi","Cho-Jui Hsieh"],"issue":["AISec '17: Proceedings of the 10th ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security","November 2017","Pages   15\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/3128572.3140448"],"date":"03 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"Marco Barreno, Blaine Nelson, Anthony D.

In this respect, high-performance three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous manycore systems present a promising direction. However, deep learning on these systems pose several design challenges. First, the network-on-chip (NoC) must handle the traffic requirements of both CPU and GPU communications. Second, 3D system designs must address thermal issues resulting from high-power density. In this work, we propose a design methodology for a heterogeneous 3D NoC architecture that not only satisfies the traffic requirements of both CPUs and GPUs, but also reduces thermal hotspots. To this end, we target the training of two widely employed convolutional neural networks (CNN), namely, LeNet and CIFAR. By using our joint performance-thermal optimization methodology to create a 3D NoC for training CNNs, we reduce the maximum temperature by 22% while incurring only 5% full-system energy-delay-product degradation over a solely performance optimized 3D NoC. This demonstrates that, our design methodology achieves considerable temperature reduction with negligible loss in performance.","author":["Biresh Kumar Joardar","Wonje Choi","Ryan Gary Kim","Janardhan Rao Doppa","Partha Pratim Pande","Diana Marculescu","Radu Marculescu"],"issue":["NOCS '17: Proceedings of the Eleventh IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip","October 2017","Article No.: 18","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3130218.3130219"],"date":"19 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Y.

However, multipath interference (MPI) resulting from indirect illumination significantly degrades the captured depth. Most previous works have tried to solve this problem by means of complex hardware modifications or costly computations. In this work, we avoid these approaches and propose a new technique to correct errors in depth caused by MPI, which requires no camera modifications and takes just 10 milliseconds per frame. Our observations about the nature of MPI suggest that most of its information is available in image space; this allows us to formulate the depth imaging process as a spatially-varying convolution and use a convolutional neural network to correct MPI errors. Since the input and output data present similar structure, we base our network on an autoencoder, which we train in two stages. First, we use the encoder (convolution filters) to learn a suitable basis to represent MPI-corrupted depth images; then, we train the decoder (deconvolution filters) to correct depth from synthetic scenes, generated by using a physically-based, time-resolved renderer. This approach allows us to tackle a key problem in ToF, the lack of ground-truth data, by using a large-scale captured training set with MPI-corrupted depth to train the encoder, and a smaller synthetic training set with ground truth depth to train the decoder stage of the network. We demonstrate and validate our method on both synthetic and real complex scenarios, using an off-the-shelf ToF camera, and with only the captured, incorrect depth as input.","author":["Julio Marco","Quercus Hernandez","Adolfo Mu\u00f1oz","Yue Dong","Adrian Jarabo","Min H.

Accordingly, microcontroller-based operating systems have not provided important features like fault isolation, dynamic memory allocation, and flexible concurrency. However, an emerging class of embedded applications are software platforms, rather than single purpose devices, and need these multiprogramming features. Tock, a new operating system for low-power platforms, takes advantage of limited hardware-protection mechanisms as well as the type-safety features of the Rust programming language to provide a multiprogramming environment for microcontrollers. Tock isolates software faults, provides memory protection, and efficiently manages memory for dynamic application workloads written in any language. It achieves this while retaining the dependability requirements of long-running applications.","author":["Amit Levy","Bradford Campbell","Branden Ghena","Daniel B.

Despite contributing to the rapid development of IoT applications, the current IoT cloud-centric architecture has led into a myriad of isolated data silos that hinders the full potential of holistic data-driven analytics within the IoT. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based design for the IoT that brings a distributed access control and data management. We depart from the current trust model that delegates access control of our data to a centralized trusted authority and instead empower the users with data ownership. Our design is tailored for IoT data streams and enables secure data sharing. We enable a secure and resilient access control management, by utilizing the blockchain as an auditable and distributed access control layer to the storage layer. We facilitate the storage of time-series IoT data at the edge of the network via a locality-aware decentralized storage system that is managed with the blockchain technology. Our system is agnostic of the physical storage nodes and supports as well utilization of cloud storage resources as storage nodes.","author":["Hossein Shafagh","Lukas Burkhalter","Anwar Hithnawi","Simon Duquennoy"],"issue":["CCSW '17: Proceedings of the 2017 on Cloud Computing Security Workshop","November 2017","Pages   45\u201350","https://doi.org/10.1145/3140649.3140656"],"date":"03 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"Ethereum White-Paper.

In this work, we show that all of the aforementioned models with negative sampling can be unified into the matrix factorization framework with closed forms. Our analysis and proofs reveal that: (1) DeepWalk empirically produces a low-rank transformation of a network's normalized Laplacian matrix; (2) LINE, in theory, is a special case of DeepWalk when the size of vertices' context is set to one; (3) As an extension of LINE, PTE can be viewed as the joint factorization of multiple networks\u00bb Laplacians; (4) node2vec is factorizing a matrix related to the stationary distribution and transition probability tensor of a 2nd-order random walk. We further provide the theoretical connections between skip-gram based network embedding algorithms and the theory of graph Laplacian. Finally, we present the NetMF method as well as its approximation algorithm for computing network embedding. Our method offers significant improvements over DeepWalk and LINE for conventional network mining tasks. This work lays the theoretical foundation for skip-gram based network embedding methods, leading to a better understanding of latent network representation learning.","author":["Jiezhong Qiu","Yuxiao Dong","Hao Ma","Jian Li","Kuansan Wang","Jie Tang"],"issue":["WSDM '18: Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2018","Pages   459\u2013467","https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159706"],"date":"02 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Sanjeev Arora, Yuanzhi Li, Yingyu Liang, Tengyu Ma, and Andrej Risteski. 2016.

However, due to the irregular data access patterns in graph computations, one major challenge for graph processing systems is performance. The algorithms, softwares, and hardwares that have been tailored for mainstream parallel applications are generally not effective for massive, sparse graphs from the real-world problems, due to their complex and irregular structures. To address the performance issues in large-scale graph analytics, we leverage the exceptional random access performance of the emerging Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) combined with the flexibility and efficiency of modern FPGAs. In particular, we develop a collaborative software/hardware technique to perform a level-synchronized Breadth First Search (BFS) on a FPGA-HMC platform. From the software perspective, we develop an architecture-aware graph clustering algorithm that exploits the FPGA-HMC platform\u00bbs capability to improve data locality and memory access efficiency. From the hardware perspective, we further improve the FPGA-HMC graph processor architecture by designing a memory request merging unit to take advantage of the increased data locality resulting from graph clustering. We evaluate the performance of our BFS implementation using the AC-510 development kit from Micron and achieve $2.8 \\times$ average performance improvement compared to the latest FPGA-HMC based graph processing system over a set of benchmarks from a wide range of applications.","author":["Soroosh Khoram","Jialiang Zhang","Maxwell Strange","Jing Li"],"issue":["FPGA '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2018","Pages   239\u2013248","https://doi.org/10.1145/3174243.3174260"],"date":"15 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Gary D.

We describe Cypher 9, which is the first version of the language governed by the openCypher Implementers Group. We first introduce the language by example, and describe its uses in industry. We then provide a formal semantic definition of the core read-query features of Cypher, including its variant of the property graph data model, and its ASCII Art graph pattern matching mechanism for expressing subgraphs of interest to an application. We compare the features of Cypher to other property graph query languages, and describe extensions, at an advanced stage of development, which will form part of Cypher 10, turning the language into a compositional language which supports graph projections and multiple named graphs.","author":["Nadime Francis","Alastair Green","Paolo Guagliardo","Leonid Libkin","Tobias Lindaaker","Victor Marsault","Stefan Plantikow","Mats Rydberg","Petra Selmer","Andr\u00e9s Taylor"],"issue":["SIGMOD '18: Proceedings of the 2018 International Conference on Management of Data","May 2018","Pages   1433\u20131445","https://doi.org/10.1145/3183713.3190657"],"date":"27 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"H.

A deep learning training job is resource-intensive and time-consuming. Efficient resource scheduling is the key to the maximal performance of a deep learning cluster. Existing cluster schedulers are largely not tailored to deep learning jobs, and typically specifying a fixed amount of resources for each job, prohibiting high resource efficiency and job performance. This paper proposes Optimus, a customized job scheduler for deep learning clusters, which minimizes job training time based on online resource-performance models. Optimus uses online fitting to predict model convergence during training, and sets up performance models to accurately estimate training speed as a function of allocated resources in each job. Based on the models, a simple yet effective method is designed and used for dynamically allocating resources and placing deep learning tasks to minimize job completion time. We implement Optimus on top of Kubernetes, a cluster manager for container orchestration, and experiment on a deep learning cluster with 7 CPU servers and 6 GPU servers, running 9 training jobs using the MXNet framework. Results show that Optimus outperforms representative cluster schedulers by about 139% and 63% in terms of job completion time and makespan, respectively.","author":["Yanghua Peng","Yixin Bao","Yangrui Chen","Chuan Wu","Chuanxiong Guo"],"issue":["EuroSys '18: Proceedings of the Thirteenth EuroSys Conference","April 2018","Article No.: 3","Pages   1\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/3190508.3190517"],"date":"23 April 2018","ref":[{"text":"2006.

Based on FA cells implemented at the transistor level (TSMC65nm), we developed several approximate building blocks of 8x8 multipliers, as well as various implementations of higher order multipliers. These designs are evaluated based on their power, area, delay and error and the best designs are identified. We validate these designs on an image blending application using MATLAB, and compare them to related work.","author":["Mahmoud Masadeh","Osman Hasan","Sofiene Tahar"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '18: Proceedings of the 2018 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2018","Pages   415\u2013418","https://doi.org/10.1145/3194554.3194626"],"date":"30 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"J.

This has led the CAD and architecture communities to devote considerable attention to building DNN hardware. Despite these efforts, the fault tolerance of DNNs has generally been overlooked. This paper is the first to conduct a large-scale, empirical study of DNN resilience. Motivated by the inherent algorithmic resilience of DNNs, we are interested in understanding the relationship between fault rate and model accuracy. To do so, we present Ares: a light-weight, DNN-specific fault injection framework validated within 12% of real hardware. We find that DNN fault tolerance varies by orders of magnitude with respect to model, layer type, and structure.","author":["Brandon Reagen","Udit Gupta","Lillian Pentecost","Paul Whatmough","Sae Kyu Lee","Niamh Mulholland","David Brooks","Gu-Yeon Wei"],"issue":["DAC '18: Proceedings of the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2018","Article No.: 17","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3195997"],"date":"24 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"\"Solid state drive (ssd) requirements and endurance test method.\" https://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/focus/flash/solid-state-drives, 2017.","order":1},{"text":"B.

Usually modular inversion operation is a choke point in realizing the public-key cryptosystem. Based on the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, this work proposes an efficient FPGA implementation of ECC modular inversion over F256. According to this proposed algorithm, one modular inversion requires 320 clock cycles with a maximum clock frequency of 144.011MHz on a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA device which gives a computation time of 2.22\u03bcs. On the other words, our scenario can perform 450 thousand times division operations in one second approximately. Compared to other available literature, our scheme presented in this paper provides a high performance FPGA implementation of 256-bit modular inversion over F256. This makes the elliptic curve cryptography have important practical value in hardware implementation.","author":["Xiuze Dong","Li Zhang","Xianwei Gao"],"issue":["ICCSP 2018: Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Cryptography, Security and Privacy","March 2018","Pages   29\u201333","https://doi.org/10.1145/3199478.3199491"],"date":"16 March 2018","ref":[{"text":"N.

The main idea is to allow nonserializable schedules which preserve consistency and which are acceptable to the system users. To produce such schedules, the transaction processing mechanism receives semantic information from the users in the form of transaction semantic types, a division of transactions into steps, compatibility sets, and countersteps. Using these notions, we propose a mechanism which allows users to exploit their semantic knowledge in an organized fashion.

Utilizing emerging non-volatile memory (NVM)'s unique characteristics, including the crossbar array structure and gray-scale cell resistances, to perform neural network (NN) computation is a well-studied approach in accelerating deep learning tasks. Compared to other NVM technologies, STT-MRAM has its unique advantages in performing NN computation. However, the state-of-the-art research have not utilized STT-MRAM for deep learning acceleration due to its device- and architecture-level challenges. Consequently, this paper enables STT-MRAM, for the firs time, as an effective and practical deep learning accelerator. In particular, it proposes a full-stack solution across multiple design layers, including device-level fabrication, circuit-level enhancement, architecture-level data quantization, and system-level accelerator design. The proposed framework significantly mitigates the model accuracy loss due to reduced data precision in a cohesive manner, constructing a comprehensive STT-MRAM accelerator system for fast NN computation with high energy efficiency and low cost.","author":["Hao Yan","Hebin R.

RNN-based networks encode historical interaction records into a hidden state vector. Although the state vector is able to encode sequential dependency, it still has limited representation power in capturing complicated user preference. It is difficult to capture fine-grained user preference from the interaction sequence. Furthermore, the latent vector representation is usually hard to understand and explain. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel knowledge enhanced sequential recommender. Our model integrates the RNN-based networks with Key-Value Memory Network (KV-MN). We further incorporate knowledge base (KB) information to enhance the semantic representation of KV-MN. RNN-based models are good at capturing sequential user preference, while knowledge-enhanced KV-MNs are good at capturing attribute-level user preference. By using a hybrid of RNNs and KV-MNs, it is expected to be endowed with both benefits from these two components. The sequential preference representation together with the attribute-level preference representation are combined as the final representation of user preference. With the incorporation of KB information, our model is also highly interpretable. To our knowledge, it is the first time that sequential recommender is integrated with external memories by leveraging large-scale KB information.","author":["Jin Huang","Wayne Xin Zhao","Hongjian Dou","Ji-Rong Wen","Edward Y.

In this paper, we demonstrate the ability to use multipath reflections to enhance localization rather than throwing them away. We present Multipath Triangulation, a new localization technique that uses multipath reflections to localize a target device with a single receiver that does not require any form of coordination with any other devices. In this paper, we leverage multipath triangulation to build the first decimeter-level WiFi localization system, called MonoLoco, that requires only a single access point (AP) and a single channel, and does not impose any overhead, data sharing, or coordination protocols beyond standard WiFi communication. As a bonus, it also determines the orientation of the target relative to the AP. We implemented MonoLoco using Intel 5300 commodity WiFi cards and deploy it in four environments with different multipath propagation. Results indicate median localization error of 0.5m and median orientation error of 6.6 degrees, which are comparable to the best performing prior systems, all of which require multiple APs and/or multiple frequency channels. High accuracy can be achieved with only a handful of packets.","author":["Elahe Soltanaghaei","Avinash Kalyanaraman","Kamin Whitehouse"],"issue":["MobiSys '18: Proceedings of the 16th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services","June 2018","Pages   376\u2013388","https://doi.org/10.1145/3210240.3210347"],"date":"10 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"F.

Its security rests critically on the distributed protocol that maintains the blockchain, run by participants called miners. Conventional wisdom asserts that the mining protocol is incentive-compatible and secure against colluding minority groups, that is, it incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed.We show that the Bitcoin mining protocol is not incentive-compatible. We present an attack with which colluding miners' revenue is larger than their fair share. The attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will prefer to join the attackers, and the colluding group will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized currency.Unless certain assumptions are made, selfish mining may be feasible for any coalition size of colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects Bitcoin in the general case. It prohibits selfish mining by a coalition that command less than 1/4 of the resources. This threshold is lower than the wrongly assumed 1/2 bound, but better than the current reality where a coalition of any size can compromise the system.","author":["Ittay Eyal","Emin G\u00fcn Sirer"],"issue":["Communications of the ACM","Volume 61","Issue 7","July 2018","pp   95\u2013102","https://doi.org/10.1145/3212998"],"date":"25 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Andresen, G.

While previous work has focused on one component of sentence significance, namely, the presence of high-frequency content words (key words), the methods described here also treat three additional components: pragmatic words (cue words); title and heading words; and structural indicators (sentence location).The research has resulted in an operating system and a research methodology. The extracting system is parameterized to control and vary the influence of the above four components. The research methodology includes procedures for the compilation of the required dictionaries, the setting of the control parameters, and the comparative evaluation of the automatic extracts with manually produced extracts. The results indicate that the three newly proposed components dominate the frequency component in the production of better extracts.","author":["H. P.

Most of the existing embedding methods embed nodes as point vectors in a low-dimensional continuous space. In this way, the formation of the edge is deterministic and only determined by the positions of the nodes. However, the formation and evolution of real-world networks are full of uncertainties, which makes these methods not optimal. To address the problem, we propose a novel Deep Variational Network Embedding in Wasserstein Space (DVNE) in this paper. The proposed method learns a Gaussian distribution in the Wasserstein space as the latent representation of each node, which can simultaneously preserve the network structure and model the uncertainty of nodes. Specifically, we use 2-Wasserstein distance as the similarity measure between the distributions, which can well preserve the transitivity in the network with a linear computational cost. Moreover, our method implies the mathematical relevance of mean and variance by the deep variational model, which can well capture the position of the node by the mean vectors and the uncertainties of nodes by the variance. Additionally, our method captures both the local and global network structure by preserving the first-order and second-order proximity in the network. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively model the uncertainty of nodes in networks, and show a substantial gain on real-world applications such as link prediction and multi-label classification compared with the state-of-the-art methods.","author":["Dingyuan Zhu","Peng Cui","Daixin Wang","Wenwu Zhu"],"issue":["KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2018","Pages   2827\u20132836","https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3220052"],"date":"19 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Luigi Ambrosio, Nicola Gigli, and Giuseppe Savar\u00e9 . 2008.

However, unlike server-scale devices, edge devices are relatively small and thus have much more limited resources. Therefore, control of resource usage and hardware optimization play an important role when we implement machine learning algorithms on an edge device. In this paper, we target convolutional neural networks (CNN) and explore various optimization and design techniques to realize them on FPGA devices. The key idea explored in this paper is Backward Pipeline Scheduling together with Latency Balancing which optimize the pipeline between CNN layers in order to significantly reduce the overall latency for processing a single image. We also develop a batch processing design to improve the throughput of the FPGA solution. We have achieved latency of 175.7\u03bcs for classifying one image in the MNIST data set using LeNet and 653.4\u03bcs for classifying one image in Cifar-10 data set using CifarNet. Without retraining, we are still able to maintain high accuracy of 97.6% for MNIST data set and 83.6% for the Cifar-10 data set. Our achieved single-image latency is 5.2x faster for LeNet and 1.95x faster for CifarNet compared to the NVIDIA Jetson TX1 solution.","author":["Xinheng Liu","Dae Hee Kim","Chang Wu","Deming Chen"],"issue":["SLIP '18: Proceedings of the 20th System Level Interconnect Prediction Workshop","June 2018","Article No.: 1","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3225209.3225214"],"date":"23 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Xilinx.

Many organizations have been adapting their business to a process-centered view since they started noticing its potential to reduce costs, improve productivity and achieve higher levels of quality. However, implementing BPM in organizations requires time, making the automation of process identification and discovery highly desirable. To achieve this expectation, the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and tools has emerged to generate process models from unstructured text. In this paper, we provide the results of a systematic literature review conducted in preparation and processing of natural language text aiming the extraction of business processes and process quality assurance. The study presents techniques applied to the BPM life-cycle phases of process identification, process discovery and process analysis as well as tools to support process discovery. This review covered papers from 2009 up to 2016 and identifies 518 articles of which 33 were selected as relevant to our work. The results of the present study may be valuable to support research in extraction of business process models from natural language text.","author":["Ana Cl\u00e1udia de Almeida Bordignon","Lucin\u00e9ia Heloisa Thom","Thanner Soares Silva","Vinicius Stein Dani","Marcelo Fantinato","Renato Cesar Borges Ferreira"],"issue":["SBSI'18: Proceedings of the XIV Brazilian Symposium on Information Systems","June 2018","Article No.: 25","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3229345.3229373"],"date":"04 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Shahzad Akbar, Ahsan Ali Chaudhri, and Imran Sarwar Bajwa. 2013.

The proposed approach is to perform the loop unrolling optimization over understudied problems Sparse Dense Matrix Multiplications SpDM, and Dense Matrix Multiplication with cache oblivious algorithm using Peano Curves, and measure the effects on both sequential and parallel execution. The proposed approach enhanced the problem execution up to 86% in SpDM on the same computer architecture, and up to 6% in Peano Curves application.","author":["Karim Soliman","Marwa El Shenawy","Ahmed Abou El Farag"],"issue":["ICFNDS '18: Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Future Networks and Distributed Systems","June 2018","Article No.: 7","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3231053.3231060"],"date":"26 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"A.

This paper presents a simulation-based study of the most common forms of DRAM today: DDR3, DDR4, and LPDDR4 SDRAM; GDDR5 SGRAM; and two recent 3D-stacked architectures: High Bandwidth Memory (HBM1, HBM2), and Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC1, HMC2). Our simulations give both time and power/energy results and reveal several things: (a) current multi-channel DRAM technologies have succeeded in translating bandwidth into better execution time for all applications, turning memory-bound applications into compute-bound; (b) the inherent parallelism in the memory system is the critical enabling factor (high bandwidth alone is insufficient); (c) while all current DRAM architectures have addressed the memory-bandwidth problem, the memory-latency problem does still remain, dominated by queuing delays arising from lack of parallelism; and (d) the majority of power and energy is spent in the I/O interface, driving bits across the bus; DRAM-specific overhead beyond bandwidth has been reduced significantly, which is great news (an ideal memory technology would dissipate power only in bandwidth, all else would be free).","author":["Shang Li","Dhiraj Reddy","Bruce Jacob"],"issue":["MEMSYS '18: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Memory Systems","October 2018","Pages   341\u2013353","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240302.3240315"],"date":"01 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Dennis Abts, Natalie D.

ISL is established in GNSS not only for inter-satellite communication but also for inter-satellite pseudo-range measurement. However, only one link can be established in the every moment for a satellite. Therefore, contact plan, which comprises all forthcoming network communication opportunities among satellites, needs to be carefully designed to accommodate the constraints of both inter-satellite pseudo-range measurement and communication. In this paper, we focus on the contact plan design problems considering the data transmission between satellites and ground stations.

Making and maintaining a near-real time HD map on a global scale is an extremely challenging task. I will present how we apply AI technologies to automate the creation of HD Live Maps using both industrial capture and crowd-sourced based data collection. Quality Index is introduced to provide automated driving customers with the confidence of HD map accuracy and reliability in a dynamic world. We implement low power and high throughput edge perception as a reference implementation to enable crowd-sourced based HD map maintenance.

The goal of this research is to provide a simple, intuitive, and type-safe DSL that is accessible to life science practitioners. The novel feature of the language is its syntax, which aims to optimize human readability; the technical contributions of the paper include the BioScript type system and relevant portions of its compiler. The type system ensures that certain types of errors, specific to biochemistry, do not occur, including the interaction of chemicals that may be unsafe. The compiler includes novel optimizations that place biochemical operations to execute concurrently on a spatial 2D array platform on the granularity of a control flow graph, as opposed to individual basic blocks. Results are obtained using both a cycle-accurate microfluidic simulator and a software interface to a real-world platform.","author":["Jason Ott","Tyson Loveless","Chris Curtis","Mohsen Lesani","Philip Brisk"],"issue":["Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages","Volume 2","Issue OOPSLA","November 2018","Article No.: 128","pp   1\u201331","https://doi.org/10.1145/3276498"],"date":"24 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mirela Alistar and Urs Gaudenz. 2017.

Slim Graph enables the developer to express numerous compression schemes using small and programmable compression kernels that can access and modify local parts of input graphs. Such kernels are executed in parallel by the underlying engine, isolating developers from complexities of parallel programming. Our kernels implement novel graph compression schemes that preserve numerous graph properties, for example connected components, minimum spanning trees, or graph spectra. Finally, Slim Graph uses statistical divergences and other metrics to analyze the accuracy of lossy graph compression. We illustrate both theoretically and empirically that Slim Graph accelerates numerous graph algorithms, reduces storage used by graph datasets, and ensures high accuracy of results. Slim Graph may become the common ground for developing, executing, and analyzing emerging lossy graph compression schemes.","author":["Maciej Besta","Simon Weber","Lukas Gianinazzi","Robert Gerstenberger","Andrey Ivanov","Yishai Oltchik","Torsten Hoefler"],"issue":["SC '19: Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2019","Article No.: 35","Pages   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/3295500.3356182"],"date":"17 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"[n.d.].

Tiled architectures provide an intuitive scaling solution that supports both coarse-grained parallelism in NNs: intra-layer parallelism, where all tiles process a single layer, and inter-layer pipelining, where multiple layers execute across tiles in a pipelined manner. This work proposes dataflow optimizations to address the shortcomings of existing parallel dataflow techniques for tiled NN accelerators. For intra-layer parallelism, we develop buffer sharing dataflow that turns the distributed buffers into an idealized shared buffer, eliminating excessive data duplication and the memory access overheads. For inter-layer pipelining, we develop alternate layer loop ordering that forwards the intermediate data in a more fine-grained and timely manner, reducing the buffer requirements and pipeline delays. We also make inter-layer pipelining applicable to NNs with complex DAG structures. These optimizations improve the performance of tiled NN accelerators by 2x and reduce their energy consumption by 45% across a wide range of NNs. The effectiveness of our optimizations also increases with the NN size and complexity.","author":["Mingyu Gao","Xuan Yang","Jing Pu","Mark Horowitz","Christos Kozyrakis"],"issue":["ASPLOS '19: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","April 2019","Pages   807\u2013820","https://doi.org/10.1145/3297858.3304014"],"date":"04 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"Jorge Albericio, Patrick Judd, Tayler Hetherington, Tor Aamodt, Natalie Enright Jerger, and Andreas Moshovos. 2016.

By combining multiple sparse columns of a convolutional filter matrix into a single dense column stored in the systolic array, the utilization efficiency of the systolic array can be substantially increased (e.g., 8x) due to the increased density of nonzero weights in the resulting packed filter matrix. In combining columns, for each row, all filter weights but the one with the largest magnitude are pruned. The remaining weights are retrained to preserve high accuracy. We study the effectiveness of this joint optimization for both high utilization efficiency and classification accuracy with ASIC and FPGA designs based on efficient bit-serial implementations of multiplier-accumulators. We demonstrate that in mitigating data privacy concerns the retraining can be accomplished with only fractions of the original dataset (e.g., 10% for CIFAR-10). We present analysis and empirical evidence on the superior performance of our column combining approach against prior arts under metrics such as energy efficiency (3x) and inference latency (12x).","author":["H.T.

Current attempts at improving blockchain scalability are limited to cryptocurrency. Scaling blockchain systems under general workloads (i.e., non-cryptocurrency applications) remains an open question. This work takes a principled approach to apply sharding to blockchain systems in order to improve their transaction throughput at scale. This is challenging, however, due to the fundamental difference in failure models between databases and blockchain. To achieve our goal, we first enhance the performance of Byzantine consensus protocols, improving individual shards' throughput. Next, we design an efficient shard formation protocol that securely assigns nodes into shards. We rely on trusted hardware, namely Intel SGX, to achieve high performance for both consensus and shard formation protocol. Third, we design a general distributed transaction protocol that ensures safety and liveness even when transaction coordinators are malicious. Finally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of our design both on a local cluster and on Google Cloud Platform. The results show that our consensus and shard formation protocols outperform state-of-the-art solutions at scale. More importantly, our sharded blockchain reaches a high throughput that can handle Visa-level workloads, and is the largest ever reported in a realistic environment.","author":["Hung Dang","Tien Tuan Anh Dinh","Dumitrel Loghin","Ee-Chien Chang","Qian Lin","Beng Chin Ooi"],"issue":["SIGMOD '19: Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Management of Data","June 2019","Pages   123\u2013140","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299869.3319889"],"date":"25 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"Intel SGX SDK for Linux. https://github.com/01org/linux-sgx.","order":1},{"text":"Proof of Elapsted Time. https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/ releases/latest/introduction.html.","order":2},{"text":"Ripple. https://ripple.com.","order":3},{"text":"The Coco Framework. http://aka.ms/cocopaper.","order":4},{"text":"Trusted Computing Group. http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/.","order":5},{"text":"2018.

Dedicated SNN hardware, also called neuromorphic hardware, can further reduce the energy consumption of these platforms. A neuromorphic hardware consists of crossbars, which are arrangements of input and output neurons with fully-connected synapses. Time-multiplexed interconnects are used to communicate spikes between crossbars. When a SNN model is mapped on multiple crossbars, the time-multiplexed interconnect increases spike latency and energy consumption, and disorders spike arrivals at output neurons, which reduces application accuracy. In this paper, we propose segmented bus interconnect for global synapses in a neuromorphic architecture. The objective is to reduce power consumption and enable parallel processing compared to traditional time-multiplexed interconnects. The fundamental idea for the segmented bus is to partition a single bus into several segments, with the segmentation switches controlled by software. We evaluate the scalability of segmented bus using synthetic applications. Our results show that segmented bus reduces the latency and energy consumption of the global synapse network significantly with respect to state-of-the-art techniques.","author":["Adarsha Balaji","Yuefeng Wu","Anup Das","Francky Catthoor","Siebren Schaafsma"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '19: Proceedings of the 2019 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2019","Pages   495\u2013499","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299874.3319491"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Filipp Akopyan et al. 2015.

Emerging resistive random-access memories (RRAMs) and RRAM-based Processing-In-Memory architectures have demonstrated great potentials in boosting both the performance and energy efficiency of CNNs. However, restricted by the immature process technology, it is hard to implement and fabricate a CNN accelerator chip based on multi-bit RRAM devices. In addition, existing single bit RRAM based CNN accelerators only focus on binary or ternary CNNs which have more than 10% accuracy loss compared with full precision CNNs. This paper proposes a configurable multi-precision CNN computing framework based on single bit RRAM, which consists of an RRAM computing overhead aware network quantization algorithm and a configurable multi-precision CNN computing architecture based on single bit RRAM. The proposed method can achieve equivalent accuracy as full precision CNN but also with lower storage consumption and latency via multiple precision quantization. The designed architecture supports for accelerating the multi-precision CNNs even with various precision among different layers. Experiment results show that the proposed framework can reduce 70% computing area and 75% computing energy on average, with nearly no accuracy loss. And the equivalent energy efficiency is 1.6 ~ 8.6\u00d7 compared with existing RRAM based architectures with only 1.07% area overhead.","author":["Zhenhua Zhu","Hanbo Sun","Yujun Lin","Guohao Dai","Lixue Xia","Song Han","Yu Wang","Huazhong Yang"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 56","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317739"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"M.

Prior AMS approaches focus on small networks/datasets, which can maintain accuracy even with 2b precision. We analyze applicability of AMS approaches to larger networks by proposing a generic AMS error model, implementing it in an existing training framework, and investigating its effect on ImageNet classification with ResNet-50. We demonstrate significant accuracy recovery by exposing the network to AMS error during retraining, and we show that batch normalization layers are responsible for this accuracy recovery. We also introduce an energy model to predict the requirements of high-accuracy AMS hardware running large networks and use it to show that for ADC-dominated designs, there is a direct tradeoff between energy efficiency and network accuracy. Our model predicts that achieving < 0.4% accuracy loss on ResNet-50 with AMS hardware requires a computation energy of at least ~300 fJ/MAC. Finally, we propose methods for improving the energy-accuracy tradeoff.","author":["Angad S.

To maximize the energy-efficiency of hardware accelerators for different applications, the accelerators need to support various bit-width configurations. When designing bit-reconfigurable accelerators, each PE must have variable shift-addition logic, which takes a large amount of area and power. This paper introduces an area and energy efficient precision-scalable neural network accelerator (BitBlade), which reduces the control overhead for variable shift-addition using bitwise summation method. The proposed BitBlade, when synthesized in a 28nm CMOS technology, showed reduction in area by 41% and in energy by 36-46% compared to the state-of-the-art precision-scalable architecture [14].","author":["Sungju Ryu","Hyungjun Kim","Wooseok Yi","Jae-Joon Kim"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 84","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317784"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"Song Han et al. 2015.

We propose a fast and flexible hardware architecture, named Peregrine, supported by a stack of innovations from algorithm to hardware design. Peregrine first minimizes the memory footprint by limiting the synaptic connection patterns within the LSTM network. Also, Peregrine provides parallel Huffman decoders with adaptive clocking to provide flexibility in dealing with a wide range of sparsity levels in the weight matrices. All these features are incorporated in a novel hardware architecture to maximize energy-efficiency. As a result, Peregrine improves performance by ~38% and energy-efficiency by ~33% in speech recognition compared to the state-of-the-art LSTM accelerator.","author":["Jaeha Kung","Junki Park","Sehun Park","Jae-Joon Kim"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 209","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317879"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"A.

With FaaS, developers express arbitrary computations as simple functions that are automatically invoked and managed by a cloud platform in response to events. We extend this FaaS model so that it is suitable for use in all tiers of scale for IoT - sensors, edge devices, and cloud - to facilitate robust, portable, and low-latency IoT application development and deployment. To enable this, we combine the use of Linux containers and namespaces for isolation and portability, an append-only object store for robust persistence, and a causal event log for triggering functions and tracking event dependencies. We present the design and implementation of CSPOT, detail its abstractions and APIs, and overview examples of its use. We empirically evaluate the performance of CSPOT using different devices and applications and find that it implements function invocation with significantly lower latency than other FaaS offerings, while providing portability across tiers and similar data durability characteristics.","author":["Rich Wolski","Chandra Krintz","Fatih Bakir","Gareth George","Wei-Tsung Lin"],"issue":["SEC '19: Proceedings of the 4th ACM/IEEE Symposium on Edge Computing","November 2019","Pages   236\u2013249","https://doi.org/10.1145/3318216.3363314"],"date":"07 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"P.

To address those requirements, a common approach is to train those models on heterogeneous systems with a mixture of hardware devices such as CPUs and GPUs. Normally, the decision of putting parts of neural networks on devices is made by researchers based on heuristics algorithm. In this paper, we introduce an effective method to optimize operations placement for TensorFlow computational graphs on heterogeneous systems by using deep neural networks to predict devices for each operation in a target computational graph. Based on reinforcement learning, our method learns to group operations and assign each group to a corresponding device. To take advantage of the information of operations, we use a fully-connected network to group operations. In addition, we use the actual running time of the predictive placement as rewards to train the predictive network by using policy gradients. By executing the most widely used models in computer vision and machine translation, our method finds an optimized placement which outperforms human experts. When applying our method to the Neural Machine Translation model on the WMT14 German-English dataset, the execution time of per single training step reduces up to 28.41%.","author":["Junnan Liu","Chengfan Jia","Junshi Chen","Han Lin","Xu Jin","Hong An"],"issue":["HP3C '19: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on High Performance Compilation, Computing and Communications","March 2019","Pages   13\u201319","https://doi.org/10.1145/3318265.3318270"],"date":"08 March 2019","ref":[{"text":"Haralick R M, Shanmugam K.

We provide a design for hardening FaaS platforms with Intel SGX---a hardware-based shielded execution technology. We explain the protocol that our system uses to ensure confidentiality and integrity of data, and integrity of function chains. To overcome performance and latency issues that are inherent in SGX applications, we apply several SGX-specific optimizations to the runtime system: we use SGXv2 to speed up the enclave startup and perform batch EPC augmentation. To evaluate our approach, we implement our design over Apache Open-Whisk, a popular serverless platform. Lastly, we show that Clemmys achieved same throughput and similar latency as native Apache OpenWhisk, while allowing it to withstand several new attack vectors.","author":["Bohdan Trach","Oleksii Oleksenko","Franz Gregor","Pramod Bhatotia","Christof Fetzer"],"issue":["SYSTOR '19: Proceedings of the 12th ACM International Conference on Systems and Storage","May 2019","Pages   44\u201354","https://doi.org/10.1145/3319647.3325835"],"date":"22 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Apache OpenWhisk is a serverless, open source cloud platform. https://openwhisk.apache.org.

However, the state-of-the-art DL systems still suffer from quality issues. While some recent progress has been made on the analysis of feed-forward DL systems, little study has been done on the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based stateful DL systems, which are widely used in audio, natural languages and video processing, etc. In this paper, we initiate the very first step towards the quantitative analysis of RNN-based DL systems. We model RNN as an abstract state transition system to characterize its internal behaviors. Based on the abstract model, we design two trace similarity metrics and five coverage criteria which enable the quantitative analysis of RNNs. We further propose two algorithms powered by the quantitative measures for adversarial sample detection and coverage-guided test generation. We evaluate DeepStellar on four RNN-based systems covering image classification and automated speech recognition. The results demonstrate that the abstract model is useful in capturing the internal behaviors of RNNs, and confirm that (1) the similarity metrics could effectively capture the differences between samples even with very small perturbations (achieving 97% accuracy for detecting adversarial samples) and (2) the coverage criteria are useful in revealing erroneous behaviors (generating three times more adversarial samples than random testing and hundreds times more than the unrolling approach).","author":["Xiaoning Du","Xiaofei Xie","Yi Li","Lei Ma","Yang Liu","Jianjun Zhao"],"issue":["ESEC/FSE 2019: Proceedings of the 2019 27th ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering","August 2019","Pages   477\u2013487","https://doi.org/10.1145/3338906.3338954"],"date":"12 August 2019","ref":[{"text":"2018.

While process variability between different horizontal layers are well known, little has been systematically investigated about strong process similarity (PS) within the horizontal layer. In this paper, based on an extensive characterization study using real 3D flash chips, we show that 3D NAND flash memory possesses very strong process similarity within a 3D flash block: the word lines (WLs) on the same horizontal layer of the 3D flash block exhibit virtually equivalent reliability characteristics. This strong process similarity, which was not previously utilized, opens simple but effective new optimization opportunities for 3D flash memory. In this paper, we focus on exploiting the process similarity for improving the I/O latency. By carefully reusing various flash operating parameters monitored from accessing the leading WL, the remaining WLs on the same horizontal layer can be quickly accessed, avoiding unnecessary redundant steps for subsequent program and read operations. We also propose a new program sequence, called mixed order scheme (MOS), for 3D NAND flash memory which can further reduce the program latency. We have implemented a PS-aware FTL, called cubeFTL, which takes advantage of the proposed techniques. Our evaluation results show that cubeFTL can improve the IOPS by up to 48% over an existing PS-unaware FTL.","author":["Youngseop Shim","Myungsuk Kim","Myoungjun Chun","Jisung Park","Yoona Kim","Jihong Kim"],"issue":["MICRO '52: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","October 2019","Pages   211\u2013223","https://doi.org/10.1145/3352460.3358311"],"date":"12 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Y.

In serverless computing, programmers write what are called serverless functions, which are programs that respond to external events. When demand for the serverless function spikes, the platform automatically allocates additional hardware and manages load-balancing; when demand falls, the platform silently deallocates idle resources; and when the platform detects a failure, it transparently retries affected requests. In 2014, Amazon Web Services introduced the first serverless platform, AWS Lambda, and similar abstractions are now available on all major cloud computing platforms. Unfortunately, the serverless computing abstraction exposes several low-level operational details that make it hard for programmers to write and reason about their code. This paper sheds light on this problem by presenting \u03bb\u03bb, an operational semantics of the essence of serverless computing. Despite being a small (half a page) core calculus, \u03bb\u03bb models all the low-level details that serverless functions can observe. To show that \u03bb\u03bb is useful, we present three applications. First, to ease reasoning about code, we present a simplified naive semantics of serverless execution and precisely characterize when the naive semantics and \u03bb\u03bb coincide. Second, we augment \u03bb\u03bb with a key-value store to allow reasoning about stateful serverless functions. Third, since a handful of serverless platforms support serverless function composition, we show how to extend \u03bb\u03bb with a composition language and show that our implementation can outperform prior work.","author":["Abhinav Jangda","Donald Pinckney","Yuriy Brun","Arjun Guha"],"issue":["Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages","Volume 3","Issue OOPSLA","October 2019","Article No.: 149","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/3360575"],"date":"10 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Istemi Ekin Akkus, Ruichuan Chen, Ivica Rimac, Manuel Stein, Klaus Satzke, Andre Beck, Paarijaat Aditya, and Volker Hilt. 2018.

However, deep learning-based video coding remains in its infancy. We review the representative works about using deep learning for image/video coding, an actively developing research area since 2015. We divide the related works into two categories: new coding schemes that are built primarily upon deep networks, and deep network-based coding tools that shall be used within traditional coding schemes. For deep schemes, pixel probability modeling and auto-encoder are the two approaches, that can be viewed as predictive coding and transform coding, respectively. For deep tools, there have been several techniques using deep learning to perform intra-picture prediction, inter-picture prediction, cross-channel prediction, probability distribution prediction, transform, post- or in-loop filtering, down- and up-sampling, as well as encoding optimizations. In the hope of advocating the research of deep learning-based video coding, we present a case study of our developed prototype video codec, Deep Learning Video Coding (DLVC). DLVC features two deep tools that are both based on convolutional neural network (CNN), namely CNN-based in-loop filter and CNN-based block adaptive resolution coding. The source code of DLVC has been released for future research.","author":["Dong Liu","Yue Li","Jianping Lin","Houqiang Li","Feng Wu"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 53","Issue 1","May 2020","Article No.: 11","pp   1\u201335","https://doi.org/10.1145/3368405"],"date":"05 February 2020","ref":[{"text":"Mariana Afonso, Fan Zhang, and David R.

At the same time, with the emergence of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, one can provide support for trust, immutability, and transparency to share information among networked entities at the edge and in the cloud in 5G networks. A performance model for a permissioned private blockchain platform is developed. Depending on the latency sensitivity and throughput requirements of a 5G edge application, different possibilities are explored to provide support for blockchain technology at the edge. In particular, applications to 5G use-cases are considered, and lazy ledger decoupling between the 5G edge and the 5G cloud is proposed to meet edge latency constraints.","author":["Dilip Krishnaswamy"],"issue":["ICDCN 2020: Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Distributed Computing and Networking","January 2020","Article No.: 47","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3369740.3372767"],"date":"04 January 2020","ref":[{"text":"Elli Androulaki et al. 2018.

They are able to request a service with different implementations of the same functionality, including hardware accelerator, depending on cost and performance. This model opens up a new opportunity to integrate reconfigurable hardware, specifically, FPGA, in the cloud to offer such services. There are many research works discussing solutions for this problem but they focus primarily on the high-level aspects of resource manager, hypervisor or hardware architecture. The low-level physical design choices of FPGA to maximize the accelerator allocation success rate (called serviceability) is largely untouched. In this paper, we propose a design space exploration algorithm to determine the best configuration of partially reconfigurable regions (PRRs) to host the accelerators. Besides, the algorithm is capable of estimating the actual resources occupied by the PRRs on the FPGA even before floorplanning. We systematically study the effects of having more PRRs on the system in various aspects, i.e., serviceability, waiting time and resource wastage. The experiments show that at a certain number of PRRs, upto 91% serviceability can be achieved for 12 concurrent users. It is a significant improvement from 52% without our approach. The average amount of time that each request has to wait to be served is also reduced by 6.3X. Furthermore, the cumulative unused FPGA resources is reduced almost by half.","author":["Tuan D. A.

These providers seek to multiplex their FPGAs among customers via virtualization, thereby reducing running costs. Unfortunately, most virtualization support is confined to FPGAs that expose a restrictive, host-centric programming model in which accelerators cannot issue direct memory accesses (DMAs). The host-centric model incurs high runtime overhead for workloads that exhibit pointer chasing. Thus, FPGAs are beginning to support a shared-memory programming model in which accelerators can issue DMAs. However, virtualization support for shared-memory FPGAs is limited. This paper presents Optimus, the first hypervisor that supports scalable shared-memory FPGA virtualization. Optimus offers both spatial multiplexing and temporal multiplexing to provide efficient and flexible sharing of each accelerator on an FPGA. To share the FPGA-CPU interconnect at a high clock frequency, Optimus implements a multiplexer tree. To isolate each guest's address space, Optimus introduces the technique of page table slicing as a hardware-software co-design. To support preemptive temporal multiplexing, Optimus provides an accelerator preemption interface. We show that Optimus supports eight physical accelerators on a single FPGA and improves the aggregate throughput of twelve real-world benchmarks by 1.98x-7x.","author":["Jiacheng Ma","Gefei Zuo","Kevin Loughlin","Xiaohe Cheng","Yanqiang Liu","Abel Mulugeta Eneyew","Zhengwei Qi","Baris Kasikci"],"issue":["ASPLOS '20: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2020","Pages   827\u2013844","https://doi.org/10.1145/3373376.3378482"],"date":"09 March 2020","ref":[{"text":"[n.d.].

Indeed, recent advances in the 5G digital communication standard recommended the use of polar codes in EMBB control channels. However, in many cases, the implementation of efficient FEC hardware decoders is challenging. Specialised knowledge is required to enable and facilitate testing, rapid design iterations, and fast prototyping. In this article, a model-based design methodology to generate efficient hardware SC polar code decoders is presented. With HLS design process and tools, we demonstrate how FPGA system designers can quickly develop complex hardware systems with good performances. The favourable impact of design space exploration is underlined on achievable performances when a relevant computation model is used. The flexibility of the abstraction layers is evaluated. Hardware decoder generation efficiency is assessed and compared to competing approaches. It is shown that the fine-tuning of computation parallelism, bit length, pruning level, and working frequency help to design high-throughput decoders with moderate hardware complexities. Decoding throughputs higher than 300 Mbps are achieved on an Xilinx Virtex-7 device and on an Altera Stratix IV device.","author":["Yann Delomier","Bertrand Le Gal","Jer\u00e9mie Crenne","Christophe Jego"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 13","Issue 2","June 2020","Article No.: 10","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/3391431"],"date":"30 May 2020","ref":[{"text":"3GPP TS 38.212. 2018.

Our results show that, due to both diminishing improvements in clock rates and poor wire scaling as semiconductor devices shrink, the achievable performance growth of conventional microarchitectures will slow substantially. In this paper, we describe technology-driven models for wire capacitance, wire delay, and microarchitectural component delay. Using the results of these models, we measure the simulated performance\u2014estimating both clock rate and IPC \u2014of an aggressive out-of-order microarchitecture as it is scaled from a 250nm technology to a 35nm technology. We perform this analysis for three clock scaling targets and two microarchitecture scaling strategies: pipeline scaling and capacity scaling. We find that no scaling strategy permits annual performance improvements of better than 12.5%, which is far worse than the annual 50-60% to which we have grown accustomed.","author":["Vikas Agarwal","M.

For online thermal-aware error compensation, we compensate conductance change according to the temperature variation.

These circuits compromise the accuracy of their results within a tolerable limit to reduce the required computational effort and energy requirements. However, for an ongoing number of such approximate circuits reported in the literature, selecting those that minimize the required resources for designing and generating an approximate accelerator from a high-level specification, while satisfying a defined accuracy constraint, is a joint high-level synthesis (HLS) and design space exploration (DSE) challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel automated framework for HLS of approximate accelerators using a given library of approximate functional units. Since repetitive circuit synthesis and gate-level simulations require a significant amount of time, to enable our framework, we present AxME, a set of analytical models for estimating the required computational resources when using approximate adders and multipliers in approximate designs. We propose DSEwam, a DSE methodology for error-tolerant applications, in which analytical models, such as AxME, are used to estimate resources needed and the accuracy of approximate designs. Furthermore, we integrate DSEwam into an HLS tool to automatically generate Pareto-optimal, or near Pareto-optimal, approximate accelerators from C language descriptions, for a given error threshold and minimization goal. We release our DSE framework as an open-source contribution, which will significantly boost the research and development in the field of automatic generation of approximate accelerators.","author":["Jorge Castro-God\u00ednez","Juli\u00e1n Mateus-Vargas","Muhammad Shafique","J\u00f6rg Henkel"],"issue":["ICCAD '20: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2020","Article No.: 117","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/3400302.3415732"],"date":"02 November 2020","ref":[{"text":"Ismail Akturk, Karen Khatamifard, and Ulya R.

Structural analysis of heterogeneous networks is of great significance by leveraging the rich semantic information of objects and links in the heterogeneous networks. And, clustering heterogeneous networks aims to group vertices into classes, which sheds light on revealing the structure\u2013function relations of the underlying systems. The current algorithms independently perform the feature extraction and clustering, which are criticized for not fully characterizing the structure of clusters. In this study, we propose a learning model by joint <underline>G</underline>raph <underline>E</underline>mbedding and <underline>N</underline>onnegative <underline>M</underline>atrix <underline>F</underline>actorization (aka GEjNMF), where feature extraction and clustering are simultaneously learned by exploiting the graph embedding and latent structure of networks. We formulate the objective function of GEjNMF and transform the heterogeneous network clustering problem into a constrained optimization problem, which is effectively solved by l0-norm optimization. The advantage of GEjNMF is that features are selected under the guidance of clustering, which improves the performance and saves the running time of algorithms at the same time. The experimental results on three benchmark heterogeneous networks demonstrate that GEjNMF achieves the best performance with the least running time compared with the best state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is robust across heterogeneous networks from various fields. The proposed model and method provide an effective alternative for heterogeneous network clustering.","author":["Benhui Zhang","Maoguo Gong","Jianbin Huang","Xiaoke Ma"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data","Volume 15","Issue 4","June 2021","Article No.: 73","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/3441449"],"date":"10 June 2021","ref":[{"text":"Ralitsa Angelova, Gjergji Kasneci, and Gerhard Weikum. 2012.

This article introduces a new technique that extracts fingerprints from unique properties of partially erased NOR flash memory cells in modern microcontrollers. NOR flash memories integrated in modern systems-on-a-chip typically hold firmware and read-only data, but they are increasingly in-system-programmable, allowing designers to erase and program them during normal operation. The proposed technique leverages partial erase operations of flash memory segments that bring them into the state that exposes physical properties of the flash memory cells through a digital interface. These properties reflect semiconductor process variations and defects that are unique to each microcontroller or a flash memory segment within a microcontroller. The article explores threshold voltage variation in NOR flash memory cells for generating fingerprints and describes an algorithm for extracting fingerprints. The experimental evaluation utilizing a family of commercial microcontrollers demonstrates that the proposed technique is cost-effective, robust, and resilient to changes in voltage and temperature as well as to aging effects.","author":["Prawar Poudel","Biswajit Ray","Aleksandar Milenkovic"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 20","Issue 3","April 2021","Article No.: 26","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3448271"],"date":"27 March 2021","ref":[{"text":"Anys Bacha and Radu Teodorescu. 2015.

The evaluation speed for the software LCC simulator (SSIM) is about 140,000 (gate) evaluations per second using C source code or target machine code, or 50,000 evaluations per second using interpreted code. It is about 40 to 100 times slower than the AIDA hardware LCC simulator, but is about one order of magnitude faster than a traditional software event simulator. For a 32-bit multiplier with gate activity more than 100%, experiments indicate that SSIM runs about 250 to 1,000 times faster than the AIDA event simulator that evaluates about 4,500 gates per second.","author":["L.-T.

Parameters include the number of memory channels, the bandwidth of each channel, burst sizes, queue sizes and organizations, turnaround overhead, memory-controller page protocol, algorithms for assigning request priorities and scheduling requests dynamically, etc. In this design space, we see a wide variation in application execution times: for example, execution times for SPEC CPU 2000 integer suite on a 2-way ganged Direct Rambus organization (32 data bits) with 64-byte bursts are 10-20% lower than execution times on an otherwise identical configuration that uses 32-byte bursts. This represents two system configurations that are relatively close to each other in the design space; performance differences become even more pronounced for designs further apart.\nThis paper characterizes the sources of overhead in high-performance DRAM systems and investigates the most effective ways to reduce a system's exposure to performance loss. In particular, we look at mechanisms to increase a system's support for concurrent transactions, mechanisms to reduce request latency, and mechanisms to reduce the \u201csystem overhead\u201d\u2014the portion of the primary memory system's overhead that is not due to DRAM latency but rather to things like turnaround time, request queueing, inefficiencies due to read/write request interleaving, etc. Our simulator models a 2GHz, highly aggressive out-of-order uniprocessor. The interface to the memory system is fully non-blocking, supporting up to 32 outstanding misses at both the level-1 and level-2 caches and split-transaction busses to all DRAM banks.","author":["Vinodh Cuppu","Bruce Jacob"],"issue":["ISCA '01: Proceedings of the 28th annual international symposium on Computer architecture","June 2001","Pages   62\u201371","https://doi.org/10.1145/379240.379252"],"date":"01 May 2001","ref":[{"text":"A.

Due to its complexity, it is responsible for a significant percentage of the energy consumed by a microprocessor. The energy consumption of the issue logic depends on several architectural parameters, the instruction issue queue size being one of the most important. In this paper we present a technique to reduce the energy consumption of the issue logic of a high-performance superscalar processor. The proposed technique is based on the observation that the conventional issue logic wastes a significant amount of energy for useless activity. In particular, the wake-up of empty entries and operands that are ready represents an important source of energy waste. Besides, we propose a mechanism to dynamically reduce the effective size of the instruction queue. We show that on average the effective instruction queue size can be reduced by a factor of 26% with minimal impact on performance. This reduction together with the energy saved for empty and ready entries result in about 90.7% reduction in the energy consumed by the wake-up logic, which represents 14.9% of the total energy of the assumed processor.","author":["Daniele Folegnani","Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez"],"issue":["ISCA '01: Proceedings of the 28th annual international symposium on Computer architecture","June 2001","Pages   230\u2013239","https://doi.org/10.1145/379240.379266"],"date":"01 May 2001","ref":[{"text":"G.

It attacks program stalls from data cache misses by pre-computing future memory accesses in available thread contexts, and prefetching these data. This technique is evaluated by simulating the performance of a research processor based on the Itanium\u2122 ISA supporting Simultaneous Multithreading. Two primary forms of Speculative Precomputation are evaluated. If only the non-speculative thread spawns speculative threads, performance gains of up to 30% are achieved when assuming ideal hardware. However, this speedup drops considerably with more realistic hardware assumptions. Permitting speculative threads to directly spawn additional speculative threads reduces the overhead associated with spawning threads and enables significantly more aggressive speculation, overcoming this limitation. Even with realistic costs for spawning threads, speedups as high as 169% are achieved, with an average speedup of 76%.","author":["Jamison D. Collins","Hong Wang","Dean M.

Although RBAC models have received broad support as a generalized approach to access control, and are well recognized for their many advantages in performing large-scale authorization management, no single authoritative definition of RBAC exists today. This lack of a widely accepted model results in uncertainty and confusion about RBAC's utility and meaning. The standard proposed here seeks to resolve this situation by unifying ideas from a base of frequently referenced RBAC models, commercial products, and research prototypes. It is intended to serve as a foundation for product development, evaluation, and procurement specification. Although RBAC continues to evolve as users, researchers, and vendors gain experience with its application, we feel the features and components proposed in this standard represent a fundamental and stable set of mechanisms that may be enhanced by developers in further meeting the needs of their customers. As such, this document does not attempt to standardize RBAC features beyond those that have achieved acceptance in the commercial marketplace and research community, but instead focuses on defining a fundamental and stable set of RBAC components. This standard is organized into the RBAC Reference Model and the RBAC System and Administrative Functional Specification. The reference model defines the scope of features that comprise the standard and provides a consistent vocabulary in support of the specification. The RBAC System and Administrative Functional Specification defines functional requirements for administrative operations and queries for the creation, maintenance, and review of RBAC sets and relations, as well as for specifying system level functionality in support of session attribute management and an access control decision process.","author":["David F.

SEDA is intended to support massive concurrency demands and simplify the construction of well-conditioned services. In SEDA, applications consist of a network of event-driven stages connected by explicit queues. This architecture allows services to be well-conditioned to load, preventing resources from being overcommitted when demand exceeds service capacity. SEDA makes use of a set of dynamic resource controllers to keep stages within their operating regime despite large fluctuations in load. We describe several control mechanisms for automatic tuning and load conditioning, including thread pool sizing, event batching, and adaptive load shedding. We present the SEDA design and an implementation of an Internet services platform based on this architecture. We evaluate the use of SEDA through two applications: a high-performance HTTP server and a packet router for the Gnutella peer-to-peer file sharing network. These results show that SEDA applications exhibit higher performance than traditional service designs, and are robust to huge variations in load.","author":["Matt Welsh","David Culler","Eric Brewer"],"issue":["SOSP '01: Proceedings of the eighteenth ACM symposium on Operating systems principles","October 2001","Pages   230\u2013243","https://doi.org/10.1145/502034.502057"],"date":"21 October 2001","ref":[{"text":"Akamai, Inc. h t t p : //www. akamai, coma]]","order":1},{"text":"America Online Press Data Points. http ://corp.aol,com /press/ press datapoints.html.]]","order":2},{"text":"Digital Island, Inc. http : //www. digitalisland, com/.]]","order":3},{"text":"Acme Labs. thttpd: Tiny/Turbo{rhrottling HTrP Server. http : //www. acrae, com/software/tht tpd/.]]","order":4},{"text":"T.

The main focus is on decidable forms of logic programming, in particular, propositional logic programming and datalog, but we also mention general logic programming with function symbols. Next to classical results on plain logic programming (pure Horn clause programs), more recent results on various important extensions of logic programming are surveyed. These include logic programming with different forms of negation, disjunctive logic programming, logic programming with equality, and constraint logic programming.","author":["Evgeny Dantsin","Thomas Eiter","Georg Gottlob","Andrei Voronkov"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 33","Issue 3","September 2001","pp   374\u2013425","https://doi.org/10.1145/502807.502810"],"date":"01 September 2001","ref":[{"text":"AANDERAA,S.AND B~RGER, E. 1979.

The inclusion of such a device will provide an efficient compromise between the flexibility of software and the performance of hardware, while at the same time allowing for post-fabrication modification of circuits. To automate the layout of reconfigurable subsystems for system-on -a-chip we present template reduction, standard cell, and circuit generator methods. We explore the standard cell method, as well as the creation of FPGA-specific standard cells. Compared to full custom circuits, we achieve designs that are 46% smaller and 36% faster when the application domain is well known in advance. In cases where no reduction from the full functionality is possible, the standard cell approach is 42% larger and 64% slower than full-custom circuits. Standard cells can thus provide competitive implementations, with significantly greater opportunity for adaptation to new domains.","author":["Shawn Phillips","Scott Hauck"],"issue":["FPGA '02: Proceedings of the 2002 ACM/SIGDA tenth international symposium on Field-programmable gate arrays","February 2002","Pages   165\u2013173","https://doi.org/10.1145/503048.503073"],"date":"24 February 2002","ref":[{"text":"Abnous, A. and Rabaey, J.

We carry this process a step further, omitting almost all features of the full language (including interfaces and even assignment) to obtain a small calculus, Featherweight Java, for which rigorous proofs are not only possible but easy. Featherweight Java bears a similar relation to Java as the lambda-calculus does to languages such as ML and Haskell. It offers a similar computational \"feel,\" providing classes, methods, fields, inheritance, and dynamic typecasts with a semantics closely following Java's. A proof of type safety for Featherweight Java thus illustrates many of the interesting features of a safety proof for the full language, while remaining pleasingly compact. The minimal syntax, typing rules, and operational semantics of Featherweight Java make it a handy tool for studying the consequences of extensions and variations. As an illustration of its utility in this regard, we extend Featherweight Java with generic classes in the style of GJ (Bracha, Odersky, Stoutamire, and Wadler) and give a detailed proof of type safety. The extended system formalizes for the first time some of the key features of GJ.","author":["Atsushi Igarashi","Benjamin C.

We are given a network, a rate of traffic between each pair of nodes, and a latency function for each edge specifying the time needed to traverse the edge given its congestion; the objective is to route traffic such that the sum of all travel times---the total latency---is minimized.In many settings, it may be expensive or impossible to regulate network traffic so as to implement an optimal assignment of routes. In the absence of regulation by some central authority, we assume that each network user routes its traffic on the minimum-latency path available to it, given the network congestion caused by the other users. In general such a \"selfishly motivated\" assignment of traffic to paths will not minimize the total latency; hence, this lack of regulation carries the cost of decreased network performance.In this article, we quantify the degradation in network performance due to unregulated traffic. We prove that if the latency of each edge is a linear function of its congestion, then the total latency of the routes chosen by selfish network users is at most 4/3 times the minimum possible total latency (subject to the condition that all traffic must be routed). We also consider the more general setting in which edge latency functions are assumed only to be continuous and nondecreasing in the edge congestion. Here, the total latency of the routes chosen by unregulated selfish network users may be arbitrarily larger than the minimum possible total latency; however, we prove that it is no more than the total latency incurred by optimally routing twice as much traffic.","author":["Tim Roughgarden","\u00c9va Tardos"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 49","Issue 2","March 2002","pp   236\u2013259","https://doi.org/10.1145/506147.506153"],"date":"01 March 2002","ref":[{"text":"Aashtiani, H.

We have recently fabricated prototype DIVA PIMs. These chips represent the first smart-memory devices designed to support virtual addressing and capable of executing multiple threads of control. In this paper, we describe the prototype PIM architecture. We emphasize three unique features of DIVA PIMs, namely, the memory interface to the host processor, the 256-bit wide datapaths for exploiting on-chip bandwidth, and the address translation unit. We present detailed simulation results on eight benchmark applications. When just a single PIM chip is used, we achieve an average speedup of 3.3X over host-only execution, due to lower memory stall times and increased fine-grain parallelism. These 1-PIM results suggest that a PIM-based architecture with many such chips yields significantly higher performance than a multiprocessor of a similar scale and at a much reduced hardware cost.","author":["Jeff Draper","Jacqueline Chame","Mary Hall","Craig Steele","Tim Barrett","Jeff LaCoss","John Granacki","Jaewook Shin","Chun Chen","Chang Woo Kang","Ihn Kim","Gokhan Daglikoca"],"issue":["ICS '02: Proceedings of the 16th international conference on Supercomputing","June 2002","Pages   14\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/514191.514197"],"date":"22 June 2002","ref":[{"text":"{1} J.

The model to be textured is decomposed into charts homeomorphic to discs, each chart is parameterized, and the unfolded charts are packed in texture space. Existing texture atlas methods for triangulated surfaces suffer from several limitations, requiring them to generate a large number of small charts with simple borders. The discontinuities between the charts cause artifacts, and make it difficult to paint large areas with regular patterns.In this paper, our main contribution is a new quasi-conformal parameterization method, based on a least-squares approximation of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The so-defined objective function minimizes angle deformations, and we prove the following properties: the minimum is unique, independent of a similarity in texture space, independent of the resolution of the mesh and cannot generate triangle flips. The function is numerically well behaved and can therefore be very efficiently minimized. Our approach is robust, and can parameterize large charts with complex borders.We also introduce segmentation methods to decompose the model into charts with natural shapes, and a new packing algorithm to gather them in texture space. We demonstrate our approach applied to paint both scanned and modeled data sets.","author":["Bruno L\u00e9vy","Sylvain Petitjean","Nicolas Ray","J\u00e9rome Maillot"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 21","Issue 3","July 2002","pp   362\u2013371","https://doi.org/10.1145/566654.566590"],"date":"01 July 2002","ref":[{"text":"M.

Many programs have wildly different behavior on even the very largest of scales (over the complete execution of the program). This realization has ramifications for many architectural and compiler techniques, from thread scheduling, to feedback directed optimizations, to the way programs are simulated. However, in order to take advantage of time-varying behavior, we must first develop the analytical tools necessary to automatically and efficiently analyze program behavior over large sections of execution.Our goal is to develop automatic techniques that are capable of finding and exploiting the Large Scale Behavior of programs (behavior seen over billions of instructions). The first step towards this goal is the development of a hardware independent metric that can concisely summarize the behavior of an arbitrary section of execution in a program. To this end we examine the use of Basic Block Vectors. We quantify the effectiveness of Basic Block Vectors in capturing program behavior across several different architectural metrics, explore the large scale behavior of several programs, and develop a set of algorithms based on clustering capable of analyzing this behavior. We then demonstrate an application of this technology to automatically determine where to simulate for a program to help guide computer architecture research.","author":["Timothy Sherwood","Erez Perelman","Greg Hamerly","Brad Calder"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 37","Issue 10","October 2002","pp   45\u201357","https://doi.org/10.1145/605432.605403"],"date":"01 October 2002","ref":[{"text":"A.

Two examples of asynchronous multiple-loop networks are presented in this article: a stylized queuing system and an Ising model. In both cases, the network is an n \u00d7 n grid on a torus and includes at least an order of n2 feedback loops. A new distributed simulation algorithm is demonstrated on these two examples. The algorithm combines three elements: (1) the bounded lag restriction; (2) minimum propagation delays; and (3) the so-called opaque periods. We prove that if N processing elements (PEs) execute the algorithm in parallel and the simulated system exhibits sufficient density of events, then, on average, processing one event would require O(log N) instructions of one PE. Experiments on a shared memory MIMD bus computer (Sequent's Balance) and on a SIMD computer (Connection Machine) show speed-ups greater than 16 on 25 PEs of a Balance and greater than1900 on 214 PEs of a Connection Machine.","author":["B.

It is specifically oriented toward supporting the database requirements for data-intensive information system applications in which (1) information objects of various levels of abstraction and modalities must be accommodated, (2) descriptive and structural information (metadata) is rich and dynamic, and (3) users who are not database experts must be able to design, manipulate, and evolve databases. In response to these needs, the 3DIS provides an approach in which data and the descriptive information about data are handled uniformly in an extensible framework. The 3DIS provides a simple, geometric, and formal representation of data which forms a basis for understanding, defining, and manipulating databases. Several prototype implementations based upon the 3DIS have been designed and implemented and are in experimental use.","author":["Hamideh Afsarmanesh","Dennis McLeod"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 7","Issue 4","Oct. 1989","pp   339\u2013377","https://doi.org/10.1145/76158.76892"],"date":"01 October 1989","ref":[{"text":"ABRIAL, J.R.

In this paper, the periodic balanced sorting network, which consists of log n blocks, is introduced. Each block, called a balanced merging block, merges elements on the even input lines with those on the odd input lines.The periodic balanced sorting network sorts n items in O([log n]2) time using (n/2)(log n)2 comparators. Although these bounds are comparable to many existing sorting networks, the periodic structure enables a hardware implementation consisting of only one block with the output of the block recycled back as input until the output is sorted. An implementation of our network on the shuffle exchange interconnection model in which the direction of the comparators are all identical and fixed is also presented.","author":["Martin Dowd","Yehoshua Perl","Larry Rudolph","Michael Saks"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 36","Issue 4","Oct. 1989","pp   738\u2013757","https://doi.org/10.1145/76359.76362"],"date":"01 October 1989","ref":[{"text":"AJTAI, M., KOMLOS, J., AND SZEMEREDI, E.

These are families of problems that (A) are computationally interreducible and (B) are the hardest members of some computationally defined class. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that for both algebraic and combinatorial problems this phenomenon exists in a form that is purely algebraic in both of the respects (A) and (B). Such computational consequences as NP-completeness are particular manifestations of something more fundamental. The core of the paper is self-contained, consisting as it does essentially of the two notions of \u201cp-definability\u201d and the five algebraic relations that are proved as theorems. In the remainder our aim is to elucidate the computational consequences of these basic results. Hence in the auxiliary propositions and discussion for convenience we do assume familiarity with algebraic and Boolean complexity theory.","author":["L. G.

This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes.","author":["Ion Stoica","Robert Morris","David Karger","M.

This subset is the gamut of colors spanned by the red, green, and blue (RGB) electron guns exciting their respective phosphors. It is called the RGB monitor gamut. Full-blown color theory is a quite complex subject involving physics, psychology, and physiology, but restriction to the RGB monitor gamut simplifies matters substantially. It is linear, for example, and admits to familiar spatial representations. This paper presents a set of alternative models of the RGB monitor gamut based on the perceptual variables hue (H), saturation (S), and value (V) or brightness (L). Algorithms for transforming between these models are derived. Particular emphasis is placed on an RGB to HSV non-trigonometric pair of transforms which have been used successfully for about four years in frame buffer painting programs.

It is well-known that the leakage power consumed by a digital CMOS circuit depends strongly on the state of its inputs. Our leakage reduction technique leverages a fundamental property of basic FPGA logic elements (look-up-tables) that allows a logic signal in an FPGA design to be interchanged with its complemented form without any area or delay penalty. We apply this property to select polarities for logic signals so that FPGA hardware structures spend the majority of time in low leakage states. In an experimental study, we optimize active leakage power in circuits mapped into a state-of-the-art 90nm commercial FPGA. Results show that the proposed approach reduces active leakage by 25%, on average.","author":["Jason H. Anderson","Farid N.

However, embedded systems increasingly incorporate Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), for which the concept of a standard hardware binary did not previously exist, requiring designers to implement a hardware circuit for a single specific FPGA. We introduce the concept of a standard hardware binary, using a just-in-time compiler to compile the hardware binary to an FPGA. A JIT compiler for FPGAs requires the development of lean versions of technology mapping, placement, and routing algorithms, of which routing is the most computationally and memory expensive step. We present the Riverside On-Chip Router (ROCR) designed to efficiently route a hardware circuit for a simple configurable logic fabric that we have developed. Through experiments with MCNC benchmark hardware circuits, we show that ROCR works well for JIT FPGA compilation, producing good hardware circuits using an order of magnitude less memory resources and execution time compared with the well known Versatile Place and Route (VPR) tool suite. ROCR produces good hardware circuits using 13X less memory and executing 10X faster than VPR's fastest routing algorithm. Furthermore, our results show ROCR requires only 10% additional routing resources, and results in circuit speeds only 32% slower than VPR's timing-driven router, and speeds that are actually 10% faster than VPR's routability-driven router.","author":["Roman Lysecky","Frank Vahid","Sheldon X.-D.

Numerous representation methods for dimensionality reduction and similarity measures geared towards time series have been introduced. Each individual work introducing a particular method has made specific claims and, aside from the occasional theoretical justifications, provided quantitative experimental observations. However, for the most part, the comparative aspects of these experiments were too narrowly focused on demonstrating the benefits of the proposed methods over some of the previously introduced ones. In order to provide a comprehensive validation, we conducted an extensive set of time series experiments re-implementing 8 different representation methods and 9 similarity measures and their variants, and testing their effectiveness on 38 time series data sets from a wide variety of application domains. In this paper, we give an overview of these different techniques and present our comparative experimental findings regarding their effectiveness. Our experiments have provided both a unified validation of some of the existing achievements, and in some cases, suggested that certain claims in the literature may be unduly optimistic.","author":["Hui Ding","Goce Trajcevski","Peter Scheuermann","Xiaoyue Wang","Eamonn Keogh"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 1","Issue 2","August 2008","pp   1542\u20131552","https://doi.org/10.14778/1454159.1454226"],"date":"01 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"Additional Experiment Results for Representation and Similarity Measures of Time Series. http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/~hdi117/tsim.htm.","order":1},{"text":"R.

This is referred to as multi-stream analysis. To deal with high stream arrival rates, it is desirable that such systems be capable of supporting very high processing throughput. The advent of multicore processors and powerful servers driven by these processors calls for efficient parallel designs that can effectively utilize the parallelism of the multicores, since performance improvement is possible only through effective parallelism. In this paper, we address the problem of parallelizing multi-stream analysis in the context of multicore processors. Specifically, we concentrate on parallelizing frequent elements, top-k, and frequency counting over multiple streams. We discuss the challenges in designing an efficient parallel system for multi-stream processing. Our evaluation and analysis reveals that traditional \"contention\" based locking results in excessive overhead and wait, which in turn leads to severe performance degradation in modern multicore architectures. Based on our analysis, we propose a \"cooperation\" based locking paradigm for efficient parallelization of frequency counting. The proposed \"cooperation\" based paradigm removes waits associated with synchronization, and allows replacing locks by much cheaper atomic synchronization primitives. Our implementation of the proposed paradigm to parallelize a well known frequency counting algorithm shows the benefits of the proposed \"cooperation\" based locking paradigm when compared to the traditional \"contention\" based locking paradigm. In our experiments, the proposed \"cooperation\" based design outperforms the traditional \"contention\" based design by a factor of 2--5.5X for synthetic zipfian data sets.","author":["Sudipto Das","Shyam Antony","Divyakant Agrawal","Amr El Abbadi"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 2","Issue 1","August 2009","pp   217\u2013228","https://doi.org/10.14778/1687627.1687653"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"D.

An important concern in the release of these data for study is their privacy, since social networks usually contain personal information. Simply removing all identifiable personal information (such as names and social security number) before releasing the data is insufficient. It is easy for an attacker to identify the target by performing different structural queries. In this paper we propose k-automorphism to protect against multiple structural attacks and develop an algorithm (called KM) that ensures k-automorphism. We also discuss an extension of KM to handle \"dynamic\" releases of the data. Extensive experiments show that the algorithm performs well in terms of protection it provides.","author":["Lei Zou","Lei Chen","M.

On such platforms, storage and compute power are adjusted dynamically, and therefore it is important to build a highly scalable and reliable storage that can elastically scale on-demand with minimal startup cost.In this paper, we propose ecStore -- an elastic cloud storage system that supports automated data partitioning and replication, load balancing, efficient range query, and transactional access. In ecStore, data objects are distributed and replicated in a cluster of commodity computer nodes located in the cloud. Users can access data via transactions which bundle read and write operations on multiple data items stored on possibly different cluster nodes.The architecture of ecStore follows a stratum design that leverages an underlying distributed index with a replication layer in the middle and a transaction management layer on top. ecStore provides adaptive read consistency on replicated data. We also enhance the system with an effective load balancing scheme using a self-tuning replication technique that is specially designed for large-scale data. Furthermore, a multi-version optimistic concurrency control scheme matches well with the characteristics of data in cloud storages. To validate the performance of the system, we have conducted extensive experiments on various platforms including a commercial cloud (Amazon's EC2), an in-house cluster, and PlanetLab.","author":["Hoang Tam Vo","Chun Chen","Beng Chin Ooi"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   506\u2013514","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920907"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~voht/TechRepVLDB10.pdf.","order":1},{"text":". http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~epic.","order":2},{"text":". http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/2008/07/10/GoogleMegastore.aspx.","order":3},{"text":"D.

With advances in geo-sensing technologies, there has been an increasing demand for geospatial streaming applications. Microsoft SQL Server StreamInsight (StreamInsight, for brevity) is a platform for developing and deploying streaming applications that run continuous queries over high-rate streaming events. With its extensibility infrastructure, StreamInsight enables developers to integrate their domain expertise within the query pipeline in the form of user defined modules.This demo utilizes the extensibility infrastructure in Microsoft StreamInsight to leverage its continuous query processing capabilities in two directions. The first direction integrates SQL spatial libraries into the continuous query pipeline of StreamInsight. StreamInsight provides a well-defined temporal model over incoming events while SQL spatial libraries cover the spatial properties of events to deliver a solution for spatiotemporal stream query processing. The second direction extends the system with an analytical refinement and prediction layer. This layer analyzes historical data that has been accumulated and summarized over the years to refine, smooth and adjust the current query output as well as predict the output in the near future. The demo scenario is based on transportation data in Los Angeles County.","author":["Seyed Jalal Kazemitabar","Ugur Demiryurek","Mohamed Ali","Afsin Akdogan","Cyrus Shahabi"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   1537\u20131540","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1921032"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"R.

It is based on the recently-developed Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI) technique. This is the first implementation of SSI in a production database release as well as the first in a database that did not previously have a lock-based serializable isolation level. We reflect on our experience and describe how we overcame some of the resulting challenges, including the implementation of a new lock manager, a technique for ensuring memory usage is bounded, and integration with other PostgreSQL features. We also introduce an extension to SSI that improves performance for read-only transactions. We evaluate PostgreSQL's serializable isolation level using several benchmarks and show that it achieves performance only slightly below that of snapshot isolation, and significantly outperforms the traditional two-phase locking approach on read-intensive workloads.","author":["Dan R.

Caching (CL) and storage (SL) layers use a common mapping table that separates a page's logical and physical location. CL supports data updates and management updates (e.g., for index re-organization) via latch-free compare-and-swap atomic state changes on its mapping table. SL uses the same mapping table to cope with page location changes produced by log structuring on every page flush. To demonstrate LLAMA's suitability, we tailored our latch-free Bw-tree implementation to use LLAMA. The Bw-tree is a B-tree style index.

Recently in SociaLite, we proposed extensions to Datalog to efficiently and succinctly implement graph analysis programs on sequential machines. This paper describes novel extensions and optimizations of SociaLite for parallel and distributed executions to support large-scale graph analysis.With distributed SociaLite, programmers simply annotate how data are to be distributed, then the necessary communication is automatically inferred to generate parallel code for cluster of multi-core machines. It optimizes the evaluation of recursive monotone aggregate functions using a delta stepping technique. In addition, approximate computation is supported in SociaLite, allowing programmers to trade off accuracy for less time and space.We evaluated SociaLite with six core graph algorithms used in many social network analyses. Our experiment with 64 Amazon EC2 8-core instances shows that SociaLite programs performed within a factor of two with respect to ideal weak scaling. Compared to optimized Giraph, an open-source alternative of Pregel, SociaLite programs are 4 to 12 times faster across benchmark algorithms, and 22 times more succinct on average.As a declarative query language, SociaLite, with the help of a compiler that generates efficient parallel and approximate code, can be used easily to create many social apps that operate on large-scale distributed graphs.","author":["Jiwon Seo","Jongsoo Park","Jaeho Shin","Monica S.

By performing a thorough performance analysis of both analytics operations and fine-grained object operations such as set/get, we show that neither system handles efficiently both types of workloads. For Memcached and Redis the CPU and I/O performance of the TCP stack are the bottlenecks -- even when serving in-memory objects within a single server node. RDD does not support efficient get operation for random objects, due to a large startup cost of the get job.

However, the main memory bandwidth of such coupled CPU-GPU architectures can be much lower than that of a discrete GPU. As a result, current GPU query co-processing paradigms can severely suffer from memory stalls. In this paper, we propose a novel in-cache query co-processing paradigm for main memory On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) databases on coupled CPU-GPU architectures. Specifically, we adapt CPU-assisted prefetching to minimize cache misses in GPU query co-processing and CPU-assisted decompression to improve query execution performance. Furthermore, we develop a cost model guided adaptation mechanism for distributing the workload of prefetching, decompression, and query execution between CPU and GPU. We implement a system prototype and evaluate it on two recent AMD APUs A8 and A10. The experimental results show that 1) in-cache query co-processing can effectively improve the performance of the state-of-the-art GPU co-processing paradigm by up to 30% and 33% on A8 and A10, respectively, and 2) our workload distribution adaption mechanism can significantly improve the query performance by up to 36% and 40% on A8 and A10, respectively.","author":["Jiong He","Shuhao Zhang","Bingsheng He"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 4","December 2014","pp   329\u2013340","https://doi.org/10.14778/2735496.2735497"],"date":"01 December 2014","ref":[{"text":"D.

As a consequence, conflicts among these sources are inevitable, which leads to an important task: how to identify which piece of information is trustworthy, i.e., the truth discovery task. Intuitively, if the piece of information is from a reliable source, then it is more trustworthy, and the source that provides trustworthy information is more reliable. Based on this principle, truth discovery approaches have been proposed to infer source reliability degrees and the most trustworthy information (i.e., the truth) simultaneously. However, existing approaches overlook the ubiquitous long-tail phenomenon in the tasks, i.e., most sources only provide a few claims and only a few sources make plenty of claims, which causes the source reliability estimation for small sources to be unreasonable. To tackle this challenge, we propose a confidence-aware truth discovery (CATD) method to automatically detect truths from conflicting data with long-tail phenomenon. The proposed method not only estimates source reliability, but also considers the confidence interval of the estimation, so that it can effectively reflect real source reliability for sources with various levels of participation. Experiments on four real world tasks as well as simulated multi-source long-tail datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art truth discovery approaches by successful discounting the effect of small sources.","author":["Qi Li","Yaliang Li","Jing Gao","Lu Su","Bo Zhao","Murat Demirbas","Wei Fan","Jiawei Han"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 4","December 2014","pp   425\u2013436","https://doi.org/10.14778/2735496.2735505"],"date":"01 December 2014","ref":[{"text":"M.

The non-volatility property has the promise to persist in-memory data structures for instantaneous failure recovery. However, realizing such promise requires a careful design to ensure that in-memory data structures are in known consistent states after failures.This paper studies persistent in-memory B+-Trees as B+-Trees are widely used in database and data-intensive systems. While traditional techniques, such as undo-redo logging and shadowing, support persistent B+-Trees, we find that they incur drastic performance overhead because of extensive NVM writes and CPU cache flush operations. PCM-friendly B+-Trees with unsorted leaf nodes help mediate this issue, but the remaining overhead is still large. In this paper, we propose write atomic B+-Trees (wB+-Trees), a new type of main-memory B+-Trees, that aim to reduce such overhead as much as possible. wB+-Tree nodes employ a small indirect slot array and/or a bitmap so that most insertions and deletions do not require the movement of index entries. In this way, wB+-Trees can achieve node consistency either through atomic writes in the nodes or by redo-only logging. We model fast NVM using DRAM on a real machine and model PCM using a cycle-accurate simulator. Experimental results show that compared with previous persistent B+-Tree solutions, wB+-Trees achieve up to 8.8x speedups on DRAM-like fast NVM and up to 27.1x speedups on PCM for insertions and deletions while maintaining good search performance. Moreover, we replaced Memcached's internal hash index with tree indices. Our real machine Memcached experiments show that wB+-Trees achieve up to 3.8X improvements over previous persistent tree structures with undo-redo logging or shadowing.","author":["Shimin Chen","Qin Jin"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 7","February 2015","pp   786\u2013797","https://doi.org/10.14778/2752939.2752947"],"date":"01 February 2015","ref":[{"text":"R.

GraphMat is our solution to bridge this gap between a user-friendly graph analytics framework and native, hand-optimized code. GraphMat functions by taking vertex programs and mapping them to high performance sparse matrix operations in the backend. We thus get the productivity benefits of a vertex programming framework without sacrificing performance. GraphMat is a single-node multicore graph framework written in C++ which has enabled us to write a diverse set of graph algorithms with the same effort compared to other vertex programming frameworks. GraphMat performs 1.1-7X faster than high performance frameworks such as GraphLab, CombBLAS and Galois. GraphMat also matches the performance of MapGraph, a GPU-based graph framework, despite running on a CPU platform with significantly lower compute and bandwidth resources. It achieves better multicore scalability (13-15X on 24 cores) than other frameworks and is 1.2X off native, hand-optimized code on a variety of graph algorithms. Since GraphMat performance depends mainly on a few scalable and well-understood sparse matrix operations, GraphMat can naturally benefit from the trend of increasing parallelism in future hardware.","author":["Narayanan Sundaram","Nadathur Satish","Md Mostofa Ali Patwary","Subramanya R.

The importance of spatial analytics and aggregation is ever-increasing. An important challenge is to support interactive exploration over such data. However, spatial analytics and aggregation using all data points that satisfy a query condition is expensive, especially over large data sets, and could not meet the needs of interactive exploration. To that end, we present novel indexing structures that support spatial online sampling and aggregation on large spatial and spatio-temporal data sets. In spatial online sampling, random samples from the set of spatial (or spatio-temporal) points that satisfy a query condition are generated incrementally in an online fashion. With more and more samples, various spatial analytics and aggregations can be performed in an online, interactive fashion, with estimators that have better accuracy over time. Our design works well for both memory-based and disk-resident data sets, and scales well towards different query and sample sizes. More importantly, our structures are dynamic, hence, they are able to deal with insertions and deletions efficiently. Extensive experiments on large real data sets demonstrate the improvements achieved by our indexing structures compared to other baseline methods.","author":["Lu Wang","Robert Christensen","Feifei Li","Ke Yi"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 9","Issue 3","November 2015","pp   84\u201395","https://doi.org/10.14778/2850583.2850584"],"date":"01 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"S.

It is crucial for performance to fit the data into single-node or distributed main memory. General-purpose, heavy- and lightweight compression techniques struggle to achieve both good compression ratios and fast decompression speed to enable block-wise uncompressed operations. Hence, we initiate work on compressed linear algebra (CLA), in which lightweight database compression techniques are applied to matrices and then linear algebra operations such as matrix-vector multiplication are executed directly on the compressed representations. We contribute effective column compression schemes, cache-conscious operations, and an efficient sampling-based compression algorithm. Our experiments show that CLA achieves in-memory operations performance close to the uncompressed case and good compression ratios that allow us to fit larger datasets into available memory. We thereby obtain significant end-to-end performance improvements up to 26x or reduced memory requirements.","author":["Ahmed Elgohary","Matthias Boehm","Peter J. Haas","Frederick R.

The crowd (or workers) have diverse qualities and it is important to effectively model a worker's quality. Most of existing worker models assume that workers have the same quality on different tasks. In practice, however, tasks belong to a variety of diverse domains, and workers have different qualities on different domains. For example, a worker who is a basketball fan should have better quality for the task of labeling a photo related to 'Stephen Curry' than the one related to 'Leonardo DiCaprio'. In this paper, we study how to leverage domain knowledge to accurately model a worker's quality. We examine using knowledge base (KB), e.g., Wikipedia and Freebase, to detect the domains of tasks and workers. We develop Domain Vector Estimation, which analyzes the domains of a task with respect to the KB. We also study Truth Inference, which utilizes the domain-sensitive worker model to accurately infer the true answer of a task. We design an Online Task Assignment algorithm, which judiciously and efficiently assigns tasks to appropriate workers. To implement these solutions, we have built DOCS, a system deployed on the Amazon Mechanical Turk. Experiments show that DOCS performs much better than the state-of-the-art approaches.","author":["Yudian Zheng","Guoliang Li","Reynold Cheng"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 4","November 2016","pp   361\u2013372","https://doi.org/10.14778/3025111.3025118"],"date":"01 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/RequesterUI/amt-ui.pdf.","order":1},{"text":"http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071211155603AAKwtyr.","order":2},{"text":"Amazon mechanical turk. https://www.mturk.com/.","order":3},{"text":"Chinacrowd. http://www.chinacrowds.com.","order":4},{"text":"Y.

This trend is a great opportunity for data-base systems to increase the overall performance if the heterogeneous resources can be utilized efficiently. To achieve this, the main challenge is to place the right work on the right computing unit. Current approaches tackling this placement for query processing assume that data cardinalities of intermediate results can be correctly estimated. However, this assumption does not hold for complex queries. To overcome this problem, we propose an adaptive placement approach being independent of cardinality estimation of intermediate results. Our approach is incorporated in a novel adaptive placement sequence. Additionally, we implement our approach as an extensible virtualization layer, to demonstrate the broad applicability with multiple database systems. In our evaluation, we clearly show that our approach significantly improves OLAP query processing on heterogeneous hardware, while being adaptive enough to react to changing cardinalities of intermediate query results.","author":["Tomas Karnagel","Dirk Habich","Wolfgang Lehner"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 7","March 2017","pp   733\u2013744","https://doi.org/10.14778/3067421.3067423"],"date":"01 March 2017","ref":[{"text":"D.

The goal of this paper is to conduct a rigorous theoretical and experimental analysis of SSA and D-SSA and compare them against the preceding algorithms. In doing so, we uncover inaccuracies in previously reported technical results on the accuracy and efficiency of SSA and D-SSA, which we set right. We also attempt to reproduce the original experiments on SSA and D-SSA, based on which we provide interesting empirical insights. Our evaluation confirms some results reported from the original experiments, but it also reveals anomalies in some other results and sheds light on the behavior of SSA and D-SSA in some important settings not considered previously. We also report on the performance of SSA-Fix, our modification to SSA in order to restore the approximation guarantee that was claimed for but not enjoyed by SSA. Overall, our study suggests that there exist opportunities for further scaling up influence maximization with approximation guarantees.","author":["Keke Huang","Sibo Wang","Glenn Bevilacqua","Xiaokui Xiao","Laks V.

While the database community has attempted to integrate some of these tools in the RDBMS, this has not swayed the trend as existing solutions are often not convenient for the incremental, iterative development approach used in these fields. In this paper, we propose AIDA - an abstraction for advanced in-database analytics. AIDA emulates the syntax and semantics of popular data science packages but transparently executes the required transformations and computations inside the RDBMS. In particular, AIDA works with a regular Python interpreter as a client to connect to the database. Furthermore, it supports the seamless use of both relational and linear algebra operations using a unified abstraction. AIDA relies on the RDBMS engine to efficiently execute relational operations and on an embedded Python interpreter and NumPy to perform linear algebra operations. Data reformatting is done transparently and avoids data copy whenever possible. AIDA does not require changes to statistical packages or the RDBMS facilitating portability.","author":["Joseph Vinish D'silva","Florestan De Moor","Bettina Kemme"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 11","July 2018","pp   1400\u20131413","https://doi.org/10.14778/3236187.3236194"],"date":"01 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"C.

Recent work has shown that CPU stalls due to main memory accesses are a significant source of overhead, even for cache-conscious data structures, and has proposed techniques to reduce this overhead, by hiding memory-stall latency. In this work, we compare and contrast the state-of-the-art approaches to reduce CPU stalls due to cache misses for pointer-intensive data structures. We present an in-depth experimental evaluation and a detailed analysis using four popular data structures: hash table, binary search, Masstree, and Bw-tree. Our focus is on understanding the practicality of using coroutines to improve throughput of such data structures. The implementation, experiments, and analysis presented in this paper promote a deeper understanding of how to exploit coroutines-based approaches to build highly efficient systems.","author":["Christopher Jonathan","Umar Farooq Minhas","James Hunter","Justin Levandoski","Gor Nishanov"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 11","July 2018","pp   1702\u20131714","https://doi.org/10.14778/3236187.3236216"],"date":"01 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"The Clang project. https://clang.llvm.org/.","order":1},{"text":"Coroutines ISO. https://www.iso.org/standard/73008.html.","order":2},{"text":"CppCoro. https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro.","order":3},{"text":"Fibers. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682661.aspx.","order":4},{"text":"Intel 64 and IA-32 architectures optimization reference manual. https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/9e/bc/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf.","order":5},{"text":"Microsoft Visual Studio. https://www.visualstudio.com/.","order":6},{"text":"Programming languages---C++ extensions for coroutines. proposed draft technical specification ISO/IEC DTS 22277 (e). http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4680.pdf.","order":7},{"text":"Redis. https://redis.io/.","order":8},{"text":"A.

While these deep NNs can produce accurate annotations of an object's position and type in video, they are computationally expensive and require complex, imperative deployment code to answer queries. Prior work uses approximate filtering to reduce the cost of video analytics, but does not handle two important classes of queries, aggregation and limit queries; moreover, these approaches still require complex code to deploy. To address the computational and usability challenges of querying video at scale, we introduce BlazeIt, a system that optimizes queries of spatiotemporal information of objects in video. BlazeIt accepts queries via FrameQL, a declarative extension of SQL for video analytics that enables video-specific query optimization. We introduce two new query optimization techniques in BlazeIt that are not supported by prior work. First, we develop methods of using NNs as control variates to quickly answer approximate aggregation queries with error bounds. Second, we present a novel search algorithm for cardinality-limited video queries. Through these these optimizations, BlazeIt can deliver up to 83X speedups over the recent literature on video processing.","author":["Daniel Kang","Peter Bailis","Matei Zaharia"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 13","Issue 4","December 2019","pp   533\u2013546","https://doi.org/10.14778/3372716.3372725"],"date":"09 December 2019","ref":[{"text":"Cornell lab bird cams. http://cams.allaboutbirds.org/.","order":1},{"text":"Cctv: Too many cameras useless, warns surveillance watchdog tony porter, 2015.","order":2},{"text":"S.

The results of the experiments demonstrate that the HDAG Kernel is superior to other kernel functions and baseline methods.","author":["Jun Suzuki","Tsutomu Hirao","Yutaka Sasaki","Eisaku Maeda"],"issue":["ACL '03: Proceedings of the 41st Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics - Volume 1","July 2003","Pages   32\u201339","https://doi.org/10.3115/1075096.1075101"],"date":"07 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"M.

The algorithm, known as a stack decoder, proceeds by continually evaluating one-word extensions of the most promising partial transcriptions of an input utterance. The output is a list of candidate complete transcriptions, ordered by likelihood under a stochastic model. The stochastic model in the current implementation is composed solely of an acoustic component - a linguistic component will soon be added. The acoustic models make use of dictionary phonetic spellings together with models for phonemes in context. The linguistic models will be based on digram statistics.A key component of the system is a module for quickly evaluating a hypothesized partial transcription of an input utterance to determine how likely it is that it will extend to a complete transcription which is the most likely transcription under the model.","author":["Dean G.

For large vocabulary systems requiring cross-word context dependent modelling, this is particularly acute since many such contexts will never occur in the training data. This paper describes a method of creating a tied-state continuous speech recognition system using a phonetic decision tree. This tree-based clustering is shown to lead to similar recognition performance to that obtained using an earlier data-driven approach but to have the additional advantage of providing a mapping for unseen triphones. State-tying is also compared with traditional model-based tying and shown to be clearly superior.

Therefore, we want to transfer learning from the old, general-purpose subtask to a more specific new task, for which there is often less data. While work in transfer learning often considers how the old task should affect learning on the new task, in this paper we show that it helps to take into account how the new task affects the old. Specifically, we perform joint decoding of separately-trained sequence models, preserving uncertainty between the tasks and allowing information from the new task to affect predictions on the old task. On two standard text data sets, we show that joint decoding outperforms cascaded decoding.","author":["Charles Sutton","Andrew McCallum"],"issue":["HLT '05: Proceedings of the conference on Human Language Technology and Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing","October 2005","Pages   748\u2013754","https://doi.org/10.3115/1220575.1220669"],"date":"06 October 2005","ref":[{"text":"Byrd, R.

By identifying and utilizing only the single best disambiguating evidence in a target context, the algorithm avoids the problematic complex modeling of statistical dependencies. Although directly applicable to a wide class of ambiguities, the algorithm is described and evaluated in a realistic case study, the problem of restoring missing accents in Spanish and French text.

Multi-stream HMMs allow the modeling of asynchrony between the audio and visual state sequences at a variety of levels (phone, syllable, word, etc.) and are equivalent to product, or composite, HMMs. In this paper, we consider such models synchronized at the phone boundary level, allowing various degrees of audio and visual state-sequence asynchrony. Furthermore, we investigate joint training of all product HMM parameters, instead of just composing the model from separately trained audio- and visual-only HMMs. We report experiments on a multi-subject connected digit recognition task, as well as on a more complex, speaker-independent large-vocabulary dictation task. Our results demonstrate that in both cases, joint multi-stream HMM training is superior to separate training of single-stream HMMs. In addition, we observe that allowing state-sequence asynchrony between the HMM audio and visual components improves connected digit recognition significantly, however it degrades performance on the dictation task. The resulting multi-stream models dramatically improve speech recognition robustness to noise, by successfully exploiting the visual modality speech information: For example, at 11 dB SNR, they reduce connected digit word error rate from the audio-only 2.3% to 0.77% audio-visual, and, for the large-vocabulary task, from 28.3% to 19.5%. Compared to the audio-only performance at 10 dB SNR, the use of multi-stream HMMs achieves an effective SNR gain of up to 9 dB and 7 dB respectively, for the two recognition tasks considered.","author":["Guillaume Gravier","Gerasimos Potamianos","Chalapathy Neti"],"issue":["HLT '02: Proceedings of the second international conference on Human Language Technology Research","March 2002","Pages   1\u20136"],"date":"24 March 2002","ref":[{"text":"R.
