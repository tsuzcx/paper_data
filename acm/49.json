Recently, new data structures have emerged which may serve as alternative models for both the organization, and presentation, of hypertextual nodes and links. In this paper, we consider zzstructures, mSpaces, and polyarchies from the perspective of graph theory, and compare these models formally. The novel aspects of this work include: providing a sound, graph-theoretic analysis of zzstructures; the identification of a new class of polyarchies associated with mSpaces; and the comparison and classification of these and other structures within a taxonomy. The taxonomy that results from our comparison allows us to consider, first; what the distinct characteristics of each model are at a fundamental level, and second; what model or attributes of a model may be most appropriate for the design goals of a given hypermedia application.","author":["Michael J.

Although near-regular textures are ubiquitous in the man-made and natural world, they present computational challenges for state of the art texture analysis and synthesis algorithms. Using regular tiling as our anchor point, and with user-assisted lattice extraction, we can explicitly model the deformation of a near-regular texture with respect to geometry, lighting and color. We treat a deformation field both as a function that acts on a texture and as a texture that is acted upon, and develop a multi-modal framework where each deformation field is subject to analysis, synthesis and manipulation. Using this formalization, we are able to construct simple parametric models to faithfully synthesize the appearance of a near-regular texture and purposefully control its regularity.","author":["Yanxi Liu","Wen-Chieh Lin","James Hays"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 23","Issue 3","August 2004","pp   368\u2013376","https://doi.org/10.1145/1015706.1015731"],"date":"01 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"ASHIKHMIN, M. 2001.

The goal is to simplify the process of finding not only highly cited clusters of scientific articles, but also pivotal points and trails that are likely to characterize fundamental transitions of a knowledge domain as a whole. The trails of an advancing research field are captured through a sequence of snapshots of its intellectual structure over time in the form of Pathfinder networks. These networks are subsequently merged with a localized pruning algorithm. Pivotal points in the merged network are algorithmically identified and visualized using the betweenness centrality metric. An example of finding clinical evidence associated with reducing risks of heart diseases is included to illustrate how CiteSpace could be used. The contribution of the work is its integration of various change detection algorithms and interactive visualization capabilities to simply users' tasks.","author":["Chaomei Chen"],"issue":["IUI '05: Proceedings of the 10th international conference on Intelligent user interfaces","January 2005","Pages   98\u2013105","https://doi.org/10.1145/1040830.1040859"],"date":"10 January 2005","ref":[{"text":"Bradshaw, S., Scheinkman, A. and Hammond, K.

It currently takes approximately 50 to 200 person years from architecture definition to tape-out for a new FPGA family. Such a lengthy development time is necessary because the process is primarily done manually. Simplifying and shortening the design process would be advantageous since it could reduce the time to market for new FPGAs while also enhancing architecture explorations. One way to accomplish this is through automation and, in this paper, we describe our efforts to automate the entire process by making use of a previously developed set of tools that assist in the creation of the repeatable FPGA tile [25]. Our aim is to demonstrate the feasibility of a CAD flow that uses an input FPGA architecture description to generate a layout that can be sent for fabrication. We prove the feasibility of this proposition by actually designing and fabricating a complete FPGA. Initial functional testing of the FPGA appears promising but is inconclusive at this time. Through this architecture to layout process, we investigate the issues that are faced in the architecture selection, circuit design, layout and verification of such an automatically produced FPGA. We found that there are significant savings in design time. As well, we demonstrate that we can produce a layout using automated tools that is only 36% larger than a commercial FPGA device layout. Given the significant time savings and the relatively minor area penalty, we feel that this work demonstrates that automated layout of FPGAs is practical and advantageous.","author":["Ian Kuon","Aaron Egier","Jonathan Rose"],"issue":["FPGA '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/SIGDA 13th international symposium on Field-programmable gate arrays","February 2005","Pages   215\u2013226","https://doi.org/10.1145/1046192.1046220"],"date":"20 February 2005","ref":[{"text":"E.

In addition, such a result page often also contains information irrelevant to the query, such as information related to the hosting site of the search engine and advertisements. In this paper, we present a technique for automatically producing wrappers that can be used to extract search result records from dynamically generated result pages returned by search engines. Automatic search result record extraction is very important for many applications that need to interact with search engines such as automatic construction and maintenance of metasearch engines and deep Web crawling. The novel aspect of the proposed technique is that it utilizes both the visual content features on the result page as displayed on a browser and the HTML tag structures of the HTML source file of the result page.

Future nano-architectures will confront devices and interconnections with a large number of inherent defects, which motivates the search for new architectural paradigms. In this paper, we examine probabilistic-based design methodologies for nanoscale computer architectures based onMarkov random fields (MRF). The MRF approach can express arbitrary logic circuits and the logic operation is achieved by maximizing the probability of correct state configurations in the logic network depending on the interaction of neighboring circuit nodes. The computation proceeds via probabilistic propagation of states through the circuit. Crucially, the MRF logic can be implemented in modified CMOS-based circuitry that trades off circuit area and operation speed for the crucial fault tolerance and noise immunity. This paper builds on the recent demonstration that significant immunity to faulty individual devices or dynamically occurring signal errors can be achieved by the propagation of state probabilities over an MRF network. In particular, we are interested in CMOS-based circuits that work reliably at very low supply voltages (VDD=0.1-0.2 V), where standard CMOS would fail due to thermal and crosstalk noise, and transistor threshold variation. In this paper, we present results for simulated probabilistic test circuits for elementary logic components and well as small circuits taken from the MCNC91 benchmark suite and we show greatly improved noise immunity operating at very low VDD. The MRF framework extends to all levels of a design, where formally optimum probabilistic computation can be implemented as a natural element of the processing structure.","author":["K. Nepal","R. I.

The L2 cache is organized as a non-uniform cache architecture (NUCA) array with a switched network embedded in it for high performance. We show that this organization can support the spectrum of degrees of sharing: unshared, in which each processor has a private portion of the cache, thus reducing hit latency, completely shared, in which every processor shares the entire cache, thus minimizing misses, and every point in between. We find the optimal degree of sharing for a number of cache bank mapping policies, and also evaluate a per-application cache partitioning strategy. We conclude that a static NUCA organization with sharing degrees of two or four work best across a suite of commercial and scientific parallel workloads. We also demonstrate that migratory, dynamic NUCA approaches improve performance significantly for a subset of the workloads at the cost of increased power consumption and complexity, especially as per-application cache partitioning strategies are applied.","author":["Jaehyuk Huh","Changkyu Kim","Hazim Shafi","Lixin Zhang","Doug Burger","Stephen W.

The basic versions of these codes are called KINSOL, CVODE, and IDA, respectively. The codes are written in ANSI standard C and are suitable for either serial or parallel machine environments. Common and notable features of these codes include inexact Newton-Krylov methods for solving large-scale nonlinear systems; linear multistep methods for time-dependent problems; a highly modular structure to allow incorporation of different preconditioning and/or linear solver methods; and clear interfaces allowing for users to provide their own data structures underneath the solvers. We describe the current capabilities of the codes, along with some of the algorithms and heuristics used to achieve efficiency and robustness. We also describe how the codes stem from previous and widely used Fortran 77 solvers, and how the codes have been augmented with forward and adjoint methods for carrying out first-order sensitivity analysis with respect to model parameters or initial conditions.","author":["Alan C.

We were designing the Piranha system,1 which was a radical point in the CMP design space in that we used very simple cores (similar to the early RISC designs of the late \u201980s) to provide a higher level of thread-level parallelism. Our main goal was to achieve the best commercial workload performance for a given silicon budget. Today, in developing Google\u2019s computing infrastructure, our focus is broader than performance alone. The merits of a particular architecture are measured by answering the following question: Are you able to afford the computational capacity you need? The high-computational demands that are inherent in most of Google\u2019s services have led us to develop a deep understanding of the overall cost of computing, and continually to look for hardware/software designs that optimize performance per unit of cost.","author":["Luiz Andr\u00e9 Barroso"],"issue":["Queue","Volume 3","Issue 7","September 2005","pp   48\u201353","https://doi.org/10.1145/1095408.1095420"],"date":"01 September 2005","ref":[{"text":"Barroso, L.

One can compare the cost of conservative garbage collection to explicit memory management in C/C++ programs by linking in an appropriate collector. This kind of direct comparison is not possible for languages designed for garbage collection (e.g., Java), because programs in these languages naturally do not contain calls to free. Thus, the actual gap between the time and space performance of explicit memory management and precise, copying garbage collection remains unknown.We introduce a novel experimental methodology that lets us quantify the performance of precise garbage collection versus explicit memory management. Our system allows us to treat unaltered Java programs as if they used explicit memory management by relying on oracles to insert calls to free. These oracles are generated from profile information gathered in earlier application runs. By executing inside an architecturally-detailed simulator, this \"oracular\" memory manager eliminates the effects of consulting an oracle while measuring the costs of calling malloc and free. We evaluate two different oracles: a liveness-based oracle that aggressively frees objects immediately after their last use, and a reachability-based oracle that conservatively frees objects just after they are last reachable. These oracles span the range of possible placement of explicit deallocation calls.We compare explicit memory management to both copying and non-copying garbage collectors across a range of benchmarks using the oracular memory manager, and present real (non-simulated) runs that lend further validity to our results. These results quantify the time-space tradeoff of garbage collection: with five times as much memory, an Appel-style generational collector with a non-copying mature space matches the performance of reachability-based explicit memory management. With only three times as much memory, the collector runs on average 17% slower than explicit memory management. However, with only twice as much memory, garbage collection degrades performance by nearly 70%. When physical memory is scarce, paging causes garbage collection to run an order of magnitude slower than explicit memory management.","author":["Matthew Hertz","Emery D.

The problem can be formulated as that of packing a given set of 3-D rectangular blocks while minimizing a suitable cost function. Our algorithm is based on a generalization of the classical 2-D slicing floorplans to 3-D slicing floorplans. A new encoding scheme of slicing floorplans (2-D/3-D) and its associated set of moves form the basis of the new simulated annealing based algorithm. The bestknown algorithm for packing 3-D rectangular blocks is based on simulated annealing using sequence-triple floorplan representation. Experimental results show that our algorithm produces packing results on average 3% better than the sequence-triple-based algorithm under the same annealing parameters, and our algorithm runs much faster (17 times for problems containing 100 blocks) than the sequence-triple. Moreover, our algorithm can be extended to consider various types of placement constraints and thermal distribution while the existing sequence-triple-based algorithm does not have such capabilities. Finally, when specializing to 2-D problems, our algorithm is a new 2-D slicing floorplanning algorithm. We are excited to report the surprising results that our new 2-D floorplanner has produced slicing floorplans for the two largest MCNC benchmarks ami33 and ami49 which have the smallest areas (among all slicing/nonslicing floorplanning algorithms) ever reported in the literature.","author":["Lei Cheng","Liang Deng","Martin D.

Because these statistics are often computed on a relatively small evaluation corpus, we believe using larger, non-evaluation corpora should improve performance. Specifically, we advocate incorporating external corpora based on language modeling. We refer to this process as external expansion. When compared to traditional pseudo-relevance feedback techniques, external expansion is more stable across topics and up to 10% more effective in terms of mean average precision. Our results show that using a high quality corpus that is comparable to the evaluation corpus can be as, if not more, effective than using the web. Our results also show that external expansion outperforms simulated relevance feedback. In addition, we propose a method for predicting the extent to which external expansion will improve retrieval performance. Our new measure demonstrates positive correlation with improvements in mean average precision.","author":["Fernando Diaz","Donald Metzler"],"issue":["SIGIR '06: Proceedings of the 29th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval","August 2006","Pages   154\u2013161","https://doi.org/10.1145/1148170.1148200"],"date":"06 August 2006","ref":[{"text":"J.

Existing dynamic power management policies usually take conservative approaches to save disk energy, and disk energy consumption remains a serious issue. Meanwhile, the flash drive is becoming a must-have portable storage device for almost every laptop user on travel. In this paper, we propose to make another highly desired use of the flash drive --- saving disk energy. This is achieved by using the flash drive as a standby buffer for caching and prefetching disk data. Our design significantly extends disk idle times with careful and deliberate consideration of the particular characteristics of the flash drive. Trace-driven simulations show that up to 41% of disk energy can be saved with a relatively small amount of data written to the flash drive.","author":["Feng Chen","Song Jiang","Xiaodong Zhang"],"issue":["ISLPED '06: Proceedings of the 2006 international symposium on Low power electronics and design","October 2006","Pages   412\u2013417","https://doi.org/10.1145/1165573.1165674"],"date":"04 October 2006","ref":[{"text":"T.

Our proposed architecture, PicoServer, employs 3D technology to bond one die containing several simple slow processing cores to multiple DRAM dies sufficient for a primary memory. The 3D technology also enables wide low-latency buses between processors and memory. These remove the need for an L2 cache allowing its area to be re-allocated to additional simple cores. The additional cores allow the clock frequency to be lowered without impairing throughput. Lower clock frequency in turn reduces power and means that thermal constraints, a concern with 3D stacking, are easily satisfied.The PicoServer architecture specifically targets Tier 1 server applications, which exhibit a high degree of thread level parallelism. An architecture targeted to efficient throughput is ideal for this application domain. We find for a similar logic die area, a 12 CPU system with 3D stacking and no L2 cache outperforms an 8 CPU system with a large on-chip L2 cache by about 14% while consuming 55% less power. In addition, we show that a PicoServer performs comparably to a Pentium 4-like class machine while consuming only about 1/10 of the power, even when conservative assumptions are made about the power consumption of the PicoServer.","author":["Taeho Kgil","Shaun D'Souza","Ali Saidi","Nathan Binkert","Ronald Dreslinski","Trevor Mudge","Steven Reinhardt","Krisztian Flautner"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 41","Issue 11","November 2006","pp   117\u2013128","https://doi.org/10.1145/1168918.1168873"],"date":"20 October 2006","ref":[{"text":"ARM 11 MPcore. http://www.arm.com/products/CPUs/ARM11MPCoreMultiprocessor.html.","order":1},{"text":"Evolution of network memory. http://www.jedex.org/images/pdf/jack_troung_samsung.pdf.","order":2},{"text":"FaStack 3D RISC super-8051 microcontroller. http://www.tachyonsemi.com/OtherICs/datasheets/TSCR8051Lx_1_5Web.pdf.","order":3},{"text":"The Micron system-power calculator. http://www.micron.com/products/dram/syscalc.html.","order":4},{"text":"National semiconductor DP83820 10 / 100 / 1000 Mb/s PCI ethernet network interface controller.","order":5},{"text":"Predictive technology model. http://www.eas.asu.edu/~ptm.","order":6},{"text":"(LS)3-libre streaming, libre software, libre standards an open multimedia streaming project. http://streaming.polito.it/.","order":7},{"text":"RLDRAM memory. http://www.micron.com/products/dram/rldram/.","order":8},{"text":"SPECweb99 benchmark. http://www.spec.org/osg/web99/.","order":9},{"text":"Sun Fire T2000 Server Power Calculator. http://www.sun.com/servers/coolthreads/t2000/calc/index.jsp.","order":10},{"text":"ITRS roadmap.

A hierarchical \"beam\" structure serves as a proxy for a collection of rays. It is tested against a kd-tree representing the overall scene in order to discard from consideration the sub-set of the kd-tree (and hence the scene) that is guaranteed not to intersect with any possible ray inside the beam. This allows for all the rays inside the beam to start traversing the tree from some node deep inside thus eliminating unnecessary operations. The original beam can be further sub-divided, and we can either continue looking for new optimal entry points for the sub-beams, or we can decompose the beam into individual rays. This is a hierarchical process that can be adapted to the geometrical complexity of a particular view direction allowing for efficient geometric anti-aliasing. By amortizing the cost of partially traversing the tree for all the rays in a beam, up to an order of magnitude performance improvement can be achieved enabling interactivity for complex scenes on ordinary desktop machines.","author":["Alexander Reshetov","Alexei Soupikov","Jim Hurley"],"issue":["SIGGRAPH '05: ACM SIGGRAPH 2005 Papers","July 2005","Pages   1176\u20131185","https://doi.org/10.1145/1186822.1073329"],"date":"01 July 2005","ref":[{"text":"Amanatides, J. 1984.

When developers perform program maintenance tasks, they often waste time and effort locating and understanding these scattered concerns. We have developed a semi-automated concern location and comprehension tool, Find-Concept, designed to reduce the time developers spend on maintenance tasks and to increase their confidence in the results of these tasks. Find-Concept is effective because it searches a unique natural language-based representation of source code, uses novel techniques to expand initial queries into more effective queries, and displays search results in an easy-to-comprehend format. We describe the Find-Concept tool, the underlying program analysis, and an experimental study comparing Find-Concept's search effectiveness with two state-of-the-art lexical and information retrieval-based search tools. Across nine action-oriented concern location tasks derived from open source bug reports, our Eclipse-based tool produced more effective queries more consistently than either competing search tool with similar user effort.","author":["David Shepherd","Zachary P.

We observe the propagation of recommendations and the cascade sizes, which we explain by a simple stochastic model. We analyze how user behavior varies within user communities defined by a recommendation network. Product purchases follow a \u2018long tail\u2019 where a significant share of purchases belongs to rarely sold items. We establish how the recommendation network grows over time and how effective it is from the viewpoint of the sender and receiver of the recommendations. While on average recommendations are not very effective at inducing purchases and do not spread very far, we present a model that successfully identifies communities, product, and pricing categories for which viral marketing seems to be very effective.","author":["Jure Leskovec","Lada A.

Another influence is the trend towards longer or more complex transactions. A possible consequence is substantially more data contention, which could limit total achievable throughput. In particular, it is known that the usual locking method of concurrency control is not well suited to environments where data contention is a significant factor.Here we consider a number of concurrency control concepts and transaction scheduling techniques that are applicable to high contention environments, and that do not rely on database semantics to reduce contention. These include access invariance and its application to prefetching of data, approximations to essential blocking such as wait depth limited scheduling, and phase dependent control. The performance of various concurrency control methods based on these concepts are studied using detailed simulation models. The results indicate that the new techniques can offer substantial benefits for systems with high levels of data contention.","author":["Peter A. Franaszek","John T.

Building on dynamic synthesis for single-processor single-thread systems, known as warp processing, thread warping improves performances of multiprocessor systems by speeding up individual threads and by allowing more threads to execute concurrently. Furthermore, thread warping maintains the important separation of function from architecture, enabling portability of applications to architectures with different quantities of microprocessors and FPGA.an advantage not shared by static compilation/synthesis approaches. We introduce a framework of architecture, CAD tools, and operating system that together support thread warping. We summarize experiments on an extensive architectural simulation framework we developed, showing application speedups of 4x to 502x, averaging 130x compared to a multiprocessor system having four ARM11 microprocessors, for eight benchmark applications. Even compared to a 64-processor system, thread warping achieves 11x speedup.","author":["Greg Stitt","Frank Vahid"],"issue":["CODES+ISSS '07: Proceedings of the 5th IEEE/ACM international conference on Hardware/software codesign and system synthesis","September 2007","Pages   93\u201398","https://doi.org/10.1145/1289816.1289841"],"date":"30 September 2007","ref":[{"text":"Amerson, R., Carter, R., Culbertson, W., Kuekes, P., Snider, G., and Albertson, L.

We introduce and motivate a new training principle for unsupervised learning of a representation based on the idea of making the learned representations robust to partial corruption of the input pattern. This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite.","author":["Pascal Vincent","Hugo Larochelle","Yoshua Bengio","Pierre-Antoine Manzagol"],"issue":["ICML '08: Proceedings of the 25th international conference on Machine learning","July 2008","Pages   1096\u20131103","https://doi.org/10.1145/1390156.1390294"],"date":"05 July 2008","ref":[{"text":"Bengio, Y.

We build on a recently proposed framework for distance metric learning known as large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) classification. Our paper makes three contributions. First, we describe a highly efficient solver for the particular instance of semidefinite programming that arises in LMNN classification; our solver can handle problems with billions of large margin constraints in a few hours. Second, we show how to reduce both training and testing times using metric ball trees; the speedups from ball trees are further magnified by learning low dimensional representations of the input space. Third, we show how to learn different Mahalanobis distance metrics in different parts of the input space. For large data sets, the use of locally adaptive distance metrics leads to even lower error rates.","author":["Kilian Q. Weinberger","Lawrence K.

However, NAND flash-based storage is still suffering from serious performance degradation for random or small size write access. This degradation mainly comes from the physical constraints of NAND flash: erase-before-program and different unit size of erase and program operations. To overcome these constraints, we propose to use PRAM (Phase-change RAM) which supports advanced features: fast byte access capability and no requirement for erase-before-program. In this paper, we focus on developing a high-performance NAND flash-based storage system by maximally exploiting the advanced feature of PRAM, in terms of performance and wearing out. To do this, we first propose a new hybrid storage architecture which consists of PRAM and NAND flash. Second, we devise two novel software schemes for the proposed hybrid storage architecture; FSMS (File System Metadata Separation) and hFTL (hybrid Flash Translation Layer). Finally, we demonstrate that our hybrid architecture increases the performance up to 290% and doubles the lifespan compared to the existing NAND flash only storage systems.","author":["Jin Kyu Kim","Hyung Gyu Lee","Shinho Choi","Kyoung Il Bahng"],"issue":["EMSOFT '08: Proceedings of the 8th ACM international conference on Embedded software","October 2008","Pages   31\u201340","https://doi.org/10.1145/1450058.1450064"],"date":"19 October 2008","ref":[{"text":"R.

We present a novel architecture capable of tracking all information flow within the machine, including all explicit data transfers and all implicit flows (those subtly devious flows caused by not performing conditional operations). While the problem is impossible to solve in the general case, we have created a machine that avoids the general-purpose programmability that leads to this impossibility result, yet is still programmable enough to handle a variety of critical operations such as public-key encryption and authentication. Through the application of our novel gate-level information flow tracking method, we show how all flows of information can be precisely tracked. From this foundation, we then describe how a class of architectures can be constructed, from the gates up, to completely capture all information flows and we measure the impact of doing so on the hardware implementation, the ISA, and the programmer.","author":["Mohit Tiwari","Hassan M.G.

The object of this game is to clear all edges of a contaminated graph. Clearing is achieved by moving searchers, a kind of token, along the edges of the graph according to clearing rules. Certain search strategies cause edges that have been cleared to become contaminated again. Megiddo et al. [9] conjectured that every graph can be searched using a minimum number of searchers without this recontamination occurring, that is, without clearing any edge twice. In this paper, this conjecture is proved. This places the graph-searching problem in NP, completing the proof by Megiddo et al. that the graph-searching problem is NP-complete. Furthermore, by eliminating the need to consider recontamination, this result simplifies the analysis of searcher requirements with respect to other properties of graphs.","author":["Andrea S.

These (re-)configuring, troubleshooting, and in general maintenance tasks lead to costly and time-consuming procedures during the operating phase. These problems are primarily due to the open-loop structure often followed in software development. Therefore, there is a high demand for management complexity reduction, management automation, robustness, and achieving all of the desired quality requirements within a reasonable cost and time range during operation. Self-adaptive software is a response to these demands; it is a closed-loop system with a feedback loop aiming to adjust itself to changes during its operation. These changes may stem from the software system's self (internal causes, e.g., failure) or context (external events, e.g., increasing requests from users). Such a system is required to monitor itself and its context, detect significant changes, decide how to react, and act to execute such decisions. These processes depend on adaptation properties (called self-* properties), domain characteristics (context information or models), and preferences of stakeholders. Noting these requirements, it is widely believed that new models and frameworks are needed to design self-adaptive software. This survey article presents a taxonomy, based on concerns of adaptation, that is, how, what, when and where, towards providing a unified view of this emerging area. Moreover, as adaptive systems are encountered in many disciplines, it is imperative to learn from the theories and models developed in these other areas. This survey article presents a landscape of research in self-adaptive software by highlighting relevant disciplines and some prominent research projects. This landscape helps to identify the underlying research gaps and elaborates on the corresponding challenges.","author":["Mazeiar Salehie","Ladan Tahvildari"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems","Volume 4","Issue 2","May 2009","Article No.: 14","pp   1\u201342","https://doi.org/10.1145/1516533.1516538"],"date":"21 May 2009","ref":[{"text":"Abdelwahed, S., Kandasamy, N., and Neema, S. 2004.

The main source of complexity is that, the threads of an application can interleave in so many different ways. To ensure correctness, a programmer has to test all possible thread interleavings, which, however, is impractical.Many rare thread interleavings remain untested in production systems, and they are the root cause for a majority of concurrency bugs. We propose a shared-memory multi-processor design that avoids untested interleavings to improve the correctness of a multi-threaded program. Since untested interleavings tend to occur infrequently at runtime, the performance cost of avoiding them is not high.We propose to encode the set of tested correct interleavings in a program's binary executable using Predecessor Set (PSet) constraints. These constraints are efficiently enforced at runtime using processor support, which ensures that the runtime follows a tested interleaving. We analyze several bugs in open source applications such as MySQL, Apache, Mozilla, etc., and show that, by enforcing PSet constraints, we can avoid not only data races and atomicity violations, but also other forms of concurrency bugs.","author":["Jie Yu","Satish Narayanasamy"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 37","Issue 3","June 2009","pp   325\u2013336","https://doi.org/10.1145/1555815.1555796"],"date":"20 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"]]The open source database benchmark. http://osdb.sourceforge.net/.","order":1},{"text":"]]C.

This will lead to increasing power consumption in the memory system. Therefore, it is critical to address the power issue in the memory subsystem. In designing a power-aware memory system, due to the interplay among power, thermal and performance, all the three factors need to be taken into account. In this paper, we propose the first joint performance, power and thermal management framework (PPT) through orchestrating task execution and page allocation.

Since most of these applications run on handheld devices, there is an increasing need for a single chip solution that can dynamically interoperate between different standards and their derivatives. In order to achieve high resource utilization and low power dissipation, we propose REDEFINE, a polymorphic ASIC in which specialized hardware units are replaced with basic hardware units that can create the same functionality by runtime re-composition. It is a \u201cfuture-proof\u201d custom hardware solution for multiple applications and their derivatives in a domain. In this article, we describe a compiler framework and supporting hardware comprising compute, storage, and communication resources.Applications described in high-level language (e.g., C) are compiled into application substructures. For each application substructure, a set of compute elements on the hardware are interconnected during runtime to form a pattern that closely matches the communication pattern of that particular application. The advantage is that the bounded CEs are neither processor cores nor logic elements as in FPGAs. Hence, REDEFINE offers the power and performance advantage of an ASIC and the hardware reconfigurability and programmability of that of an FPGA/instruction set processor.In addition, the hardware supports custom instruction pipelining. Existing instruction-set extensible processors determine a sequence of instructions that repeatedly occur within the application to create custom instructions at design time to speed up the execution of this sequence. We extend this scheme further, where a kernel is compiled into custom instructions that bear strong producer-consumer relationship (and not limited to frequently occurring sequences of instructions). Custom instructions, realized as hardware compositions effected at runtime, allow several instances of the same to be active in parallel. A key distinguishing factor in majority of the emerging embedded applications is stream processing. To reduce the overheads of data transfer between custom instructions, direct communication paths are employed among custom instructions.In this article, we present the overview of the hardware-aware compiler framework, which determines the NoC-aware schedule of transports of the data exchanged between the custom instructions on the interconnect. The results for the FFT kernel indicate a 25% reduction in the number of loads/stores, and throughput improves by log(n) for n-point FFT when compared to sequential implementation. Overall, REDEFINE offers flexibility and a runtime reconfigurability at the expense of 1.16\u00d7 in power and 8\u00d7 in area when compared to an ASIC. REDEFINE implementation consumes 0.1\u00d7 the power of an FPGA implementation. In addition, the configuration overhead of the FPGA implementation is 1,000\u00d7 more than that of REDEFINE.","author":["Mythri Alle","Keshavan Varadarajan","Alexander Fell","Ramesh Reddy C.","Nimmy Joseph","Saptarsi Das","Prasenjit Biswas","Jugantor Chetia","Adarsh Rao","S.

The result of the indexing procedure is a vector in which some of the terms represent word senses instead of word stems. Retrieval experiments comparing the effectivenss of these sense-based vectors vs. stem-based vectors show the stem-based vectors to be superior overall, although the sense-based vectors do improve the performance of some queries. The overall degradation is due in large part to the difficulty of disambiguating senses in short query statements. An analysis of these results suggests two conclusions: the IS-A links define a generalization/specialization hierarchy that is not sufficient to reliably select the correct sense of a noun from the set of fine sense distinctions in WordNet; and missing correct matches because of incorrect sense resolution has a much more deleterious effect on retrieval performance than does making spurious matches.","author":["Ellen M.

Once the data has been transferred from the source to the target, a natural question is whether one can undo the process and recover the initial data, or at least part of it. In fact, it would be desirable to find a reverse schema mapping from target to source that specifies how to bring the exchanged data back.In this article, we introduce the notion of a recovery of a schema mapping: it is a reverse mapping, M\u2032 for a mapping M, that recovers sound data with respect to M. We further introduce an order relation on recoveries. This allows us to choose mappings that recover the maximum amount of sound information. We call such mappings maximum recoveries. We study maximum recoveries in detail, providing a necessary and sufficient condition for their existence. In particular, we prove that maximum recoveries exist for the class of mappings specified by FO-to-CQ source-to-target dependencies. This class subsumes the class of source-to-target tuple-generating dependencies used in previous work on data exchange. For the class of mappings specified by FO-to-CQ dependencies, we provide an exponential-time algorithm for computing maximum recoveries, and a simplified version for full dependencies that works in quadratic time. We also characterize the language needed to express maximum recoveries, and we include a detailed comparison with the notion of inverse (and quasi-inverse) mapping previously proposed in the data exchange literature. In particular, we show that maximum recoveries strictly generalize inverses. We finally study the complexity of some decision problems related to the notions of recovery and maximum recovery.","author":["Marcelo Arenas","Jorge P\u00e9rez","Cristian Riveros"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Database Systems","Volume 34","Issue 4","December 2009","Article No.: 22","pp   1\u201348","https://doi.org/10.1145/1620585.1620589"],"date":"14 December 2009","ref":[{"text":"Abiteboul, S. and Duschka, O.

The PRAM has long been acknowledged to be a useful tool for the study of parallel computing, but unfortunately it is not physically implementable in hardware. In order to take advantage of the broad base of algorithms and results regarding this high-level abstraction one needs general methods for allowing the execution of PRAM algorithms on more realistic machines. In the following we survey these methods, which we refer to as PRAM simulation techniques. The general issues of memory management and routing are discussed, and both randomized and deterministic solutions are considered. We show that good theoretical solutions to many of the subproblems in PRAM simulation have been developed, though questions still exist as to their practical utility. This article should allow those performing research in this field to become well acquainted with the current state of the art, while allowing the novice to get an intuitive feeling for the fundamental questions being considered. The introduction should provide a concise tutorial for those unfamiliar with the problem of PRAM simulation.","author":["Tim J.

In addition, traffic is getting more concentrated to points such as data centers, and demand for protecting such high-speed networks from attack traffic is increasing. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) with Regular Expression (RegEx) detection is the de facto defense mechanism agains network intrusions. However, current RegEx detection systems cannot keep up with the upcoming high-speed line rate. The RegExes consist of three types of components, exact strings, character classes (CC), and repetitions. Exact string and repetition matching have been widely studied by RegEx research community for better performance. Yet, although more than 55% of RegExes in Snort signature set contain at least one CC, hardware based solutions that focus on CC detection is limited. In this paper we propose a new CC detection architecture called Range Hash that is suitable for high-speed, compact CC detection. Additionally, we propose a practical application of the Range Hash architecture where it can be used as a pre-filter for a Regular Expression detection system to increase overall RegEx detection performance. Based on our hardware prototype design which runs at 250MHz, Range Hash can reach to 100-Gbps CC detection throughput with today's FPGA chips.","author":["Masanori Bando","N.

In this paper we present an innovative design for the operation of such ad-hoc networks. The basic idea of the design is to operate each Mobile Host as a specialized router, which periodically advertises its view of the interconnection topology with other Mobile Hosts within the network. This amounts to a new sort of routing protocol. We have investigated modifications to the basic Bellman-Ford routing mechanisms, as specified by RIP [5], to make it suitable for a dynamic and self-starting network mechanism as is required by users wishing to utilize ad hoc networks. Our modifications address some of the previous  objections  to the use of Bellman-Ford, related to the poor looping properties of such algorithms in the face of broken links and the resulting time dependent nature of the interconnection topology describing the links between the Mobile Hosts. Finally, we describe the ways in which the basic network-layer routing can be modified to provide MAC-layer support for ad-hoc networks.","author":["Charles E.

A key technology to ensure that physical human robot interaction is safe is to monitor contact forces by providing the robot with a tactile sensor as an artificial skin. This paper introduces a pressure sensitive skin that can be adapted to complex geometries and offers reliable contact measurements on the entire robot body. Equipped with integrated cushioning elements the sensitive skin can reduce the risk of dangerous injuries in physical human-robot interaction. Beside safety related functions, the sensitive skin offers touch based robot motion control which simplifies human-robot interaction.","author":["Markus Fritzsche","Norbert Elkmann","Erik Schulenburg"],"issue":["HRI '11: Proceedings of the 6th international conference on Human-robot interaction","March 2011","Pages   139\u2013140","https://doi.org/10.1145/1957656.1957700"],"date":"06 March 2011","ref":[{"text":"H.

These memory devices enable fast user-mode access to persistence, allowing regular in-memory data structures to survive system crashes.In this paper, we present Mnemosyne, a simple interface for programming with persistent memory. Mnemosyne addresses two challenges: how to create and manage such memory, and how to ensure consistency in the presence of failures. Without additional mechanisms, a system failure may leave data structures in SCM in an invalid state, crashing the program the next time it starts.In Mnemosyne, programmers declare global persistent data with the keyword \"pstatic\" or allocate it dynamically. Mnemosyne provides primitives for directly modifying persistent variables and supports consistent updates through a lightweight transaction mechanism. Compared to past work on disk-based persistent memory, Mnemosyne reduces latency to storage by writing data directly to memory at the granularity of an update rather than writing memory pages back to disk through the file system. In tests emulating the performance characteristics of forthcoming SCMs, we show that Mnemosyne can persist data as fast as 3 microseconds. Furthermore, it provides a 35 percent performance increase when applied in the OpenLDAP directory server. In microbenchmark studies we find that Mnemosyne can be up to 1400% faster than alternative persistence strategies, such as Berkeley DB or Boost serialization, that are designed for disks.","author":["Haris Volos","Andres Jaan Tack","Michael M.

The failure of Dennard scaling, to which the shift to multicore parts is partially a response, may soon limit multicore scaling just as single-core scaling has been curtailed. This paper models multicore scaling limits by combining device scaling, single-core scaling, and multicore scaling to measure the speedup potential for a set of parallel workloads for the next five technology generations. For device scaling, we use both the ITRS projections and a set of more conservative device scaling parameters. To model single-core scaling, we combine measurements from over 150 processors to derive Pareto-optimal frontiers for area/performance and power/performance. Finally, to model multicore scaling, we build a detailed performance model of upper-bound performance and lower-bound core power. The multicore designs we study include single-threaded CPU-like and massively threaded GPU-like multicore chip organizations with symmetric, asymmetric, dynamic, and composed topologies. The study shows that regardless of chip organization and topology, multicore scaling is power limited to a degree not widely appreciated by the computing community. Even at 22 nm (just one year from now), 21% of a fixed-size chip must be powered off, and at 8 nm, this number grows to more than 50%. Through 2024, only 7.9x average speedup is possible across commonly used parallel workloads, leaving a nearly 24-fold gap from a target of doubled performance per generation.","author":["Hadi Esmaeilzadeh","Emily Blem","Renee St. Amant","Karthikeyan Sankaralingam","Doug Burger"],"issue":["ISCA '11: Proceedings of the 38th annual international symposium on Computer architecture","June 2011","Pages   365\u2013376","https://doi.org/10.1145/2000064.2000108"],"date":"04 June 2011","ref":[{"text":"G.

Providing a single virtual compute device image to the user makes an OpenCL application written for a single GPU portable to the platform that has multiple GPU devices. It also makes the application exploit full computing power of the multiple GPU devices and the total amount of GPU memories available in the platform. Our OpenCL framework automatically distributes at run-time the OpenCL kernel written for a single GPU into multiple CUDA kernels that execute on the multiple GPU devices. It applies a run-time memory access range analysis to the kernel by performing a sampling run and identifies an optimal workload distribution for the kernel. To achieve a single compute device image, the runtime maintains virtual device memory that is allocated in the main memory. The OpenCL runtime treats the memory as if it were the memory of a single GPU device and keeps it consistent to the memories of the multiple GPU devices. Our OpenCL-C-to-C translator generates the sampling code from the OpenCL kernel code and OpenCL-C-to-CUDA-C translator generates the CUDA kernel code for the distributed OpenCL kernel. We show the effectiveness of our OpenCL framework by implementing the OpenCL runtime and two source-to-source translators. We evaluate its performance with a system that contains 8 GPUs using 11 OpenCL benchmark applications.","author":["Jungwon Kim","Honggyu Kim","Joo Hwan Lee","Jaejin Lee"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 46","Issue 8","August 2011","pp   277\u2013288","https://doi.org/10.1145/2038037.1941591"],"date":"12 February 2011","ref":[{"text":"ATI Stream Software Development Ket (SDK) v2.1.

The emerging trend of social networking sites and their accommodation in other sites like e-commerce can potentially help alleviate the sparsity problem with their provided social relation data. In this paper, we have particularly explored a new kind of social relation, the membership, and its combined effect with friendship. The two type of heterogeneous social relations are fused into the CF recommender via a factorization process. Due to the two relations' respective properties, we adopt different fusion strategies: regularization was leveraged for friendship and collective matrix factorization (CMF) was proposed for incorporating membership. We further developed a unified model to combine the two relations together and tested it with real large-scale datasets at five sparsity levels. The experiment has not only revealed the significant effect of the two relations, especially the membership, in augmenting recommendation accuracy in the sparse data condition, but also identified the ability of our fusing model in achieving the desired fusion performance.","author":["Quan Yuan","Li Chen","Shiwan Zhao"],"issue":["RecSys '11: Proceedings of the fifth ACM conference on Recommender systems","October 2011","Pages   245\u2013252","https://doi.org/10.1145/2043932.2043975"],"date":"23 October 2011","ref":[{"text":"N.

Yet, some processor architectures of choice for DSP and media applications, such as wide-issue VLIW processors, remain impractical: the multi-ported register file makes a very inefficient use of the resources in the FPGA fabric. This paper proposes modifications to existing FPGAs to make soft-VLIW processor viable. We introduce an embedded multi-ported RAM that can be customized to match the issue-width of VLIW processors. To ascertain the benefits of this approach, we map an extensible VLIW processor onto a standard FPGA from Xilinx. For the register file implemented in the modified FPGA, the area occupied is at least 102\u00d7 smaller and the dynamic power is reduced by 41% as compared to the implementation using configurable logic blocks in existing standard FPGAs. A subset of this embedded multi-ported RAM can also be used for mapping the register file in soft-RISC processors. For the soft-RISC processor, the register file in the modified FPGA is at least 22\u00d7 smaller than its equivalent that uses configurable logic blocks and 1.5\u00d7 the size in comparison to the implementation using block RAMs. Reduction of routing area and the maximum net length is about 39% and 51% respectively for RISC processors. As a result, this approach works towards enhancing soft-processor density in FPGAs by orders of magnitude.","author":["Madhura Purnaprajna","Paolo Ienne"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 8","Issue 4","January 2012","Article No.: 33","pp   1\u201316","https://doi.org/10.1145/2086696.2086712"],"date":"26 January 2012","ref":[{"text":"Altera. 2011.

In this paper, we present a Network-on-Chip (NoC) design study from the mindset of NoC as a synthesizable infrastructural element to support emerging System-on-Chip (SoC) applications on FPGAs. To support our study, we developed CONNECT, an NoC generator that can produce synthesizable RTL designs of FPGA-tuned multi-node NoCs of arbitrary topology. The CONNECT NoC architecture embodies a set of FPGA-motivated design principles that uniquely influence key NoC design decisions, such as topology, link width, router pipeline depth, network buffer sizing, and flow control. We evaluate CONNECT against a high-quality publicly available synthesizable RTL-level NoC design intended for ASICs. Our evaluation shows a significant gain in specializing NoC design decisions to FPGAs' unique mapping and operating characteristics. For example, in the case of a 4x4 mesh configuration evaluated using a set of synthetic traffic patterns, we obtain comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-art NoC while reducing logic resource cost by 58%, or alternatively, achieve 3-4x better performance for approximately the same logic resource usage. Finally, to demonstrate CONNECT's flexibility and extensive design space coverage, we also report synthesis and network performance results for several router configurations and for entire CONNECT networks.","author":["Michael K.

Conventional metric-learning methods achieve satisfactory performance on distance metric computation of data in a single-view observation space, but fail to handle well data sampled from multiview observation spaces, especially those with highly nonlinear structure. To tackle this problem, we propose a new method called Multiview Metric Learning with Global consistency and Local smoothness (MVML-GL) under a semisupervised learning setting, which jointly considers global consistency and local smoothness. The basic idea is to reveal the shared latent feature space of the multiview observations by embodying global consistency constraints and preserving local geometric structures. Specifically, this framework is composed of two main steps. In the first step, we seek a global consistent shared latent feature space, which not only preserves the local geometric structure in each space but also makes those labeled corresponding instances as close as possible. In the second step, the explicit mapping functions between the input spaces and the shared latent space are learned via regularized locally linear regression. Furthermore, these two steps both can be solved by convex optimizations in closed form. Experimental results with application to manifold alignment on real-world datasets of pose and facial expression demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","author":["Deming Zhai","Hong Chang","Shiguang Shan","Xilin Chen","Wen Gao"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology","Volume 3","Issue 3","May 2012","Article No.: 53","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/2168752.2168767"],"date":"01 May 2012","ref":[{"text":"2001.

In particular, Multi-Level Cell (MLC) flash memory, which provides a lower cost and higher density solution, has occupied the largest part of NAND flash-memory market share. However, MLC flash memory also introduces new challenges: (1) Pages in a block must be written sequentially. (2) Information to indicate a page being obsoleted cannot be recorded in its spare area due to the limitation on the number of partial programming. Since most of applications access NAND flash memory under FAT file system, this article designs an MLC Flash Translation Layer (MFTL) for flash-memory storage systems which takes constraints of MLC flash memory and access behaviors of FAT file system into consideration. A series of trace-driven simulations was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. Although MFTL is designed for MLC flash memory and FAT file system, it is applicable to SLC flash memory and other file systems as well. Our experiment results show that the proposed MFTL could achieve a good performance for various access patterns even on SLC flash memory.","author":["Jen-Wei Hsieh","Chung-Hsien Wu","Ge-Ming Chiu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 8","Issue 2","May 2012","Article No.: 7","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/2180905.2180908"],"date":"01 May 2012","ref":[{"text":".

However, their inherent security weaknesses allow attacks against the integrity of Web sessions. HTTPS is often recommended to protect cookies, but deploying full HTTPS support can be challenging due to performance and financial concerns, especially for highly distributed applications. Moreover, cookies can be exposed in a variety of ways even when HTTPS is enabled. In this article, we propose one-time cookies (OTC), a more robust alternative for session authentication. OTC prevents attacks such as session hijacking by signing each user request with a session secret securely stored in the browser. Unlike other proposed solutions, OTC does not require expensive state synchronization in the Web application, making it easily deployable in highly distributed systems. We implemented OTC as a plug-in for the popular WordPress platform and as an extension for Firefox and Firefox for mobile browsers. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that OTC introduces a latency of less than 6 ms when compared to cookies\u2014a negligible overhead for most Web applications. Moreover, we show that OTC can be combined with HTTPS to effectively add another layer of security to Web applications. In so doing, we demonstrate that one-time cookies can significantly improve the security of Web applications with minimal impact on performance and scalability.","author":["Italo Dacosta","Saurabh Chakradeo","Mustaque Ahamad","Patrick Traynor"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Internet Technology","Volume 12","Issue 1","June 2012","Article No.: 1","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/2220352.2220353"],"date":"05 July 2012","ref":[{"text":"Adida, B. 2007.

A single server can have over 100 GB of memory, and a cluster of such servers can have 10s to 100s of TB. However, a storage back end is still required for recovery from failures. Recovery can last for minutes for a single server or hours for a whole cluster, causing heavy load on the back end. Non-volatile main memory (NVRAM) technologies can help by allowing near-instantaneous recovery of in-memory state. However, today's software does not support this well. Block-based approaches such as persistent buffer caches suffer from data duplication and block transfer overheads. Recently, user-level persistent heaps have been shown to have much better performance than these. However they require substantial application modification and still have significant runtime overheads. This paper proposes whole-system persistence (WSP) as an alternative. WSP is aimed at systems where all memory is non-volatile. It transparently recovers an application's entire state, making a failure appear as a suspend/resume event. Runtime overheads are eliminated by using \"flush on fail\": transient state in processor registers and caches is flushed to NVRAM only on failure, using the residual energy from the system power supply. Our evaluation shows that this approach has 1.6--13 times better runtime performance than a persistent heap, and that flush-on-fail can complete safely within 2--35\\% of the residual energy window provided by standard power supplies.","author":["Dushyanth Narayanan","Orion Hodson"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 47","Issue 4","April 2012","pp   401\u2013410","https://doi.org/10.1145/2248487.2151018"],"date":"03 March 2012","ref":[{"text":"AgigaTech.

A planar graph with this property satisfies the requirement that its maximum clique size equal the minimum number of colors required for the graph (graphs all of whose induced subgraphs satisfy the latter property are perfect as defined by Berge). The algorithm presented is based on decomposing these graphs into essentially two special classes of inseparable component graphs that are easy to recognize. They are (i) planar comparability graphs and (ii) planar line graphs of those planar bipartite graphs whose maximum degrees are no greater than 3. Composition schemes for generating planar perfect graphs from those basic components are also provided. This decomposition algorithm can also be adapted to solve the corresponding maximum independent set and minimum coloring problems.

However, unlike other resources, it is neither shared proportionally to payment, nor do cloud providers offer minimum guarantees on network bandwidth. The reason networks are more difficult to share is because the network allocation of a virtual machine (VM) X depends not only on the VMs running on the same machine with X, but also on the other VMs that X communicates with and the cross-traffic on each link used by X. In this paper, we start from the above requirements--payment proportionality and minimum guarantees--and show that the network-specific challenges lead to fundamental tradeoffs when sharing cloud networks. We then propose a set of properties to explicitly express these tradeoffs. Finally, we present three allocation policies that allow us to navigate the tradeoff space. We evaluate their characteristics through simulation and testbed experiments to show that they can provide minimum guarantees and achieve better proportionality than existing solutions.","author":["Lucian Popa","Gautam Kumar","Mosharaf Chowdhury","Arvind Krishnamurthy","Sylvia Ratnasamy","Ion Stoica"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 42","Issue 4","October 2012","pp   187\u2013198","https://doi.org/10.1145/2377677.2377717"],"date":"13 August 2012","ref":[{"text":"Amazon web services. http://aws.amazon.com.","order":1},{"text":"Cisco 7500 series. http://goo.gl/m0Ve0.","order":2},{"text":"Congestion Exposure. http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/conex/.","order":3},{"text":"DETERlab. http://www.isi.deterlab.net.","order":4},{"text":"HP 5900 ToR switch. http://goo.gl/kcycc.","order":5},{"text":"Rackspace Cloud Servers vs. VPS Platforms. http://goo.gl/LPxIJ.","order":6},{"text":"M.

A majority of existing PUFs rely on a dedicated circuit structure for generating chip-specific signatures, which often imposes concerns due to area/power overhead and extra design efforts. Furthermore, existing PUF-based signature generation cannot be employed to authenticate chips already in the market. In this paper, we propose RESP, a novel PUF structure realized in embedded SRAM array, a prevalent component in processors and system-on-chips (SOCs), with virtually no design modification. RESP leverages on voltage-depend memory access failures (during write) to produce large volume of high-quality challenge-response pairs. Since many modern ICs integrate SRAM array of varying size with isolated power grid, RESP can be easily retrofitted into these chips. Circuit-level simulation of 1000 chips using realistic process variation model shows high uniqueness of 49.2% average inter-die Hamming distance and good reproducibility of 2.88% intra-die Hamming distance under temperature < 85\u00b0C.

However, the use of CMOS analog-circuits with RCM would result in large power-consumption and poor scalability, thereby eschewing the benefits of RCM-based computation. We propose the use of low-voltage, fast-switching, magneto-metallic 'spin-neurons' for ultra low-power non-Boolean computing with RCM. We present the design of analog associative memory for face recognition using RCM, where, substituting conventional analog circuits with spin-neurons can achieve ~100x lower power. This makes the proposed design ~1000x more energy-efficient than a 45nm-CMOS digital ASIC, thereby significantly enhancing the prospects of RCM based computational hardware.","author":["Mrigank Sharad","Deliang Fan","Kaushik Roy"],"issue":["DAC '13: Proceedings of the 50th Annual Design Automation Conference","May 2013","Article No.: 107","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2463209.2488866"],"date":"29 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"Sangho Shin et. al, \"Memristor-Based Fine Resolution Programmable Resistance and Its Applications\", ISCAS, 2009.","order":1},{"text":"R.

We analyze this phenomenon and show that in the \u221e-norm it happens precisely when x has components of widely varying magnitude and every component of x of largest magnitude agrees with the corresponding component of y. Performance profiles are a popular way to compare competing algorithms according to particular measures of performance. We show that performance profiles based on normwise relative errors can give a misleading impression due to the influence of zero or tiny normwise relative errors. We propose a transformation that reduces the influence of these extreme errors in a controlled manner, while preserving the monotonicity of the underlying data and leaving the performance profile unchanged at its left end-point. Numerical examples with both artificial and genuine data illustrate the benefits of the transformation.","author":["Nicholas J. Dingle","Nicholas J.

Protection mechanisms deployed by such systems keep a malicious kernel from directly manipulating a trusted application's state. Under such systems, the application and kernel are, conceptually, peers, and the system call API defines an RPC interface between them.We introduce Iago attacks, attacks that a malicious kernel can mount in this model. We show how a carefully chosen sequence of integer return values to Linux system calls can lead a supposedly protected process to act against its interests, and even to undertake arbitrary computation at the malicious kernel's behest.Iago attacks are evidence that protecting applications from malicious kernels is more difficult than previously realized.","author":["Stephen Checkoway","Hovav Shacham"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 48","Issue 4","April 2013","pp   253\u2013264","https://doi.org/10.1145/2499368.2451145"],"date":"16 March 2013","ref":[{"text":"Anonymous.

Still, there is currently a lack of programming languages for describing quantum computation on a practical scale, i.e., not just at the level of toy problems. We address this issue by introducing Quipper, a scalable, expressive, functional, higher-order quantum programming language. Quipper has been used to program a diverse set of non-trivial quantum algorithms, and can generate quantum gate representations using trillions of gates. It is geared towards a model of computation that uses a classical computer to control a quantum device, but is not dependent on any particular model of quantum hardware. Quipper has proven effective and easy to use, and opens the door towards using formal methods to analyze quantum algorithms.","author":["Alexander S. Green","Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine","Neil J.

In parallel, interest in movement has shifted from raw movement data analysis to more application-oriented ways of analyzing segments of movement suitable for the specific purposes of the application. This trend has promoted semantically rich trajectories, rather than raw movement, as the core object of interest in mobility studies. This survey provides the definitions of the basic concepts about mobility data, an analysis of the issues in mobility data management, and a survey of the approaches and techniques for: (i) constructing trajectories from movement tracks, (ii) enriching trajectories with semantic information to enable the desired interpretations of movements, and (iii) using data mining to analyze semantic trajectories and extract knowledge about their characteristics, in particular the behavioral patterns of the moving objects. Last but not least, the article surveys the new privacy issues that arise due to the semantic aspects of trajectories.","author":["Christine Parent","Stefano Spaccapietra","Chiara Renso","Gennady Andrienko","Natalia Andrienko","Vania Bogorny","Maria Luisa Damiani","Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis","Jose Macedo","Nikos Pelekis","Yannis Theodoridis","Zhixian Yan"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 45","Issue 4","August 2013","Article No.: 42","pp   1\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/2501654.2501656"],"date":"30 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"Abul, O., Bonchi, F., and Nanni, M. 2008.

However, the performance of restore operations from a deduplicated backup can be significantly lower than that without deduplication. The main reason lies in the fact that a file or block is split into multiple small data chunks that are often located in different disks after deduplication, which can cause a subsequent read operation to invoke many disk IOs involving multiple disks and thus degrade the read performance significantly. While this problem has been by and large ignored in the literature thus far, we argue that the time is ripe for us to pay significant attention to it in light of the emerging cloud storage applications and the increasing popularity of the VM platform in the cloud. This is because, in a cloud storage or VM environment, a simple read request on the client side may translate into a restore operation if the data to be read or a VM suspended by the user was previously deduplicated when written to the cloud or the VM storage server, a likely scenario considering the network bandwidth and storage capacity concerns in such an environment.To address this problem, in this article, we propose SAR, an SSD (solid-state drive)-Assisted Read scheme, that effectively exploits the high random-read performance properties of SSDs and the unique data-sharing characteristic of deduplication-based storage systems by storing in SSDs the unique data chunks with high reference count, small size, and nonsequential characteristics. In this way, many read requests to HDDs are replaced by read requests to SSDs, thus significantly improving the read performance of the deduplication-based storage systems in the cloud. The extensive trace-driven and VM restore evaluations on the prototype implementation of SAR show that SAR outperforms the traditional deduplication-based and flash-based cache schemes significantly, in terms of the average response times.","author":["Bo Mao","Hong Jiang","Suzhen Wu","Yinjin Fu","Lei Tian"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 10","Issue 2","March 2014","Article No.: 6","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/2512348"],"date":"01 March 2014","ref":[{"text":"Andersen, D.

GPUs, in particular, are becoming very popular for speeding up compute-intensive kernels of scientific, imaging, and simulation applications. New programming models that facilitate parallel processing on heterogeneous systems containing GPUs are spreading rapidly in the computing community. By leveraging these investments, the developers of other accelerators have an opportunity to significantly reduce the programming effort by supporting those accelerator models already gaining popularity. In this work, we adapt one such language, the CUDA programming model, into a new FPGA design flow called FCUDA, which efficiently maps the coarse- and fine-grained parallelism exposed in CUDA onto the reconfigurable fabric. Our CUDA-to-FPGA flow employs AutoPilot, an advanced high-level synthesis tool (available from Xilinx) which enables high-abstraction FPGA programming. FCUDA is based on a source-to-source compilation that transforms the SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Thread) CUDA code into task-level parallel C code for AutoPilot. We describe the details of our CUDA-to-FPGA flow and demonstrate the highly competitive performance of the resulting customized FPGA multicore accelerators. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CUDA-to-FPGA flow to demonstrate the applicability and potential advantage of using the CUDA programming model for high-performance computing in FPGAs.","author":["Alexandros Papakonstantinou","Karthik Gururaj","John A.

While retaining the scatter-gather programming model with state stored in the vertices, X-Stream is novel in (i) using an edge-centric rather than a vertex-centric implementation of this model, and (ii) streaming completely unordered edge lists rather than performing random access. This design is motivated by the fact that sequential bandwidth for all storage media (main memory, SSD, and magnetic disk) is substantially larger than random access bandwidth. We demonstrate that a large number of graph algorithms can be expressed using the edge-centric scatter-gather model. The resulting implementations scale well in terms of number of cores, in terms of number of I/O devices, and across different storage media. X-Stream competes favorably with existing systems for graph processing. Besides sequential access, we identify as one of the main contributors to better performance the fact that X-Stream does not need to sort edge lists during preprocessing.","author":["Amitabha Roy","Ivo Mihailovic","Willy Zwaenepoel"],"issue":["SOSP '13: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","November 2013","Pages   472\u2013488","https://doi.org/10.1145/2517349.2522740"],"date":"03 November 2013","ref":[{"text":"http://freecode.com/projects/fio","order":1},{"text":"http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon0601.html","order":2},{"text":"http://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-Patents.html","order":3},{"text":"http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-LiveJournal1.html","order":4},{"text":"http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Challenges/","order":5},{"text":"http://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-Friendster.html","order":6},{"text":"http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/LAW/sk-2005.html","order":7},{"text":"http://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=g","order":8},{"text":"http://www.graph500.org/","order":9},{"text":"http://incubator.apache.org/giraph/","order":10},{"text":"M.

Medical record databases, large biomedical datasets, historical information about power systems and financial data are some examples of critical data that could be moved to the cloud. However, the reliability and security of data stored in the cloud still remain major concerns. In this work we present DepSky, a system that improves the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of information stored in the cloud through the encryption, encoding, and replication of the data on diverse clouds that form a cloud-of-clouds. We deployed our system using four commercial clouds and used PlanetLab to run clients accessing the service from different countries. We observed that our protocols improved the perceived availability, and in most cases, the access latency, when compared with cloud providers individually. Moreover, the monetary costs of using DepSky in this scenario is at most twice the cost of using a single cloud, which is optimal and seems to be a reasonable cost, given the benefits.","author":["Alysson Bessani","Miguel Correia","Bruno Quaresma","Fernando Andr\u00e9","Paulo Sousa"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 9","Issue 4","November 2013","Article No.: 12","pp   1\u201333","https://doi.org/10.1145/2535929"],"date":"01 November 2013","ref":[{"text":"Abraham, I., Chockler, G., Keidar, I., and Malkhi, D. 2006.

Available in mainstream wireless signal measurements, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) has been adopted in vast indoor localization systems. However, it suffers from dramatic performance degradation in complex situations due to multipath fading and temporal dynamics.Break-through techniques resort to finer-grained wireless channel measurement than RSSI. Different from RSSI, the PHY layer power feature, channel response, is able to discriminate multipath characteristics, and thus holds the potential for the convergence of accurate and pervasive indoor localization. Channel State Information (CSI, reflecting channel response in 802.11 a/g/n) has attracted many research efforts and some pioneer works have demonstrated submeter or even centimeter-level accuracy. In this article, we survey this new trend of channel response in localization. The differences between CSI and RSSI are highlighted with respect to network layering, time resolution, frequency resolution, stability, and accessibility. Furthermore, we investigate a large body of recent works and classify them overall into three categories according to how to use CSI. For each category, we emphasize the basic principles and address future directions of research in this new and largely open area.","author":["Zheng Yang","Zimu Zhou","Yunhao Liu"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 46","Issue 2","November 2013","Article No.: 25","pp   1\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/2543581.2543592"],"date":"27 December 2013","ref":[{"text":"Azizyan, M., Constandache, I., and Roy Choudhury, R. 2009.

In this paper we examine an architecture for a scalable distributed flash store which aims to overcome this limitation in two ways. First, the architecture provides a high-performance, high-capacity, scalable random-access storage. It achieves high-throughput by sharing large numbers of flash chips across a low-latency, chip-to-chip backplane network managed by the flash controllers. The additional latency for remote data access via this network is negligible as compared to flash access time. Second, it permits some computation near the data via a FPGA-based programmable flash controller. The controller is located in the datapath between the storage and the host, and provides hardware acceleration for applications without any additional latency. We have constructed a small-scale prototype whose network bandwidth scales directly with the number of nodes, and where average latency for user software to access flash store is less than 70mus, including 3.5mus of network overhead.","author":["Sang-Woo Jun","Ming Liu","Kermin Elliott Fleming","Arvind"],"issue":["FPGA '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM/SIGDA international symposium on Field-programmable gate arrays","February 2014","Pages   55\u201364","https://doi.org/10.1145/2554688.2554789"],"date":"26 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"FUSE: Filesystem in Userspace. http://fuse.sourceforge.net/.

While there has been a spate of recent work on estimating the number of nodes in a network, the edge-estimation question appears to be largely unaddressed. In this work we consider the problem of estimating the average degree of a large network using efficient random sampling, where the number of nodes is not known to the algorithm. We propose a new estimator for this problem that relies on access to node samples under a prescribed distribution. Next, we show how to efficiently realize this ideal estimator in a random walk setting. Our estimator has a natural and simple implementation using random walks; we bound its performance in terms of the mixing time of the underlying graph. We then show that our estimators are both provably and practically better than many natural estimators for the problem. Our work contrasts with existing theoretical work on estimating average degree, which assume that a uniform random sample of nodes is available and the number of nodes is known.","author":["Anirban Dasgupta","Ravi Kumar","Tamas Sarlos"],"issue":["WWW '14: Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World wide web","April 2014","Pages   795\u2013806","https://doi.org/10.1145/2566486.2568019"],"date":"07 April 2014","ref":[{"text":"Z.

First, we present a hardware resource management scheme for sharing of loosely coupled accelerators and arbitration of multiple requesting cores. Second, we present a mechanism for accelerator virtualization. This allows multiple accelerators to efficiently compose a larger virtual accelerator out of multiple smaller accelerators, as well as to collaborate as multiple copies of a simple accelerator. All of this work is supported by a fully automated simulation tool-chain for both accelerator generation and management. We present the applicability of our approach to four different application domains: medical imaging, commercial, computer vision, and navigation. Our results demonstrate large performance improvements and energy savings over a software implementation. We also show additional improvements that result from enhanced load balancing and simplification of the communication between the core and the arbitration mechanism.","author":["Jason Cong","Mohammad Ali Ghodrat","Michael Gill","Beayna Grigorian","Glenn Reinman"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 13","Issue 4s","July 2014","Article No.: 131","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/2584664"],"date":"01 April 2014","ref":[{"text":"D.

However, since each data point enters the objective function with squared residue error, a few outliers with large errors easily dominate the objective function. In this article, we propose a Robust Manifold Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (RMNMF) method using \u21132,1-norm and integrating NMF and spectral clustering under the same clustering framework. We also point out the solution uniqueness issue for the existing NMF methods and propose an additional orthonormal constraint to address this problem. With the new constraint, the conventional auxiliary function approach no longer works. We tackle this difficult optimization problem via a novel Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM)--based algorithm and convert the original constrained optimization problem on one variable into a multivariate constrained problem. The new objective function then can be decomposed into several subproblems that each has a closed-form solution. More importantly, we reveal the connection of our method with robust K-means and spectral clustering, and we demonstrate its theoretical significance. Extensive experiments have been conducted on nine benchmark datasets, and all empirical results show the effectiveness of our method.","author":["Jin Huang","Feiping Nie","Heng Huang","Chris Ding"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data","Volume 8","Issue 3","June 2014","Article No.: 11","pp   1\u201321","https://doi.org/10.1145/2601434"],"date":"01 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"M.

Since GPUs operate many processing units and manage multiple levels of memory hierarchy, they consume a significant amount of power. Although several power models for CPUs are available, the power consumption of GPUs has not been studied much yet. In this article we develop a new power model for GPUs by utilizing McPAT, a CPU power tool. We generate initial power model data from McPAT with a detailed GPU configuration, and then adjust the models by comparing them with empirical data. We use the NVIDIA's Fermi architecture for building the power model, and our model estimates the GPU power consumption with an average error of 7.7% and 12.8% for the microbenchmarks and Merge benchmarks, respectively.","author":["Jieun Lim","Nagesh B.

Unlike prior RDMA-based key-value systems, HERD focuses its design on reducing network round trips while using efficient RDMA primitives; the result is substantially lower latency, and throughput that saturates modern, commodity RDMA hardware. HERD has two unconventional decisions: First, it does not use RDMA reads, despite the allure of operations that bypass the remote CPU entirely. Second, it uses a mix of RDMA and messaging verbs, despite the conventional wisdom that the messaging primitives are slow. A HERD client writes its request into the server's memory; the server computes the reply. This design uses a single round trip for all requests and supports up to 26 million key-value operations per second with 5\u03bcs average latency. Notably, for small key-value items, our full system throughput is similar to native RDMA read throughput and is over 2X higher than recent RDMA-based key-value systems. We believe that HERD further serves as an effective template for the construction of RDMA-based datacenter services.","author":["Anuj Kalia","Michael Kaminsky","David G.

This paper asks the following question: Can Wi-Fi \"hear\" our talks? We present WiHear, which enables Wi-Fi signals to \"hear\" our talks without deploying any devices. To achieve this, WiHear needs to detect and analyze fine-grained radio reflections from mouth movements. WiHear solves this micro-movement detection problem by introducing Mouth Motion Profile that leverages partial multipath effects and wavelet packet transformation. Since Wi-Fi signals do not require line-of-sight, WiHear can \"hear\" people talks within the radio range. Further, WiHear can simultaneously \"hear\" multiple people's talks leveraging MIMO technology. We implement WiHear on both USRP N210 platform and commercial Wi-Fi infrastructure. Results show that within our pre-defined vocabulary, WiHear can achieve detection accuracy of 91% on average for single individual speaking no more than 6 words and up to 74% for no more than 3 people talking simultaneously. Moreover, the detection accuracy can be further improved by deploying multiple receivers from different angles.","author":["Guanhua Wang","Yongpan Zou","Zimu Zhou","Kaishun Wu","Lionel M.

Recently, rapid growth of modern applications based on deep learning algorithms has further improved research and implementations. Especially, various accelerators for deep CNN have been proposed based on FPGA platform because it has advantages of high performance, reconfigurability, and fast development round, etc. Although current FPGA accelerators have demonstrated better performance over generic processors, the accelerator design space has not been well exploited. One critical problem is that the computation throughput may not well match the memory bandwidth provided an FPGA platform. Consequently, existing approaches cannot achieve best performance due to under-utilization of either logic resource or memory bandwidth. At the same time, the increasing complexity and scalability of deep learning applications aggravate this problem. In order to overcome this problem, we propose an analytical design scheme using the roofline model. For any solution of a CNN design, we quantitatively analyze its computing throughput and required memory bandwidth using various optimization techniques, such as loop tiling and transformation. Then, with the help of rooine model, we can identify the solution with best performance and lowest FPGA resource requirement. As a case study, we implement a CNN accelerator on a VC707 FPGA board and compare it to previous approaches. Our implementation achieves a peak performance of 61.62 GFLOPS under 100MHz working frequency, which outperform previous approaches significantly.","author":["Chen Zhang","Peng Li","Guangyu Sun","Yijin Guan","Bingjun Xiao","Jason Cong"],"issue":["FPGA '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2015","Pages   161\u2013170","https://doi.org/10.1145/2684746.2689060"],"date":"22 February 2015","ref":[{"text":"D.

However, unlike in data-parallel algorithms, synchronization patterns in SGD are quite complex. Furthermore, scheduling for scale-free graphs is challenging. This work examines several synchronization strategies for SGD, ranging from simple locking to conflict-free scheduling. We observe that static schedules do not yield better performance despite eliminating the need to perform conflict detection and resolution at runtime. We identify the source of the performance degradation to be the structure of certain parts of the graph (dense vs sparse). This classification can be used to devise hybrid scheduling strategies which exploit different schedules for different regions of the graph to obtain better performance. We found that the best schedule for some problems can be up to two orders of magnitude faster than the worst one. To evaluate the performance of our GPU implementation, we also compare against a CPU implementation of SGD. Dynamic schedules perform comparably to a 14-thread CPU implementation, while a static schedule performs comparably to a 6-thread CPU implementation.","author":["Rashid Kaleem","Sreepathi Pai","Keshav Pingali"],"issue":["GPGPU-8: Proceedings of the 8th Workshop on General Purpose Processing using GPUs","February 2015","Pages   81\u201389","https://doi.org/10.1145/2716282.2716289"],"date":"07 February 2015","ref":[{"text":"B.

From many semantic concept detectors obtained by using training data, we make detectors for concepts not included in training data. First, we introduce Mikolov's word vectors to represent a word by a low-dimensional vector. Second, we represent a new concept by a weighted sum of concepts in training data in the word vector space. Finally, we use the same weighting coefficients for combining detectors to make a new detector. In our experiments, we evaluate our methods on the TRECVID Video Semantic Indexing (SIN) Task. We train our models with Google News text documents and ImageNET images to generate new semantic detectors for SIN task. We show that our method performs as well as SVMs trained with 100 TRECVID ex- ample videos.","author":["Nakamasa Inoue","Koichi Shinoda"],"issue":["MM '15: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2015","Pages   851\u2013854","https://doi.org/10.1145/2733373.2806347"],"date":"13 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"F.

To accelerate design tuning, statistical design space exploration methods have been proposed. This article presents Starchart, a novel design space partitioning tool that uses regression trees to approach GPU tuning problems. Improving on prior work, Starchart offers more automation in identifying key design trade-offs and models design subspaces with distinctly different behaviors. Starchart achieves good model accuracy using very few random samples: less than 0.3% of a given design space; iterative sampling can more quickly target subspaces of interest.","author":["Wenhao Jia","Elba Garza","Kelly A.

Its revolutionary features are the expected operating frequencies (THz), the high device densities, the noncryogenic working temperature, and, above all, the limited power densities.The main drawback of this technology is a consequence of one of its very main advantages, that is, the extremely small size of a single molecule. Device prototyping and the fabrication of a simple circuit are limited by lack of control in the technological process [Pulimeno et al. 2013a]. Moreover, high defectivity might strongly impact the correct behavior of mQCA devices. Another challenging point is the lack of a solid method for analyzing and simulating mQCA behavior and performance, either in ideal or defective conditions.Our contribution in this article is threefold: (i) We identify a methodology based on both ab-initio simulations and post-processing of data for analyzing an mQCA system adopting an electronic point of view (we baptized this method as \u201cMoSQuiTo\u201d); (ii) we assess the performance of an mQCA device (in this case, a bis- ferrocene molecule) working in nonideal conditions, using as a reference the information on fabrication-critical issues and on the possible defects that we are obtaining while conducting our own ongoing experiments on mQCA: (iii) we determine and assess the electrostatic energy stored in a bis-ferrocene molecule both in an oxidized and reduced form.Results presented here consist of quantitative information for an mQCA device working in manifold driving conditions and subjected to defects. This information is given in terms of: (a) output voltage; (b) safe operating area (SOA); (c) electrostatic energy; and (d) relation between SOA and energy, that is, possible energy reduction subject to reliability and functionality constraints. The whole analysis is a first fundamental step toward the study of a complex mQCA circuit. It gives important suggestions on possible improvements of the technological processes. Moreover, it starts an interesting assessment on the energy of an mQCA, one of the most promising features of this technology.","author":["Mariagrazia Graziano","Azzurra Pulimeno","Ruiyu Wang","Xiang Wei","Massimo Ruo Roch","Gianluca Piccinini"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 12","Issue 2","August 2015","Article No.: 18","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/2738041"],"date":"02 September 2015","ref":[{"text":"V.

Discovery of memristor further accelerates engineering realization of NCS by leveraging the similarity between synaptic connections in neural networks and programming weight of the memristor. However, to achieve a stable large-scale NCS for practical applications, many essential EDA design challenges still need to be overcome especially the state-of-the-art memristor crossbar structure is adopted. In this paper, we summarize some of our recent published works about enhancing the design robustness and efficiency of memristor crossbar based NCS. The experiments show that the impacts of noises generated by process variations and the IR-drop over the crossbar can be effectively suppressed by our noise-eliminating training method and IR-drop compensation technique. Moreover, our network clustering techniques can alleviate the challenges of limited crossbar scale and routing congestion in NCS implementations.","author":["Beiye Liu","Wei Wen","Yiran Chen","Xin Li","Chi-Ruo Wu","Tsung-Yi Ho"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '15: Proceedings of the 25th edition on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2015","Pages   185\u2013188","https://doi.org/10.1145/2742060.2743754"],"date":"20 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"D.

Energy harvesting instead of battery is a better power source for these wearable devices due to many advantages. However, harvested energy is often unstable and program execution will be frequently interrupted. Non-volatile processors demonstrate promising advantages to back up volatile state before the system energy is depleted. But Non-volatile processors require additional memory for backing up, thus introducing non-negligible overhead in terms of energy, runtime as well as chip area. In this work, we target at non-volatile register reduction for energy harvesting based wearable devices. This paper proposes to stack trimming the memory footprint via a novel compiler directed method. The evaluation results deliver on average 28.6% reduction of non-volatile register files for backing up stack area, with ultra low runtime overhead.","author":["Qingan Li","Mengying Zhao","Jingtong Hu","Yongpan Liu","Yanxiang He","Chun Jason Xue"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 183","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744809"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"Morgan Stanley: Wearable Devices A Potential $1.6 Trillion Business: http://www.wearabledevices.com/2014/11/20/morgan-stanley-wearable-devices/.","order":1},{"text":"IEEE, 2014.","order":2},{"text":"A.

However, the nondeterministic garbage collection operation in NAND flash memory makes it difficult to predict the system response time of each data request. This article presents Lazy-RTGC, a real-time lazy garbage collection mechanism for NAND flash memory storage systems. Lazy-RTGC adopts two design optimization techniques: on-demand page-level address mappings, and partial garbage collection. On-demand page-level address mappings can achieve high performance of address translation and can effectively manage the flash space with the minimum RAM cost. On the other hand, partial garbage collection can provide the guaranteed system response time. By adopting these techniques, Lazy-RTGC jointly optimizes both the average and the worst system response time, and provides a lower bound of reclaimed free space. Lazy-RTGC is implemented in FlashSim and compared with representative real-time NAND flash memory management schemes. Experimental results show that our technique can significantly improve both the average and worst system performance with very low extra flash-space requirements.","author":["Qi Zhang","Xuandong Li","Linzhang Wang","Tian Zhang","Yi Wang","Zili Shao"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 20","Issue 3","June 2015","Article No.: 43","pp   1\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/2746236"],"date":"24 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (Aeec). 1991.

Such caches can improve system performance by servicing data at a faster rate when the requested data is found in the cache, potentially increasing the memory bandwidth of the system by 4x-8x. Unfortunately, a DRAM cache uses the available memory bandwidth not only for data transfer on cache hits, but also for other secondary operations such as cache miss detection, fill on cache miss, and writeback lookup and content update on dirty evictions from the last-level on-chip cache. Ideally, we want the bandwidth consumed for such secondary operations to be negligible, and have almost all the bandwidth be available for transfer of useful data from the DRAM cache to the processor. We evaluate a 1GB DRAM cache, architected as Alloy Cache, and show that even the most bandwidth-efficient proposal for DRAM cache consumes 3.8x bandwidth compared to an idealized DRAM cache that does not consume any bandwidth for secondary operations. We also show that redesigning the DRAM cache to minimize the bandwidth consumed by secondary operations can potentially improve system performance by 22%. To that end, this paper proposes Bandwidth Efficient ARchitecture (BEAR) for DRAM caches. BEAR integrates three components, one each for reducing the bandwidth consumed by miss detection, miss fill, and writeback probes. BEAR reduces the bandwidth consumption of DRAM cache by 32%, which reduces cache hit latency by 24% and increases overall system performance by 10%. BEAR, with negligible overhead, outperforms an idealized SRAM Tag-Store design that incurs an unacceptable overhead of 64 megabytes, as well as Sector Cache designs that incur an SRAM storage overhead of 6 megabytes.","author":["Chiachen Chou","Aamer Jaleel","Moinuddin K.

Although retrieval models incorporating term dependencies have been shown to be significantly more effective than the unigram bag-of-words ones for ad hoc document retrieval, it is not known whether accounting for term dependencies can improve retrieval from the Web of Data. In this work, we propose a novel retrieval model that incorporates term dependencies into structured document retrieval and apply it to the task of ERWD. In the proposed model, the document field weights and the relative importance of unigrams and bigrams are optimized with respect to the target retrieval metric using a learning-to-rank method. Experiments on a publicly available benchmark indicate significant improvement of the accuracy of retrieval results by the proposed model over state-of-the-art retrieval models for ERWD.","author":["Nikita Zhiltsov","Alexander Kotov","Fedor Nikolaev"],"issue":["SIGIR '15: Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2015","Pages   253\u2013262","https://doi.org/10.1145/2766462.2767756"],"date":"09 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"K.

In this paper, we present similarities and differences between them and propose an automatic translation framework for both OpenCL to CUDA and CUDA to OpenCL. We describe features that make it difficult to translate from one to the other and provide our solution. We show that our translator achieves comparable performance between the original and target applications in both directions. Since each programming model separately has a wide user-base and large code-base, our translation framework is useful to extend the code-base for each programming model and unifies the efforts to develop applications for heterogeneous systems.","author":["Junghyun Kim","Thanh Tuan Dao","Jaehoon Jung","Jinyoung Joo","Jaejin Lee"],"issue":["SC '15: Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2015","Article No.: 82","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2807591.2807621"],"date":"15 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"S.

Uncovering these sparse links (i.e. intercommunity links) has a significant role in community detection problem which has been of great importance in sociology, biology, and computer science. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called CS-ComDet, to efficiently detect the inter-community links based on a newly emerged paradigm in sparse signal recovery, called compressive sensing. We test our method on real-world networks of various kinds whose community structures are already known, and illustrate that the proposed method detects the inter-community links accurately even with low number of measurements (i.e. when the number of measurements is less than half of the number of existing links in the network).","author":["Hamidreza Mahyar","Hamid R.

White-box cryptography aims to ensure the security of cryptographic algorithms when the attacker has full access to their implementations. However, there is no secure white-box implementation of standard block ciphers such as DES and AES known to date: All published techniques have been practically broken. In this paper, we revisit white-box cryptography and propose a family of white-box secure block ciphers SPACE with several novel features. The design of SPACE is such that the key-extraction security in the white box reduces to the well-studied problem of key recovery for block ciphers (AES in our example) in the standard black-box setting. Moreover, to mitigate code lifting, we introduce the notion of space hardness. It measures the difficulty of compressing the white-box implementation of a cipher, and quantifies security against code lifting by the amount of code that needs to be extracted from the implementation by a white-box attacker to maintain its functionality. SPACE includes several variants with different white-box code sizes. Therefore, it is applicable to a wide range of environments and use cases. One of the variants called N-SPACE can be implemented with different code sizes while keeping the cipher itself unchanged. SPACE offers a high level of space hardness: It is difficult to find a compact but still functional representation of SPACE given its white-box implementation. This property has several useful consequences for applications. First, it gets more challenging for a DRM attacker (e.g. in a pay TV setting) to scale a code-lifting attack and to distribute the break. Moreover, this paves the way for mass-surveillance resistant cryptography: If a large proportion of users dedicates a significant part of their computers' storage (e.g. HDD) to white-box SPACE implementations, it will be much more complex or even infeasible for governmental agencies to deal with the keys of all users simultaneously due to the limited storage available, forcing them to focus on targeted attacks instead. This consequence is especially important given Snowden's revelations on the extent of the mass surveillance practice by NSA and GCHQ. Finally, the usage of SPACE ciphers can mitigate the damage of having malware in security-critical systems such as networks processing top-secret data: As those are typically insulated from the Internet, the capacity of the communication channel from inside to outside the system is often limited, making it infeasible for Trojans to transmit the necessary key material.","author":["Andrey Bogdanov","Takanori Isobe"],"issue":["CCS '15: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2015","Pages   1058\u20131069","https://doi.org/10.1145/2810103.2813699"],"date":"12 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"Martin R.

Earlier systems that process graphs from secondary storage are restricted to a single machine, and therefore limited by the bandwidth and capacity of the storage system on a single machine. Chaos is limited only by the aggregate bandwidth and capacity of all storage devices in the entire cluster. Chaos builds on the streaming partitions introduced by X-Stream in order to achieve sequential access to storage, but parallelizes the execution of streaming partitions. Chaos is novel in three ways. First, Chaos partitions for sequential storage access, rather than for locality and load balance, resulting in much lower pre-processing times. Second, Chaos distributes graph data uniformly randomly across the cluster and does not attempt to achieve locality, based on the observation that in a small cluster network bandwidth far outstrips storage bandwidth. Third, Chaos uses work stealing to allow multiple machines to work on a single partition, thereby achieving load balance at runtime. In terms of performance scaling, on 32 machines Chaos takes on average only 1.61 times longer to process a graph 32 times larger than on a single machine. In terms of capacity scaling, Chaos is capable of handling a graph with 1 trillion edges representing 16 TB of input data, a new milestone for graph processing capacity on a small commodity cluster.","author":["Amitabha Roy","Laurent Bindschaedler","Jasmina Malicevic","Willy Zwaenepoel"],"issue":["SOSP '15: Proceedings of the 25th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","October 2015","Pages   410\u2013424","https://doi.org/10.1145/2815400.2815408"],"date":"04 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"http://www.graph500.org/results_jun_2014","order":1},{"text":"https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/scaling-apache-giraph-to-a-trillion-edges/10151617006153920","order":2},{"text":"http://zeromq.org/","order":3},{"text":"http://webdatacommons.org/hyperlinkgraph/","order":4},{"text":"http://freecode.com/projects/fio","order":5},{"text":"http://giraph.apache.org/","order":6},{"text":"Balakrishnan, M., Malkhi, D., Prabhakaran, V., Wobber, T., Wei, M., and Davis, J.

Almost all ML toolkits assume that the input is a single table, but many datasets are not stored as single tables due to normalization. Thus, analysts often perform key-foreign key joins to obtain features from all base tables and apply a feature selection method, either explicitly or implicitly, with the aim of improving accuracy. In this work, we show that the features brought in by such joins can often be ignored without affecting ML accuracy significantly, i.e., we can \"avoid joins safely.\" We identify the core technical issue that could cause accuracy to decrease in some cases and analyze this issue theoretically. Using simulations, we validate our analysis and measure the effects of various properties of normalized data on accuracy. We apply our analysis to design easy-to-understand decision rules to predict when it is safe to avoid joins in order to help analysts exploit this runtime-accuracy trade-off. Experiments with multiple real normalized datasets show that our rules are able to accurately predict when joins can be avoided safely, and in some cases, this led to significant reductions in the runtime of some popular feature selection methods.","author":["Arun Kumar","Jeffrey Naughton","Jignesh M.

However, when a large number of concurrent transactions contend on the same data records, the system performance can deteriorate significantly. This is especially the case when scaling transaction processing with optimistic concurrency control (OCC) on multicore machines. In this paper, we propose a new concurrency-control mechanism, called transaction healing, that exploits program semantics to scale the conventional OCC towards dozens of cores even under highly contended workloads. Transaction healing captures the dependencies across operations within a transaction prior to its execution. Instead of blindly rejecting a transaction once its validation fails, the proposed mechanism judiciously restores any non-serializable operation and heals inconsistent transaction states as well as query results according to the extracted dependencies. Transaction healing can partially update the membership of read/write sets when processing dependent transactions. Such overhead, however, is largely reduced by carefully avoiding false aborts and rearranging validation orders. We implemented the idea of transaction healing in TheDB, a main-memory database prototype that provides full ACID guarantee with a scalable commit protocol. By evaluating TheDB on a 48-core machine with two widely-used benchmarks, we confirm that transaction healing can scale near-linearly, yielding significantly higher transaction rate than the state-of-the-art OCC implementations.","author":["Yingjun Wu","Chee-Yong Chan","Kian-Lee Tan"],"issue":["SIGMOD '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data","June 2016","Pages   1689\u20131704","https://doi.org/10.1145/2882903.2915202"],"date":"26 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"http://llvm.org/docs/passes.html.","order":1},{"text":"https://github.com/apavlo/h-store.","order":2},{"text":"https://github.com/stephentu/silo.","order":3},{"text":"http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/.","order":4},{"text":"D.

As an alternative, standard cell memories (SCMs) can be defined, synthesized, and placed and routed as an integral part of a given digital system, providing complete design flexibility, good energy efficiency, low-voltage operation, and even area efficiency for small memory blocks. Yet implementing an SCM block with a standard digital flow often fails to exploit the distinct and regular structure of such an array, leaving room for optimization. In this article, we present a design methodology for optimizing the physical implementation of SCM macros as part of the standard design flow. This methodology introduces controlled placement, leading to a structured, noncongested layout with close to 100% placement utilization, resulting in a smaller silicon footprint, reduced wire length, and lower power consumption compared to SCMs without controlled placement. This methodology is demonstrated on SCM macros of various sizes and aspect ratios in a state-of-the-art 28nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator technology, and compared with equivalent macros designed with the noncontrolled, standard flow, as well as with foundry-supplied SRAM macros. The controlled SCMs provide an average 25% reduction in area as compared to noncontrolled implementations while achieving a smaller size than SRAM macros of up to 1Kbyte. Power and performance comparisons of controlled SCM blocks of a commonly found 256 \u00d7 32 (1 Kbyte) memory with foundry-provided SRAMs show greater than 65% and 10% reduction in read and write power, respectively, while providing faster access than their SRAM counterparts, despite being of an aspect ratio that is typically unfavorable for SCMs. In addition, the SCM blocks function correctly with a supply voltage as low as 0.3V, well below the lower limit of even the SRAM macros optimized for low-voltage operation. The controlled placement methodology is applied within a full-chip physical implementation flow of an OpenRISC-based test chip, providing more than 50% power reduction compared to equivalently sized compiled SRAMs under a benchmark application.","author":["Adam Teman","Davide Rossi","Pascal Meinerzhagen","Luca Benini","Andreas Burg"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 21","Issue 4","September 2016","Article No.: 59","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2890498"],"date":"27 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"O.

Consequently, Bitcoin has the unintuitive property that while the ownership of money is implicitly anonymous, its flow is globally visible. In this paper we explore this unique characteristic further, using heuristic clustering to group Bitcoin wallets based on evidence of shared authority, and then using re-identification attacks (i.e., empirical purchasing of goods and services) to classify the operators of those clusters. From this analysis, we consider the challenges for those seeking to use Bitcoin for criminal or fraudulent purposes at scale.","author":["Sarah Meiklejohn","Marjori Pomarole","Grant Jordan","Kirill Levchenko","Damon McCoy","Geoffrey M.

However, statistical validity is typically studied in a nonadaptive model, where all questions are specified before the dataset is drawn. Recent work by Dwork et al. (STOC, 2015) and Hardt and Ullman (FOCS, 2014) initiated a general formal study of this problem, and gave the first upper and lower bounds on the achievable generalization error for adaptive data analysis.     Specifically, suppose there is an unknown distribution P and a set of n independent samples x is drawn from P. We seek an algorithm that, given x as input, accurately answers a sequence of adaptively chosen ``queries'' about the unknown distribution P. How many samples n must we draw from the distribution, as a function of the type of queries, the number of queries, and the desired level of accuracy?     In this work we make two new contributions towards resolving this question: We give upper bounds on the number of samples n that are needed to answer statistical queries. The bounds improve and simplify the work of Dwork et al. (STOC, 2015), and have been applied in subsequent work by those authors (Science, 2015; NIPS, 2015).We prove the first upper bounds on the number of samples required to answer more general families of queries. These include arbitrary low-sensitivity queries and an important class of optimization queries (alternatively, risk minimization queries).     As in Dwork et al., our algorithms are based on a connection with algorithmic stability in the form of differential privacy. We extend their work by giving a quantitatively optimal, more general, and simpler proof of their main theorem that the stability notion guaranteed by differential privacy implies low generalization error. We also show that weaker stability guarantees such as bounded KL divergence and total variation distance lead to correspondingly weaker generalization guarantees.","author":["Raef Bassily","Kobbi Nissim","Adam Smith","Thomas Steinke","Uri Stemmer","Jonathan Ullman"],"issue":["STOC '16: Proceedings of the forty-eighth annual ACM symposium on Theory of Computing","June 2016","Pages   1046\u20131059","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897518.2897566"],"date":"19 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"{BE02} Olivier Bousquet and Andr\u00e9 Elisseeff.

We firstly invented a conversion algorithm to map arbitrary matrix values appropriately to memristor conductances in a realistic crossbar array, accounting for device physics and circuit issues to reduce computational errors. The accurate device resistance programming in large arrays is enabled by close-loop pulse tuning and access transistors. To validate our approach, we simulated and benchmarked one of the state-of-the-art neural networks for pattern recognition on the DPEs. The result shows no accuracy degradation compared to software approach (99 % pattern recognition accuracy for MNIST data set) with only 4 Bit DAC/ADC requirement, while the DPE can achieve a speed-efficiency product of 1,000\u00d7 to 10,000\u00d7 compared to a custom digital ASIC.","author":["Miao Hu","John Paul Strachan","Zhiyong Li","Emmanuelle M.

Due to the nature of how these memories operate, unique properties (such as non-destructive read and current-sensing) can be exploited to further subdivide memory and provide increasing parallelism with negligible overhead. In this work, we leverage these properties to design a finegrained non-volatile memory (FgNVM), featuring two-dimensional bank subdivision for tile-level parallelism (TLP) in a NVM memory bank, with much finer-granularity and increased parallelism than the one-dimensional bank subdivision for subarray-level parallelism (SALP) in a DRAM memory bank. With such new tile-level parallelism, three new memory access modes are proposed for further performance improvement and energy reduction: Partial-Activation, Multi-Activation, and Background Writes. Our experimental results show that the new architecture is highly effective in boosting non-volatile memory performance with significant energy reduction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study fine-granularity memory access in emerging non-volatile memory architectures.","author":["Matthew Poremba","Tao Zhang","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 168","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898024"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"A.

We propose an approach which distinguishes between tolerable errors in data-flow, such-as arithmetic, and intolerable errors in control-flow, such as branches and their data-dependencies. This approach is demonstrated in a new high-level synthesis compiler pass called StitchUp, which precisely identifies the control critical parts of the design, then automatically replicates only that part. We applied StitchUp to the CHStone benchmark suite and performed exhaustive hardware fault injection in each case, finding that all control-flow errors were detected while only requiring 1% circuit area overhead in the best case.","author":["Shane T.

As the Network-on-Chip (NoC) is a focal point of sensitive data transfer and critical device coordination, there is an urgent demand for secure and reliable communication. In this paper we propose Secure Model Checkers (SMCs), a real-time solution for control logic verification and functional correctness in the micro-architecture to detect Hardware Trojan (HT) induced denial-of-service attacks and improve reliability. In our evaluation, we show that SMCs provides significant security enhancements in real-time with only 1.5% power and 1.1% area overhead penalty in the micro-architecture.","author":["Travis Boraten","Dominic DiTomaso","Avinash Karanth Kodi"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '16: Proceedings of the 26th edition on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2016","Pages   45\u201350","https://doi.org/10.1145/2902961.2903032"],"date":"18 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"D.

Among these, EMOs use this method for survival selection. The worst case complexity of this problem is found to be O(NlogM-1N) when the number of objectives M is constant and the size of solutions N is varying. But this bound becomes too large when M depends on N. In this paper we are proposing a new algorithm with worst case complexity O(MNlogN+MN2), however, with reduced running time in many objective cases. This algorithm can make use of the faster implementation of sorting algorithms. It removes unnecessary comparisons among the solutions which improves the running time. The proposed algorithm is compared with four other competing algorithms on three different datasets. Experimental results show that our approach, namely, best order sort (BOS) is computationally more efficient than all other compared algorithms with respect to running time.","author":["Proteek Chandan Roy","Md.

These approaches are far from ideal in highly dynamic recommendation domains such as news recommendation and computational advertisement, where the set of items and users is very fluid. In this work, we investigate an adaptive clustering technique for content recommendation based on exploration-exploitation strategies in contextual multi-armed bandit settings. Our algorithm takes into account the collaborative effects that arise due to the interaction of the users with the items, by dynamically grouping users based on the items under consideration and, at the same time, grouping items based on the similarity of the clusterings induced over the users. The resulting algorithm thus takes advantage of preference patterns in the data in a way akin to collaborative filtering methods. We provide an empirical analysis on medium-size real-world datasets, showing scalability and increased prediction performance (as measured by click-through rate) over state-of-the-art methods for clustering bandits. We also provide a regret analysis within a standard linear stochastic noise setting.","author":["Shuai Li","Alexandros Karatzoglou","Claudio Gentile"],"issue":["SIGIR '16: Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","July 2016","Pages   539\u2013548","https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2911548"],"date":"07 July 2016","ref":[{"text":"C.

These tools often need to employ tricky, custom-built synthesis algorithms because they require synthesized programs to be not only correct, but also optimal with respect to a desired cost metric, such as program size. Finding these optimal solutions efficiently requires domain-specific search strategies, but existing synthesizers hard-code the strategy, making them difficult to reuse. This paper presents metasketches, a general framework for specifying and solving optimal synthesis problems. metasketches make the search strategy a part of the problem definition by specifying a fragmentation of the search space into an ordered set of classic sketches. We provide two cooperating search algorithms to effectively solve metasketches. A global optimizing search coordinates the activities of local searches, informing them of the costs of potentially-optimal solutions as they explore different regions of the candidate space in parallel. The local searches execute an incremental form of counterexample-guided inductive synthesis to incorporate information sent from the global search. We present Synapse, an implementation of these algorithms, and show that it effectively solves optimal synthesis problems with a variety of different cost functions. In addition, metasketches can be used to accelerate classic (non-optimal) synthesis by explicitly controlling the search strategy, and we show that Synapse solves classic synthesis problems that state-of-the-art tools cannot.","author":["James Bornholt","Emina Torlak","Dan Grossman","Luis Ceze"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 51","Issue 1","January 2016","pp   775\u2013788","https://doi.org/10.1145/2914770.2837666"],"date":"11 January 2016","ref":[{"text":"R.

To handle the sparsity problem, several recommendation techniques have been proposed that additionally consider auxiliary information to improve rating prediction accuracy. In particular, when rating data is sparse, document modeling-based approaches have improved the accuracy by additionally utilizing textual data such as reviews, abstracts, or synopses. However, due to the inherent limitation of the bag-of-words model, they have difficulties in effectively utilizing contextual information of the documents, which leads to shallow understanding of the documents. This paper proposes a novel context-aware recommendation model, convolutional matrix factorization (ConvMF) that integrates convolutional neural network (CNN) into probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF). Consequently, ConvMF captures contextual information of documents and further enhances the rating prediction accuracy. Our extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets show that ConvMF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation models even when the rating data is extremely sparse. We also demonstrate that ConvMF successfully captures subtle contextual difference of a word in a document. Our implementation and datasets are available at http://dm.postech.ac.kr/ConvMF.","author":["Donghyun Kim","Chanyoung Park","Jinoh Oh","Sungyoung Lee","Hwanjo Yu"],"issue":["RecSys '16: Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems","September 2016","Pages   233\u2013240","https://doi.org/10.1145/2959100.2959165"],"date":"07 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"F.

IP address lookup is challenging because it requires a longest matching prefix lookup. It is compounded by increasing routing table sizes, increased traffic, higher-speed links, and the migration to 128-bit IPv6 addresses. We describe how IP lookups and updates can be made faster using a set of of transformation techniques. Our main technique, controlled prefix expansion, transforms a set of prefixes into an equivalent set with fewer prefix lengths. In addition, we use optimization techniques based on dynamic programming, and local transformations of data structures to improve cache behavior. When applied to trie search, our techniques provide a range of algorithms     (Expanded Tries) whose performance can be tuned. For example, using a processor with 1MB of L2 cache, search of the MaeEast database containing 38000 prefixes can be done in 3 L2 cache accesses. On a 300MHz Pentium II which takes 4 cycles for accessing the first word of the L2 cacheline, this algorithm has a worst-case search time of 180 nsec., a worst-case insert/delete time of 2.5 msec., and an average insert/delete time of 4 usec. Expanded tries provide faster search and faster insert/delete times than earlier lookup algirthms. When applied to Binary Search on Levels, our techniques improve worst-case search times by nearly a factor of 2 (using twice as much storage) for the MaeEast database. Our approach to algorithm design is based on measurements     using the VTune tool on a Pentium to obtain dynamic clock cycle counts. Our techniques also apply to similar address lookup problems in other network protocols.","author":["V. Srinivasan","G.

Both the performance and computational complexity of such models are heavily dependant on the design of characteristic hyper-parameters (e.g., number of hidden layers, nodes per layer, or choice of activation functions), which have traditionally been optimized manually. With machine learning penetrating low-power mobile and embedded areas, the need to optimize not only for performance (accuracy), but also for implementation complexity, becomes paramount. In this work, we present a multi-objective design space exploration method that reduces the number of solution networks trained and evaluated through response surface modelling. Given spaces which can easily exceed 1020 solutions, manually designing a near-optimal architecture is unlikely as opportunities to reduce network complexity, while maintaining performance, may be overlooked. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that hyper-parameters which perform well on specific datasets may yield sub-par results on others, and must therefore be designed on a per-application basis. In our work, machine learning is leveraged by training an artificial neural network to predict the performance of future candidate networks. The method is evaluated on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 image datasets, optimizing for both recognition accuracy and computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can closely approximate the Pareto-optimal front, while only exploring a small fraction of the design space.","author":["Sean C.

They are especially powerful once annotated with semantic information such as salient regions and functional parts. We propose a novel active learning method capable of enriching massive geometric datasets with accurate semantic region annotations. Given a shape collection and a user-specified region label our goal is to correctly demarcate the corresponding regions with minimal manual work. Our active framework achieves this goal by cycling between manually annotating the regions, automatically propagating these annotations across the rest of the shapes, manually verifying both human and automatic annotations, and learning from the verification results to improve the automatic propagation algorithm. We use a unified utility function that explicitly models the time cost of human input across all steps of our method. This allows us to jointly optimize for the set of models to annotate and for the set of models to verify based on the predicted impact of these actions on the human efficiency. We demonstrate that incorporating verification of all produced labelings within this unified objective improves both accuracy and efficiency of the active learning procedure. We automatically propagate human labels across a dynamic shape network using a conditional random field (CRF) framework, taking advantage of global shape-to-shape similarities, local feature similarities, and point-to-point correspondences. By combining these diverse cues we achieve higher accuracy than existing alternatives. We validate our framework on existing benchmarks demonstrating it to be significantly more efficient at using human input compared to previous techniques. We further validate its efficiency and robustness by annotating a massive shape dataset, labeling over 93,000 shape parts, across multiple model classes, and providing a labeled part collection more than one order of magnitude larger than existing ones.","author":["Li Yi","Vladimir G.

In addition, emerging Non Volatile Memories (NVMs) such as Spin-Torque Transfer RAM (STT-RAM) have been explored as a replacement for traditional SRAM-based LLCs due to their higher density and lower leakage power. In this paper, we aim to use the benefits of the integration of STT-RAM in a 3D multi-core environment. The main challenge we try to address is the high operating temperatures. The higher power density of 3D ICs might incur temperature-related problems in reliability, power consumption, and performance. Specifically, recent works have shown that elevated operating temperatures can adversely impact STT-RAM performance. To alleviate the temperature-induced problems, we propose TAPAS, a low-cost temperature-aware adaptive block placement and migration policy, for a hybrid LLC that includes STT-RAM and SRAM structures. This technique places cache blocks according to their temperature characteristics. Specifically, the cache blocks that heat up a hot bank are recognized and migrated to a cooler bank to 1) enable those blocks to get accessed in a cooler bank with lower read/write latency and 2) reduce the number of accesses to the hotter bank. We design and evaluate a novel flow control mechanism to assign priorities to those cache blocks to reach their destination. Evaluation results reveal that TAPAS achieves, on average, 11.6% performance improvement, 6.5% power, and 5.6\u00b0C peak temperature reduction compared to a state-of-the art hybrid cache design.","author":["Majed Valad Beigi","Gokhan Memik"],"issue":["MEMSYS '16: Proceedings of the Second International Symposium on Memory Systems","October 2016","Pages   415\u2013426","https://doi.org/10.1145/2989081.2989085"],"date":"03 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"\"Gem5 simulator,\" http://gem5.org/.","order":1},{"text":"\"The NAS parallel benchmarks.,\" http://www.nas.nasa.gov/publications/npb.html.","order":2},{"text":"\"CACTI 6.5,\" http://hpl.hp.com:research/cacti/.","order":3},{"text":"\"International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductor,\" http://www.itrs.org.","order":4},{"text":"J.

Nswap2L is a novel system that transparently manages a heterogeneous set of storage options commonly found in clusters, including node RAM, disk, flash SSD, PCM, or network storage devices. Nswap2L implements a two-level device driver interface. At the top level, it appears to node operating systems (OSs) as a single, fast, random access device that can be added as a swap partition on cluster nodes. It transparently manages the underlying heterogeneous storage devices, including its own implementation of Network RAM, to which swapped out data are stored. It implements data placement, migration, and prefetching policies that choose which underlying physical devices store swapped-out page data. Its policies incorporate information about device capacity, system load, and the strengths of different physical storage media. By moving device-specific knowledge into Nswap2L, VM policies in the OS can be based solely on typical application access patterns and not on characteristics of underlying physical storage media. Nswap2L's policy decisions are abstracted from the OS, freeing the OS from having to implement specialized policies for different combinations of cluster storage---Nswap2L requires no changes to the OS's VM system. Results of our benchmark tests show that data-intensive applications perform up to 6 times faster on Nswap2L-enabled clusters, and show that our two-level device driver design adds minimal I/O latency to the underlying devices that Nswap2L manages. In addition, we found that even though Nswap2L's Network RAM is faster than any other backing store, its prefetching policy that distributes data over multiple devices results in increased I/O parallelism and can lead to better performance than swapping only to a single underlying device.","author":["Tia Newhall","E.

This observation motivates Cnvlutin (CNV), a value-based approach to hardware acceleration that eliminates most of these ineffectual operations, improving performance and energy over a state-of-the-art accelerator with no accuracy loss. CNV uses hierarchical data-parallel units, allowing groups of lanes to proceed mostly independently enabling them to skip over the ineffectual computations. A co-designed data storage format encodes the computation elimination decisions taking them off the critical path while avoiding control divergence in the data parallel units. Combined, the units and the data storage format result in a data-parallel architecture that maintains wide, aligned accesses to its memory hierarchy and that keeps its data lanes busy. By loosening the ineffectual computation identification criterion, CNV enables further performance and energy efficiency improvements, and more so if a loss in accuracy is acceptable. Experimental measurements over a set of state-of-the-art DNNs for image classification show that CNV improves performance over a state-of-the-art accelerator from 1.24\u00d7 to 1.55\u00d7 and by 1.37\u00d7 on average without any loss in accuracy by removing zero-valued operand multiplications alone. While CNV incurs an area overhead of 4.49%, it improves overall EDP (Energy Delay Product) and ED2P (Energy Delay Squared Product) on average by 1.47\u00d7 and 2.01\u00d7, respectively. The average performance improvements increase to 1.52\u00d7 without any loss in accuracy with a broader ineffectual identification policy. Further improvements are demonstrated with a loss in accuracy.","author":["Jorge Albericio","Patrick Judd","Tayler Hetherington","Tor Aamodt","Natalie Enright Jerger","Andreas Moshovos"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 44","Issue 3","June 2016","pp   1\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/3007787.3001138"],"date":"18 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"K.

Public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, enable secure peer-to-peer applications like crypto-currency or smart contracts. Their security and performance are well studied. This paper concerns recent private blockchain systems designed with stronger security (trust) assumption and performance requirement. These systems target and aim to disrupt applications which have so far been implemented on top of database systems, for example banking, finance and trading applications. Multiple platforms for private blockchains are being actively developed and fine tuned. However, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which different systems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can be used to assess blockchains' viability as another distributed data processing platform, while helping developers to identify bottlenecks and accordingly improve their platforms. In this paper, we first describe BLOCKBENCH, the first evaluation framework for analyzing private blockchains. It serves as a fair means of comparison for different platforms and enables deeper understanding of different system design choices. Any private blockchain can be integrated to BLOCKBENCH via simple APIs and benchmarked against workloads that are based on real and synthetic smart contracts. BLOCKBENCH measures overall and component-wise performance in terms of throughput, latency, scalability and fault-tolerance. Next, we use BLOCKBENCH to conduct comprehensive evaluation of three major private blockchains: Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate that these systems are still far from displacing current database systems in traditional data processing workloads. Furthermore, there are gaps in performance among the three systems which are attributed to the design choices at different layers of the blockchain's software stack. We have released BLOCKBENCH for public use.","author":["Tien Tuan Anh Dinh","Ji Wang","Gang Chen","Rui Liu","Beng Chin Ooi","Kian-Lee Tan"],"issue":["SIGMOD '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data","May 2017","Pages   1085\u20131100","https://doi.org/10.1145/3035918.3064033"],"date":"09 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"BlockBench: private blockchains benchmarking. https://github.com/ooibc88/blockbench.","order":1},{"text":"Ethereum blockchain app platform. https://www.ethereum.org/.","order":2},{"text":"Ibm watson iot. http://www.ibm.com/internet-of-things.","order":3},{"text":"Leveldb. https://leveldb.org.","order":4},{"text":"Monax: The ecosystem application platform. https://monax.io.","order":5},{"text":"Rocksdb. https://rocksdb.org.","order":6},{"text":"M.

This task was nearly impossible years ago due to the lack of reliable data sources, yet the emergence of geo-tagged social media (GTSM) data sheds new light on it. Recently, there have been fruitful studies on discovering geographical topics from GTSM data. However, their high computational costs and strong distributional assumptions about the latent topics hinder them from fully unleashing the power of GTSM. To bridge the gap, we present CrossMap, a novel cross-modal representation learning method that uncovers urban dynamics with massive GTSM data. CrossMap first employs an accelerated mode seeking procedure to detect spatiotemporal hotspots underlying people's activities. Those detected hotspots not only address spatiotemporal variations, but also largely alleviate the sparsity of the GTSM data. With the detected hotspots, CrossMap then jointly embeds all spatial, temporal, and textual units into the same space using two different strategies: one is reconstruction-based and the other is graph-based. Both strategies capture the correlations among the units by encoding their co-occurrence and neighborhood relationships, and learn low-dimensional representations to preserve such correlations. Our experiments demonstrate that CrossMap not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for activity recovery and classification, but also achieves much better efficiency.","author":["Chao Zhang","Keyang Zhang","Quan Yuan","Haoruo Peng","Yu Zheng","Tim Hanratty","Shaowen Wang","Jiawei Han"],"issue":["WWW '17: Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web","April 2017","Pages   361\u2013370","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052601"],"date":"03 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"H.

Although machine learning solutions show benefits over lithography simulation and pattern matching based methods, it is still hard to select a proper model for large scale problems and it is inevitable that performance degradation will occur. To overcome these issues, in this paper we develop a deep learning framework for high performance and large scale hotspot detection. First, feature tensor generation is proposed to extract representative layout features that fit well with convolutional neural networks while keeping the spatial relationship of the original layout pattern with minimal information loss. Second, we propose a biased learning algorithm to train the convolutional neural network to further improve detection accuracy with small false alarm penalties.

While state-of-the-art low-latency approximate adders provide an accuracy-area-latency configurable design space, the selection of a particular configuration from the design space is still manually done. In this paper, we analytically analyze different structural properties of low-latency approximate adders to formulate a new adder model, Quality-area optimal Low-Latency approximate Adder (QuAd). It provides an increased design space as compared to state-of-the-art, providing design points that require less logic area for the same accuracy, as compared to state-of-the-art approximate adders. Furthermore, based upon our mathematical analysis, we show that, provided a latency constraint, an adder configuration with the highest quality and lowest area requirement can effortlessly be selected from the whole design space of QuAd adder model, without requiring any optimization strategy or numerical simulation. Our experimental results validate the developed model and also the quality-area optimality of our optimal QuAd adder configuration. For functional verification and prototyping, we have used a Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA. RTL/behavioral models and MATLAB equivalent scripts, of our proposed adder model are made open source, to facilitate further research and development.","author":["Muhammad Abdullah Hanif","Rehan Hafiz","Osman Hasan","Muhammad Shafique"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 42","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062306"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

With a fully-convolutional neural network, we can complete images of arbitrary resolutions by filling-in missing regions of any shape. To train this image completion network to be consistent, we use global and local context discriminators that are trained to distinguish real images from completed ones. The global discriminator looks at the entire image to assess if it is coherent as a whole, while the local discriminator looks only at a small area centered at the completed region to ensure the local consistency of the generated patches. The image completion network is then trained to fool the both context discriminator networks, which requires it to generate images that are indistinguishable from real ones with regard to overall consistency as well as in details. We show that our approach can be used to complete a wide variety of scenes. Furthermore, in contrast with the patch-based approaches such as PatchMatch, our approach can generate fragments that do not appear elsewhere in the image, which allows us to naturally complete the images of objects with familiar and highly specific structures, such as faces.","author":["Satoshi Iizuka","Edgar Simo-Serra","Hiroshi Ishikawa"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 36","Issue 4","July 2017","Article No.: 107","pp   1\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/3072959.3073659"],"date":"20 July 2017","ref":[{"text":"Coloma Ballester, Marcelo Bertalm\u00edo, Vicent Caselles, Guillermo Sapiro, and Joan Verdera. 2001.

The former refers to forums or E-commerce sites that emphasize user-item interactions, like Trip.com and Amazon; whereas the latter refers to social networking services (SNSs) that have rich user-user connections, such as Facebook and Twitter. Despite their heterogeneity, these two domains can be bridged by a few overlapping users, dubbed as bridge users. In this work, we address the problem of cross-domain social recommendation, i.e., recommending relevant items of information domains to potential users of social networks. To our knowledge, this is a new problem that has rarely been studied before. Existing cross-domain recommender systems are unsuitable for this task since they have either focused on homogeneous information domains or assumed that users are fully overlapped. Towards this end, we present a novel Neural Social Collaborative Ranking (NSCR) approach, which seamlessly sews up the user-item interactions in information domains and user-user connections in SNSs. In the information domain part, the attributes of users and items are leveraged to strengthen the embedding learning of users and items. In the SNS part, the embeddings of bridge users are propagated to learn the embeddings of other non-bridge users. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our NSCR method.","author":["Xiang Wang","Xiangnan He","Liqiang Nie","Tat-Seng Chua"],"issue":["SIGIR '17: Proceedings of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2017","Pages   185\u2013194","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080771"],"date":"07 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Immanuel Bayer, Xiangnan He, Bhargav Kanagal, and Steffen Rendle. 2017.

Specifically, in the proposed framework there are two stages: graph construction and embedding learning. In the first stage, we propose a generalized network construction method to build a network involving heterogeneous nodes and a mixture of both homogeneous and heterogeneous relations. The second stage leverages the concept of neighborhood proximity to learn the embeddings of both items and words. With the proposed carefully designed ICE networks, the resulting embedding facilitates both homogeneous and heterogeneous retrieval, including item-to-item and word-to-item retrieval. Moreover, as a distributed embedding approach, the proposed ICE approach not only generates related retrieval results but also delivers more diverse results than traditional keyword-matching-based approaches. As our experiments on two real-world datasets show, ICE encodes useful textual information and thus outperforms traditional methods in various item classification and retrieval tasks.","author":["Chuan-Ju Wang","Ting-Hsiang Wang","Hsiu-Wei Yang","Bo-Sin Chang","Ming-Feng Tsai"],"issue":["SIGIR '17: Proceedings of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2017","Pages   85\u201394","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080807"],"date":"07 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Yoshua Bengio, R\u00e9jean Ducharme, Pascal Vincent, and Christian Janvin 2003.

Since this is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, it is important to study techniques that can make it run fast on parallel hardware. In this paper, we provide the first analysis of a technique called Buck-wild! that uses both asynchronous execution and low-precision computation. We introduce the DMGC model, the first conceptualization of the parameter space that exists when implementing low-precision SGD, and show that it provides a way to both classify these algorithms and model their performance. We leverage this insight to propose and analyze techniques to improve the speed of low-precision SGD. First, we propose software optimizations that can increase throughput on existing CPUs by up to 11X. Second, we propose architectural changes, including a new cache technique we call an obstinate cache, that increase throughput beyond the limits of current-generation hardware. We also implement and analyze low-precision SGD on the FPGA, which is a promising alternative to the CPU for future SGD systems.","author":["Christopher De Sa","Matthew Feldman","Christopher R\u00e9","Kunle Olukotun"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   561\u2013574","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080248"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"BOOST C++ Libraries. http://www.boost.org.","order":1},{"text":"Alekh Agarwal, Olivier Chapelle, Miroslav Dud\u00edk, and John Langford. 2011.

Therefore, it is important to study patient subtyping, which is grouping of patients into disease characterizing subtypes. Subtyping from complex patient data is challenging because of the information heterogeneity and temporal dynamics. Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) has been successfully used in many domains for processing sequential data, and recently applied for analyzing longitudinal patient records. The LSTM units are designed to handle data with constant elapsed times between consecutive elements of a sequence. Given that time lapse between successive elements in patient records can vary from days to months, the design of traditional LSTM may lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel LSTM unit called Time-Aware LSTM (T-LSTM) to handle irregular time intervals in longitudinal patient records. We learn a subspace decomposition of the cell memory which enables time decay to discount the memory content according to the elapsed time. We propose a patient subtyping model that leverages the proposed T-LSTM in an auto-encoder to learn a powerful single representation for sequential records of patients, which are then used to cluster patients into clinical subtypes. Experiments on synthetic and real world datasets show that the proposed T-LSTM architecture captures the underlying structures in the sequences with time irregularities.","author":["Inci M.

HIN based recommenders face two problems: how to represent the high-level semantics of recommendations and how to fuse the heterogeneous information to make recommendations. In this paper, we solve the two problems by first introducing the concept of meta-graph to HIN-based recommendation, and then solving the information fusion problem with a \"matrix factorization (MF) + factorization machine (FM)\" approach. For the similarities generated by each meta-graph, we perform standard MF to generate latent features for both users and items. With different meta-graph based features, we propose to use FM with Group lasso (FMG) to automatically learn from the observed ratings to effectively select useful meta-graph based features. Experimental results on two real-world datasets, Amazon and Yelp, show the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art FM and other HIN-based recommendation algorithms.","author":["Huan Zhao","Quanming Yao","Jianda Li","Yangqiu Song","Dik Lun Lee"],"issue":["KDD '17: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2017","Pages   635\u2013644","https://doi.org/10.1145/3097983.3098063"],"date":"04 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"P.

However, because of the drawbacks of collaborative-based methods such as sparsity, cold start, etc., more attention has been drawn to hybrid methods that consider both the rating and content information. Most of the previous works in this area cannot learn a good representation from content for recommendation task or consider only text modality of the content, thus their methods are very limited in current multimedia scenario. This paper proposes a Bayesian generative model called collaborative variational autoencoder (CVAE) that considers both rating and content for recommendation in multimedia scenario. The model learns deep latent representations from content data in an unsupervised manner and also learns implicit relationships between items and users from both content and rating. Unlike previous works with denoising criteria, the proposed CVAE learns a latent distribution for content in latent space instead of observation space through an inference network and can be easily extended to other multimedia modalities other than text. Experiments show that CVAE is able to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art recommendation methods with more robust performance.","author":["Xiaopeng Li","James She"],"issue":["KDD '17: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2017","Pages   305\u2013314","https://doi.org/10.1145/3097983.3098077"],"date":"04 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Gediminas Adomavicius and Alexander Tuzhilin 2005.

For example, different RDF vocabularies may be utilized to describe pharmacogenomic data, and the same drug or gene is represented by different RDF graphs in DBpedia or Drug-bank. To provide a unified representation of the same real-world entity, RDF graphs need to be semantically integrated. Semantic integration requires the management of knowledge encoded in RDF vocabularies to determine the relatedness of different RDF representations of the same entity, e.g., axiomatic definition of vocabulary properties or resource equivalences. We devise MINTE, an integration technique that relies on both: knowledge stated in RDF vocabularies and semantic similarity measures to merge semantically equivalent RDF graphs, i.e., graphs corresponding to the same real-world entity. MINTE follows a two-fold approach to solve the problem of integrating RDF graphs. In the first step, MINTE implements a 1--1 weighted perfect matching algorithm to identify semantically equivalent RDF entities in different graphs. Then, MINTE relies on different fusion policies to merge triples from these semantically equivalent RDF entities. We empirically evaluate the performance of MINTE on data from DBpedia, Wiki-data, and Drugbank. The experimental results suggest that MINTE is able to accurately integrate semantically equivalent RDF graphs.","author":["Diego Collarana","Mikhail Galkin","Ignacio Traverso-Rib\u00f3n","Maria-Esther Vidal","Christoph Lange","S\u00f6ren Auer"],"issue":["WIMS '17: Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Web Intelligence, Mining and Semantics","June 2017","Article No.: 22","Pages   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/3102254.3102280"],"date":"19 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"M.

After years of having its abstractions bypassed via virtualization, the kernel has responded with a native container abstraction that is eagerly being applied in the cloud. In this paper, we point out that history is repeating itself: with the introduction of serverless computing, even the native container abstraction is ill-suited. We show that bypassing the kernel with unikernels can yield at least a factor of 6 better latency and throughput. Facing a more complex kernel than ever and a relatively undemanding computing model, we must revisit the question of whether the kernel should try to adapt, we should continue bypassing the kernel, or if it is finally time to try a new native OS for this important future cloud workload.","author":["Ricardo Koller","Dan Williams"],"issue":["HotOS '17: Proceedings of the 16th Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems","May 2017","Pages   169\u2013173","https://doi.org/10.1145/3102980.3103008"],"date":"07 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"2016.

As the performance of these cores steadily improves there are opportunities to repurpose these cores to perform application driven computations on stored data, with the aim of reducing the communication between the host processor and the SSD. Reducing host-SSD bandwidth demand cuts down the I/O time which is a bottleneck for many applications operating on large data sets. However, the embedded core performance is still significantly lower than the host processor, as generally wimpy embedded cores are used within SSD for cost effective reasons. So there is a trade-off between the computation overhead associated with near SSD processing and the reduction in communication overhead to the host system. In this work, we design a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that can be used by the host application to offload a data intensive task to the SSD processor. We describe how these APIs can be implemented by simple modifications to the existing Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) command interface between the host and the SSD processor. We then quantify the computation versus communication tradeoffs for near storage computing using applications from two important domains, namely data analytics and data integration. Using a fully functional SSD evaluation platform we perform design space exploration of our proposed approach by varying the bandwidth and computation capabilities of the SSD processor. We evaluate static and dynamic approaches for dividing the work between the host and SSD processor, and show that our design may improve the performance by up to 20% when compared to processing at the host processor only, and 6X when compared to processing at the SSD processor only.","author":["Gunjae Koo","Kiran Kumar Matam","Te I","H.

Despite the availability of many information visualisation guidelines, those who are tasked to produce knowledge visualisations currently do so without any formal guidance. These unguided efforts do not reliably deliver efficacious visualisations. The research reported in this paper sought first to delineate the essence of knowledge visualisation. We captured this essence in the form of a comprehensive definition as well as a list of essential criteria exhibited by effective knowledge visualisations. Using these, we moved on to address the lack of guidance by producing a set of knowledge visualisation guidelines. We report on how we derived and evaluated these guidelines. The guidelines, despite the rigorous derivation process, did not help the evaluators to produce effective visualisations. We reflect on the reasons for this and report on a number of lessons learned during the process. We conclude by suggesting a direction for future research.","author":["karen renaud","Judy van Biljon"],"issue":["SAICSIT '17: Proceedings of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists","September 2017","Article No.: 30","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3129416.3129421"],"date":"26 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"Maryam Alavi and Dorothy E Leidner. 2001.

These data, which are often noisy or inexact, can be represented by uncertain graphs, whose edges are associated with probabilities to indicate the chances that they exist. Recently, researchers have studied various algorithms (e.g., clustering, classification, and k-NN) for uncertain graphs. These solutions face two problems: (1) high dimensionality: uncertain graphs are often highly complex, which can affect the mining quality; and (2) low reusability, where an existing mining algorithm has to be redesigned to deal with uncertain graphs. To tackle these problems, we propose a solution called URGE, or UnceRtain Graph Embedding. Given an uncertain graph G, URGE generates G's embedding, or a set of low-dimensional vectors, which carry the proximity information of nodes in G. This embedding enables the dimensionality of G to be reduced, without destroying node proximity information. Due to its simplicity, existing mining solutions can be used on the embedding. We investigate two low- and high-order node proximity measures in the embedding generation process, and develop novel algorithms to enable fast evaluation.   To our best knowledge, there is no prior study on the use of embedding for uncertain graphs. We have further performed extensive experiments for clustering, classification, and k-NN on several uncertain graph datasets. Our results show that URGE attains better effectiveness than current uncertain data mining algorithms, as well as state-of-the-art embedding solutions. The embedding and mining performance is also highly efficient in our experiments.","author":["Jiafeng Hu","Reynold Cheng","Zhipeng Huang","Yixang Fang","Siqiang Luo"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   157\u2013166","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132885"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"Amr Ahmed, Nino Shervashidze, Shravan Narayanamurthy, Vanja Josifovski, and Alexander J.

However, researchers found deep learning systems to be vulnerable to small, specially crafted perturbations that are imperceptible to humans. Such perturbations cause deep learning systems to mis-classify adversarial examples, with potentially disastrous consequences where safety or security is crucial. Prior defenses against adversarial examples either targeted specific attacks or were shown to be ineffective. We propose MagNet, a framework for defending neural network classifiers against adversarial examples. MagNet neither modifies the protected classifier nor requires knowledge of the process for generating adversarial examples. MagNet includes one or more separate detector networks and a reformer network. The detector networks learn to differentiate between normal and adversarial examples by approximating the manifold of normal examples. Since they assume no specific process for generating adversarial examples, they generalize well. The reformer network moves adversarial examples towards the manifold of normal examples, which is effective for correctly classifying adversarial examples with small perturbation. We discuss the intrinsic difficulties in defending against whitebox attack and propose a mechanism to defend against graybox attack. Inspired by the use of randomness in cryptography, we use diversity to strengthen MagNet. We show empirically that MagNet is effective against the most advanced state-of-the-art attacks in blackbox and graybox scenarios without sacrificing false positive rate on normal examples.","author":["Dongyu Meng","Hao Chen"],"issue":["CCS '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2017","Pages   135\u2013147","https://doi.org/10.1145/3133956.3134057"],"date":"30 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Mariusz Bojarski, Davide Del Testa, Daniel Dworakowski, Bernhard Firner, Beat Flepp, Prasoon Goyal, Lawrence D Jackel, Mathew Monfort, Urs Muller, Jiakai Zhang, et al.

In this paper, we suggest a different notion of smart spaces, where the radio environment is programmable to achieve desirable link quality within the space. We envision deploying low-cost devices embedded in the walls of a building to passively reflect or actively transmit radio signals. This is a significant departure from typical approaches to optimizing endpoint radios and individual links to improve performance. In contrast to previous work combating or leveraging per-link multipath fading, we actively reconfigure the multipath propagation. We sketch design and implementation directions for such a programmable radio environment, highlighting the computational and operational challenges our architecture faces. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the efficacy of using passive elements to change the wireless channel, shifting frequency \"nulls\" by nine Wi-Fi subcarriers, changing the 2 x 2 MIMO channel condition number by 1.5 dB, and attenuating or enhancing signal strength by up to 26 dB.","author":["Allen Welkie","Longfei Shangguan","Jeremy Gummeson","Wenjun Hu","Kyle Jamieson"],"issue":["HotNets-XVI: Proceedings of the 16th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks","November 2017","Pages   36\u201342","https://doi.org/10.1145/3152434.3152456"],"date":"30 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"O.

Even though it has been shown that FPGAs can compete with GPUs in terms of performance for stencil computation, most previous work achieve this by avoiding spatial blocking and restricting input dimensions relative to FPGA on-chip memory. In this work we create a stencil accelerator using Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL that achieves high performance without having such restrictions. We combine spatial and temporal blocking to avoid input size restrictions, and employ multiple FPGA-specific optimizations to tackle issues arisen from the added design complexity. Accelerator parameter tuning is guided by our performance model, which we also use to project performance for the upcoming Intel Stratix 10 devices. On an Arria 10 GX 1150 device, our accelerator can reach up to 760 and 375 GFLOP/s of compute performance, for 2D and 3D stencils, respectively, which rivals the performance of a highly-optimized GPU implementation. Furthermore, we estimate that the upcoming Stratix 10 devices can achieve a performance of up to 3.5 TFLOP/s and 1.6 TFLOP/s for 2D and 3D stencil computation, respectively.","author":["Hamid Reza Zohouri","Artur Podobas","Satoshi Matsuoka"],"issue":["FPGA '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2018","Pages   153\u2013162","https://doi.org/10.1145/3174243.3174248"],"date":"15 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"R.

To spur detailed routing research, ISPD 2018 initial detailed routing contest is hosted and it is the first ISPD contest on detailed routing problem. In this contest, the benchmarks synthesized by industrial tool and library are released, which consider the design rules like spacing table, cut spacing, end-of-line spacing, and min-area rules. In addition, the global routing guide is provided associated to each benchmark, and detailed routers are required to honor the routing guides as much as possible meanwhile minimize design-rule-checking (DRC) violations. The biggest benchmark released in this contest has near-millions of nets, so the runtime and memory scalability for detailed routers need to be well addressed. To reduce routers' runtime, the deterministic multithreading framework is encouraged but optional in this contest.","author":["Stefanus Mantik","Gracieli Posser","Wing-Kai Chow","Yixiao Ding","Wen-Hao Liu"],"issue":["ISPD '18: Proceedings of the 2018 International Symposium on Physical Design","March 2018","Pages   140\u2013143","https://doi.org/10.1145/3177540.3177562"],"date":"25 March 2018","ref":[{"text":"V.

DeepSecure targets scenarios in which neither of the involved parties including the cloud servers that hold the DL model parameters or the delegating clients who own the data is willing to reveal their information. Our framework is the first to empower accurate and scalable DL analysis of data generated by distributed clients without sacrificing the security to maintain efficiency. The secure DL computation in DeepSecure is performed using Yao's Garbled Circuit (GC) protocol. We devise GC-optimized realization of various components used in DL. Our optimized implementation achieves up to 58-fold higher throughput per sample compared with the best prior solution. In addition to the optimized GC realization, we introduce a set of novel low-overhead pre-processing techniques which further reduce the GC overall runtime in the context of DL. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate up to two orders-of-magnitude additional runtime improvement achieved as a result of our pre-processing methodology.","author":["Bita Darvish Rouhani","M.

Key properties of HD computing include a well-defined set of arithmetic operations on hypervectors, generality, scalability, robustness, fast learning, and ubiquitous parallel operations. HD computing is about manipulating and comparing large patterns---binary hypervectors with 10,000 dimensions---making its efficient realization on minimalistic ultra-low-power platforms challenging. This paper describes HD computing's acceleration and its optimization of memory accesses and operations on a silicon prototype of the PULPv3 4-core platform (1.5 mm2, 2 mW), surpassing the state-of-the-art classification accuracy (on average 92.4%) with simultaneous 3.7\u00d7 end-to-end speed-up and 2\u00d7 energy saving compared to its single-core execution. We further explore the scalability of our accelerator by increasing the number of inputs and classification window on a new generation of the PULP architecture featuring bit-manipulation instruction extensions and larger number of 8 cores. These together enable a near ideal speed-up of 18.4\u00d7 compared to the single-core PULPv3.","author":["Fabio Montagna","Abbas Rahimi","Simone Benatti","Davide Rossi","Luca Benini"],"issue":["DAC '18: Proceedings of the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2018","Article No.: 111","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3196096"],"date":"24 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"D.

To this end, we explore the implementation space and discuss the techniques of optimizing the performance of the streaming kernels using the Intel OpenCL SDK for FPGA. On the Nallatech 385A FPGA platform that features an Arria 10 GX1150 FPGA, the experimental results show that FPGA resources, such as block RAMs and DSPs, can limit the performance of a kernel before the constraint of memory bandwidth takes effect. Kernel vectorization and compute unit duplication are practical optimization techniques that can improve the kernel performance by a factor of 2.8 to 10. The combination of the two techniques can improve the performance by a factor of 3.3 to 16, achieving the highest performance. To improve the performance of streaming kernels with compute unit duplication, the local work size needs to be tuned. The optimal value can increase the performance of a duplicated kernel without tuning by a factor of 3 to 70.","author":["Zheming Jin","Hal Finkel"],"issue":["IWOCL '18: Proceedings of the International Workshop on OpenCL","May 2018","Article No.: 1","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3204919.3204920"],"date":"14 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"Koch, D., Hannig, F. and Ziener, D. eds., 2016.

Autostacker combines an innovative hierarchical stacking architecture and an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to perform efficient parameter search without the need for prior domain knowledge about the data or feature preprocessing. Using EA, Autostacker quickly evolves candidate pipelines with high predictive accuracy. These pipelines can be used in their given form, or serve as a starting point for further augmentation and refinement by human experts. Autostacker finds innovative machine learning model combinations and structures, rather than selecting a single model and optimizing its hyperparameters. When its performance on fifteen datasets is compared with that of other AutoML systems, Autostacker produces superior or competitive results in terms of both test accuracy and time cost.","author":["Boyuan Chen","Harvey Wu","Warren Mo","Ishanu Chattopadhyay","Hod Lipson"],"issue":["GECCO '18: Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference","July 2018","Pages   402\u2013409","https://doi.org/10.1145/3205455.3205586"],"date":"02 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"James Bergstra, Dan Yamins, and David D Cox. 2013.

The limited resources problem requires efforts to build new and improved Arabic corpora and lexica. We propose a class-specific sentiment analysis (CLASENTI) framework. The framework includes a new annotation approach to build multi-faceted Arabic corpus and lexicon allowing for simultaneous annotation of different facets, including domains, dialects, linguistic issues, and polarity strengths. Each of these facets has multiple classes (e.g., the nine classes representing dialects found in the Arab world). The new corpus and lexicon annotations facilitate the development of new class-specific classification models and polarity strength calculation. For the new sentiment classification models, we propose a hybrid model combining corpus-based and lexicon-based models. The corpus-based model has two interrelated phases to build; (1) full-corpus classification models for all facets; and (2) class-specific models trained on filtered subsets of the corpus according to the performances of the full-corpus models. To calculate polarity strengths, the lexicon-based model filters the annotated lexicon based on the specific classes of the domain and dialect. As a case study, we collect and annotate 15274 reviews from various sources, including surveys, Facebook comments, and Twitter posts, pertaining to governmental services. In addition, we develop a new web-based application to apply the proposed framework on the case study. CLASENTI framework reaches up to 95% accuracy and 93% F1-Score surpassing the best-known sentiment classifiers implemented in Scikit-learn library that achieve 82% accuracy and 81% F1-Score for Arabic when tested on the same dataset.","author":["Ali Hamdi","Khaled Shaban","Anazida Zainal"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing","Volume 17","Issue 4","August 2018","Article No.: 32","pp   1\u201328","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209885"],"date":"21 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"O.

Significant progresses have been made by deep neural networks. However, background information and hidden relations beyond the context, which play crucial roles in human text comprehension, have received little attention in recent deep neural networks that achieve the state of the art in ranking QA pairs. In the paper, we propose KABLSTM, a Knowledge-aware Attentive Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, which leverages external knowledge from knowledge graphs (KG) to enrich the representational learning of QA sentences. Specifically, we develop a context-knowledge interactive learning architecture, in which a context-guided attentive convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to integrate knowledge embeddings into sentence representations. Besides, a knowledge-aware attention mechanism is presented to attend interrelations between each segments of QA pairs. KABLSTM is evaluated on two widely-used benchmark QA datasets: WikiQA and TREC QA. Experiment results demonstrate that KABLSTM has robust superiority over competitors and sets state-of-the-art.","author":["Ying Shen","Yang Deng","Min Yang","Yaliang Li","Nan Du","Wei Fan","Kai Lei"],"issue":["SIGIR '18: The 41st International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research & Development in Information Retrieval","June 2018","Pages   901\u2013904","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210081"],"date":"27 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Jason Weston, and Oksana Yakhnenko. 2013.

These two step methods are different from classical Runge-Kutta methods in that evaluations of F made at the previous point are used along with those made at the current point in order to obtain the solution at the next point. If the stepsize is fixed, this use of previous computations makes it possible to obtain the solution at the next point by evaluating F two or three times for the third or fourth order method, respectively.These methods are consistent with the initial value problem and are shown to be convergent with its unique solution under certain restrictions.

Currently, OpenCL, the parallel programming standard for heterogeneous computing, contains mainly low-level APIs to interact with the runtime and hardware device of each individual vendor. To apply efficient scheduling algorithm, the overall execution flow and information of OpenCL kernels must be considered. In this paper, we proposed computational graph support for OpenCL. The framework features computational graphs that store meta-data and execution dependencies of kernels. We then provide scheduling framework for OpenCL programs based on the graph information. In our optimization framework, the kernel task scheduling is based on the graph model. In addition, we have kernel code analysis for target device decision as well as runtime work-group size optimization. The preliminary experimental results show that our scheme enables significant performance enhancement, achieving about 1.59 times speedup relative to our neural network program baseline.","author":["Shih-Huan Chien","Yuan-Ming Chang","Chun-Chieh Yang","Yuan-Shin Hwang","Jenq-Kuen Lee"],"issue":["ICPP '18: Proceedings of the 47th International Conference on Parallel Processing Companion","August 2018","Article No.: 14","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.1145/3229710.3229724"],"date":"13 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"J.

Given the large size and heterogeneity of the data, it is currently unclear whether data analytics frameworks will require high performance and large capacity memory to cope with this change and exactly what role main memory subsystems will play; particularly in terms of energy efficiency. In this paper, we investigate how the choice of DRAM (high-end vs low-end) impacts the performance of Hadoop, Spark, and MPI based Big Data workloads in the presence of different storage types on a local cluster. Our results show that Hadoop workloads do not require high capacity memory. However, Spark and MPI based workloads require large capacity memory. Moreover, Increasing memory bandwidth through the increasing memory frequency or the number of channels does not improve the performance of Hadoop workloads while iterative tasks in Spark and MPI benefits from high bandwidth memory. Among the configurable parameters, our results indicate that increasing the number of DRAM channels reduces DRAM power and improves the energy-efficiency across all applications.","author":["Hosein Mohammadi Makrani","Hossein Sayadi","Sai Manoj Pudukotai Dinakarra","Setareh Rafatirad","Houman Homayoun"],"issue":["MEMSYS '18: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Memory Systems","October 2018","Pages   19\u201330","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240302.3240320"],"date":"01 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"{n. d.}.","order":1},{"text":"{n. d.}.","order":2},{"text":"Sanjay P Ahuja, Thomas F Furman, Kerwin E Roslie, and Jared T Wheeler. 2013.

In the literature, two of the most popular approaches are based on factorization and graph-based models; the former approach captures user preferences by factorizing the observed direct interactions between users and items, and the latter extracts indirect preferences from the graphs constructed by user-item interactions. In this paper we present HOP-Rec, a unified and efficient method that incorporates the two approaches. The proposed method involves random surfing on a graph to harvest high-order information among neighborhood items for each user. Instead of factorizing a transition matrix, our method introduces a confidence weighting parameter to simulate all high-order information simultaneously, for which we maintain a sparse user-item interaction matrix and enrich the matrix for each user using random walks. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art on a range of large-scale real-world datasets.","author":["Jheng-Hong Yang","Chih-Ming Chen","Chuan-Ju Wang","Ming-Feng Tsai"],"issue":["RecSys '18: Proceedings of the 12th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems","September 2018","Pages   140\u2013144","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240323.3240381"],"date":"27 September 2018","ref":[{"text":"Fabian Christoffel, Bibek Paudel, Chris Newell, and Abraham Bernstein. 2015.

Processing in-memory (PIM) and binary CNN have been proposed to alleviate the number of memory accesses and footprints, respectively. By combining the two separate concepts, we propose a novel processing in-DRAM framework for binary CNN, called NID, where dominant convolution operations are processed using in-DRAM bulk bitwise operations. We first identify the problem that the bitcount operations with only bulk bitwise AND/OR/NOT incur significant overhead in terms of delay when the size of kernels gets larger. Then, we not only optimize the performance by efficiently allocating inputs and kernels to DRAM banks for both convolutional and fully-connected layers through design space explorations, but also mitigate the overhead of bitcount operations by splitting kernels into multiple parts. Partial sum accumulations and tasks of the other layers such as max-pooling and normalization layers are processed in the peripheral area of DRAM with negligible overheads. In results, our NID framework achieves 19X-36X performance and 9X-14X EDP improvements for convolutional layers, and 9X-17X performance and 1.4X-4.5X EDP improvements for fully-connected layers over previous PIM technique in four large-scale CNN models.","author":["Jaehyeong Sim","Hoseok Seol","Lee-Sup Kim"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 10","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240831"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"A.

It takes a viewport-adaptive approach, which fetches only portions of a panoramic scene that cover what a viewer is about to perceive. We conduct an IRB-approved user study where we collect head movement traces from 130 diverse users to gain insights on how to design the viewport prediction mechanism for Flare. We then develop novel online algorithms that determine which spatial portions to fetch and their corresponding qualities. We also innovate other components in the streaming pipeline such as decoding and server-side transmission. Through extensive evaluations (~400 hours' playback on WiFi and ~100 hours over LTE), we show that Flare significantly improves the QoE in real-world settings. Compared to non-viewport-adaptive approaches, Flare yields up to 18x quality level improvement on WiFi, and achieves high bandwidth reduction (up to 35%) and video quality enhancement (up to 4.9x) on LTE.","author":["Feng Qian","Bo Han","Qingyang Xiao","Vijay Gopalakrishnan"],"issue":["MobiCom '18: Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking","October 2018","Pages   99\u2013114","https://doi.org/10.1145/3241539.3241565"],"date":"15 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"360 Google Spotlight Story: Help. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-XZhKqQAHU.","order":1},{"text":"360DEG Great Hammerhead Shark Encounter. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG4jSz_2HDY.","order":2},{"text":"Android MediaCodec API. https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaCodec.html.","order":3},{"text":"Elephants on the Brink. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bpICIClAIg.","order":4},{"text":"GT-R Drives First EVER 360 VR lap. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD4XfM2TZ2k.","order":5},{"text":"Linux Packet Filtering framework. https://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO/packet-filtering-HOWTO.html.","order":6},{"text":"Mega Coaster: Get Ready for the Drop. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNN-bJQ4vI.","order":7},{"text":"Per-Title Encode Optimization. https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/per-title-encode-optimization-7e99442b62a2 .","order":8},{"text":"Pony Stable Playhouse for the Currys. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWg1kjMmr3k.","order":9},{"text":"Under the hood: Building 360 video. https://code.facebook.com/posts/1638767863078802.","order":10},{"text":"Visit Hamilton Island in 360DEG Virtual Reality with Qantas. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJype_TafRk.","order":11},{"text":"What Is Per-Title Encoding?. https://bitmovin.com/per-title-encoding/.","order":12},{"text":"YouTube live in 360 degrees encoder settings. https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6396222.","order":13},{"text":"360DEG, Angel Falls, Venezuela. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_tqK4eqelA.","order":14},{"text":"4G/LTE Bandwidth Logs. http://users.ugent.be/~jvdrhoof/dataset-4g/.","order":15},{"text":"Feel wimbledon with andy murray. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krl6U15OERo.","order":16},{"text":"Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon/processors/835.","order":17},{"text":"Skydive in 360DEG virtual reality via gopro. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5XXsRuMPIU.","order":18},{"text":"Tomorrowland 2014 | 360 degrees of madness. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j81DDY4nvos.","order":19},{"text":"O.

Many state-of-the-art models incorporate fact sequences, entity types, and even textual information. Unfortunately, most of them do not fully take advantage of rich structural information in a KG, i.e., connectivity patterns around each entity. In this paper, we propose a context-aware convolutional learning (CACL) model which jointly learns from entities and their multi-hop neighborhoods. Since we directly utilize the connectivity patterns contained in each multi-hop neighborhood, the structural role similarity among entities can be better captured, resulting in more informative entity and relation embeddings. Specifically, CACL collects entities and relations from the multi-hop neighborhood as contextual information according to their relative importance and uniquely maps them to a linear vector space. Our convolutional architecture leverages a deep learning technique to represent each entity along with its linearly mapped contextual information. Thus, we can elaborately extract the features of key connectivity patterns from the context and incorporate them into a score function which evaluates the validity of facts. Experimental results on the newest datasets show that CACL outperforms existing approaches by successfully enriching embeddings with neighborhood information.","author":["Byungkook Oh","Seungmin Seo","Kyong-Ho Lee"],"issue":["CIKM '18: Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2018","Pages   257\u2013266","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271769"],"date":"17 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"M.

The emerging metal-oxide resistive random access memory (ReRAM) and ReRAM crossbars have shown huge potential in accelerating graph processing. However, the sparse feature of natural graphs hinders the performance of graph processing on ReRAMs. Previous work of graph processing on ReRAMs stored and computed edges separately, leading to high energy consumption and long latency of transferring data. In this paper, we present GraphSAR, a sparsity-aware processing-in-memory large-scale graph processing accelerator on ReRAMs. Computations over edges are performed in the memory, eliminating overheads of transferring edges. Moreover, graphs are divided considering the sparsity. Subgraphs with low densities are further divided into smaller ones to minimize the waste of memory space. According to our extensive experimental results, GraphSAR achieves 4.43x energy reduction and 1.85x speedup (8.19x lower energy-delay product, EDP) against previous graph processing architecture on ReRAMs (GraphR [1]).","author":["Guohao Dai","Tianhao Huang","Yu Wang","Huazhong Yang","John Wawrzynek"],"issue":["ASPDAC '19: Proceedings of the 24th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2019","Pages   120\u2013126","https://doi.org/10.1145/3287624.3287637"],"date":"21 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Linghao Song et al.

IBM QX architectures are the first ones which are already publicly available today. However, in order to use them, the respective quantum circuits have to be compiled for the respectively used target architecture. While first approaches have been proposed for this purpose, they are infeasible for a certain set of SU(4) quantum circuits which have recently been introduced to benchmark corresponding compilers. In this work, we analyze the bottlenecks of existing compilers and provide a dedicated method for compiling this kind of circuits to IBM QX architectures.

Sub-resolution assist feature (SRAF) insertion and optical proximity correction (OPC) are both inevitable resolution enhancement techniques (RET) to maximize process window and ensure feature printability. Conventional model-based SRAF insertion and OPC methods are widely applied in industrial application but suffer from the extremely long runtime due to iterative optimization process. In this paper, we propose the first work developing a deep learning framework to simultaneously perform SRAF insertion and edge-based OPC. In addition, to make the optimized masks more reliable and convincing for industrial application, we employ a commercial lithography simulation tool to consider the quality of wafer image with various lithographic metrics. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework are demonstrated in experimental results, which also show the success of machine learning-based lithography optimization techniques for the current complex and large-scale circuit layouts.","author":["Bo-Yi Yu","Yong Zhong","Shao-Yun Fang","Hung-Fei Kuo"],"issue":["ASPDAC '19: Proceedings of the 24th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2019","Pages   311\u2013316","https://doi.org/10.1145/3287624.3288749"],"date":"21 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"M.

However, FPGA accelerator design has not leveraged the latest progress of ConvNets. As a result, the key application characteristics such as frames-per-second (FPS) are ignored in favor of simply counting GOPs, and results on accuracy, which is critical to application success, are often not even reported. In this work, we adopt an algorithm-hardware co-design approach to develop a ConvNet accelerator called Synetgy and a novel ConvNet model called DiracDeltaNet. Both the accelerator and ConvNet are tailored to FPGA requirements. DiracDeltaNet, as the name suggests, is a ConvNet with only $1\\times 1$ convolutions while spatial convolutions are replaced by more efficient shift operations. DiracDeltaNet achieves competitive accuracy on ImageNet (89.0% top-5), but with 48\u00d7 fewer parameters and 65\u00d7 fewer OPs than VGG16. We further quantize DiracDeltaNet's weights to 1-bit and activations to 4-bits, with less than 1% accuracy loss. These quantizations exploit well the nature of FPGA hardware. In short, DiracDeltaNet's small model size, low computational OP count, ultra-low precision and simplified operators allow us to co-design a highly customized computing unit for an FPGA. We implement the computing units for DiracDeltaNet on an Ultra96 SoC system through high-level synthesis. Our accelerator's final top-5 accuracy of 88.2% on ImageNet, is higher than all the previously reported embedded FPGA accelerators. In addition, the accelerator reaches an inference speed of 96.5 FPS on the ImageNet classification task, surpassing prior works with similar accuracy by at least 16.9\u00d7.","author":["Yifan Yang","Qijing Huang","Bichen Wu","Tianjun Zhang","Liang Ma","Giulio Gambardella","Michaela Blott","Luciano Lavagno","Kees Vissers","John Wawrzynek","Kurt Keutzer"],"issue":["FPGA '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2019","Pages   23\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/3289602.3293902"],"date":"20 February 2019","ref":[{"text":"Kiseok Kwon, Alon Amid, Amir Gholami, Bichen Wu, Krste Asanovic, and Kurt Keutzer.

To explore how birders often find and identify animals by calls and share their observations, we conducted qualitative interviews and a visualization-review activity with nine birders, eliciting insight into their existing practices, knowledge, and visualisation interpretation. We found that visualisations evoked memories demonstrating birder expertise on the natural history, behaviours, and habitats of birds. Birders were curious and learned from exploring the abstract patterns in visualisations of acoustic data, relying on past experiences with nature to interpret acoustic visualisations. Birders often wanted to corroborate findings with other birders by reviewing acoustic recordings and local bird lists. This study demonstrates how qualitative review of visualisations can elicit a nuanced understanding of community practices, knowledge, and sensemaking, which are essential to improve design of future technologies.","author":["Jessica L.

Ideally, GPU-accelerated code on such systems should be \"write once, run anywhere,\" regardless of the GPU device (or for that matter, any parallel device, e.g., CPU or FPGA). In practice, however, portability can be significantly more limited due to the sheer volume of code implemented in non-portable languages. For example, the tremendous success of CUDA, as evidenced by the vast cornucopia of CUDA-accelerated applications, makes it infeasible to manually rewrite all these applications to achieve portability. Consequently, we achieve portability by using our automated CUDA-to-OpenCL source-to-source translator called CU2CL. To demonstrate the state of the practice, we use CU2CL to automatically translate three medium-to-large, CUDA-optimized codes to OpenCL, thus enabling the codes to run on other GPU-accelerated systems (as well as CPU- or FPGA-based systems). These automatically translated codes deliver performance portability, including as much as three-fold performance improvement, on a GPU device not supported by CUDA.","author":["Paul Sathre","Mark Gardner","Wu-chun Feng"],"issue":["HPC Asia 2019: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing in Asia-Pacific Region","January 2019","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3293320.3293338"],"date":"14 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"CU2CL: A Prototype CUDA-to-OpenCL Source-to-Source Translator. https://github.com/vtsynergy/CU2CL.","order":1},{"text":"ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES (AMD).

DL frameworks, such as TensorFlow, MXNet, and Caffe2, have emerged to assist DL researchers to train their models in a distributed manner. Although current DL frameworks scale well for image classification models, there remain opportunities for scalable distributed training on natural language processing (NLP) models. We found that current frameworks show relatively low scalability on training NLP models due to the lack of consideration to the difference in sparsity of model parameters. In this paper, we propose Parallax, a framework that optimizes data parallel training by utilizing the sparsity of model parameters. Parallax introduces a hybrid approach that combines Parameter Server and AllReduce architectures to optimize the amount of data transfer according to the sparsity. Experiments show that Parallax built atop Tensor-Flow achieves scalable training throughput on both dense and sparse models while requiring little effort from its users. Parallax achieves up to 2.8x, 6.02x speedup for NLP models than TensorFlow and Horovod with 48 GPUs, respectively. The training speed for the image classification models is equal to Horovod and 1.53x faster than TensorFlow.","author":["Soojeong Kim","Gyeong-In Yu","Hojin Park","Sungwoo Cho","Eunji Jeong","Hyeonmin Ha","Sanha Lee","Joo Seong Jeong","Byung-Gon Chun"],"issue":["EuroSys '19: Proceedings of the Fourteenth EuroSys Conference 2019","March 2019","Article No.: 43","Pages   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/3302424.3303957"],"date":"25 March 2019","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, Manjunath Kudlur, Josh Levenberg, Rajat Monga, Sherry Moore, Derek G.

This algorithm is not based on graph coloring, but allocates registers to variables in a single linear-time scan of the variables' live ranges. The linear scan algorithm is considerably faster than algorithms based on graph coloring, is simple to implement, and results in code that is almost as efficient as that obtained using more complex and time-consuming register allocators based on graph coloring.

In this paper, we consider knowledge graphs as the source of side information. We propose MKR, a Multi-task feature learning approach for Knowledge graph enhanced Recommendation. MKR is a deep end-to-end framework that utilizes knowledge graph embedding task to assist recommendation task. The two tasks are associated by crosscompress units, which automatically share latent features and learn high-order interactions between items in recommender systems and entities in the knowledge graph. We prove that crosscompress units have sufficient capability of polynomial approximation, and show that MKR is a generalized framework over several representative methods of recommender systems and multi-task learning. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that MKR achieves substantial gains in movie, book, music, and news recommendation, over state-of-the-art baselines. MKR is also shown to be able to maintain satisfactory performance even if user-item interactions are sparse.","author":["Hongwei Wang","Fuzheng Zhang","Miao Zhao","Wenjie Li","Xing Xie","Minyi Guo"],"issue":["WWW '19: The World Wide Web Conference","May 2019","Pages   2000\u20132010","https://doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313411"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2015.

In order to examine the impacts of those non-ideal effects, we first develop a comprehensive framework called PytorX based on main-stream DNN pytorch framework. PytorX could perform end-to-end training, mapping, and evaluation for crossbar-based neural network accelerator, considering all above discussed non-ideal effects of ReRAM crossbar together. Experiments based on PytorX show that directly mapping the trained large scale DNN into crossbar without considering these non-ideal effects could lead to a complete system malfunction (i.e., equal to random guess) when the neural network goes deeper and wider. In particular, to address SAF side effects, we propose a digital SAF error correction algorithm to compensate for crossbar output errors, which only needs one-time profiling to achieve almost no system accuracy degradation. Then, to overcome IR drop effects, we propose a Noise Injection Adaption (NIA) methodology by incorporating statistics of current shift caused by IR drop in each crossbar as stochastic noise to DNN training algorithm, which could efficiently regularize DNN model to make it intrinsically adaptive to non-ideal ReRAM crossbar. It is a one-time training method without the request of retraining for every specific crossbar. Optimizing system operating frequency could easily take care of rest non-ideal effects. Various experiments on different DNNs using image recognition application are conducted to show the efficacy of our proposed methodology.","author":["Zhezhi He","Jie Lin","Rickard Ewetz","Jiann-Shiun Yuan","Deliang Fan"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 57","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317870"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"Fabien Alibart et al. 2012.

In this paper, we explored image based indoor positioning as an alternative to other approaches and it is cheaper than other currently using technologies. Mobile phone's camera is used to capture images of surroundings to localize or locate him/herself. No, any special arrangement is required for image-based indoor positioning. Localization is accomplished by using Microsoft Azure Cognitive Service that uses an artificial intelligence algorithm for predicting custom images with the dataset of pre-captured indoor images. First, the dataset of the environment for different locations or places is constructed from the images captured by volunteers or crowd, after preprocessing the collected data through an android application. Dataset is uploaded with tags or labels to custom vision services cloud. Microsoft Azure. Custom vision Services predict or detect the user's location through machine learning. Machine is trained on the data collected from volunteers and the trained classifier will predict the appropriate label or class. The user will be localized by capturing an image of the surrounding environment, it is then uploaded to the cloud. The classifier will match it against every label and show results in the percentage of similarity with a particular label. Label or tag is assigned based on highest percentage, only the highest percentage tag is retrieved for precise localization. Feasibility of this method is proved by the preliminary experimental results. In future, we are trying to increase accuracy to predict most accurate label for indoor positioning or localization.","author":["Eman Shahid","Qasim Arain","Sandia Kumari","Isma Farah"],"issue":["ICEIT 2019: Proceedings of the 2019 8th International Conference on Educational and Information Technology","March 2019","Pages   97\u2013101","https://doi.org/10.1145/3318396.3318415"],"date":"02 March 2019","ref":[{"text":"Suk-Hoon Jung, Gunwoo Lee, and Dongsoo Han, Member, IEEE (2018).

Therefore, they have great potential to revolutionize the image pipelines on cameras and displays. However, it is difficult for conventional CNN accelerators to support ultra-high-resolution videos at the edge due to their considerable DRAM bandwidth and power consumption. Therefore, finding a further memory- and computation-efficient microarchitecture is crucial to speed up this coming revolution. In this paper, we approach this goal by considering the inference flow, network model, instruction set, and processor design jointly to optimize hardware performance and image quality. We apply a block-based inference flow which can eliminate all the DRAM bandwidth for feature maps and accordingly propose a hardware-oriented network model, ERNet, to optimize image quality based on hardware constraints. Then we devise a coarse-grained instruction set architecture, FBISA, to support power-hungry convolution by massive parallelism. Finally, we implement an embedded processor---eCNN---which accommodates to ERNet and FBISA with a flexible processing architecture. Layout results show that it can support high-quality ERNets for super-resolution and denoising at up to 4K Ultra-HD 30 fps while using only DDR-400 and consuming 6.94W on average. By comparison, the state-of-the-art Diffy uses dualchannel DDR3-2133 and consumes 54.3W to support lower-quality VDSR at Full HD 30 fps. Lastly, we will also present application examples of high-performance style transfer and object recognition to demonstrate the flexibility of eCNN.","author":["Chao-Tsung Huang","Yu-Chun Ding","Huan-Ching Wang","Chi-Wen Weng","Kai-Ping Lin","Li-Wei Wang","Li-De Chen"],"issue":["MICRO '52: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","October 2019","Pages   182\u2013195","https://doi.org/10.1145/3352460.3358263"],"date":"12 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Eirikur Agustsson and Radu Timofte. 2017.

However, efficient SpMV operation on large problem (i.e. working set exceeds on-chip storage) is severely constrained due to strong dependence on limited amount of fast random access memory to scale. Additionally, unstructured matrix with high sparsity pose difficulties as most solutions rely on exploitation of data locality. This work presents an algorithm co-optimized scalable hardware architecture that can efficiently operate on very large (~billion nodes) and/or highly sparse (avg. degree <10) graphs with significantly less on-chip fast memory than existing solutions. A novel parallelization methodology for implementing large and high throughput multi-way merge network is the key enabler of this high performance SpMV accelerator. Additionally, a data compression scheme to reduce off-chip traffic and special computation for nodes with exceptionally large number of edges, commonly found in power-law graphs, are presented. This accelerator is demonstrated with 16-nm fabricated ASIC and Stratix\u00ae 10 FPGA platforms. Experimental results show more than an order of magnitude improvement over current custom hardware solutions and more than two orders of magnitude improvement over commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) architectures for both performance and energy efficiency.","author":["Fazle Sadi","Joe Sweeney","Tze Meng Low","James C.

The typical workflow consists of distinct stages of user interaction, such as preprocessing, training, and tuning, that are repeatedly executed by users but have heterogeneous computational requirements. This complexity makes it challenging for ML users to correctly provision and manage resources and, in practice, constitutes a significant burden that frequently causes over-provisioning and impairs user productivity. Serverless computing is a compelling model to address the resource management problem, in general, but there are numerous challenges to adopt it for existing ML frameworks due to significant restrictions on local resources. This work proposes Cirrus---an ML framework that automates the end-to-end management of datacenter resources for ML workflows by efficiently taking advantage of serverless infrastructures. Cirrus combines the simplicity of the serverless interface and the scalability of the serverless infrastructure (AWS Lambdas and S3) to minimize user effort. We show a design specialized for both serverless computation and iterative ML training is needed for robust and efficient ML training on serverless infrastructure. Our evaluation shows that Cirrus outperforms frameworks specialized along a single dimension: Cirrus is 100x faster than a general purpose serverless system [36] and 3.75x faster than specialized ML frameworks for traditional infrastructures [49].","author":["Joao Carreira","Pedro Fonseca","Alexey Tumanov","Andrew Zhang","Randy Katz"],"issue":["SoCC '19: Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing","November 2019","Pages   13\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/3357223.3362711"],"date":"20 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"2013.

It is now known by the work of Rudra and Wootters, using techniques from high dimensional probability, that over large enough alphabets there exist RS codes that are indeed list-decodable beyond this radius.  In this paper we take a more combinatorial approach that allows us to determine the precise relation (up to the exact constant) between the decoding radius and the list size. We prove a generalized Singleton bound for a given list size, and conjecture that the bound is tight for most RS codes over large enough finite fields. We also show that the conjecture holds true for list sizes 2 and 3, and as a by product show that most RS codes with a rate of at least 1/9 are list-decodable beyond the Johnson radius. Lastly, we give the first explicit construction of such RS codes. The main tools used in the proof are a new type of linear dependency between codewords of a code that are contained in a small Hamming ball, and the notion of cycle space from Graph Theory. Both of them have not been used before in the context of list-decoding.","author":["Chong Shangguan","Itzhak Tamo"],"issue":["STOC 2020: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing","June 2020","Pages   538\u2013551","https://doi.org/10.1145/3357713.3384295"],"date":"22 June 2020","ref":[{"text":"Rudolf Ahlswede. 1973.

Individual functions are often composed into workflows for complex tasks. However, the pay-per-use model and nontransparent reporting by cloud providers make it challenging to estimate the expected cost of a workflow, which prevents informed business decisions. Existing cost-estimation approaches assume a static response time for the serverless functions, without taking input parameters into account. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the cost prediction of serverless workflows consisting of input-parameter sensitive function models and a monte-carlo simulation of an abstract workflow model. Our approach enables workflow designers to predict, compare, and optimize the expected costs and performance of a planned workflow, which currently requires time-intensive experimentation. In our evaluation, we show that our approach can predict the response time and output parameters of a function based on its input parameters with an accuracy of 96.1%. In a case study with two audio-processing workflows, our approach predicts the costs of the two workflows with an accuracy of 96.2%.","author":["Simon Eismann","Johannes Grohmann","Erwin van Eyk","Nikolas Herbst","Samuel Kounev"],"issue":["ICPE '20: Proceedings of the ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering","April 2020","Pages   265\u2013276","https://doi.org/10.1145/3358960.3379133"],"date":"20 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"Vanessa Ackermann, Johannes Grohmann, Simon Eismann, and Samuel Kounev. 2018.

Extending the technology to the Internet of things (IoT), we can obtain a verifiable and traceable IoT network. Emerging research in IoT applications exploits blockchain technology to record transaction data, optimize current system performance, or construct next-generation systems, which can provide additional security, automatic transaction management, decentralized platforms, offline-to-online data verification, and so on. In this article, we conduct a systematic survey of the key components of IoT blockchain and examine a number of popular blockchain applications.In particular, we first give an architecture overview of popular IoT-blockchain systems by analyzing their network structures and protocols. Then, we discuss variant consensus protocols for IoT blockchains, and make comparisons among different consensus algorithms. Finally, we analyze the traffic model for P2P and blockchain systems and provide several metrics. We also provide a suitable traffic model for IoT-blockchain systems to illustrate network traffic distribution.","author":["Laphou Lao","Zecheng Li","Songlin Hou","Bin Xiao","Songtao Guo","Yuanyuan Yang"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 53","Issue 1","May 2020","Article No.: 18","pp   1\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/3372136"],"date":"05 February 2020","ref":[{"text":"Ala Al-Fuqaha, Mohsen Guizani, Mehdi Mohammadi, Mohammed Aledhari, and Moussa Ayyash. 2015.

Not only cloud providers are susceptible to internal and external hacks, but also in some scenarios, data owners cannot outsource the computation due to privacy laws such as GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a groundbreaking invention in cryptography that, unlike traditional cryptosystems, enables computation on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. However, the most critical obstacle in deploying FHE at large-scale is the enormous computation overhead. In this paper, we present HEAX, a novel hardware architecture for FHE that achieves unprecedented performance improvements. HEAX leverages multiple levels of parallelism, ranging from ciphertext-level to fine-grained modular arithmetic level. Our first contribution is a new highly-parallelizable architecture for number-theoretic transform (NTT) which can be of independent interest as NTT is frequently used in many lattice-based cryptography systems. Building on top of NTT engine, we design a novel architecture for computation on homomorphically encrypted data. Our implementation on reconfigurable hardware demonstrates 164-268\u00d7 performance improvement for a wide range of FHE parameters.","author":["M.

To enable such event detection and search, ImageNet concept banks have shown to be effective. Rather than employing the standard concept bank of 1,000 ImageNet classes, we leverage the full 21,841-class dataset. We identify two problems with using the full dataset: (i) there is an imbalance between the number of examples per concept, and (ii) not all concepts are equally relevant for events. In this article, we propose to balance large-scale image hierarchies for pre-training. We shuffle concepts based on bottom-up and top-down operations to overcome the problems of example imbalance and concept relevance. Using this strategy, we arrive at the shuffled ImageNet bank, a concept bank with an order of magnitude more concepts compared to standard ImageNet banks. Compared to standard ImageNet pre-training, our shuffles result in more discriminative representations to train event models from the limited video event examples. For event search, the broad range of concepts enable a closer match between textual queries of events and concept detections in videos. Experimentally, we show the benefit of the proposed bank for event detection and event search, with state-of-the-art performance for both tasks on the challenging TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection and Ad-Hoc Video Search benchmarks.","author":["Pascal Mettes","Dennis C.

Leveraging a scholarly knowledge graph, we present a methodology and a system for comparing scholarly literature, in particular research contributions describing the addressed problem, utilized materials, employed methods and yielded results. The system can be used by researchers to quickly get familiar with existing work in a specific research domain (e.g., a concrete research question or hypothesis). Additionally, it can be used to publish literature surveys following the FAIR Data Principles. The methodology to create a research contribution comparison consists of multiple tasks, specifically: (a) finding similar contributions, (b) aligning contribution descriptions, (c) visualizing and finally (d) publishing the comparison. The methodology is implemented within the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), a scholarly infrastructure that enables researchers to collaboratively describe, find and compare research contributions. We evaluate the implementation using data extracted from published review articles. The evaluation also addresses the FAIRness of comparisons published with the ORKG.","author":["Allard Oelen","Mohamad Yaser Jaradeh","Markus Stocker","S\u00f6ren Auer"],"issue":["JCDL '20: Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries in 2020","August 2020","Pages   97\u2013106","https://doi.org/10.1145/3383583.3398520"],"date":"01 August 2020","ref":[{"text":"Samur Araujo, Jan Hidders, Daniel Schwabe, and Arjen P.

The system provides security, availability, and reliability by distributing multiple encrypted replicas of each file among the client machines. To assess the feasibility of deploying this system on an existing desktop infrastructure, we measure and analyze a large set of client machines in a commercial environment. In particular, we measure and report results on disk usage and content; file activity; and machine uptimes, lifetimes, and loads. We conclude that the measured desktop infrastructure would passably support our proposed system, providing availability on the order of one unfilled file request per user per thousand days.","author":["William J.

Integrated in a dense array, eNVM such as resistive random access memory (RRAM), spin transfer torque based random access memory, or phase change random access memory (PCRAM) can perform compute in-memory (CIM) using the physical properties of the device. The combination of eNVM and CIM seeks to minimize both data transport and leakage power while offering density up to 10x that of traditional 6T SRAM. Despite these exciting new properties, these devices introduce problems that were not faced by traditional CMOS and SRAM based designs. While some of these problems will be solved by further research and development, properties such as significant cell-to-cell variance and high write power will persist due to the physical limitations of the devices. As a result, circuit and system level designs must account for and mitigate the problems that arise. In this work we introduce these problems from the system level and propose solutions that improve performance while mitigating the impact of the non-ideal properties of eNVM.

Soft updates is an implementation technique for low-cost sequencing of fine-grained updates to write-back cache blocks. Using soft updates to track and enforce metadata update dependencies, a file system can safely use delayed writes for almost all file operations. This article describes soft updates, their incorporation into the 4.4BSD fast file system, and the resulting effects on the sytem. We show that a disk-based file system using soft updates achieves memory-based file system performance while providing stronger integrity and security guarantees than most disk-based file  systems. For workloads that frequently perform updates on metadata (such as creating and deleting files), this improves performance by more than a factor of two and up to a factor of 20 when compared to the conventional synchronous write approach and by 4-19% when compared to an aggressive write-ahead logging approach. In addition, soft updates can improve file system availablity by relegating crash-recovery assistance (e.g., the fsck utility) to an optional and background role, reducing file system recovery time to less than one second.","author":["Gregory R.

The Streams-C language consists of a small number of libraries and intrinsic functions added to a synthesizable subset of C, and supports a communicating process programming model. The processes may be either software or hardware processes, and the compiler manages communication among the processes transparently to the programmer. For the hardware processes, the compiler generates Register-Transfer-Level (RTL) VHDL, targeting multiple FPGAs with dedicated memories.  For the software processes, a multi-threaded software program is generated.The Streams-C language and compiler offer a very high level of expressivity for reconfigurable computing application development, particularly for stream-processing applications. We find this is reflected in productivity, for a factor of up to 10 times improvement in time to produce a program. However, use of the tool in the ``real world'' is predicated on performance: only if such a compiler can deliver performance comparable to hand-coded performance will it be used in practice.This paper presents an application study of the Streams-C compiler. Four applications have been written in Streams-C and compiled to the AMC Wildforce board containing Xilinx 4036's. Those same applications have been hand-coded in a combination of RTL and structural VHDL. We compare performance of the generated code with the hand-optimized code. Our study shows that the compiler-generated designs are 1.37--4 times the area and $1/2$--1 times the clock frequency of the hand designs. We find that the compiler, based on the SUIF infrastructure, can be greatly improved through various standard compiler optimizations that are not currently being exploited. Thus we are currently re-writing a public domain version of Streams-C to better optimize and target the Virtex chip.","author":["Jan Frigo","Maya Gokhale","Dominique Lavenier"],"issue":["FPGA '01: Proceedings of the 2001 ACM/SIGDA ninth international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2001","Pages   134\u2013140","https://doi.org/10.1145/360276.360326"],"date":"01 February 2001","ref":[{"text":"Joseph Arrowood.

The paradigm problem considered is that of testing a series of messages one-by-one for membership in a given set of messages. Two new hash-coding methods are examined and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method. The computational factors considered are the size of the hash area (space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency.The new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded information from that associated with conventional methods. The reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods.In such applications, it is envisaged that overall performance could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to \u201ccatch\u201d the small fraction of errors associated with the new methods. An example is discussed which illustrates possible areas of application for the new methods.Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash area to be used without increasing reject time.","author":["Burton H.

The ephemeral nature of some electronic documents means that the document address (i.e., reference details of the document) can become incorrect some time after coming into use, resulting in references, such as index entries and hypertext links, failing to correctly address the document they describe. A classic case of invalidated references is on the World Wide Web\u2014links that point to a named resource fail when the domain name, file name, or any other aspect of the addressed resource is changed, resulting in the well-known Error 404. Additionally, there are other errors which arise from changes to document collections.This paper surveys the strategies used both in World Wide Web software and other hypertext systems for managing the integrity of references and hence the integrity of links. Some strategies are preventative, not permitting errors to occur; others are corrective, discovering references errors and sometimes attempting to correct them; while the last strategy is adaptive, because references are calculated on a just-in-time basis, according the current state of the document collection.","author":["Helen Ashman"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 32","Issue 3","Sept. 2000","pp   201\u2013212","https://doi.org/10.1145/367701.367702"],"date":"01 September 2000","ref":[{"text":"ACM. 2000.

All objects are reduced to common world-space geometric entities called micropolygons, and all of the shading and visibility calculations operate on these micropolygons. Each type of calculation is performed in a coordinate system that is natural for that type of calculation. Micropolygons are created and textured in the local coordinate sysem of the object, with the result that texture filtering is simplified and improved. Visibility is calculated in screen space using stochastic point sampling with a z buffer. There are no clipping or inverse perspective calculations. Geometric and texture locality are exploited to minimize paging and to support models that contain arbitrarily many primitives.","author":["Robert L.

This paper investigates the design and implementation of a thread-based MPI system on SMP clusters. Our study indicates that with a proper design for threaded MPI execution, both point-to-point and collective communication performance can be improved substantially, compared to a process-based MPI implementation in a cluster environment. Our contribution includes a hierarchy-aware and adaptive communication scheme for threaded MPI execution and a thread-safe network device abstraction that uses event-driven synchronization and provides separated collective and point-to-point communication channels. This paper describes the implementation of our design and illustrates its performance advantage on a Linux SMP cluster.","author":["Hong Tang","Tao Yang"],"issue":["ICS '01: Proceedings of the 15th international conference on Supercomputing","June 2001","Pages   381\u2013392","https://doi.org/10.1145/377792.377895"],"date":"17 June 2001","ref":[{"text":"T.Anderson,D.Culler,D.P tterson,et al.A case for networks of workstations:NOW.IEEE Micro ,1995.","doi":"10.1109/40.342018","order":1},{"text":"Donald J.Becker,Thomas Sterling,D niel Sav rese, John E.Dorband,Ud y A.Ranawak,and Charles V.

This paper presents research examining the situation where such an assumption is false.  Here, an intermediate (or pivot) language provides a means of transitive translation of the query language to that of the document via the pivot, at the cost, however, of introducing much error.  The paper reports the novel approach of translating in parallel across multiple intermediate languages and fusing the results.  Such a technique removes the error, raising the effectiveness of the tested retrieval system, up to and possibly above the level expected, had a direct translation route existed.  Across a number of retrieval situations and combinations of languages, the approach proves to be highly effective.","author":["Tim Gollins","Mark Sanderson"],"issue":["SIGIR '01: Proceedings of the 24th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval","September 2001","Pages   90\u201395","https://doi.org/10.1145/383952.383965"],"date":"01 September 2001","ref":[{"text":"Ballesteros, L. and Croft, B., Dictionary methods for crosslingual information retrieval. in Database and Expert Systems Applications. 7th International Conference, DEXA '96 Proceedings, (Zurich, Switzerland, 1996), Springer- Verlag Berlin, Germany.]]","doi":"10.5555/648309.754278","order":1},{"text":"Ballesteros, L. and Croft, W.B., Resolving ambiguity for cross-language retrieval. in Proceedings of the 21st Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, (Melbourne, Vic., Australia, 1998), ACM Press.]]","doi":"10.1145/290941.290958","order":2},{"text":"Ballesteros, L.A.

For example, in a database system enhanced with inference capabilities, a simple query involving a rule with multiple definitions may expand to more than one actual query that has to be run over the database. It is an interesting problem then to come up with algorithms that process these queries together instead of one query at a time. The main motivation for performing such an interquery optimization lies in the fact that queries may share common data. We examine the problem of multiple-query optimization in this paper. The first major contribution of the paper is a systematic look at the problem, along with the presentation and analysis of algorithms that can be used for multiple-query optimization. The second contribution lies in the presentation of experimental results. Our results show that using multiple-query processing algorithms may reduce execution cost considerably.","author":["Timos K.

As applications become increasingly sophisticated and processing power increases, the most serious limitation on these devices is the available battery life. Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) has been a key technique in exploiting the hardware characteristics of processors to reduce energy dissipation by lowering the supply voltage and operating frequency. The DVS algorithms are shown to be able to make dramatic energy savings while providing the necessary peak computation power in general-purpose systems. However, for a large class of applications in embedded real-time systems like cellular phones and camcorders, the variable operating frequency interferes with their deadline guarantee mechanisms, and DVS in this context, despite its growing importance, is largely overlooked/under-developed. To provide real-time guarantees, DVS must consider deadlines and periodicity of real-time tasks, requiring integration with the real-time scheduler. In this paper, we present a class of novel algorithms called real-time DVS (RT-DVS) that modify the OS's real-time scheduler and task management service to provide significant energy savings while maintaining real-time deadline guarantees. We show through simulations and a working prototype implementation that these RT-DVS algorithms closely approach the theoretical lower bound on energy consumption, and can easily reduce energy consumption 20% to 40% in an embedded real-time system.","author":["Padmanabhan Pillai","Kang G.

It differs from pseudo-relevance feedback in that retrieved documents are labeled by an automatic language classifier as relevant or irrelevant, and this feedback is used to generate new queries. We experiment with various query-generation methods and query-lengths to find inclusion/exclusion terms that are helpful for retrieving documents in the target language and find that using odds-ratio scores calculated over the documents acquired so far was one of the most consistently accurate query-generation methods. We also describe experiments using a handful of words elicited from a user instead of initial documents and show that the methods perform similarly. Experiments applying the same approach to multiple languages are also presented showing that our approach generalizes to a variety of languages.","author":["Rayid Ghani","Rosie Jones","Dunja Mladeni\u0107"],"issue":["CIKM '01: Proceedings of the tenth international conference on Information and knowledge management","October 2001","Pages   279\u2013286","https://doi.org/10.1145/502585.502633"],"date":"05 October 2001","ref":[{"text":"D.

Earlier methods presented separately by Gawlick and Reuter are comparable but concentrate on \u201chot-spot\u201d situations, where even short transactions cannot lock frequently accessed fields without causing bottlenecks. The Escrow Method offered here is designed to support nonblocking record updates by transactions that are \u201clong lived\u201d and thus require long periods to complete. Recoverability of intermediate results prior to commit thus becomes a design goal, so that updates as of a given time can be guaranteed against memory or media failure while still retaining the prerogative to abort. This guarantee basically completes phase one of a two-phase commit, and several advantages result: (1) As with Gawlick's and Reuter's methods, high-concurrency items in the database will not act as a bottleneck; (2) transaction commit of different updates can be performed asynchronously, allowing natural distributed transactions; indeed, distributed transactions in the presence of delayed messages or occasional line disconnection become feasible in a way that we argue will tie up minimal resources for the purpose intended; and (3) it becomes natural to allow for human interaction in the middle of a transaction without loss of concurrent access or any special difficulty for the application programmer. The Escrow Method, like Gawlick's Fast Path and Reuter's Method, requires the database system to be an \u201cexpert\u201d about the type of transactional updates performed, most commonly updates involving incremental changes to aggregate quantities. However, the Escrow Method is extendable to other types of updates.","author":["Patrick E.

Thus, we demonstrate that the set of problems learnable in the statistical query model is a strict subset of those problems learnable in the presence of noise in the PAC model.In coding-theory terms, what we give is a poly(n)-time algorithm for decoding linear k \u00d7 n codes in the presence of random noise for the case of k = c log n log log n for some c > 0. (The case of k = O(log n) is trivial since one can just individually check each of the 2k possible messages and choose the one that yields the closest codeword.)A natural extension of the statistical query model is to allow queries about statistical properties that involve t-tuples of examples, as opposed to just single examples. The second result of this article is to show that any class of functions learnable (strongly or weakly) with t-wise queries for t = O(log n) is also weakly learnable with standard unary queries. Hence, this natural extension to the statistical query model does not increase the set of weakly learnable functions.","author":["Avrim Blum","Adam Kalai","Hal Wasserman"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 50","Issue 4","July 2003","pp   506\u2013519","https://doi.org/10.1145/792538.792543"],"date":"01 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"Ajtai, M., Kumar, R., and Sivakumar, D. 2001.

The first upper bound is 0(n1/7); it improves the previously best known bound of 0(n1/4) due to Pollard [11]. The second upper bound is dependent on the Extended Riemann Hypothesis (ERH): assuming ERH, we produce an algorithm which tests primality and runs in time 0((log n)4) steps. Thus we show that primality is testable in time a polynomial in the length of the binary representation of a number. Finally, we give a partial solution to the relationship between the complexity of computing the prime factorization of a number, computing the Euler phi function, and computing other related functions.","author":["Gary L.

Research should help to define best practices, but often the worlds of research and of practice can seem too dichotomous. Recently, for instance, the fields of usability and user-centered design generally have seen considerable controversy about the relative effectiveness of different methodologies. In this column, Dennis Wixon argues that we need to look at whether we are evaluating methods by the appropriate criteria. He considers the growing body of literature on evaluation of methods unhelpful, or even irrelevant, to the practitioner.

We introduce a robust technique for directly parametrizing a genus-zero surface onto a spherical domain. A key ingredient for making such a parametrization practical is the minimization of a stretch-based measure, to reduce scale-distortion and thereby prevent undersampling. Our second contribution is a scheme for sampling the spherical domain using uniformly subdivided polyhedral domains, namely the tetrahedron, octahedron, and cube. We show that these particular semi-regular samplings can be conveniently represented as completely regular 2D grids, i.e. geometry images. Moreover, these images have simple boundary extension rules that aid many processing operations. Applications include geometry remeshing, level-of-detail, morphing, compression, and smooth surface subdivision.","author":["Emil Praun","Hugues Hoppe"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 22","Issue 3","July 2003","pp   340\u2013349","https://doi.org/10.1145/882262.882274"],"date":"01 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"ALEXA, M. 2000.

The environment is fully backward compatible with its predecessor, and offers support for Fortran 90/95 and a general C/C++ Application Programming Interface. The SIF decoder, formerly a part of CUTE, has become a separate tool, easily callable by various packages. It features simple extensions to the SIF test problem format and the generation of files suited to automatic differentiation packages.","author":["Nicholas I. M. Gould","Dominique Orban","Philippe L.

This paper presents a general-purpose algorithm for converting procedures that solves linear programming problems. The conversion is polynomial for constraint matrices with polynomially bounded subdeterminants. Among the important corollaries of the algorithm is the extension of the polynomial solvability of integer linear programming problems with totally unimodular constraint matrix, to integer-separable convex programming. An algorithm for finding a \u03b5-accurate optimal continuous solution to the  nonlinear problem that is polynomial in log(1/\u03b5) and the input size and the largest subdeterminant of the constraint matrix is also presented. These developments are based on proximity results between the continuous and integral optimal solutions for problems with any nonlinear separable convex objective function. The practical feature of our algorithm is that is does not demand an explicit representation of the nonlinear function, only a polynomial number of function evaluations on a prespecified grid.","author":["D.

We propose to use pre-defined dual-Vdd and dual-Vt fabrics to reduce FPGA power. We design FPGA circuits with dual-Vdd/dual-Vt to effectively reduce both dynamic power and leakage power, and define dual-Vdd/dual-Vt FPGA fabrics based on the profiling of benchmark circuits. We further develop CAD algorithms including power-sensitivity based voltage assignment and simulated-annealing based placement to leverage such fabrics. Compared to the conventional fabric using uniform Vdd/Vt at the same target clock frequency, our new fabric using dual Vt achieves 9% to 20% power reduction. However, the pre-defined FPGA fabric using both dual Vdd and dual Vt only achieves on average 2% extra power reduction. It is because that the pre-designed dual-Vdd layout pattern introduces non-negligible performance penalty. Therefore, programmability of supply voltage is needed to achieve significant power saving for dual-Vdd FPGAs. To our best knowledge, it is the first in-depth study on applying both dual-Vdd and dual-Vt to FPGA considering circuits, fabrics and CAD algorithms.","author":["Fei Li","Yan Lin","Lei He","Jason Cong"],"issue":["FPGA '04: Proceedings of the 2004 ACM/SIGDA 12th international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2004","Pages   42\u201350","https://doi.org/10.1145/968280.968288"],"date":"22 February 2004","ref":[{"text":"E.

Therefore, the response time of a database engine could be improved by moving the objects that are frequently accessed in a random fashion to the SSD. Considering the price and limited storage capacity of solid state disks, the database administrator needs to determine which objects (tables, indexes, materialized views, etc.), if placed on the SSD, would most improve the performance of the system. In this paper we propose a tool called \"Object Placement Advisor\" for making a wise decision for the object placement problem. By collecting profile inputs from workload runs, the advisor utility provides a list of objects to be placed on the SSD by applying heuristics like the greedy knapsack technique or dynamic programming. To show that the proposed approach is effective in conventional database management systems, we have conducted experiments on IBM DB2 with queries and schemas based on the TPC-H and TPC-C benchmarks. The results indicate that using a relatively small amount of SSD storage, the response time of the system can be reduced significantly by considering the recommendation of the advisor.","author":["Mustafa Canim","George A.

FlashStore is designed to store the working set of key-value pairs on flash and use one flash read per key lookup. As the working set changes over time, space is made for the current working set by destaging recently unused key-value pairs to hard disk and recycling pages in the flash store. FlashStore organizes key-value pairs in a log-structure on flash to exploit faster sequential write performance. It uses an in-memory hash table to index them, with hash collisions resolved by a variant of cuckoo hashing. The in-memory hash table stores compact key signatures instead of full keys so as to strike tradeoffs between RAM usage and false flash read operations.FlashStore can be used as a high throughput persistent key-value storage layer for a broad range of server class applications. We compare FlashStore with BerkeleyDB, an embedded key-value store application, running on hard disk and flash separately, so as to bring out the performance gain of FlashStore in not only using flash as a cache above hard disk but also in its use of flash aware algorithms. We use real-world data traces from two data center applications, namely, Xbox LIVE Primetime online multi-player game and inline storage deduplication, to drive and evaluate the design of FlashStore on traditional and low power server platforms. FlashStore outperforms BerkeleyDB by up to 60x on throughput (ops/sec), up to 50x on energy efficiency (ops/Joule), and up to 85x on cost efficiency (ops/sec/dollar) on the evaluated datasets.","author":["Biplob Debnath","Sudipta Sengupta","Jin Li"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   1414\u20131425","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1921015"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"BerkeleyDB. http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/berkeley-db/index.html.","order":1},{"text":"BerkeleyDB for .NET. http://sourceforge.net/projects/libdb-dotnet/.","order":2},{"text":"C# System.

Alignments at the instance level cross-fertilize with alignments at the schema level. Thereby, our system provides a truly holistic solution to the problem of ontology alignment. The heart of the approach is probabilistic, i.e., we measure degrees of matchings based on probability estimates. This allows paris to run without any parameter tuning. We demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm and its precision through extensive experiments.

NOMAD is a decentralized algorithm with non-blocking communication between processors. One of the key features of NOMAD is that the ownership of a variable is asynchronously transferred between processors in a decentralized fashion. As a consequence it is a lock-free parallel algorithm. In spite of being asynchronous, the variable updates of NOMAD are serializable, that is, there is an equivalent update ordering in a serial implementation. NOMAD outperforms synchronous algorithms which require explicit bulk synchronization after every iteration: our extensive empirical evaluation shows that not only does our algorithm perform well in distributed setting on commodity hardware, but also outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on a HPC cluster both in multi-core and distributed memory settings.","author":["Hyokun Yun","Hsiang-Fu Yu","Cho-Jui Hsieh","S.

Among many systems providing some SQL support over Hadoop, Hive is the first native Hadoop system that uses an underlying framework such as MapReduce or Tez to process SQL-like statements. Impala, on the other hand, represents the new emerging class of SQL-on-Hadoop systems that exploit a shared-nothing parallel database architecture over Hadoop. Both systems optimize their data ingestion via columnar storage, and promote different file formats: ORC and Parquet. In this paper, we compare the performance of these two systems by conducting a set of cluster experiments using a TPC-H like benchmark and two TPC-DS inspired workloads. We also closely study the I/O efficiency of their columnar formats using a set of micro-benchmarks. Our results show that Impala is 3.3X to 4.4X faster than Hive on MapReduce and 2.1X to 2.8X than Hive on Tez for the overall TPC-H experiments. Impala is also 8.2X to 10X faster than Hive on MapReduce and about 4.3X faster than Hive on Tez for the TPC-DS inspired experiments. Through detailed analysis of experimental results, we identify the reasons for this performance gap and examine the strengths and limitations of each system.","author":["Avrilia Floratou","Umar Farooq Minhas","Fatma \u00d6zcan"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 12","August 2014","pp   1295\u20131306","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732977.2733002"],"date":"01 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"D.

This unprecedented level of on-chip parallelism introduces a new dimension to scalability that current database management systems (DBMSs) were not designed for. In particular, as the number of cores increases, the problem of concurrency control becomes extremely challenging. With hundreds of threads running in parallel, the complexity of coordinating competing accesses to data will likely diminish the gains from increased core counts.To better understand just how unprepared current DBMSs are for future CPU architectures, we performed an evaluation of concurrency control for on-line transaction processing (OLTP) workloads on many-core chips. We implemented seven concurrency control algorithms on a main-memory DBMS and using computer simulations scaled our system to 1024 cores. Our analysis shows that all algorithms fail to scale to this magnitude but for different reasons. In each case, we identify fundamental bottlenecks that are independent of the particular database implementation and argue that even state-of-the-art DBMSs suffer from these limitations. We conclude that rather than pursuing incremental solutions, many-core chips may require a completely redesigned DBMS architecture that is built from ground up and is tightly coupled with the hardware.","author":["Xiangyao Yu","George Bezerra","Andrew Pavlo","Srinivas Devadas","Michael Stonebraker"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 3","November 2014","pp   209\u2013220","https://doi.org/10.14778/2735508.2735511"],"date":"01 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"Intel brings supercomputing horsepower to big data analytics. http://intel.ly/18A03EM, November 2013.","order":1},{"text":"A.

This paper focuses on HNE for massive graphs, e.g., with billions of edges. On this scale, most existing approaches fail, as they incur either prohibitively high costs, or severely compromised result utility.Our proposed solution, called Node-Reweighted PageRank (NRP), is based on a classic idea of deriving embedding vectors from pairwise personalized PageRank (PPR) values. Our contributions are twofold: first, we design a simple and efficient baseline HNE method based on PPR that is capable of handling billion-edge graphs on commodity hardware; second and more importantly, we identify an inherent drawback of vanilla PPR, and address it in our main proposal NRP. Specifically, PPR was designed for a very different purpose, i.e., ranking nodes in G based on their relative importance from a source node's perspective. In contrast, HNE aims to build node embeddings considering the whole graph. Consequently, node embeddings derived directly from PPR are of suboptimal utility.The proposed NRP approach overcomes the above deficiency through an effective and efficient node reweighting algorithm, which augments PPR values with node degree information, and iteratively adjusts embedding vectors accordingly. Overall, NRP takes O(mlogn) time and O(m) space to compute all node embeddings for a graph with m edges and n nodes. Our extensive experiments that compare NRP against 18 existing solutions over 7 real graphs demonstrate that NRP achieves higher result utility than all the solutions for link prediction, graph reconstruction and node classification, while being up to orders of magnitude faster. In particular, on a billion-edge Twitter graph, NRP terminates within 4 hours, using a single CPU core.","author":["Renchi Yang","Jieming Shi","Xiaokui Xiao","Yin Yang","Sourav S.

While prior research has explored many different ways of reducing DNN training time, the impact of input data pipeline, i.e., fetching raw data items from storage and performing data pre-processing in memory, has been relatively unexplored. This paper makes the following contributions: (1) We present the first comprehensive analysis of how the input data pipeline affects the training time of widely-used computer vision and audio Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), that typically involve complex data pre-processing. We analyze nine different models across three tasks and four datasets while varying factors such as the amount of memory, number of CPU threads, storage device, GPU generation etc on servers that are a part of a large production cluster at Microsoft. We find that in many cases, DNN training time is dominated by data stall time: time spent waiting for data to be fetched and pre-processed. (2) We build a tool, DS-Analyzer to precisely measure data stalls using a differential technique, and perform predictive what-if analysis on data stalls. (3) Finally, based on the insights from our analysis, we design and implement three simple but effective techniques in a data-loading library, CoorDL, to mitigate data stalls. Our experiments on a range of DNN tasks, models, datasets, and hardware configs show that when PyTorch uses CoorDL instead of the state-of-the-art DALI data loading library, DNN training time is reduced significantly (by as much as 5X on a single server).","author":["Jayashree Mohan","Amar Phanishayee","Ashish Raniwala","Vijay Chidambaram"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 14","Issue 5","January 2021","pp   771\u2013784","https://doi.org/10.14778/3446095.3446100"],"date":"01 January 2021","ref":[{"text":"2020.

However, they often include many rare senses while missing domain-specific senses. We present a clustering algorithm called CBC (Clustering By Committee) that automatically discovers concepts from text. It initially discovers a set of tight clusters called committees that are well scattered in the similarity space. The centroid of the members of a committee is used as the feature vector of the cluster. We proceed by assigning elements to their most similar cluster. Evaluating cluster quality has always been a difficult task. We present a new evaluation methodology that is based on the editing distance between output clusters and classes extracted from WordNet (the answer key). Our experiments show that CBC outperforms several well-known clustering algorithms in cluster quality.","author":["Dekang Lin","Patrick Pantel"],"issue":["COLING '02: Proceedings of the 19th international conference on Computational linguistics - Volume 1","August 2002","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.3115/1072228.1072372"],"date":"24 August 2002","ref":[{"text":"Cutting, D.

The accuracy of the system is dependent on the quality and quantity of contextual information available to describe each term. However, the quantity variable is no longer fixed by limited corpus resources. Given fixed training time and computational resources, it makes sense for systems to invest time in extracting high quality contextual information from a fixed corpus. However, with an effectively limitless quantity of text available, extraction rate and representation size need to be considered.

Roles are tagged through applying the Viterbi algorithm in the fashion of a POS tagger. In the resulted most probable roles sequence, all the eligible unknown words are recognized through a maximum patterns matching. We have got excellent precision and recalling rates, especially for person names and transliterations.

DECIPHER is a speaker-independent continuous speech recognition system based on hidden Markov model (HMM) technology. We show significant performance improvements in DECIPHER due to (1) the addition of tied-mixture HMM modeling (2) rejection of out-of-vocabulary speech and background noise while continuing to recognize speech (3) adapting to the current speaker (4) the implementation of N-gram statistical grammars with DECIPHER. Finally we describe our performance in the February 1991 DARPA Resource Management evaluation (4.8 percent word error) and in the February 1991 DARPA-ATIS speech and SLS evaluations (95 sentences correct, 15 wrong of 140).

We show how to solve this dilemma with Gibbs sampling, a simple Monte Carlo method used to perform approximate inference in factored probabilistic models. By using simulated annealing in place of Viterbi decoding in sequence models such as HMMs, CMMs, and CRFs, it is possible to incorporate non-local structure while preserving tractable inference. We use this technique to augment an existing CRF-based information extraction system with long-distance dependency models, enforcing label consistency and extraction template consistency constraints.

In contrast to the well known back-off n-gram language models, the neural network approach attempts to overcome the data sparseness problem by performing the estimation in a continuous space. This type of language model was mostly used for tasks for which only a very limited amount of in-domain training data is available.In this paper we present new algorithms to train a neural network language model on very large text corpora. This makes possible the use of the approach in domains where several hundreds of millions words of texts are available. The neural network language model is evaluated in a state-of-the-art real-time continuous speech recognizer for French Broadcast News. Word error reductions of 0.5% absolute are reported using only a very limited amount of additional processing time.","author":["Holger Schwenk","Jean-Luc Gauvain"],"issue":["HLT '05: Proceedings of the conference on Human Language Technology and Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing","October 2005","Pages   201\u2013208","https://doi.org/10.3115/1220575.1220601"],"date":"06 October 2005","ref":[{"text":"Yoshua Bengio and Rejean Ducharme. 2001.

While such projects can be quite useful, we believe that it is time to make the next step in the design of machine translation systems and to move toward adaptive, multiple-engine systems.

There are a number of different estimators for Bayesian models, and it is useful to know what kinds of tasks each does well on. This paper compares a variety of different Bayesian estimators for Hidden Markov Model POS taggers with various numbers of hidden states on data sets of different sizes. Recent papers have given contradictory results when comparing Bayesian estimators to Expectation Maximization (EM) for unsupervised HMM POS tagging, and we show that the difference in reported results is largely due to differences in the size of the training data and the number of states in the HMM. We invesigate a variety of samplers for HMMs, including some that these earlier papers did not study. We find that all of Gibbs samplers do well with small data sets and few states, and that Variational Bayes does well on large data sets and is competitive with the Gibbs samplers. In terms of times of convergence, we find that Variational Bayes was the fastest of all the estimators, especially on large data sets, and that explicit Gibbs sampler (both pointwise and sentence-blocked) were generally faster than their collapsed counterparts on large data sets.","author":["Jianfeng Gao","Mark Johnson"],"issue":["EMNLP '08: Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing","October 2008","Pages   344\u2013352"],"date":"25 October 2008","ref":[{"text":"Matthew J.
