A document has a phrase if all content words in the phrase are within a window of a certain size. The window sizes for different types of phrases are different and are determined using a decision tree. Phrases are more important than individual terms. Consequently, documents in response to a query are ranked with matching phrases given a higher priority. We utilize WordNet to disambiguate word senses of query terms. Whenever the sense of a query term is determined, its synonyms, hyponyms, words from its definition and its compound words are considered for possible additions to the query. Experimental results show that our approach yields between 23% and 31% improvements over the best-known results on the TREC 9, 10 and 12 collections for short (title only) queries, without using Web data.","author":["Shuang Liu","Fang Liu","Clement Yu","Weiyi Meng"],"issue":["SIGIR '04: Proceedings of the 27th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval","July 2004","Pages   266\u2013272","https://doi.org/10.1145/1008992.1009039"],"date":"25 July 2004","ref":[{"text":"G.

They are most conveniently applied to 2-way clustering problems. When applying to multi-way clustering, either the 2-way spectral clustering is recursively applied or an embedding to spectral space is done and some other methods are used to cluster the points. Here we propose and study a K-way cluster assignment method. The method transforms the problem to find valleys and peaks of a 1-D quantity called cluster crossing, which measures the symmetric cluster overlap across a cut point along a linear ordering of the data points. The method can either determine K clusters in one shot or recursively split a current cluster into several smaller ones. We show that a linear ordering based on a distance sensitive objective has a continuous solution which is the eigenvector of the Laplacian, showing the close relationship between clustering and ordering. The method relies on the connectivity matrix constructed as the truncated spectral expansion of the similarity matrix, useful for revealing cluster structure. The method is applied to newsgroups to illustrate introduced concepts; experiments show it outperforms the recursive 2-way clustering and the standard K-means clustering.","author":["Chris Ding","Xiaofeng He"],"issue":["ICML '04: Proceedings of the twenty-first international conference on Machine learning","July 2004","https://doi.org/10.1145/1015330.1015407"],"date":"04 July 2004","ref":[{"text":"Bach, F.

Unfortunately, typical implementations of busy-waiting tend to produce large amounts of memory and interconnect contention, introducing performance bottlenecks that become markedly more pronounced as applications scale. We argue that this problem is not fundamental, and that one can in fact construct busy-wait synchronization algorithms that induce no memory or interconnect contention. The key to these algorithms is for every processor to spin on separate locally-accessible flag variables, and for some other processor to terminate the spin with a single remote write operation at an appropriate time. Flag variables may be locally-accessible as a result of coherent caching, or by virtue of allocation in the local portion of physically distributed shared memory.We present a new scalable algorithm for spin locks that generates 0(1) remote references per lock acquisition, independent of the number of processors attempting to acquire the lock. Our algorithm provides reasonable latency in the absence of contention, requires only a constant amount of space per lock, and requires no hardware support other than a swap-with-memory instruction. We also present a new scalable barrier algorithm that generates 0(1) remote references per processor reaching the barrier, and observe that two previously-known barriers can likewise be cast in a form that spins only on locally-accessible flag variables. None of these barrier algorithms requires hardware support beyond the usual atomicity of memory reads and writes.We compare the performance of our scalable algorithms with other software approaches to busy-wait synchronization on both a Sequent Symmetry and a BBN Butterfly. Our principal conclusion is that contention due to synchronization need not be a problem in large-scale shared-memory multiprocessors. The existence of scalable algorithms greatly weakens the case for costly special-purpose hardware support for synchronization, and provides a case against so-called \u201cdance hall\u201d architectures, in which shared memory locations are equally far from all processors. \u2014From the Authors' Abstract","author":["John M.

Each cell in this architecture can implement a single output function of up to k inputs and up to m product terms. We develop a very efficient technology mapping algorithm, k_m_flow, for this new type of architecture. The experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve depth-optimality on almost all the testcases in a set of 16 Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC) benchmarks. Furthermore it is shown that on this set of benchmarks, with only a relatively small number of product terms (m \u2264 k + 3), the k/m-macrocell-based FPGAs can achieve the same or similar mapping depth compared with the traditional k-input single-output lookup table- (k-LUT-) based FPGAs. We also investigate the total area and delay of k/m-macrocell-based FPGAs and compare them with those of the commonly used 4-LUT-based FPGAs. The experimental results show that k/m-macrocell-based FPGAs can outperform 4-LUT-based FPGAs in terms of both delay and area after placement and routing by VPR on this set of benchmarks.","author":["Jason Cong","Hui Huang","Xin Yuan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 10","Issue 1","January 2005","pp   3\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/1044111.1044113"],"date":"01 January 2005","ref":[{"text":"Altera Corp. 2000.

However, it has been discussed that radio obstacles [4], as they are found in urban areas, have a significant negative impact on the performance of position-based routing. In prior work [6] we presented a position-based approach which alleviates this problem and is able to find robust routes within city environments. It is related to the idea of position-based source routing as proposed in [1] for terminode routing. The algorithm needs global knowledge of the city topology as it is provided by a static street map. Given this information the sender determines the junctions that have to be traversed by the packet using the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm. Forwarding between junctions is then done in a position-based fashion. In this short paper we show how position-based routing can be aplied to a city scenario without assuming that nodes have access to a static street map and without using source routing.","author":["Christian Lochert","Martin Mauve","Holger F\u00fc\u00dfler","Hannes Hartenstein"],"issue":["ACM SIGMOBILE Mobile Computing and Communications Review","Volume 9","Issue 1","January 2005","pp   69\u201372","https://doi.org/10.1145/1055959.1055970"],"date":"01 January 2005","ref":[{"text":"L.

This article surveys optimistic replication algorithms. They allow replica contents to diverge in the short term to support concurrent work practices and tolerate failures in low-quality communication links. The importance of such techniques is increasing as collaboration through wide-area and mobile networks becomes popular.Optimistic replication deploys algorithms not seen in traditional \u201cpessimistic\u201d systems. Instead of synchronous replica coordination, an optimistic algorithm propagates changes in the background, discovers conflicts after they happen, and reaches agreement on the final contents incrementally.We explore the solution space for optimistic replication algorithms. This article identifies key challenges facing optimistic replication systems---ordering operations, detecting and resolving conflicts, propagating changes efficiently, and bounding replica divergence---and provides a comprehensive survey of techniques developed for addressing these challenges.","author":["Yasushi Saito","Marc Shapiro"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 37","Issue 1","March 2005","pp   42\u201381","https://doi.org/10.1145/1057977.1057980"],"date":"01 March 2005","ref":[{"text":"Adly, N. 1995.

One of the most fundamental factors impacting disk drive design is the heat dissipation and its effect on drive reliability, since high temperatures can cause off-track errors, or even head crashes. Until now, drive manufacturers have continued to meet the 40% annual growth target of the internal data rates (IDR) by increasing RPMs, and shrinking platter sizes, both of which have counter-acting effects on the heat dissipation within a drive. As this paper will show, we are getting to a point where it is becoming very difficult to stay on this roadmap. This paper presents an integrated disk drive model that captures the close relationships between capacity, performance and thermal characteristics over time. Using this model, we quantify the drop off in IDR growth rates over the next decade if we are to adhere to the thermal envelope of drive design.We present two mechanisms for buying back some of this IDR loss with Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM). The first DTM technique exploits any available thermal slack, between what the drive was intended to support and the currently lower operating temperature, to ramp up the RPM. The second DTM technique assumes that the drive is only designed for average case behavior, thus allowing higher RPMs than the thermal envelope, and employs dynamic throttling of disk drive activities to remain within this envelope.","author":["Sudhanva Gurumurthi","Anand Sivasubramaniam","Vivek K.

These applications, which typically occur in the data-path of high-speed routers, must process and forward packets with little or no buffer, making it important to maintain wire-speed throughout. A poorly designed hash table can critically affect the worst-case throughput of an application, since the number of memory accesses required for each lookup can vary. Hence, high throughput applications require hash tables with more predictable worst-case lookup performance. While published papers often assume that hash table lookups take constant time, there is significant variation in the number of items that must be accessed in a typical hash table search, leading to search times that vary by a factor of four or more.We present a novel hash table data structure and lookup algorithm which improves the performance over a naive hash table by reducing the number of memory accesses needed for the most time-consuming lookups. This allows designers to achieve higher lookup performance for a given memory bandwidth, without requiring large amounts of buffering in front of the lookup engine. Our algorithm extends the multiple-hashing Bloom Filter data structure to support exact matches and exploits recent advances in embedded memory technology. Through a combination of analysis and simulations we show that our algorithm is significantly faster than a naive hash table using the same amount of memory, hence it can support better throughput for router applications that use hash tables.","author":["Haoyu Song","Sarang Dharmapurikar","Jonathan Turner","John Lockwood"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 35","Issue 4","October 2005","pp   181\u2013192","https://doi.org/10.1145/1090191.1080114"],"date":"22 August 2005","ref":[{"text":"Cisco netflow. http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/732/Tech/netflow.","order":1},{"text":"Snort - The Open Source Network Intrusion Detection System. http://www.snort.org.","order":2},{"text":"Y.

The analysis is based on a type system that captures many common synchronization patterns. It supports classes with internal synchronization, classes that require client-side synchronization, and thread-local classes. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the type system, we have implemented it in a checker and applied it to over 40,000 lines of hand-annotated Java code. We found a number of race conditions in the standard Java libraries and other test programs. The checker required fewer than 20 additional type annotations per 1,000 lines of code. This article also describes two improvements that facilitate checking much larger programs: an algorithm for annotation inference and a user interface that clarifies warnings generated by the checker. These extensions have enabled us to use the checker for identifying race conditions in large-scale software systems with up to 500,000 lines of code.","author":["Martin Abadi","Cormac Flanagan","Stephen N.

This integration generates a unique synergy that we call a Visualization-based Computer Science Hypertextbook (VizCoSH). By borrowing features of both traditional hypertextbooks and course management systems, VizCoSHs become delivery platforms that address some of the reasons why visualizations have failed to find widespread use in education.The heart of the paper describes these features and explains, from both a student and teacher perspective, how each feature adds educational value to a visualization. In some cases, this value focuses on pedagogical issues, taking advantage of known strategies for making visualizations more engaging and effective. In other cases, the emphasis is on making it easier for teachers to use visualizations. A set of possible use scenarios and approaches for increasing interest in adopting a VizCoSH are also presented.","author":["Guido R\u00f6\u00dfling","Thomas Naps","Mark S.

One way to achieve this goal is to avoid maintaining duplicate copies of the same data. Eliminating redundant data at the source by not writing data which has already been stored not only reduces storage overheads, but can also improve bandwidth utilization. For these reasons, in the face of today's exponentially growing data volumes, redundant data elimination techniques have assumed critical significance in the design of modern storage systems.Intelligent object partitioning techniques identify data that is new when objects are updated, and transfer only these chunks to a storage server. In this article, we propose a new object partitioning technique, called fingerdiff, that improves upon existing schemes in several important respects. Most notably, fingerdiff dynamically chooses a partitioning strategy for a data object based on its similarities with previously stored objects in order to improve storage and bandwidth utilization. We present a detailed evaluation of fingerdiff, and other existing object partitioning schemes, using a set of real-world workloads. We show that for these workloads, the duplicate elimination strategies employed by fingerdiff improve storage utilization on average by 25%, and bandwidth utilization on average by 40% over comparable techniques.","author":["Deepak R.

What are normal growth patterns in social, technological, and information networks? Many studies have discovered patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a large network or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena, and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time.Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time with the number of edges growing superlinearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)).Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a forest fire spreading process that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires very few parameters (like the flammability of nodes), and produces graphs exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present study.We also notice that the forest fire model exhibits a sharp transition between sparse graphs and graphs that are densifying. Graphs with decreasing distance between the nodes are generated around this transition point.Last, we analyze the connection between the temporal evolution of the degree distribution and densification of a graph. We find that the two are fundamentally related. We also observe that real networks exhibit this type of relation between densification and the degree distribution.","author":["Jure Leskovec","Jon Kleinberg","Christos Faloutsos"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data","Volume 1","Issue 1","March 2007","pp   2\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.1145/1217299.1217301"],"date":"01 March 2007","ref":[{"text":"Abello, J. 2004.

YAGO builds on entities and relations and currently contains more than 1 million entities and 5 million facts. This includes the Is-A hierarchy as well as non-taxonomic relations between entities (such as HASONEPRIZE). The facts have been automatically extracted from Wikipedia and unified with WordNet, using a carefully designed combination of rule-based and heuristic methods described in this paper. The resulting knowledge base is a major step beyond WordNet: in quality by adding knowledge about individuals like persons, organizations, products, etc. with their semantic relationships - and in quantity by increasing the number of facts by more than an order of magnitude. Our empirical evaluation of fact correctness shows an accuracy of about 95%. YAGO is based on a logically clean model, which is decidable, extensible, and compatible with RDFS. Finally, we show how YAGO can be further extended by state-of-the-art information extraction techniques.","author":["Fabian M.

A wide range of biologically interesting phenomena, however, occur over time scales on the order of a millisecond--about three orders of magnitude beyond the duration of the longest current MD simulations. In this paper, we describe a massively parallel machine called Anton, which should be capable of executing millisecond-scale classical MD simulations of such biomolecular systems. The machine, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2008, is based on 512 identical MD-specific ASICs that interact in a tightly coupled manner using a specialized high-speed communication network. Anton has been designed to use both novel parallel algorithms and special-purpose logic to dramatically accelerate those calculations that dominate the time required for a typical MD simulation. The remainder of the simulation algorithm is executed by a programmable portion of each chip that achieves a substantial degree of parallelism while preserving the flexibility necessary to accommodate anticipated advances in physical models and simulation methods.","author":["David E.

Biologically-inspired and quantum computing represent two emerging technology vectors for novel computing architectures within nanoelectronics. However, potential benefits will come at the cost of increased device sensitivity to the surrounding environment. This article provides a dependability perspective over these technologies from a designer's standpoint. Maintaining or increasing the dependability of unconventional computational processes is discussed in two different contexts, a bio-inspired computing architecture (the Embryonics project) and a quantum computational architecture (the QUERIST project).","author":["Lucian Prodan","Mihai Udrescu","Oana Boncalo","Mircea Vladutiu"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 3","Issue 2","July 2007","pp   6\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.1145/1265949.1265952"],"date":"01 July 2007","ref":[{"text":"Aharonov, D. and Ben-Or, M. 1997.

However, in order to harness the additional compute resources of a CMP, applications must expose their thread-level parallelism to the hardware. One common approach to doing this is to decompose a program into parallel \"tasks\" and allow an underlying software layer to schedule these tasks to different threads. Software task scheduling can provide good parallel performance as long as tasks are large compared to the software overheads.We examine a set of applications from an important emerging domain: Recognition, Mining, and Synthesis (RMS). Many RMS applications are compute-intensive and have abundant thread-level parallelism, and are therefore good targets for running on a CMP. However, a significant number have small tasks for which software task schedulers achieve only limited parallel speedups.We propose Carbon, a hardware technique to accelerate dynamic task scheduling on scalable CMPs. Carbon has relatively simple hardware, most of which can be placed far from the cores. We compare Carbon to some highly tuned software task schedulers for a set of RMS benchmarks with small tasks. Carbon delivers significant performance improvements over the best software scheduler: on average for 64 cores, 68% faster on a set of loop-parallel benchmarks, and 109% faster on aset of task-parallel benchmarks.","author":["Sanjeev Kumar","Christopher J.

Our authority-mode architecture has trust rooted in two critical secrets: a Device Root Key and a Storage Root Hash, initialized in the device by the trusted authority. Our architecture protects trusted software, bound to the device, which can use the root secrets to protect other sensitive information for many different usage scenarios. We describe a detailed usage scenario for crisis response, where first responders are given transient access to third-party sensitive information which can be securely accessed during a crisis and reliably revoked after the crisis is over. We leverage the Concealed Execution Mode of our earlier user-mode SP (Secret-Protecting) architecture to protect trusted code and its execution [1]. We call our new architecture authority-mode SP since it shares the same architectural lineage and the goal of minimalist hardware roots of trust. However, we completely change the key management hardware and software to enable new remote trust mechanisms that user-mode SP cannot support. In our new architecture, trust is built on top of the shared root key which binds together the secrets, policy and trusted software on the device. As a result, the authority-mode SP architecture can be used to provide significant new functionality including transient access to secrets with reliable revocation mechanisms, controlled transitive support for policy-controlled secrets belonging to different organizations, and remote attestation and secure communications with the authority.","author":["Jeffrey S.

Current techniques for full-custom design of droplet-based \u201cdigital\u201d biochips do not scale well for concurrent assays and for next-generation system-on-chip (SOC) designs that are expected to include microfluidic components. We propose a system design methodology that attempts to apply classical high-level synthesis techniques to the design of digital microfluidic biochips. We focus here on the problem of scheduling bioassay functions under resource constraints. We first develop an optimal scheduling strategy based on integer linear programming. However, because the scheduling problem is NP-complete, we also develop two heuristic techniques that scale well for large problem instances. A clinical diagnostic procedure, namely multiplexed in-vitro diagnostics on human physiological fluids, is first used to illustrate and evaluate the proposed method. Next, the synthesis approach is applied to a protein assay, which serves as a more complex bioassay application. The proposed synthesis approach is expected to reduce human effort and design cycle time, and it will facilitate the integration of microfluidic components with microelectronic components in next-generation SOCs.","author":["Fei Su","Krishnendu Chakrabarty"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 3","Issue 4","January 2008","Article No.: 1","pp   1\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/1324177.1324178"],"date":"28 January 2008","ref":[{"text":"Aarts, E. and Korst, J. 1989.

The Merge framework replaces current ad hoc approaches to parallel programming on heterogeneous platforms with a rigorous, library-based methodology that can automatically distribute computation across heterogeneous cores to achieve increased energy and performance efficiency. The Merge framework provides (1) a predicate dispatch-based library system for managing and invoking function variants for multiple architectures; (2) a high-level, library-oriented parallel language based on map-reduce; and (3) a compiler and runtime which implement the map-reduce language pattern by dynamically selecting the best available function implementations for a given input and machine configuration. Using a generic sequencer architecture interface for heterogeneous accelerators, the Merge framework can integrate function variants for specialized accelerators, offering the potential for to-the-metal performance for a wide range of heterogeneous architectures, all transparent to the user. The Merge framework has been prototyped on a heterogeneous platform consisting of an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU and an 8-core 32-thread Intel Graphics and Media Accelerator X3000, and a homogeneous 32-way Unisys SMP system with Intel Xeon processors. We implemented a set of benchmarks using the Merge framework and enhanced the library with X3000 specific implementations, achieving speedups of 3.6x -- 8.5x using the X3000 and 5.2x -- 22x using the 32-way system relative to the straight C reference implementation on a single IA32 core.","author":["Michael D.

These systems often rely on Collaborating Filtering (CF), where past transactions are analyzed in order to establish connections between users and products. The two more successful approaches to CF are latent factor models, which directly profile both users and products, and neighborhood models, which analyze similarities between products or users. In this work we introduce some innovations to both approaches. The factor and neighborhood models can now be smoothly merged, thereby building a more accurate combined model. Further accuracy improvements are achieved by extending the models to exploit both explicit and implicit feedback by the users. The methods are tested on the Netflix data. Results are better than those previously published on that dataset. In addition, we suggest a new evaluation metric, which highlights the differences among methods, based on their performance at a top-K recommendation task.","author":["Yehuda Koren"],"issue":["KDD '08: Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2008","Pages   426\u2013434","https://doi.org/10.1145/1401890.1401944"],"date":"24 August 2008","ref":[{"text":".

In order to develop suitable protection mechanisms against data corruption, it is essential to understand its characteristics. In this article, we present the first large-scale study of data corruption. We analyze corruption instances recorded in production storage systems containing a total of 1.53 million disk drives, over a period of 41 months. We study three classes of corruption: checksum mismatches, identity discrepancies, and parity inconsistencies. We focus on checksum mismatches since they occur the most.We find more than 400,000 instances of checksum mismatches over the 41-month period. We find many interesting trends among these instances, including: (i) nearline disks (and their adapters) develop checksum mismatches an order of magnitude more often than enterprise-class disk drives, (ii) checksum mismatches within the same disk are not independent events and they show high spatial and temporal locality, and (iii) checksum mismatches across different disks in the same storage system are not independent. We use our observations to derive lessons for corruption-proof system design.","author":["Lakshmi N. Bairavasundaram","Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau","Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau","Garth R.

A log-structured file system writes all modifications to disk sequentially in a log-like structure, thereby speeding up both file writing and crash recovery. The log is the only structure on disk; it contains indexing information so that files can be read back from the log efficiently. In order to maintain large free areas on disk for fast writing, we divide the log intosegmentsand use a segment cleaner to compress the live information from heavily fragmented segments. We present a series of simulations that demonstrate the efficiency of a simple cleaning policy based on cost and benefit. We have implemented a prototype  log-structured file system called Sprite LFS; it outperforms current Unix file systems by an order of magnitude for small-file writes while matching or exceeding Unix performance for reads and large writes. Even when the overhead for cleaning is included, Sprite LFS can use 70% of the disk bandwidth for writing, whereas Unix file systems typically can use only 5\u201310%.","author":["Mendel Rosenblum","John K.

However, unprotected hardware implementations are susceptible to side-channel attacks, and Differential Power Analysis (DPA) has been shown to be especially powerful. In this work, we evaluate and compare the effectiveness of common hiding countermeasures against DPA in FPGA-based designs, using the Whirlpool hash function as a case study. In particular, we develop a new design flow called Isolated WDDL (IWDDL). In contrast with previous works, IWDDL isolates the direct and complementary circuit paths, and also provides DPA resistance in the Hamming distance power model. The analysis is supported using actual implementation results.","author":["Robert P. McEvoy","Colin C. Murphy","William P.

A subspace iteration algorithm is used to compute a sequence of sets of vectors that converge to an orthonormal basis for the invariant subspace corresponding to the required eigenvalues. This algorithm is combined with Chebychev acceleration if the rightmost or leftmost eigenvalues are sought, or if the eigenvalues of largest modulus are known to be the rightmost or leftmost eigenvalues. An option exists for computing the corresponding eigenvectors. The code does not need the matrix explicitly since it only requires the user to multiply sets of vectors by the matrix. Sophisticated and novel iteration controls, stopping criteria, and restart facilities are provided. The code is shown to be efficient and competitive on a range of test problems.","author":["I. S.

In contrast, phase change memory (PCM) storage relies on scalable current and thermal mechanisms. To exploit PCM's scalability as a DRAM alternative, PCM must be architected to address relatively long latencies, high energy writes, and finite endurance.We propose, crafted from a fundamental understanding of PCM technology parameters, area-neutral architectural enhancements that address these limitations and make PCM competitive with DRAM. A baseline PCM system is 1.6x slower and requires 2.2x more energy than a DRAM system. Buffer reorganizations reduce this delay and energy gap to 1.2x and 1.0x, using narrow rows to mitigate write energy and multiple rows to improve locality and write coalescing. Partial writes enhance memory endurance, providing 5.6 years of lifetime. Process scaling will further reduce PCM energy costs and improve endurance.","author":["Benjamin C.

To address the interdependency among data instances, relational learning has been proposed, and collective inference based on network connectivity is adopted for prediction. However, connections in social media are often multi-dimensional. An actor can connect to another actor for different reasons, e.g., alumni, colleagues, living in the same city, sharing similar interests, etc. Collective inference normally does not differentiate these connections. In this work, we propose to extract latent social dimensions based on network information, and then utilize them as features for discriminative learning. These social dimensions describe diverse affiliations of actors hidden in the network, and the discriminative learning can automatically determine which affiliations are better aligned with the class labels. Such a scheme is preferred when multiple diverse relations are associated with the same network. We conduct extensive experiments on social media data (one from a real-world blog site and the other from a popular content sharing site). Our model outperforms representative relational learning methods based on collective inference, especially when few labeled data are available. The sensitivity of this model and its connection to existing methods are also examined.","author":["Lei Tang","Huan Liu"],"issue":["KDD '09: Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","June 2009","Pages   817\u2013826","https://doi.org/10.1145/1557019.1557109"],"date":"28 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"E.

In this paper we provide further evidence that this approach solves the programmability problem for this domain by targeting a more complex architecture, composed of a multicore processor and multiple hardware accelerators (GPUs, Cell B.E., etc.), each with its own local memory, resulting in a platform more reminiscent of a heterogeneous distributed-memory system. In particular, we show that the FLAME programming model accommodates this new situation effortlessly so that no significant change needs to be made to the codebase. All complexity is hidden inside the SuperMatrix runtime scheduling mechanism, which incorporates software implementations of standard cache/memory coherence techniques in computer architecture to improve the performance. Our experimental evaluation on a Intel Xeon 8-core host linked to an NVIDIA Tesla S870 platform with four GPUs delivers peak performances around 550 and 450 (single-precision) GFLOPS for the matrix-matrix product and the Cholesky factorization, respectively, which we believe to be the best performance numbers posted on this new architecture for such operations.","author":["Gregorio Quintana-Ort\u00ed","Francisco D.

It makes the case for using a two-tier hybrid wireless/wired architecture to interconnect hundreds to thousands of cores in chip multiprocessors (CMPs), where current interconnect technologies face severe scaling limitations in excessive latency, long wiring, and complex layout. We propose a recursive wireless interconnect structure called the WCube that features a single transmit antenna and multiple receive antennas at each micro wireless router and offers scalable performance in terms of latency and connectivity. We show the feasibility to build miniature on-chip antennas, and simple transmitters and receivers that operate at 100-500 GHz sub-terahertz frequency bands. We also devise new two-tier wormhole based routing algorithms that are deadlock free and ensure a minimum-latency route on a 1000-core on-chip interconnect network. Our simulations show that our protocol suite can reduce the observed latency by 20% to 45%, and consumes power that is comparable to or less than current 2-D wired mesh designs.","author":["Suk-Bok Lee","Sai-Wang Tam","Ioannis Pefkianakis","Songwu Lu","M.

The implementation of streaming programs in FPGAs has attracted significant attention because of their inherent parallelism and high performance requirements. Languages, tools, and even custom hardware for streaming have been proposed, some of which are commercially available. There are several significant challenges to realizing streaming applications directly in hardware (FPGAs). Since FPGAs have finite resources, there are often many non-trivial tradeoffs between processing throughput and overall latency. In this paper, we describe an algorithm that computes refinements of stream graphs into designs that optimize processing throughput subject to user-specified area and latency constraints.","author":["Andrei Hagiescu","Weng-Fai Wong","David F.

This paper addresses the issue on collective intelligence retrieval with activated knowledge-base decision making. Our methodology differs from the existing literature in the sense that we are doing analysis on Twitter microblog messages as opposed to traditional blog analysis in the literature which deals with the conventional 'blogosphere'. Another key difference in our methodology is that we apply visualization techniques in conjunction with artificial intelligence-based data mining methods to classify messages dealing with the trend topic. Our methodology also analyzes demographics of the authors of such Twitter messages and attempt to map a Twitter trend into what's going on in the real world. Our findings reveal a pattern behind trends on Twitter, enabling us to see how it 'ticks' and evolves though visualization methods. Our findings also enable us to understand the underlying characteristics behind the 'trend setters', providing us a new perspective on the contributors of a trend.","author":["Marc Cheong","Vincent Lee"],"issue":["SWSM '09: Proceedings of the 2nd ACM workshop on Social web search and mining","November 2009","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/1651437.1651439"],"date":"02 November 2009","ref":[{"text":"Twitter Incorporated, \"Twitter.\" 2009.","order":1},{"text":"T.

Main advantages of PRAM are non-volatility, byte addressability, in-place programmability, low-power operation, and higher write endurance than that of current flash memories. However, the relatively low write bandwidth and the less-than-desirable write endurance of PRAM remain room for improvement. This paper proposes and evaluates Flip-N-Write, a simple microarchitectural technique to replace a PRAM write operation with a more efficient read-modify-write operation. On a write, after quick bit-by-bit inspection of the original data word and the new data word, Flip-N-Write writes either the new data word or the \"flipped\" value of it. Flip-N-Write introduces a single bit associated with each PRAM word to indicate whether the PRAM word has been flipped or not. We analytically and experimentally show that the proposed technique reduces the PRAM write time by half, more than doubles the write endurance, and achieves commensurate savings in write energy under the same instantaneous write power constraint. Due to its simplicity, Flip-N-Write is straightforward to implement within a PRAM device.","author":["Sangyeun Cho","Hyunjin Lee"],"issue":["MICRO 42: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2009","Pages   347\u2013357","https://doi.org/10.1145/1669112.1669157"],"date":"12 December 2009","ref":[{"text":"S.

To squeeze maximum value from the infrastructure, researchers have proposed over-subscribing power circuits, relying on the observation that peak loads are rare. To ensure availability, these proposals employ power capping, which throttles server performance during utilization spikes to enforce safe power budgets. However, because budgets must be enforced locally -- at each power distribution unit (PDU) -- local utilization spikes may force throttling even when power delivery capacity is available elsewhere. Moreover, the need to maintain reserve capacity for fault tolerance on power delivery paths magnifies the impact of utilization spikes.In this paper, we develop mechanisms to better utilize installed power infrastructure, reducing reserve capacity margins and avoiding performance throttling. Unlike conventional high-availability data centers, where collocated servers share identical primary and secondary power feeds, we reorganize power feeds to create shuffled power distribution topologies. Shuffled topologies spread secondary power feeds over numerous PDUs, reducing reserve capacity requirements to tolerate a single PDU failure. Second, we propose Power Routing, which schedules IT load dynamically across redundant power feeds to: (1) shift slack to servers with growing power demands, and (2) balance power draw across AC phases to reduce heating and improve electrical stability. We describe efficient heuristics for scheduling servers to PDUs (an NP-complete problem). Using data collected from nearly 1000 servers in three production facilities, we demonstrate that these mechanisms can reduce the required power infrastructure capacity relative to conventional high-availability data centers by 32% without performance degradation.","author":["Steven Pelley","David Meisner","Pooya Zandevakili","Thomas F.

Their performance on small writes, however, is much worse than mirrored disks\u2014the traditional, highly reliable, but expensive organization for secondary storage. Unfortunately, small writes are a substantial portion of the I/O workload of many important, demanding applications such as on-line transaction processing. This paper presents parity logging, a novel solution to the small write problem for redundant disk arrays. Parity logging applies journalling techniques to substantially reduce the cost of small writes. We provide a detailed analysis of parity logging and competing schemes\u2014mirroring, floating storage, and RAID level 5\u2014 and verify these models by simulation. Parity logging provides performance competitive with mirroring, the best of the alternative single failure tolerating disk array organizations. However, its overhead cost is close to the minimum offered by RAID level 5. Finally, parity logging can exploit data caching much more effectively than all three alternative approaches.","author":["Daniel Stodolsky","Garth Gibson","Mark Holland"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 21","Issue 2","May 1993","pp   64\u201375","https://doi.org/10.1145/173682.165143"],"date":"01 May 1993","ref":[{"text":"A.

Effectively programming such reconfigurable architectures, however, is an extremely cumbersome and error-prone process, as it requires programmers to assume the role of hardware designers while mastering hardware description languages, thus limiting the acceptance and dissemination of this promising technology. To address this problem, researchers have developed numerous approaches at both the programming languages as well as the compilation levels, to offer high-level programming abstractions that would allow programmers to easily map applications to reconfigurable architectures. This survey describes the major research efforts on compilation techniques for reconfigurable computing architectures. The survey focuses on efforts that map computations written in imperative programming languages to reconfigurable architectures and identifies the main compilation and synthesis techniques used in this mapping.","author":["Jo\u00e3o M.

Emerging Computational RFIDs (CRFIDs) provide both sensing and general-purpose computation without batteries--instead relying on small capacitors charged by energy harvesting. CRFIDs have small form factors and consume less energy than traditional sensor motes. However, CRFIDs have yet to see widespread use because of limited autonomy and the propensity for frequent power loss as a result of the necessarily small capacitors that serve as a microcontroller's power supply. Our results show that hybrid harvesting CRFIDs, which use an ambient energy micro-harvester, can complete a variety of useful workloads--even in an environment with little ambient energy available. Our contributions include (1) benchmarks demonstrating that micro-harvesting from ambient energy sources enables greater range and read rate, as well as autonomous operation by hybrid CRFIDs, (2) a measurement study that stresses the limits of effective ambient energy harvesting for diverse workloads, (3) application studies that demonstrate the benefits of hybrid CRFIDs, and (4) a trace-driven simulator to model and evaluate the expected behavior of a CRFID with different capacitor sizes and operating under varying conditions of mobility and solar energy harvesting. Our results show that ambient harvesting can triple the effective communication range of a CRFID, quadruple the read rate, and achieve 95% uptime in RAM retention mode despite long periods of low light.","author":["Jeremy Gummeson","Shane S.

A prime example is the overfetch feature in DRAM, where a single request activates thousands of bit-lines in many DRAM chips, only to return a single cache line to the CPU. The focus on cost-per-bit is questionable in modern-day servers where operating costs can easily exceed the purchase cost. Modern technology trends are also placing very different demands on the memory system: (i)queuing delays are a significant component of memory access time, (ii) there is a high energy premium for the level of reliability expected for business-critical computing, and (iii) the memory access stream emerging from multi-core systems exhibits limited locality. All of these trends necessitate an overhaul of DRAM architecture, even if it means a slight compromise in the cost-per-bit metric. This paper examines three primary innovations. The first is a modification to DRAM chip microarchitecture that re tains the traditional DDRx SDRAMinterface. Selective Bit-line Activation (SBA) waits for both RAS (row address) and CAS (column address) signals to arrive before activating exactly those bitlines that provide the requested cache line. SBA reduces energy consumption while incurring slight area and performance penalties. The second innovation, Single Subarray Access (SSA), fundamentally re-organizes the layout of DRAM arrays and the mapping of data to these arrays so that an entire cache line is fetched from a single subarray. It requires a different interface to the memory controller, reduces dynamic and background energy (by about 6X), incurs a slight area penalty (4%), and can even lead to performance improvements (54% on average) by reducing queuing delays. The third innovation further penalizes the cost-per-bit metric by adding a checksum feature to each cache line. This checksum error-detection feature can then be used to build stronger RAID-like fault tolerance, including chipkill-level reliability. Such a technique is especially crucial for the SSA architecture where the entire cache line is localized to a single chip. This DRAM chip microarchitectural change leads to a dramatic reduction in the energy and storage overheads for reliability. The proposed architectures will also apply to other emerging memory technologies (such as resistive memories) and will be less disruptive to standards, interfaces, and the design flow if they can be incorporated into first-generation designs.","author":["Aniruddha N.

Like SRAM, eDRAM is susceptible to device variations, which play a role in determining refresh time for eDRAM cells. Refresh power potentially represents a large fraction of overall system power, particularly during low-power states when the CPU is idle. Future designs need to reduce cache power without incurring the high cost of flushing cache data when entering low-power states.In this paper, we show the significant impact of variations on refresh time and cache power consumption for large eDRAM caches. We propose Hi-ECC, a technique that incorporates multi-bit error-correcting codes to significantly reduce refresh rate. Multi-bit error-correcting codes usually have a complex decoder design and high storage cost. Hi-ECC avoids the decoder complexity by using strong ECC codes to identify and disable sections of the cache with multi-bit failures, while providing efficient single-bit error correction for the common case. Hi-ECC includes additional optimizations that allow us to amortize the storage cost of the code over large data words, providing the benefit of multi-bit correction at same storage cost as a single-bit error-correcting (SECDED) code (2% overhead). Our proposal achieves a 93% reduction in refresh power vs. a baseline eDRAM cache without error correcting capability, and a 66% reduction in refresh power vs. a system using SECDED codes.","author":["Chris Wilkerson","Alaa R.

We present a method to optimally distribute a given energy budget among adders in a dataflow graph so as to minimize expected errors. The method is based on new formal mathematical models and algorithms, which quantitatively characterize the relative importance of the adders in a circuit. We demonstrate this method on a finite impulse response filter and a Fast Fourier Transform. The optimized energy distribution yields 2.05X lower error in a 16-point FFT and images with SNR 1.42X higher than those achieved by the best previous approach.","author":["Zvi Kedem","Vincent J.

Its applications include surveillance systems, patient monitoring systems, and a variety of systems that involve interactions between persons and electronic devices such as human-computer interfaces. Most of these applications require an automated recognition of high-level activities, composed of multiple simple (or atomic) actions of persons. This article provides a detailed overview of various state-of-the-art research papers on human activity recognition. We discuss both the methodologies developed for simple human actions and those for high-level activities. An approach-based taxonomy is chosen that compares the advantages and limitations of each approach.Recognition methodologies for an analysis of the simple actions of a single person are first presented in the article. Space-time volume approaches and sequential approaches that represent and recognize activities directly from input images are discussed. Next, hierarchical recognition methodologies for high-level activities are presented and compared. Statistical approaches, syntactic approaches, and description-based approaches for hierarchical recognition are discussed in the article. In addition, we further discuss the papers on the recognition of human-object interactions and group activities. Public datasets designed for the evaluation of the recognition methodologies are illustrated in our article as well, comparing the methodologies' performances. This review will provide the impetus for future research in more productive areas.","author":["J.K. Aggarwal","M.S.

Through a coupling of compile-time analysis routines and hardware synthesis tools, we automatically configure a given set of the hardware-programmable functional units (PFUs) and thus augment the base instruction set architecture so that it better meets the instruction set needs of each application. We refer to this new class of general-purpose computers as PRogrammable Instruction Set Computers (PRISC). Although similar in concept, the PRISC approach differs from dynamically programmable microcode because in PRISC we define entirely-new primitive datapath operations. In this paper, we concentrate on the microarchitectural design of the simplest form of PRISC\u2014a RISC microprocessor with a single PFU that only evaluates combinational functions. We briefly discuss the operating system and the programming language compilation techniques that are needed to successfully build PRISC and, we present performance results from a proof-of-concept study. With the inclusion of a single 32-bit-wide PFU whose hardware cost is less than that of a 1 kilobyte SRAM, our study shows a 22% improvement in processor performance on the SPECint92 benchmarks.","author":["Rahul Razdan","Michael D.

Chaski is a task-level executive that enables a robot to collaboratively execute a shared plan with a person. The system chooses and schedules the robot's actions, adapts to the human partner, and acts to minimize the human's idle time. We evaluate Chaski in human subject experiments in which a person works with a mobile and dexterous robot to collaboratively assemble structures using building blocks. We measure team performance outcomes for robots controlled by Chaski compared to robots that are verbally commanded, step-by-step by the human teammate. We show that Chaski reduces the human's idle time by 85%, a statistically significant difference. This result supports the hypothesis that human-robot team performance is improved when a robot emulates the effective coordination behaviors observed in human teams.","author":["Julie Shah","James Wiken","Brian Williams","Cynthia Breazeal"],"issue":["HRI '11: Proceedings of the 6th international conference on Human-robot interaction","March 2011","Pages   29\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/1957656.1957668"],"date":"06 March 2011","ref":[{"text":"R.

Mementos is a software system that transforms general-purpose programs into interruptible computations that are protected from frequent power losses by automatic, energy-aware state checkpointing. Mementos comprises a collection of optimization passes for the LLVM compiler infrastructure and a linkable library that exercises hardware support for energy measurement while managing state checkpoints stored in nonvolatile memory. We evaluate Mementos against diverse test cases in a trace-driven simulator of transiently powered RFID-scale devices. Although Mementos's energy checks increase run time when energy is plentiful, they allow Mementos to safely suspend execution when energy dwindles, effectively spreading computation across zero or more power failures. This paper's contributions are: a study of the runtime environment for programs on RFID-scale devices; an energy-aware state checkpointing system for these devices that is implemented for the MSP430 family of microcontrollers; and a trace-driven simulator of transiently powered RFID-scale devices.","author":["Benjamin Ransford","Jacob Sorber","Kevin Fu"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 46","Issue 3","March 2011","pp   159\u2013170","https://doi.org/10.1145/1961296.1950386"],"date":"05 March 2011","ref":[{"text":"W.

However, their efficiency is sensitive to dynamic irregular memory references and control flows in an application. Experiments have shown great performance gains when these irregularities are removed. But it remains an open question how to achieve those gains through software approaches on modern GPUs.This paper presents a systematic exploration to tackle dynamic irregularities in both control flows and memory references. It reveals some properties of dynamic irregularities in both control flows and memory references, their interactions, and their relations with program data and threads. It describes several heuristics-based algorithms and runtime adaptation techniques for effectively removing dynamic irregularities through data reordering and job swapping. It presents a framework, G-Streamline, as a unified software solution to dynamic irregularities in GPU computing. G-Streamline has several distinctive properties. It is a pure software solution and works on the fly, requiring no hardware extensions or offline profiling. It treats both types of irregularities at the same time in a holistic fashion, maximizing the whole-program performance by resolving conflicts among optimizations. Its optimization overhead is largely transparent to GPU kernel executions, jeopardizing no basic efficiency of the GPU application. Finally, it is robust to the presence of various complexities in GPU applications. Experiments show that G-Streamline is effective in reducing dynamic irregularities in GPU computing, producing speedups between 1.07 and 2.5 for a variety of applications.","author":["Eddy Z.

Our solution is based on a transform that defines an isometry between curves on the 2D image manifold in 5D and the real line. This transform preserves the geodesic distance between points on these curves, adaptively warping the input signal so that 1D edge-preserving filtering can be efficiently performed in linear time. We demonstrate three realizations of 1D edge-preserving filters, show how to produce high-quality 2D edge-preserving filters by iterating 1D-filtering operations, and empirically analyze the convergence of this process. Our approach has several desirable features: the use of 1D operations leads to considerable speedups over existing techniques and potential memory savings; its computational cost is not affected by the choice of the filter parameters; and it is the first edge-preserving filter to work on color images at arbitrary scales in real time, without resorting to subsampling or quantization. We demonstrate the versatility of our domain transform and edge-preserving filters on several real-time image and video processing tasks including edge-preserving filtering, depth-of-field effects, stylization, recoloring, colorization, detail enhancement, and tone mapping.","author":["Eduardo S.

While this freedom leads to many potential benefits, the running services must be minimally disrupted by the migration. Unfortunately, current solutions for wide-area migration incur too much disruption as they will significantly slow down storage I/O operations during migration. The resulting increase in service latency could be very costly to a business. This paper presents a novel storage migration scheduling algorithm that can greatly improve storage I/O performance during wide-area migration. Our algorithm is unique in that it considers individual virtual machine's storage I/O workload such as temporal locality, spatial locality and popularity characteristics to compute an efficient data transfer schedule. Using a fully implemented system on KVM and a trace-driven framework, we show that our algorithm provides large performance benefits across a wide range of popular virtual machine workloads.","author":["Jie Zheng","Tze Sing Eugene Ng","Kunwadee Sripanidkulchai"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 46","Issue 7","July 2011","pp   133\u2013144","https://doi.org/10.1145/2007477.1952700"],"date":"09 March 2011","ref":[{"text":"Michael Armbrust, Armando Fox, Rean Griffith, and et. al.

We focus on the use of category information and show the advantage of a category-based representation over a term-based representation, and also demonstrate the effectiveness of category-based expansion using example entities.

This applies to both production datacenters and cloud environments. Network performance variability hurts application performance which makes tenant costs unpredictable and causes provider revenue loss. Motivated by these factors, this paper makes the case for extending the tenant-provider interface to explicitly account for the network. We argue this can be achieved by providing tenants with a virtual network connecting their compute instances. To this effect, the key contribution of this paper is the design of virtual network abstractions that capture the trade-off between the performance guarantees offered to tenants, their costs and the provider revenue.To illustrate the feasibility of virtual networks, we develop Oktopus, a system that implements the proposed abstractions. Using realistic, large-scale simulations and an Oktopus deployment on a 25-node two-tier testbed, we demonstrate that the use of virtual networks yields significantly better and more predictable tenant performance. Further, using a simple pricing model, we find that the our abstractions can reduce tenant costs by up to 74% while maintaining provider revenue neutrality.","author":["Hitesh Ballani","Paolo Costa","Thomas Karagiannis","Ant Rowstron"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 41","Issue 4","August 2011","pp   242\u2013253","https://doi.org/10.1145/2043164.2018465"],"date":"15 August 2011","ref":[{"text":"Amazon EC2 Spot Instances. http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/.","order":1},{"text":"Amazon Cluster Compute, Jan. 2011. http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/hpc-applications/.","order":2},{"text":"Amazon's EC2 Generating 220M, Jan. 2011. http://bit.ly/8rZdu.","order":3},{"text":"Traffic Control API, Jan. 2011. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa374468%28v=VS.85%29.aspx.","order":4},{"text":"M.

We first introduce an exact common subexpression elimination (CSE) algorithm that formalizes the minimization of the number of operations as a 0-1 integer linear programming problem. Since there are still instances that the proposed exact algorithm cannot handle due to the NP-completeness of the problem, we also introduce a CSE heuristic algorithm that iteratively finds the most common 2-term subexpressions with the minimum conflicts among the expressions. Furthermore, since the main drawback of CSE algorithms is their dependency on a particular number representation, we propose a hybrid algorithm that initially finds promising realizations of linear transforms using a numerical difference method, and then applies the proposed CSE algorithm to utilize the common subexpressions iteratively. The experimental results on a comprehensive set of instances indicate that the proposed approximate algorithms find competitive results with those of the exact CSE algorithm and obtain better solutions than the prominent, previously proposed, heuristics. It is also observed that our solutions yield significant area reductions in the design of linear transforms after circuit synthesis, compared to direct realizations of linear transforms.","author":["Levent Aksoy","Eduardo Costa","Paulo Flores","Jose Monteiro"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 17","Issue 1","January 2012","Article No.: 3","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/2071356.2071359"],"date":"01 January 2012","ref":[{"text":"2007.

While MapReduce is used in many areas where massive data analysis is required, there are still debates on its performance, efficiency per node, and simple abstraction. This survey intends to assist the database and open source communities in understanding various technical aspects of the MapReduce framework. In this survey, we characterize the MapReduce framework and discuss its inherent pros and cons. We then introduce its optimization strategies reported in the recent literature. We also discuss the open issues and challenges raised on parallel data analysis with MapReduce.","author":["Kyong-Ha Lee","Yoon-Joon Lee","Hyunsik Choi","Yon Dohn Chung","Bongki Moon"],"issue":["ACM SIGMOD Record","Volume 40","Issue 4","December 2011","pp   11\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/2094114.2094118"],"date":"11 January 2012","ref":[{"text":"Mahout: Scalable machine-learning and data-mining library. http://mapout.apache.org, 2010.","order":1},{"text":"F.N.

The resulting signal is then amplified to reveal hidden information. Using our method, we are able to visualize the flow of blood as it fills the face and also to amplify and reveal small motions.

A slew of manual design techniques for approximate computing have been proposed in recent years, but very little effort has been devoted to design automation. We propose SALSA, a Systematic methodology for Automatic Logic Synthesis of Approximate circuits. Given a golden RTL specification of a circuit and a quality constraint that defines the amount of error that may be introduced in the implementation, SALSA synthesizes an approximate version of the circuit that adheres to the pre-specified quality bounds. We make two key contributions: (i) the rigorous formulation of the problem of approximate logic synthesis, enabling the generation of circuits that are correct by construction, and (ii) mapping the problem of approximate synthesis into an equivalent traditional logic synthesis problem, thereby allowing the capabilities of existing synthesis tools to be fully utilized for approximate logic synthesis. In order to achieve these benefits, SALSA encodes the quality constraints using logic functions called Q-functions, and captures the flexibility that they engender as Approximation Don't Cares (ADCs), which are used for circuit simplification using traditional don't care based optimization techniques. We have implemented SALSA using two off-the-shelf logic synthesis tools - SIS and Synopsys Design Compiler. We automatically synthesize approximate circuits ranging from arithmetic building blocks (adders, multipliers, MAC) to entire datapaths (DCT, FIR, IIR, SAD, FFT Butterfly, Euclidean distance), demonstrating scalability and significant improvements in area (1.1X to 1.85X for tight error constraints, and 1.2X to 4.75X for relaxed error constraints) and power (1.15X to 1.75X for tight error constraints, and 1.3X to 5.25X for relaxed error constraints).","author":["Swagath Venkataramani","Amit Sabne","Vivek Kozhikkottu","Kaushik Roy","Anand Raghunathan"],"issue":["DAC '12: Proceedings of the 49th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2012","Pages   796\u2013801","https://doi.org/10.1145/2228360.2228504"],"date":"03 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"Y.

A variety of schemes have been proposed to address either the latency or the energy consumption of DRAMs. These schemes typically require non-trivial hardware changes and end up improving latency at the cost of energy or vice-versa. One specific DRAM performance problem in multicores is that interleaved accesses from different cores can potentially degrade row-buffer locality. In this paper, based on the temporal and spatial locality characteristics of memory accesses, we propose a reorganization of the existing single large row-buffer in a DRAM bank into multiple sub-row buffers (MSRB). This re-organization not only improves row hit rates, and hence the average memory latency, but also brings down the energy consumed by the DRAM. The first major contribution of this work is proposing such a reorganization without requiring any significant changes to the existing widely accepted DRAM specifications. Our proposed reorganization improves weighted speedup by 35.8%, 14.5% and 21.6% in quad, eight and sixteen core workloads along with a 42%, 28% and 31% reduction in DRAM energy. The proposed MSRB organization enables opportunities for the management of multiple row-buffers at the memory controller level. As the memory controller is aware of the behaviour of individual cores it allows us to implement coordinated buffer allocation schemes for different cores that take into account program behaviour. We demonstrate two such schemes, namely Fairness Oriented Allocation and Performance Oriented Allocation, which show the flexibility that memory controllers can now exploit in our MSRB organization to improve overall performance and/or fairness. Further, the MSRB organization enables additional opportunities for DRAM intra-bank parallelism and selective early precharging of the LRU row-buffer to further improve memory access latencies. These two optimizations together provide an additional 5.9% performance improvement.","author":["Nagendra Dwarakanath Gulur","R. Manikantan","Mahesh Mehendale","R.

LH* generalizes Linear Hashing (LH) to distributed RAM and disk files. An LH* file can be created from records with primary keys, or objects with OIDs, provided by any number of distributed and autonomous clients. It does not require a central directory, and grows gracefully, through splits of one bucket at a time, to virtually any number of servers. The number of messages per random insertion is one in general, and three in the worst case, regardless of the file size. The number of messages per key search is two in general, and four in the worst case. The file supports parallel operations, e.g., hash joins and scans. Performing a parallel operation on a file of M buckets costs at most 2M +   1 messages, and between 1 and O(log2 Mrounds of messages.We first describle the basic LH* scheme where a coordinator site manages abucket splits, and splits a bucket every time a collision occurs. We show that the average load factor of an LH* file is 65%\u201370% regardless of file size, and bucket capacity. We then enhance the scheme with load control, performed at no additional message cost. The average load factor then increases to 80\u201395%. These values are about that of LH, but the load factor for LH* varies more.We nest define LH* schemes without a coordinator. We show that insert and search costs are the same as for the basic scheme. The splitting cost decreases on the average, but becomes more  variable, as cascading splits are needed to prevent file overload. Next, we briefly describe two variants of splitting policy, using parallel splits and presplitting that should enhance performance for high-performance applications.All together, we show that LH* files can efficiently scale to files that are orders of magnitude larger in size than single-site files. LH* files that reside in main memory may also be much faster than single-site disk files. Finally, LH* files can be more efficient than any distributed file with a centralized directory, or a static parallel or distributed hash file.","author":["Witold Litwin","Marie-Anna Neimat","Donovan A.

Indeed, while synthesis techniques for random control logic (AND/OR-intensive) are well established, no dominant method for automated synthesis of datapath logic (XOR/MAJ-intensive) has yet emerged. Recently, Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) have been adopted to create an optimization system, named BDS, that supports integrated synthesis of both AND/OR- and XOR-intensive functions through functional logic decomposition on the BDD structure. However, it does not support direct decomposition and manipulation of majority logic which, instead, is widely used in datapath circuits. In this paper, we present the first BDD-based majority logic decomposition method and a logic decomposition system, BDS-MAJ, that enables efficient logic synthesis for both random control and datapath circuits. Experimental results show that logic synthesis based on BDS-MAJ produces CMOS circuits having on average 28.8% and 26.4% less area and, at the same time, 12.8% and 20.9% smaller delay with respect to academic ABC and BDS synthesis tools. Compared to commercial Synopsys Design Compiler synthesis tool, BDS-MAJ reduces on average the circuit area by 6.0% and decreases the delay by 7.8%.","author":["Luca Amar\u00fa","Pierre-Emmanuel Gaillardon","Giovanni De Micheli"],"issue":["DAC '13: Proceedings of the 50th Annual Design Automation Conference","May 2013","Article No.: 47","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2463209.2488792"],"date":"29 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"G.

Previous work in this area has demonstrated the potential for significant energy and performance improvements, but largely consists of ad hoc techniques that have been applied to a small number of applications. Taking approximate computing closer to mainstream adoption requires (i) a deeper understanding of inherent application resilience across a broader range of applications (ii) tools that can quantitatively establish the inherent resilience of an application, and (iii) methods to quickly assess the potential of various approximate computing techniques for a given application. We make two key contributions in this direction. Our primary contribution is the analysis and characterization of inherent application resilience present in a suite of 12 widely used applications from the domains of recognition, data mining, and search. Based on this analysis, we present several new insights into the nature of resilience and its relationship to various key application characteristics. To facilitate our analysis, we propose a systematic framework for Application Resilience Characterization (ARC) that (a) partitions an application into resilient and sensitive parts and (b) characterizes the resilient parts using approximation models that abstract a wide range of approximate computing techniques. We believe that the key insights that we present can help shape further research in the area of approximate computing, while automatic resilience characterization frameworks such as ARC can greatly aid designers in the adoption approximate computing.","author":["Vinay K.

Using Twitter posts, we quantify postpartum changes in 376 mothers along dimensions of social engagement, emotion, social network, and linguistic style. We then construct statistical models from a training set of observations of these measures before and after the reported childbirth, to forecast significant postpartum changes in mothers. The predictive models can classify mothers who will change significantly following childbirth with an accuracy of 71%, using observations about their prenatal behavior, and as accurately as 80-83% when additionally leveraging the initial 2-3 weeks of postnatal data. The study is motivated by the opportunity to use social media to identify mothers at risk of postpartum depression, an underreported health concern among large populations, and to inform the design of low-cost, privacy-sensitive early-warning systems and intervention programs aimed at promoting wellness postpartum.","author":["Munmun De Choudhury","Scott Counts","Eric Horvitz"],"issue":["CHI '13: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","April 2013","Pages   3267\u20133276","https://doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2466447"],"date":"27 April 2013","ref":[{"text":"Bagehahl-Strindlund, M. & Borjesson, K.

Unfortunately, scaling DRAM to smaller technology nodes has become challenging due to the inherent difficulty in designing smaller geometries, coupled with the problems of device variation and leakage. Future DRAM devices are likely to experience significantly high error-rates. Techniques that can tolerate errors efficiently can enable DRAM to scale to smaller technology nodes. However, existing techniques such as row/column sparing and ECC become prohibitive at high error-rates. To develop cost-effective solutions for tolerating high error-rates, this paper advocates a cross-layer approach. Rather than hiding the faulty cell information within the DRAM chips, we expose it to the architectural level. We propose ArchShield, an architectural framework that employs runtime testing to identify faulty DRAM cells. ArchShield tolerates these faults using two components, a Fault Map that keeps information about faulty words in a cache line, and Selective Word-Level Replication (SWLR) that replicates faulty words for error resilience. Both Fault Map and SWLR are integrated in reserved area in DRAM memory. Our evaluations with 8GB DRAM DIMM show that ArchShield can efficiently tolerate error-rates as higher as 10\u22124 (100x higher than ECC alone), causes less than 2% performance degradation, and still maintains 1-bit error tolerance against soft errors.","author":["Prashant J.

Phase change memory (PCM) is one such candidate proposed for being part of the main memory in computing systems. One salient feature of PCM is its multi-level-cell (MLC) property, which can be used to multiply the memory capacity at the cell level. However, due to the nature of PCM that the value written to the cell can drift over time, PCM is prone to a unique type of soft errors, posing a great challenge for their practical deployment. This paper first quantitatively studied the current art for MLC PCM in dealing with the resistance drift problem and showed that the previously proposed techniques such as scrubbing or error correction mechanisms have significant reliability challenges to overcome. We then propose tri-level-cell PCM and demonstrate its ability to achieving 105 x lower soft error rate than four-level-cell PCM and 1.33 x higher information density than single-level-cell PCM. According to our findings, the tri-level-cell PCM shows 36.4% performance improvement over the four-level-cell PCM while achieving the soft error rate of DRAM.","author":["Nak Hee Seong","Sungkap Yeo","Hsien-Hsin S.

Recent work relies on static profiling to precisely predict the QoS degradation that results from performance interference among co-running applications to increase the number of \"safe\" co-locations. However, these static profiling techniques have several critical limitations: 1) a priori knowledge of all workloads is required for profiling, 2) it is difficult for the prediction to capture or adapt to phase or load changes of applications, and 3) the prediction technique is limited to only two co-running applications. To address all of these limitations, we present Bubble-Flux, an integrated dynamic interference measurement and online QoS management mechanism to provide accurate QoS control and maximize server utilization. Bubble-Flux uses a Dynamic Bubble to probe servers in real time to measure the instantaneous pressure on the shared hardware resources and precisely predict how the QoS of a latency-sensitive job will be affected by potential co-runners. Once \"safe\" batch jobs are selected and mapped to a server, Bubble-Flux uses an Online Flux Engine to continuously monitor the QoS of the latency-sensitive application and control the execution of batch jobs to adapt to dynamic input, phase, and load changes to deliver satisfactory QoS. Batch applications remain in a state of flux throughout execution. Our results show that the utilization improvement achieved by Bubble-Flux is up to 2.2x better than the prior static approach.","author":["Hailong Yang","Alex Breslow","Jason Mars","Lingjia Tang"],"issue":["ISCA '13: Proceedings of the 40th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2013","Pages   607\u2013618","https://doi.org/10.1145/2485922.2485974"],"date":"23 June 2013","ref":[{"text":"Apache hadoop. http://hadoop.apache.org.","order":1},{"text":"Apache mahout: scalable machine-learning and data-mining library. http://mahout.apache.org/.","order":2},{"text":"Cassandra. http://cassandra.apache.org.","order":3},{"text":"Faban harness and benchmark framework. http://java.net/projects/faban/.","order":4},{"text":"L.

We consider the problem of simultaneously selecting a learning algorithm and setting its hyperparameters, going beyond previous work that attacks these issues separately. We show that this problem can be addressed by a fully automated approach, leveraging recent innovations in Bayesian optimization. Specifically, we consider a wide range of feature selection techniques (combining 3 search and 8 evaluator methods) and all classification approaches implemented in WEKA's standard distribution, spanning 2 ensemble methods, 10 meta-methods, 27 base classifiers, and hyperparameter settings for each classifier. On each of 21 popular datasets from the UCI repository, the KDD Cup 09, variants of the MNIST dataset and CIFAR-10, we show classification performance often much better than using standard selection and hyperparameter optimization methods. We hope that our approach will help non-expert users to more effectively identify machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter settings appropriate to their applications, and hence to achieve improved performance.","author":["Chris Thornton","Frank Hutter","Holger H.

Understanding the indoor environments is therefore important for a wide range of emerging mobile personal and social applications. Knowledge of indoor floorplans is often required by these applications. However, indoor floorplans are either unavailable or obtaining them requires slow, tedious, and error-prone manual labor. This paper describes an automatic indoor floorplan construction system. Leveraging Wi-Fi fingerprints and user motion information, this system automatically constructs floorplan via three key steps: (1) room adjacency graph construction to determine which rooms are adjacent; (2) hallway layout learning to estimate room sizes and order rooms along each hallway, and (3) force directed dilation to adjust room sizes and optimize the overall floorplan accuracy. Deployment study in three buildings with 189 rooms demonstrates high floorplan accuracy. The system has been implemented as a mobile middleware, which allows emerging mobile applications to generate, leverage, and share indoor floorplans.","author":["Yifei Jiang","Yun Xiang","Xin Pan","Kun Li","Qin Lv","Robert P.

Commodity DRAMs will not satisfy this requirement. Additionally, the large number of memory chips (>10M) required will result in crippling failure rates. Although specialized DRAM memories have been reorganized to reduce power through 3D-stacking or row buffer resizing, their implications on fault tolerance have not been considered. We show that addressing reliability and energy is a co-optimization problem involving tradeoffs between error correction cost, access energy and refresh power---reducing the physical page size to decrease access energy increases the energy/area overhead of error resilience. Additionally, power can be reduced by optimizing bitline lengths. The proposed 3D-stacked memory uses a page size of 4kb and consumes 5.1pJ/bit based on simulations with NEK5000 benchmarks. Scaling to 100PB, the memory consumes 4.7MW at 100PB/s which, while well within the total power budget (20MW), is also error-resilient.","author":["Bharan Giridhar","Michael Cieslak","Deepankar Duggal","Ronald Dreslinski","Hsing Min Chen","Robert Patti","Betina Hold","Chaitali Chakrabarti","Trevor Mudge","David Blaauw"],"issue":["SC '13: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2013","Article No.: 23","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2503210.2503215"],"date":"17 November 2013","ref":[{"text":"Micron 1Gb DDR3 SDRAM Datasheet. http://www.micron.com/.","order":1},{"text":"NEK5000. http://nek5000.mcs.anl.gov/.","order":2},{"text":"Octopus 8-Port DRAM for Die-Stack Applications. http://www.tezzaron.com/.","order":3},{"text":"Tezzaron Semiconductor. http://www.tezzaron.com/.","order":4},{"text":"J.

Scheduling highly parallel jobs that complete in hundreds of milliseconds poses a major challenge for task schedulers, which will need to schedule millions of tasks per second on appropriate machines while offering millisecond-level latency and high availability. We demonstrate that a decentralized, randomized sampling approach provides near-optimal performance while avoiding the throughput and availability limitations of a centralized design. We implement and deploy our scheduler, Sparrow, on a 110-machine cluster and demonstrate that Sparrow performs within 12% of an ideal scheduler.","author":["Kay Ousterhout","Patrick Wendell","Matei Zaharia","Ion Stoica"],"issue":["SOSP '13: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","November 2013","Pages   69\u201384","https://doi.org/10.1145/2517349.2522716"],"date":"03 November 2013","ref":[{"text":"Apache Thrift. http://thrift.apache.org.","order":1},{"text":"G.

These logs often contain high volumes of interesting and useful information about activities in the network, and are among the first data sources that information security specialists consult when they suspect that an attack has taken place. However, security products often come from a patchwork of vendors, and are inconsistently installed and administered. They generate logs whose formats differ widely and that are often incomplete, mutually contradictory, and very large in volume. Hence, although this collected information is useful, it is often dirty. We present a novel system, Beehive, that attacks the problem of automatically mining and extracting knowledge from the dirty log data produced by a wide variety of security products in a large enterprise. We improve on signature-based approaches to detecting security incidents and instead identify suspicious host behaviors that Beehive reports as potential security incidents. These incidents can then be further analyzed by incident response teams to determine whether a policy violation or attack has occurred. We have evaluated Beehive on the log data collected in a large enterprise, EMC, over a period of two weeks. We compare the incidents identified by Beehive against enterprise Security Operations Center reports, antivirus software alerts, and feedback from enterprise security specialists. We show that Beehive is able to identify malicious events and policy violations which would otherwise go undetected.","author":["Ting-Fang Yen","Alina Oprea","Kaan Onarlioglu","Todd Leetham","William Robertson","Ari Juels","Engin Kirda"],"issue":["ACSAC '13: Proceedings of the 29th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference","December 2013","Pages   199\u2013208","https://doi.org/10.1145/2523649.2523670"],"date":"09 December 2013","ref":[{"text":"OSSEC -- Open Source Security. http://www.ossec.net.","order":1},{"text":"Snort. http://www.snort.org.","order":2},{"text":"The Bro Network Security Monitor. http://www.bro.org/.","order":3},{"text":"M.

CTP uses three techniques to provide efficient, robust, and reliable routing in highly dynamic network conditions. CTP's link estimator accurately estimates link qualities by using feedback from both the data and control planes, using information from multiple layers through narrow, platform-independent interfaces. Second, CTP uses the Trickle algorithm to time the control traffic, sending few beacons in stable topologies yet quickly adapting to changes. Finally, CTP actively probes the topology with data traffic, quickly discovering and fixing routing failures. Through experiments on 13 different testbeds, encompassing seven platforms, six link layers, and multiple densities and frequencies, and detailed observations of a long-running sensor network application that uses CTP, we study how these three techniques contribute to CTP's overall performance.","author":["Omprakash Gnawali","Rodrigo Fonseca","Kyle Jamieson","Maria Kazandjieva","David Moss","Philip Levis"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks","Volume 10","Issue 1","November 2013","Article No.: 16","pp   1\u201349","https://doi.org/10.1145/2529988"],"date":"06 December 2013","ref":[{"text":"Ahn, G.-S., Miluzzo, E., Campbell, A., Hong, S., and Cuomo, F. 2006.

Meanwhile, slowdown in supply voltage scaling has stymied improvements in core performance and ushered an era of power-limited chips. These developments motivate the design of DBMS accelerators that (a) maximize utility by accelerating the dominant operations, and (b) provide flexibility in the choice of DBMS, data layout, and data types. We study data analytics workloads on contemporary in-memory databases and find hash index lookups to be the largest single contributor to the overall execution time. The critical path in hash index lookups consists of ALU-intensive key hashing followed by pointer chasing through a node list. Based on these observations, we introduce Widx, an on-chip accelerator for database hash index lookups, which achieves both high performance and flexibility by (1) decoupling key hashing from the list traversal, and (2) processing multiple keys in parallel on a set of programmable walker units. Widx reduces design cost and complexity through its tight integration with a conventional core, thus eliminating the need for a dedicated TLB and cache. An evaluation of Widx on a set of modern data analytics workloads (TPC-H, TPC-DS) using full-system simulation shows an average speedup of 3.1x over an aggressive OoO core on bulk hash table operations, while reducing the OoO core energy by 83%.","author":["Onur Kocberber","Boris Grot","Javier Picorel","Babak Falsafi","Kevin Lim","Parthasarathy Ranganathan"],"issue":["MICRO-46: Proceedings of the 46th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2013","Pages   468\u2013479","https://doi.org/10.1145/2540708.2540748"],"date":"07 December 2013","ref":[{"text":"ARM M4 Embedded Microcontroller. http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m4-processor.php.","order":1},{"text":"C.

However, its latency and endurance have generated problems in fulfilling its main memory role. The latency can be treated with a DRAM buffer, but the endurance problem remains, with three critical points that need to be improved despite the use of, existing wear-leveling algorithms. First, existing DRAM buffering schemes do not consider write count distribution. Second, swapping and shifting operations are performed statically. Finally, swapping and shifting operations are loosely coupled with a DRAM buffer. As a remedy to these drawbacks, we propose an adaptive wear-leveling algorithm that consists of three novel schemes for PRAM main memory with a DRAM buffer. The PRAM-aware DRAM buffering scheme reduces the write count and prevents skewed writing by considering the write count and clean data based on the least recently used (LRU) scheme. The adaptive multiple swapping and shifting scheme makes the write count even with the dynamic operation timing, the number of swapping pages being based on the workload pattern. Our DRAM buffer-aware swapping and shifting scheme reduces overhead by curbing additional swapping and shifting operations, thus reducing unnecessary write operations. To evaluate the wear-leveling effect, we have implemented a PIN-based wear-leveling simulator. The evaluation confirms that the PRAM lifetime increases from 0.68 years with the previous wear-leveling algorithm to 5.32 years with the adaptive wear-leveling algorithm.","author":["Sung Kyu Park","Min Kyu Maeng","Ki-Woong Park","Kyu Ho Park"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 13","Issue 4","November 2014","Article No.: 88","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2558427"],"date":"10 March 2014","ref":[{"text":"Y.-H.

However, transistor power consumption no longer scales commensurately with integration density and, consequently, it is projected that in future technology nodes it will only be possible to simultaneously power on a fraction of cores on a multi-core chip in order to stay within the power budget. The part of the chip that is powered off is referred to as dark silicon and brings new challenges as well as opportunities for the design community, particularly in the context of the interaction of dark silicon with thermal, reliability and variability concerns. In this perspectives paper we describe these new challenges and opportunities, and provide preliminary experimental evidence in their support.","author":["Muhammad Shafique","Siddharth Garg","J\u00f6rg Henkel","Diana Marculescu"],"issue":["DAC '14: Proceedings of the 51st Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2014","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2593069.2593229"],"date":"01 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"J.

Furthermore, research into new CAD algorithms often requires a complete and open source baseline CAD flow. This article describes recent advances in the open source Verilog-to-Routing (VTR) CAD flow that enable further research in these areas. VTR now supports designs with multiple clocks in both timing analysis and optimization. Hard adder/carry logic can be included in an architecture in various ways and significantly improves the performance of arithmetic circuits. The flow now models energy consumption, an increasingly important concern. The speed and quality of the packing algorithms have been significantly improved. VTR can now generate a netlist of the final post-routed circuit which enables detailed simulation of a design for a variety of purposes. We also release new FPGA architecture files and models that are much closer to modern commercial architectures, enabling more realistic experiments. Finally, we show that while this version of VTR supports new and complex features, it has a 1.5\u00d7 compile time speed-up for simple architectures and a 6\u00d7 speed-up for complex architectures compared to the previous release, with no degradation to timing or wire-length quality.","author":["Jason Luu","Jeffrey Goeders","Michael Wainberg","Andrew Somerville","Thien Yu","Konstantin Nasartschuk","Miad Nasr","Sen Wang","Tim Liu","Nooruddin Ahmed","Kenneth B.

Recent results make a promising case for augmenting an oversubscribed network with reconfigurable inter-rack wireless or optical links. Inspired by the promise of reconfigurability, this paper presents FireFly, an inter-rack network solution that pushes DC network design to the extreme on three key fronts: (1) all links are reconfigurable; (2) all links are wireless; and (3) non top-of-rack switches are eliminated altogether. This vision, if realized, can offer significant benefits in terms of increased flexibility, reduced equipment cost, and minimal cabling complexity. In order to achieve this vision, we need to look beyond traditional RF wireless solutions due to their interference footprint which limits range and data rates. Thus, we make the case for using free-space optics (FSO). We demonstrate the viability of this architecture by (a) building a proof-of-concept prototype of a steerable small form factor FSO device using commodity components and (b) developing practical heuristics to address algorithmic and system-level challenges in network design and management.","author":["Navid Hamedazimi","Zafar Qazi","Himanshu Gupta","Vyas Sekar","Samir R.

However, eDRAM suffers short retention time and high refresh power, which prevents its widespread adoption. To save the refresh power of eDRAM-based frame buffers, we propose Tiered-Reliability Memory (TRM), where the frame buffer is divided into multiple segments with different refresh periods and hence different error rates. By allocating most-significant bits to the most reliable segment, our four-tier TRM reduces refresh power by 48% without degrading user experience.","author":["Kyungsang Cho","Yongjun Lee","Young H.

These computations are prevalent in computational sciences, particularly in partial differential equation solvers. We propose a fully automatic technique suitable for implementation in a compiler or in a domain-specific code generator for such computations. Dependence patterns on periodic data domains prevent existing algorithms from finding tiling opportunities. Our approach augments a state-of-the-art parallelization and locality-enhancing algorithm from the polyhedral framework to allow time-tiling of stencil computations on periodic domains. Experimental results on the swim SPEC CPU2000fp benchmark show a speedup of 5\u00d7 and 4.2\u00d7 over the highest SPEC performance achieved by native compilers on Intel Xeon and AMD Opteron multicore SMP systems, respectively. On other representative stencil computations, our scheme provides performance similar to that achieved with no periodicity, and a very high speedup is obtained over the native compiler. We also report a mean speedup of about 1.5\u00d7 over a domain-specific stencil compiler supporting limited cases of periodic boundary conditions. To the best of our knowledge, it has been infeasible to manually reproduce such optimizations on swim or any other periodic stencil, especially on a data grid of two-dimensions or higher.","author":["Uday Bondhugula","Vinayaka Bandishti","Albert Cohen","Guillain Potron","Nicolas Vasilache"],"issue":["PACT '14: Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on Parallel architectures and compilation","August 2014","Pages   39\u201350","https://doi.org/10.1145/2628071.2628106"],"date":"24 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"N.

In this paper, we study the challenging task of classifying videos according to their high-level semantics such as human actions or complex events. Although extensive efforts have been paid to study this problem, most existing works combined multiple features using simple fusion strategies and neglected the exploration of inter-class semantic relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel unified framework that jointly learns feature relationships and exploits the class relationships for improved video classification performance. Specifically, these two types of relationships are learned and utilized by rigorously imposing regularizations in a deep neural network (DNN). Such a regularized DNN can be efficiently launched using a GPU implementation with an affordable training cost. Through arming the DNN with better capability of exploring both the inter-feature and the inter-class relationships, the proposed regularized DNN is more suitable for identifying video semantics. With extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed framework exhibits superior performance over several state-of-the-art approaches. On the well-known Hollywood2 and Columbia Consumer Video benchmarks, we obtain to-date the best reported results: 65.7% and 70.6% respectively in terms of mean average precision.","author":["Zuxuan Wu","Yu-Gang Jiang","Jun Wang","Jian Pu","Xiangyang Xue"],"issue":["MM '14: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Multimedia","November 2014","Pages   167\u2013176","https://doi.org/10.1145/2647868.2654931"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"R.

In short, we treat a BFT protocol as a composition of Abstract instances. Each instance is developed and analyzed independently and optimized for specific system conditions. We illustrate the power of Abstract through several interesting examples.We first show how Abstract can yield benefits of a state-of-the-art BFT protocol in a less painful and error-prone manner. Namely, we develop AZyzzyva, a new protocol that mimics the celebrated best-case behavior of Zyzzyva using less than 35% of the Zyzzyva code. To cover worst-case situations, our abstraction enables one to use in AZyzzyva any existing BFT protocol.We then present Aliph, a new BFT protocol that outperforms previous BFT protocols in terms of both latency (by up to 360%) and throughput (by up to 30%). Finally, we present R-Aliph, an implementation of Aliph that is robust, that is, whose performance degrades gracefully in the presence of Byzantine replicas and Byzantine clients.","author":["Pierre-Louis Aublin","Rachid Guerraoui","Nikola Kne\u017eevi\u0107","Vivien Qu\u00e9ma","Marko Vukoli\u0107"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Computer Systems","Volume 32","Issue 4","January 2015","Article No.: 12","pp   1\u201345","https://doi.org/10.1145/2658994"],"date":"20 January 2015","ref":[{"text":"Michael Abd-El-Malek, Gregory R.

One common approach to thwart cache-based attacks is to use constant-time implementations, i.e., which do not branch on secrets and do not perform memory accesses that depend on secrets. However, there is no rigorous proof that constant-time implementations are protected against concurrent cache-attacks in virtualization platforms with shared cache; moreover, many prominent implementations are not constant-time. An alternative approach is to rely on system-level mechanisms. One recent such mechanism is stealth memory, which provisions a small amount of private cache for programs to carry potentially leaking computations securely. Stealth memory induces a weak form of constant-time, called S-constant-time, which encompasses some widely used cryptographic implementations. However, there is no rigorous analysis of stealth memory and S-constant-time, and no tool support for checking if applications are S-constant-time. We propose a new information-flow analysis that checks if an x86 application executes in constant-time, or in S-constant-time. Moreover, we prove that constant-time (resp. S-constant-time) programs do not leak confidential information through the cache to other operating systems executing concurrently on virtualization platforms (resp. platforms supporting stealth memory). The soundness proofs are based on new theorems of independent interest, including isolation theorems for virtualization platforms (resp. platforms supporting stealth memory), and proofs that constant-time implementations (resp. S-constant-time implementations) are non-interfering with respect to a strict information flow policy which disallows that control flow and memory accesses depend on secrets. We formalize our results using the Coq proof assistant and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our analyses on cryptographic implementations, including PolarSSL AES, DES and RC4, SHA256 and Salsa20.","author":["Gilles Barthe","Gustavo Betarte","Juan Campo","Carlos Luna","David Pichardie"],"issue":["CCS '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","November 2014","Pages   1267\u20131279","https://doi.org/10.1145/2660267.2660283"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"O.

The core network contains an Internet edge comprised of packet data network gateways (PGWs). The radio network consists of only base stations. There are minimal interactions among regions other than interference management at the edge. The current architecture has several problems. First, mobile application performance is seriously impacted by the lack of Internet egress points per region. Second, the continued exponential growth of mobile traffic puts tremendous pressure on the scalability of PGWs. Third, the fast growth of signaling traffic known as the signaling storm problem poses a major challenge to the scalability of the control plane. To address these problems, we present SoftMoW, a recursive and reconfigurable cellular WAN architecture that supports seamlessly inter-connected core networks, reconfigurable control plane, and global optimization. To scale the control plane nation-wide, SoftMoW recursively builds up the hierarchical control plane with novel abstractions of both control plane and data plane entities. To enable scalable end-to-end path setup, SoftMoW presents a novel label swapping mechanism such that each controller only operates on its logical topology and each switch along the path only sees at most one label. SoftMoW supports new network-wide optimization functions such as optimal routing and inter-region handover minimization. We demonstrate that SoftMoW improves the performance, flexibility and scalability of cellular WAN using real LTE network traces with thousands of base stations and millions of subscribers. Our evaluation shows that path inflation and inter-region handovers can be reduced by up to 60% and 44% respectively.","author":["Mehrdad Moradi","Wenfei Wu","Li Erran Li","Zhuoqing Morley Mao"],"issue":["CoNEXT '14: Proceedings of the 10th ACM International on Conference on emerging Networking Experiments and Technologies","December 2014","Pages   377\u2013390","https://doi.org/10.1145/2674005.2674981"],"date":"02 December 2014","ref":[{"text":"Floodlight. http://goo.gl/eXUprV.","order":1},{"text":"iplane dataset. http://goo.gl/JZWdK2.","order":2},{"text":"LTE design and deployment. http://goo.gl/DMKymH.","order":3},{"text":"Managing the signaling storm. http://goo.gl/lkTyb1.","order":4},{"text":"Zookeeper: Wait-free coordination for internet-scale systems.

IEEE 1901, the MAC protocol for power-line networks, employs a CSMA/CA protocol similar to that of 802.11, but is substantially more complex, which probably explains why little is known about its performance. One of the key differences between the two protocols is that whereas 802.11 only reacts upon collisions, 1901 also reacts upon several consecutive transmissions and thus can potentially achieve better performance by avoiding unnecessary collisions. In this paper, we propose a model for the 1901 MAC. Our analysis reveals that the default configuration of 1901 does not fully exploit its potential and that its performance degrades with the number of stations. We derive analytically the optimal configuration parameters for 1901; this drastically improves throughput and achieves optimal performance without requiring the knowledge of the number of stations in the network. In contrast, to provide a similar performance, 802.11 requires knowing the number of contending stations, which is unfeasible for realistic traffic patterns. Our solution can be readily implemented by vendors, as it only consists in modifying existing MAC parameters. We corroborate our results with testbed measurements, unveiling a significant signaling overhead in 1901 implementations.","author":["Christina Vlachou","Albert Banchs","Julien Herzen","Patrick Thiran"],"issue":["CoNEXT '14: Proceedings of the 10th ACM International on Conference on emerging Networking Experiments and Technologies","December 2014","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2674005.2675016"],"date":"02 December 2014","ref":[{"text":"Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit.https://github.com/qca/open-plc-utils.","order":1},{"text":"Faifa. http://github.com/ffainelli/faifa.","order":2},{"text":"HomePlug Alliance (retrieved 9/2014). www.homeplug.org/media/filer_public/e4/cb/e4cbfc97--5e5e-4df1--9625-c226df16c93f/connected_home_summits_2013.pdf.","order":3},{"text":"HomePlug Alliance (retrieved 9/2014). www.homeplug.org/news-events/member-pr/358/.","order":4},{"text":"IEEE 802.11n-2009-Amendment 5: Enhancements for Higher Throughput.","order":5},{"text":"OpenWrt. https://openwrt.org/.","order":6},{"text":"IEEE Standard for Broadband over Power Line Networks: Medium Access Control and Physical Layer Specifications.

An image processing pipeline can be viewed as a graph of interconnected stages which process images successively. Each stage typically performs one of point-wise, stencil, reduction or data-dependent operations on image pixels. Individual stages in a pipeline typically exhibit abundant data parallelism that can be exploited with relative ease. However, the stages also require high memory bandwidth preventing effective utilization of parallelism available on modern architectures. For applications that demand high performance, the traditional options are to use optimized libraries like OpenCV or to optimize manually. While using libraries precludes optimization across library routines, manual optimization accounting for both parallelism and locality is very tedious. The focus of our system, PolyMage, is on automatically generating high-performance implementations of image processing pipelines expressed in a high-level declarative language. Our optimization approach primarily relies on the transformation and code generation capabilities of the polyhedral compiler framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model-driven compiler for image processing pipelines that performs complex fusion, tiling, and storage optimization automatically. Experimental results on a modern multicore system show that the performance achieved by our automatic approach is up to 1.81x better than that achieved through manual tuning in Halide, a state-of-the-art language and compiler for image processing pipelines. For a camera raw image processing pipeline, our performance is comparable to that of a hand-tuned implementation.","author":["Ravi Teja Mullapudi","Vinay Vasista","Uday Bondhugula"],"issue":["ASPLOS '15: Proceedings of the Twentieth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2015","Pages   429\u2013443","https://doi.org/10.1145/2694344.2694364"],"date":"14 March 2015","ref":[{"text":"Andrew Adams, Eino-Ville Talvala, Sung Hee Park, David E.

The documents are represented as low-dimensional vectors and are jointly learned with distributed vector representations of word tokens using a hierarchical framework with two embedded neural language models. In particular, we exploit the context of documents in streams and use one of the language models to model the document sequences, and the other to model word sequences within them. The models learn continuous vector representations for both word tokens and documents such that semantically similar documents and words are close in a common vector space. We discuss extensions to our model, which can be applied to personalized recommendation and social relationship mining by adding further user layers to the hierarchy, thus learning user-specific vectors to represent individual preferences. We validated the learned representations on a public movie rating data set from MovieLens, as well as on a large-scale Yahoo News data comprising three months of user activity logs collected on Yahoo servers. The results indicate that the proposed model can learn useful representations of both documents and word tokens, outperforming the current state-of-the-art by a large margin.","author":["Nemanja Djuric","Hao Wu","Vladan Radosavljevic","Mihajlo Grbovic","Narayan Bhamidipati"],"issue":["WWW '15: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web","May 2015","Pages   248\u2013255","https://doi.org/10.1145/2736277.2741643"],"date":"18 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"R.

While the concept had been applied to several research projects it is only recently that the technological hurdles have been solved and we are able to see products arriving the market. While in most cases we need to concentrate on developing new algorithms and porting applications to new models as to fully exploit the potentials of the new products, we will still want to be able to execute efficiently existing applications. As such, in this work we focus on the analysis of the in-memory computation characteristics of existing applications in a way to evaluate how we would be able to have them move to \"Memoryland\". We present a tool that analyses the locality of the memory accesses for the different routines in an application. The results observed from the execution of this tool on different applications are that while certain applications seem to be able to fit in a small granularity architecture (small memory-to-computation ratio), others have routines that require a large amount of data. Thus we believe that hierarchical in-memory processing architectures are a good fit for the demands of the different applications. In addition, results have shown that for most applications we can limit our analysis to the routines that issue the most memory accesses.","author":["Pedro Trancoso"],"issue":["CF '15: Proceedings of the 12th ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers","May 2015","Article No.: 32","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2742854.2742874"],"date":"06 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"A.

Many techniques have been proposed for processing, managing, and mining trajectory data in the past decade, fostering a broad range of applications. In this article, we conduct a systematic survey on the major research into trajectory data mining, providing a panorama of the field as well as the scope of its research topics. Following a road map from the derivation of trajectory data, to trajectory data preprocessing, to trajectory data management, and to a variety of mining tasks (such as trajectory pattern mining, outlier detection, and trajectory classification), the survey explores the connections, correlations, and differences among these existing techniques. This survey also introduces the methods that transform trajectories into other data formats, such as graphs, matrices, and tensors, to which more data mining and machine learning techniques can be applied. Finally, some public trajectory datasets are presented. This survey can help shape the field of trajectory data mining, providing a quick understanding of this field to the community.","author":["Yu Zheng"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology","Volume 6","Issue 3","May 2015","Article No.: 29","pp   1\u201341","https://doi.org/10.1145/2743025"],"date":"12 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"O.

In this paper we present a quantitative study that considers these aspects by implementing seven high-throughput accelerators following three design models: tight coupling behind a CPU, loose out-of-core coupling with Direct Memory Access (DMA) to the LLC, and loose out-of-core coupling with DMA to DRAM. A salient conclusion of our study is that working sets of non-trivial size are best served by loosely-coupled accelerators that integrate private memory blocks tailored to their needs.","author":["Emilio G.

However, modern systems create emanations at thousands of different frequencies, so it is a difficult, error-prone, and time-consuming task to find those few emanations that are AM-modulated by processor/memory activity. This paper presents a methodology for rapidly finding such activity-modulated signals. This method creates recognizable spectral patterns generated by specially designed microbenchmarks and then processes the recorded spectra to identify signals that exhibit amplitude-modulation behavior. We apply this method to several computer systems and find several such modulated signals. To illustrate how our methodology can benefit side-channel security research and practice, we also identify the physical mechanisms behind those signals, and find that the strongest signals are created by voltage regulators, memory refreshes, and DRAM clocks. Our results indicate that each signal may carry unique information about system activity, potentially enhancing an attacker's capability to extract sensitive information. We also confirm that our methodology correctly separates emanated signals that are affected by specific processor or memory activities from those that are not.","author":["Robert Callan","Alenka Zaji\u0107","Milos Prvulovic"],"issue":["ISCA '15: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2015","Pages   592\u2013603","https://doi.org/10.1145/2749469.2750394"],"date":"13 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"O.

However, changes in the area-optimized DRAM bank can incur large area-overhead. To solve this problem, we propose Multiple Clone Row DRAM (MCR-DRAM), which uses existing DRAM bank structure without any modification. Our key idea is Multiple Clone Row (MCR), in which multiple rows are simultaneously turned on or off to consist of a logically single row. MCR provides two advantages which enable our low-latency mechanisms (Early-Access, Early-Precharge and Fast-Refresh). First, MCR increases the speed of the sensing process by increasing the number of sensed-cells. Thus, it enables a READ/WRITE command to an MCR to be issued earlier than possible for a normal row (Early-Access). Second, DRAM cells in an MCR exhibit more frequent refreshes without additional REFRESH commands, thereby reducing the amount of charge leakage during the refresh interval for the identical cell. The reduced amount of charge leakage enables a PRECHARGE command to be served before the activated-cells are fully restored (Early-Precharge) and a REFRESH operation to be completed before the refreshed-cells are fully restored (Fast-Refresh). Even though MCR-DRAM sacrifices memory capacity for low-latency, it can be dynamically reconfigured from low-latency to full-capacity DRAM. MCR-DRAM improves both performance and energy efficiency for both single-core and multi-core systems.","author":["Jungwhan Choi","Wongyu Shin","Jaemin Jang","Jinwoong Suh","Yongkee Kwon","Youngsuk Moon","Lee-Sup Kim"],"issue":["ISCA '15: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2015","Pages   223\u2013234","https://doi.org/10.1145/2749469.2750402"],"date":"13 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"(2012) MSC:Memory Scheduling Championship. {Online}.

Aligned with observations in prior literature, we find the presence of two prominent anorexia related communities on Tumblr -- pro-anorexia and pro-recovery. Empirical analyses on several thousand Tumblr posts show use of the site as a media-rich platform replete with triggering content for enacting anorexia as a lifestyle choice. Through use of common pro-anorexia tags, the pro-recovery community however attempts to \"permeate\" into the pro-anorexia community to educate them of the health risks of anorexia. Further, the communities exhibit distinctive affective, social, cognitive, and linguistic style markers. Compared with recover- ing anorexics, pro-anorexics express greater negative affect, higher cognitive impairment, and greater feelings of social isolation and self-harm. We also observe that these characteristics may be used in a predictive setting to detect anorexia content with 80% accuracy. Based on our findings, clinical implications of detecting anorexia related content on social media are discussed.","author":["Munmun De Choudhury"],"issue":["DH '15: Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Digital Health 2015","May 2015","Pages   43\u201350","https://doi.org/10.1145/2750511.2750515"],"date":"18 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"Jaime Arguello, Brian S Butler, Elisabeth Joyce, Robert Kraut, Kimberly S Ling, Carolyn Ros\u00e9, and Xiaoqing Wang.

The main contribution of this work is a new model for initializing the parameter weights of the convolutional neural network, which is crucial to train an accurate model while avoiding the need to inject any additional features. Briefly, we use an unsupervised neural language model to train initial word embeddings that are further tuned by our deep learning model on a distant supervised corpus. At a final stage, the pre-trained parameters of the network are used to initialize the model. We train the latter on the supervised training data recently made available by the official system evaluation campaign on Twitter Sentiment Analysis organized by Semeval-2015. A comparison between the results of our approach and the systems participating in the challenge on the official test sets, suggests that our model could be ranked in the first two positions in both the phrase-level subtask A (among 11 teams) and on the message-level subtask B (among 40 teams). This is an important evidence on the practical value of our solution.","author":["Aliaksei Severyn","Alessandro Moschitti"],"issue":["SIGIR '15: Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2015","Pages   959\u2013962","https://doi.org/10.1145/2766462.2767830"],"date":"09 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"A.

This has motivated a significant amount of research on heterogeneous computing techniques, along with the design of CPU-GPU fused chips and petascale heterogeneous supercomputers. In this article, we survey Heterogeneous Computing Techniques (HCTs) such as workload partitioning that enable utilizing both CPUs and GPUs to improve performance and/or energy efficiency. We review heterogeneous computing approaches at runtime, algorithm, programming, compiler, and application levels. Further, we review both discrete and fused CPU-GPU systems and discuss benchmark suites designed for evaluating Heterogeneous Computing Systems (HCSs). We believe that this article will provide insights into the workings and scope of applications of HCTs to researchers and motivate them to further harness the computational powers of CPUs and GPUs to achieve the goal of exascale performance.","author":["Sparsh Mittal","Jeffrey S.

Their key limitation lies in the lack of a model that can quantitatively correlate CSI dynamics and human activities. In this paper, we propose CARM, a CSI based human Activity Recognition and Monitoring system. CARM has two theoretical underpinnings: a CSI-speed model, which quantifies the correlation between CSI value dynamics and human movement speeds, and a CSI-activity model, which quantifies the correlation between the movement speeds of different human body parts and a specific human activity. By these two models, we quantitatively build the correlation between CSI value dynamics and a specific human activity. CARM uses this correlation as the profiling mechanism and recognizes a given activity by matching it to the best-fit profile. We implemented CARM using commercial WiFi devices and evaluated it in several different environments. Our results show that CARM achieves an average accuracy of greater than 96%.","author":["Wei Wang","Alex X.

While prior solutions require the user to hold a wireless transmitter, or require custom wireless hardware, or can only determine a pre-defined set of hand gestures, this paper introduces WiDraw, the first hand motion tracking system using commodity WiFi cards, and without any user wearables. WiDraw harnesses the Angle-of-Arrival values of incoming wireless signals at the mobile device to track the user's hand trajectory. We utilize the intuition that whenever the user's hand occludes a signal coming from a certain direction, the signal strength of the angle representing the same direction will experience a drop. Our software prototype using commodity wireless cards can track the user's hand with a median error lower than 5 cm. We use WiDraw to implement an in-air handwriting application that allows the user to draw letters, words, and sentences, and achieves a mean word recognition accuracy of 91%.","author":["Li Sun","Souvik Sen","Dimitrios Koutsonikolas","Kyu-Han Kim"],"issue":["MobiCom '15: Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking","September 2015","Pages   77\u201389","https://doi.org/10.1145/2789168.2790129"],"date":"07 September 2015","ref":[{"text":"Microsoft kinect. http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/.","order":1},{"text":"Leap motion, inc. leap motion: Mac & pc gesture controller for game, design and more. https://www.leapmotion.com/.","order":2},{"text":"Qifan Pu, Sidhant Gupta, Shyamnath Gollakota, and Shwetak Patel.

Weak PUFs (i.e., devices able to generate a single signature or to deal with a limited number of challenges) are widely discussed in literature. One of the most investigated solutions today is based on SRAMs. However, the rapid development of low-power, high-density, high-performance SoCs has pushed the embedded memories to their limits and opened the field to the development of emerging memory technologies. The Spin-Transfer-Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) has emerged as a promising choice for embedded memories due to its reduced read/write latency and high CMOS integration capability. In this article, we propose an innovative PUF design based on STT-MRAM memory. We exploit the high variability affecting the electrical resistance of the Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) device in anti-parallel magnetization. We will demonstrate that the proposed solution is robust, unclonable, and unpredictable.","author":["Elena Ioana Vatajelu","Giorgio Di Natale","Mario Barbareschi","Lionel Torres","Marco Indaco","Paolo Prinetto"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 13","Issue 1","December 2016","Article No.: 5","pp   1\u201321","https://doi.org/10.1145/2790302"],"date":"06 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"D.

Mobile system designers are constrained by existing technology, and are forced to select a single chemistry that best meets their diverse needs, thereby compromising other desirable features. In this paper, we present a new hardware-software system, called Software Defined Battery (SDB), which allows system designers to integrate batteries of different chemistries. SDB exposes APIs to the operating system which control the amount of charge flowing in and out of each battery, enabling it to dynamically trade one battery property for another depending on Application And/Or User Needs. Using microbenchmarks from our prototype SDB implementation, and through detailed simulations, we demonstrate that it is possible to combine batteries which individually excel along different axes to deliver an enhanced collective performance when compared to traditional battery packs.","author":["Anirudh Badam","Ranveer Chandra","Jon Dutra","Anthony Ferrese","Steve Hodges","Pan Hu","Julia Meinershagen","Thomas Moscibroda","Bodhi Priyantha","Evangelia Skiani"],"issue":["SOSP '15: Proceedings of the 25th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","October 2015","Pages   215\u2013229","https://doi.org/10.1145/2815400.2815429"],"date":"04 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"Altium Designer. http://www.altium.com/altium-designer/overview.","order":1},{"text":"Apple MacBook (2015) Battery Design. http://www.apple.com/macbook/design/.","order":2},{"text":"Arbin BT-2000 Battery Testing Equipment. http://www.arbin.com/products/battery.","order":3},{"text":"N.

Our Skinned Multi-Person Linear model (SMPL) is a skinned vertex-based model that accurately represents a wide variety of body shapes in natural human poses. The parameters of the model are learned from data including the rest pose template, blend weights, pose-dependent blend shapes, identity-dependent blend shapes, and a regressor from vertices to joint locations. Unlike previous models, the pose-dependent blend shapes are a linear function of the elements of the pose rotation matrices. This simple formulation enables training the entire model from a relatively large number of aligned 3D meshes of different people in different poses. We quantitatively evaluate variants of SMPL using linear or dual-quaternion blend skinning and show that both are more accurate than a Blend-SCAPE model trained on the same data. We also extend SMPL to realistically model dynamic soft-tissue deformations. Because it is based on blend skinning, SMPL is compatible with existing rendering engines and we make it available for research purposes.","author":["Matthew Loper","Naureen Mahmood","Javier Romero","Gerard Pons-Moll","Michael J.

RF-Capture tracks the 3D positions of a person's limbs and body parts even when the person is fully occluded from its sensor, and does so without placing any markers on the subject's body. In designing RF-Capture, we built on recent advances in wireless research, which have shown that certain radio frequency (RF) signals can traverse walls and reflect off the human body, allowing for the detection of human motion through walls. In contrast to these past systems which abstract the entire human body as a single point and find the overall location of that point through walls, we show how we can reconstruct various human body parts and stitch them together to capture the human figure. We built a prototype of RF-Capture and tested it on 15 subjects. Our results show that the system can capture a representative human figure through walls and use it to distinguish between various users.","author":["Fadel Adib","Chen-Yu Hsu","Hongzi Mao","Dina Katabi","Fr\u00e9do Durand"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 34","Issue 6","November 2015","Article No.: 219","pp   1\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/2816795.2818072"],"date":"02 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"Abdelnasser, H., Youssef, M., and Harras, K.

In this paper we show how a precise architectural envelope model for such architectures can be defined, taking IBM POWER as our example. Our model specifies, for an arbitrary test program, the set of all its allowable executions, not just those of some particular implementation. The model integrates an operational concurrency model with an ISA model for the fixed-point non-vector user-mode instruction set (largely automatically derived from the vendor pseudocode, and expressed in a new ISA description language). The key question is the interface between these two: allowing all the required concurrency behaviour, without overcommitting to some particular microarchitectural implementation, requires a novel abstract structure. Our model is expressed in a mathematically rigorous language that can be automatically translated to an executable test-oracle tool; this lets one either interactively explore or exhaustively compute the set of all allowed behaviours of intricate test cases, to provide a reference for hardware and software development.","author":["Kathryn E.

Interestingly, hardware neural network accelerators are emerging again as attractive candidate architectures for such tasks. The neural network algorithms considered come from two, largely separate, domains: machine-learning and neuroscience. These neural networks have very different characteristics, so it is unclear which approach should be favored for hardware implementation. Yet, few studies compare them from a hardware perspective. We implement both types of networks down to the layout, and we compare the relative merit of each approach in terms of energy, speed, area cost, accuracy and functionality. Within the limit of our study (current SNN and machine-learning NN algorithms, current best effort at hardware implementation efforts, and workloads used in this study), our analysis helps dispel the notion that hardware neural network accelerators inspired from neuroscience, such as SNN+STDP, are currently a competitive alternative to hardware neural networks accelerators inspired from machine-learning, such as MLP+BP: not only in terms of accuracy, but also in terms of hardware cost for realistic implementations, which is less expected. However, we also outline that SNN+STDP carry potential for reduced hardware cost compared to machine-learning networks at very large scales, if accuracy issues can be controlled (or for applications where they are less important). We also identify the key sources of inaccuracy of SNN+STDP which are less related to the loss of information due to spike coding than to the nature of the STDP learning algorithm. Finally, we outline that for the category of applications which require permanent online learning and moderate accuracy, SNN+STDP hardware accelerators could be a very cost-efficient solution.","author":["Zidong Du","Daniel D.

The simple fact that multiple cores may simultaneously access shared memory and communication resources introduces a significant pessimism in the timing and schedulability analysis. To counter this problem, predictable execution models have been proposed splitting task executions into two consecutive phases: a memory phase in which the required instruction and data are pre-fetched to local memory (M-phase), and an execution phase in which the task is executed with no memory contention (C-phase). Decoupling memory and execution phases not only simplifies the timing analysis, but it also allows a more efficient (and predictable) pipelining of memory and execution phases through proper co-scheduling algorithms. In this paper, we take a further step towards the design of smart co-scheduling algorithms for sporadic real-time tasks complying with the M/C (memory-computation) model. We provide a theoretical framework that aims at tightly characterizing the schedulability improvement obtainable with the adopted M/C task model on a single-core systems. We identify a tight critical instant for M/C tasks scheduled with fixed priority, providing an exact response-time analysis with pseudo-polynomial complexity. We show in our experiments that a significant schedulability improvement may be obtained with respect to classic execution models, placing an important building block towards the design of more efficient partitioned multi-core systems.","author":["Alessandra Melani","Marko Bertogna","Vincenzo Bonifaci","Alberto Marchetti-Spaccamela","Giorgio Buttazzo"],"issue":["RTNS '15: Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Real Time and Networks Systems","November 2015","Pages   87\u201396","https://doi.org/10.1145/2834848.2834854"],"date":"04 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"http://www.ti.com/product/66AK2H12.","order":1},{"text":"\u00ae","order":2},{"text":"A.

Such networks naturally represent many real-world Web data such as DBLP data (author, paper, and conference). Given a network where some vertices are labeled, the classifier aims to predict labels for the remaining vertices by propagating the labels to the entire network. In the label propagation process, many studies reduce the importance of edges connecting to a high-degree vertex. The assumption is unsatisfactory when reliability of a label of a vertex cannot be implied from its degree. On the basis of our intuition that edges bridging across communities are less trustworthy, we adapt edge betweenness to imply the importance of edges. Since directly applying the conventional edge betweenness is inefficient on heterogeneous networks, we propose two additional refinements. First, the centrality utilizes the fact that networks contain multiple types of vertices. Second, the centrality ignores flows originating from endpoints of considering edges. The experimental results on real-world datasets show our proposed method is more effective than a state-of-the-art method, GNetMine. On average, our method yields 92.79 \u00b1 1.25% accuracy on a DBLP network even if only 1.92% of vertices are labeled. Our simple weighting scheme results in more than 5 percentage points increase in accuracy compared with GNetMine.","author":["Phiradet Bangcharoensap","Tsuyoshi Murata","Hayato Kobayashi","Nobuyuki Shimizu"],"issue":["WSDM '16: Proceedings of the Ninth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2016","Pages   437\u2013446","https://doi.org/10.1145/2835776.2835799"],"date":"08 February 2016","ref":[{"text":"L.

For frequently executed algorithms, dedicated hardware accelerators are an energy-efficient avenue to high performance. Unfortunately, they are notoriously labor-intensive to design and verify while meeting stringent time-to-market goals. In this paper, we present GraphOps, a modular hardware library for quickly and easily constructing energy-efficient accelerators for graph analytics algorithms. GraphOps provide a hardware designer with a set of composable graph-specific building blocks, broad enough to target a wide array of graph analytics algorithms. The system is built upon a dataflow execution platform and targets FPGAs, allowing a vendor to use the same hardware to accelerate different types of analytics computation. Low-level hardware implementation details such as flow control, input buffering, rate throttling, and host/interrupt interaction are automatically handled and built into the design of the GraphOps, greatly reducing design time. As an enabling contribution, we also present a novel locality-optimized graph data structure that improves spatial locality and memory efficiency when accessing the graph in main memory. Using the GraphOps system, we construct six different hardware accelerators. Results show that the GraphOps-based accelerators are able to operate close to the bandwidth limit of the hardware platform, the limiting constraint in graph analytics computation.","author":["Tayo Oguntebi","Kunle Olukotun"],"issue":["FPGA '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2016","Pages   111\u2013117","https://doi.org/10.1145/2847263.2847337"],"date":"21 February 2016","ref":[{"text":"N.

Simple questions such as \"What kind of datasets are in the LOD cloud?\", \"In what way(s) are these datasets connected?\" -- albeit frequently asked -- are at the moment still difficult to answer due to the lack of proper tooling support. The infrequent update of the static LOD cloud diagram adds to the current dilemma, since there is neither reliable nor timely-updated information to perform an interactive search, analysis or in particular visualization in order to gain insight into the current state of Linked Open Data. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid system which combines LOD Visualisation, Analytics and DiscovERy (LODVader) to aid in answering the above questions. LODVader is equipped with (1) a multi-layer LOD cloud visualization component comprising datasets, subsets and vocabularies, (2) dataset analysis components that extend the state of the art with new similarity measures and efficient link extracting techniques and (3) a fast search index that is an entry point for dataset discovery. At its core, LODVader employs a timely-updated index using a complex cluster of Bloom filters as a fast search index with low memory footprint. This BF cluster is able to efficiently perform analysis on link and dataset similarities based on stored predicate and object information, which -- once inverted -- can be employed to discover invalid links by displaying the Dark LOD Cloud. By combining all these features, we allow for an up-to-date, multi-dimensional LOD cloud analysis, which -- to the best of our knowledge -- was not possible before.","author":["Ciro Baron Neto","Kay M\u00fcller","Martin Br\u00fcmmer","Dimitris Kontokostas","Sebastian Hellmann"],"issue":["WWW '16 Companion: Proceedings of the 25th International Conference Companion on World Wide Web","April 2016","Pages   163\u2013166","https://doi.org/10.1145/2872518.2890545"],"date":"11 April 2016","ref":[{"text":"B.

This is often the case in bug and feature location, community question answering, or more generally the communication between technical personnel and non-technical stake holders in a software project. In this paper, we propose bridging the lexical gap by projecting natural language statements and code snippets as meaning vectors in a shared representation space. In the proposed architecture, word embeddings are first trained on API documents, tutorials, and reference documents, and then aggregated in order to estimate semantic similarities between documents. Empirical evaluations show that the learned vector space embeddings lead to improvements in a previously explored bug localization task and a newly defined task of linking API documents to computer programming questions.","author":["Xin Ye","Hui Shen","Xiao Ma","Razvan Bunescu","Chang Liu"],"issue":["ICSE '16: Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Software Engineering","May 2016","Pages   404\u2013415","https://doi.org/10.1145/2884781.2884862"],"date":"14 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"A.

DRAM access latency is defined by three fundamental operations that take place within the DRAM cell array: (i) activation of a memory row, which opens the row to perform accesses; (ii) precharge, which prepares the cell array for the next memory access; and (iii) restoration of the row, which restores the values of cells in the row that were destroyed due to activation. There is significant latency variation for each of these operations across the cells of a single DRAM chip due to irregularity in the manufacturing process. As a result, some cells are inherently faster to access, while others are inherently slower. Unfortunately, existing systems do not exploit this variation.   The goal of this work is to (i) experimentally characterize and understand the latency variation across cells within a DRAM chip for these three fundamental DRAM operations, and (ii) develop new mechanisms that exploit our understanding of the latency variation to reliably improve performance. To this end, we comprehensively characterize 240 DRAM chips from three major vendors, and make several new observations about latency variation within DRAM. We find that (i) there is large latency variation across the cells for each of the three operations; (ii) variation characteristics exhibit significant spatial locality: slower cells are clustered in certain regions of a DRAM chip; and (iii) the three fundamental operations exhibit different reliability characteristics when the latency of each operation is reduced.   Based on our observations, we propose Flexible-LatencY DRAM (FLY-DRAM), a mechanism that exploits latency variation across DRAM cells within a DRAM chip to improve system performance. The key idea of FLY-DRAM is to exploit the spatial locality of slower cells within DRAM, and access the faster DRAM regions with reduced latencies for the fundamental operations. Our evaluations show that FLY-DRAM improves the performance of a wide range of applications by 13.3%, 17.6%, and 19.5%, on average, for each of the three different vendors' real DRAM chips, in a simulated 8-core system. We conclude that the experimental characterization and analysis of latency variation within modern DRAM, provided by this work, can lead to new techniques that improve DRAM and system performance.","author":["Kevin K.

These algorithms accelerate Gaussian elimination by sparsifying the nonzero matrix entries created by the elimination process. We use these new algorithms to derive the first nearly linear time algorithms for solving systems of equations in connection Laplacians---a generalization of Laplacian matrices that arise in many problems in image and signal processing. We also prove that every connection Laplacian has a linear sized approximate inverse. This is an LU factorization with a linear number of nonzero entries that is a strong approximation of the original matrix. Using such a factorization one can solve systems of equations in a connection Laplacian in linear time. Such a factorization was unknown even for ordinary graph Laplacians.","author":["Rasmus Kyng","Yin Tat Lee","Richard Peng","Sushant Sachdeva","Daniel A.

We ask crowd workers to sketch particular photographic objects sampled from 125 categories and acquire 75,471 sketches of 12,500 objects. The Sketchy database gives us fine-grained associations between particular photos and sketches, and we use this to train cross-domain convolutional networks which embed sketches and photographs in a common feature space. We use our database as a benchmark for fine-grained retrieval and show that our learned representation significantly outperforms both hand-crafted features as well as deep features trained for sketch or photo classification. Beyond image retrieval, we believe the Sketchy database opens up new opportunities for sketch and image understanding and synthesis.","author":["Patsorn Sangkloy","Nathan Burnell","Cusuh Ham","James Hays"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 35","Issue 4","July 2016","Article No.: 119","pp   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897824.2925954"],"date":"11 July 2016","ref":[{"text":"Antol, S., Zitnick, C.

The design of our divider is highly scalable, offering a wide range of power and inaccuracy trade-offs based on the application requirements. Furthermore, the proposed divider has a lower delay compared to the accurate design, enabling its use on the critical path. We theoretically analyze the error of our design as a function of its configuration, and we thoroughly evaluate the error and power characteristics of our divider in a standalone case and demonstrate that the proposed design can achieve up to 70% in power savings, while introducing an mean average absolute error of only 3.08%. We also implement three image-processing applications in hardware using our divider and conclude that use of the proposed divider will not perceptibly impact their quality-of-service while achieving power benefits of up to 75%.","author":["Soheil Hashemi","R.

But STT-RAM and Me RAM both suffer from high write error rate due to thermal fluctuation of magnetization. Temperature and wafer-level process variation significantly exacerbate these problems. In this paper, we propose a design that adaptively selects optimized write pulse for STT-RAM and MeRAM to overcome ambient process and temperature variation. To enable the adaptive write, we design specific MTJ-based variation monitor, which precisely senses process and temperature variation. The monitor is over 10X faster, 5X more energy-efficient, and 20X smaller compared with conventional thermal monitors of similar accuracy. With adaptive write, the write latency of STT-RAM and MeRAM cache are reduced by up to 17% and 59% respectively, and application run time is improved by up to 41%.","author":["Shaodi Wang","Hochul Lee","Cecile Grezes","Pedram Khalili","Kang L.

For graphics-intensive gaming applications, this approach is inadequate because both the CPU and the GPU contribute towards the overall application performance (frames per second or FPS) as well as the on-chip temperature. The lack of coordination between CPU and GPU induces recurrent frequency throttling to maintain on-chip temperature below the permissible limit. This leads to significantly degraded application performance and large variation in temperature over time. We propose a control-theory based dynamic thermal management technique that cooperatively scales CPU and GPU frequencies to meet the thermal constraint while achieving high performance for mobile gaming. Experimental results with six popular Android games on a commercial mobile platform show an average 19% performance improvement and over 90% reduction in temperature variance compared to the original Linux approach.","author":["Alok Prakash","Hussam Amrouch","Muhammad Shafique","Tulika Mitra","J\u00f6rg Henkel"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 47","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898031"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"Android Governors. http://goo.gl/8j1Eqo.","order":1},{"text":"Arndale board 5250. http://goo.gl/1ZCSNX.","order":2},{"text":"Epic Citadel, Unreal Engine. http://goo.gl/xdsQMr.","order":3},{"text":"H.

We provide a systematical understanding of how to generate and explore the design space of approximate components, which enables a wide-range of power/energy, performance, area and output quality tradeoffs, and a high degree of design flexibility to facilitate their design. To enable cross-layer approximate computing, bridging the gap between the logic layer (i.e. arithmetic blocks) and the architecture layer (and even considering the software layers) is crucial. Towards this end, this paper introduces open-source libraries of low-power and high-performance approximate components. The elementary approximate arithmetic blocks (adder and multiplier) are used to develop multi-bit approximate arithmetic blocks and accelerators. An analysis of data-driven resilience and error propagation is discussed. The approximate computing components are a first steps towards a systematic approach to introduce approximate computing paradigms at all levels of abstractions.","author":["Muhammad Shafique","Rehan Hafiz","Semeen Rehman","Walaa El-Harouni","J\u00f6rg Henkel"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 99","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2906199"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, due to the constrained on-chip resource and many other factors, single-board FPGA designs may have difficulties in achieving optimal energy efficiency. In this paper we present a deeply pipelined multi-FPGA architecture that expands the design space for optimal performance and energy efficiency. A dynamic programming algorithm is proposed to map the CNN computing layers efficiently to different FPGA boards. To demonstrate the potential of the architecture, we built a prototype system with seven FPGA boards connected with high-speed serial links. The experimental results on AlexNet and VGG-16 show that the prototype can achieve up to 21x and 2x energy efficiency compared to optimized multi-core CPU and GPU implementations, respectively.","author":["Chen Zhang","Di Wu","Jiayu Sun","Guangyu Sun","Guojie Luo","Jason Cong"],"issue":["ISLPED '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","August 2016","Pages   326\u2013331","https://doi.org/10.1145/2934583.2934644"],"date":"08 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"R.

It is challenging to efficiently utilize expensive WAN bandwidth to achieve short transfer completion time and meet mission-critical deadlines. Advancements in software-defined networking (SDN) and optical hardware make it feasible and beneficial to quickly reconfigure optical devices in the optical layer, which brings a new opportunity for traffic management on the WAN. We present Owan, a novel traffic management system that optimizes wide-area bulk transfers with centralized joint control of the optical and network layers. \\sysname can dynamically change the network-layer topology by reconfiguring the optical devices. We develop efficient algorithms to jointly optimize optical circuit setup, routing and rate allocation, and dynamically adapt them to traffic demand changes. We have built a prototype of Owan with commodity optical and electrical hardware. Testbed experiments and large-scale simulations on two ISP topologies and one inter-DC topology show that \\sysname completes transfers up to 4.45x faster on average, and up to 1.36x more transfers meet their deadlines, as compared to prior methods that only control the network layer.","author":["Xin Jin","Yiran Li","Da Wei","Siming Li","Jie Gao","Lei Xu","Guangzhi Li","Wei Xu","Jennifer Rexford"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGCOMM Conference","August 2016","Pages   87\u2013100","https://doi.org/10.1145/2934872.2934904"],"date":"22 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"S.

Conventional FPGA packing and placement approaches are shown to have severe difficulties to yield good routability. In this paper, we propose a FPGA packing and placement engine called UTPlaceF that simultaneously optimizes wirelength and routablity. A novel physical and congestion aware packing alogrithm and several congestion aware detailed placement techniques are proposed. Compared with the top 3 winners of ISPD'16 FPGA placement contest, UTPlaceF can achieve 3.3%, 7.7% and 28.3% better routed wirelength with similar or shorter runtime.","author":["Wuxi Li","Shounak Dhar","David Z.

In this paper, we present XKnowSearch!, a novel entity-based system for multilingual and cross-lingual information retrieval, which supports keyword search and also allows users to influence the search process according to their search intents. By leveraging the multilingual knowledge base on the Web, keyword queries and documents can be represented in their semantic forms, which can facilitate query disambiguation and expansion, and can also overcome the language barrier between queries and documents in different languages.","author":["Lei Zhang","Michael F\u00e4rber","Achim Rettinger"],"issue":["CIKM '16: Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2016","Pages   2425\u20132428","https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983324"],"date":"24 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"C.

While environmental energy harvesting is a promising solution to power these IoT edge devices, it introduces new complexities due to the unreliable nature of ambient energy sources. In the presence of an unreliable power supply, frequent checkpointing of the system state becomes imperative, and recent research has proposed the concept of in-situ checkpointing by using ferroelectric RAM (FRAM), an emerging non-volatile memory technology, as unified memory in these systems. Even though an entirely FRAM-based solution provides reliability, it is energy inefficient compared to SRAM due to the higher access latency of FRAM. On the other hand, an entirely SRAM-based solution is highly energy efficient but is unreliable in the face of power loss. This paper advocates an intermediate approach in hybrid FRAM-SRAM microcontrollers that involves judicious memory mapping of program sections to retain the reliability benefits provided by FRAM while performing almost as efficiently as an SRAM-based system. We propose an energy-aware memory mapping technique that maps different program sections to the hybrid FRAM-SRAM microcontroller such that energy consumption is minimized without sacrificing reliability. Our technique consists of eM-map, which performs a one-time characterization to find the optimal memory map for the functions that constitute a program and energy-align, a novel hardware-software technique that aligns the system\u2019s powered-on time intervals to function execution boundaries, which results in further improvements in energy efficiency and performance. Experimental results obtained using the MSP430FR5739 microcontroller demonstrate a significant performance improvement of up to 2x and energy reduction of up to 20% over a state-of-the-art FRAM-based solution. Finally, we present a case study that shows the implementation of our techniques in the context of a real IoT application.","author":["Hrishikesh Jayakumar","Arnab Raha","Jacob R.

DNN systems scale to large cluster deployments by having worker nodes train many model replicas in parallel; to ensure model convergence, parameter servers periodically synchronise the replicas. This raises the challenge of how to split resources between workers and parameter servers so that the cluster CPU and network resources are fully utilised without introducing bottlenecks. In practice, this requires manual tuning for each model configuration or hardware type. We describe Ako, a decentralised dataflow-based DNN system without parameter servers that is designed to saturate cluster resources. All nodes execute workers that fully use the CPU resources to update model replicas. To synchronise replicas as often as possible subject to the available network bandwidth, workers exchange partitioned gradient updates directly with each other. The number of partitions is chosen so that the used network bandwidth remains constant, independently of cluster size. Since workers eventually receive all gradient partitions after several rounds, convergence is unaffected. For the ImageNet benchmark on a 64-node cluster, Ako does not require any resource allocation decisions, yet converges faster than deployments with parameter servers.","author":["Pijika Watcharapichat","Victoria Lopez Morales","Raul Castro Fernandez","Peter Pietzuch"],"issue":["SoCC '16: Proceedings of the Seventh ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing","October 2016","Pages   84\u201397","https://doi.org/10.1145/2987550.2987586"],"date":"05 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"M.

Memorization of feature interactions through a wide set of cross-product feature transformations are effective and interpretable, while generalization requires more feature engineering effort. With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features. However, deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank. In this paper, we present Wide & Deep learning---jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks---to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems. We productionized and evaluated the system on Google Play, a commercial mobile app store with over one billion active users and over one million apps. Online experiment results show that Wide & Deep significantly increased app acquisitions compared with wide-only and deep-only models. We have also open-sourced our implementation in TensorFlow.","author":["Heng-Tze Cheng","Levent Koc","Jeremiah Harmsen","Tal Shaked","Tushar Chandra","Hrishi Aradhye","Glen Anderson","Greg Corrado","Wei Chai","Mustafa Ispir","Rohan Anil","Zakaria Haque","Lichan Hong","Vihan Jain","Xiaobing Liu","Hemal Shah"],"issue":["DLRS 2016: Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Deep Learning for Recommender Systems","September 2016","Pages   7\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2988450.2988454"],"date":"15 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"J.

However, the existing RRAM crossbar--based computing is mainly assumed as a multilevel analog computing, whose result is sensitive to process nonuniformity as well as additional overhead from AD-conversion and I/O. In this article, we explore the matrix-vector multiplication accelerator on a binary RRAM crossbar with adaptive 1-bit-comparator--based parallel conversion. Moreover, a distributed in-memory computing architecture is also developed with the according control protocol. Both memory array and logic accelerator are implemented on the binary RRAM crossbar, where the logic-memory pair can be distributed with the control bus protocol. Experimental results have shown that compared to the analog RRAM crossbar, the proposed binary RRAM crossbar can achieve significant area savings with better calculation accuracy. Moreover, significant speedup can be achieved for matrix-vector multiplication in neural network--based machine learning such that the overall training and testing time can be both reduced. In addition, large energy savings can be also achieved when compared to the traditional CMOS-based out-of-memory computing architecture.","author":["Leibin Ni","Hantao Huang","Zichuan Liu","Rajiv V.

Stochastic computing requires simple logic gates, and stochastic logic--based circuits are inherently fault tolerant. Thus, these structures are well suited for nanoscale CMOS technologies. It is well known that an AND gate and a multiplexer can be used to implement stochastic unipolar multiplier and adder, respectively. Although it is easy to realize multiplication and scaled addition, implementation of subtraction is nontrivial using unipolar stochastic logic. Additionally, an accurate computation of subtraction is critical for the implementation of polynomials with negative coefficients in stochastic unipolar representation. This work, for the first time, demonstrates that instead of using well-known Bernstein polynomials, stochastic computation of polynomials can be implemented by using a stochastic subtractor and factorization. Three major contributions are given in this article. First, two approaches are proposed to compute subtraction in stochastic unipolar representation. In the first approach, the subtraction operation is approximated by cascading multilevels of OR and AND gates. The accuracy of the approximation is improved with the increase in the number of stages. In the second approach, the stochastic subtraction is implemented using a multiplexer and a stochastic divider. This approach requires more hardware complexity due to the use of a linear-feedback shift register and a counter for division. Second, computation of polynomials in stochastic unipolar format is presented using scaled addition and proposed stochastic subtraction. Third, we propose stochastic computation of polynomials using factorization. Stochastic implementations of first- and second-order factors are presented for different locations of polynomial roots. From experimental results, it is shown that the proposed stochastic logic circuits require less hardware complexity than the previous stochastic polynomial implementation using Bernstein polynomials.","author":["Yin Liu","Keshab K.

This cloud-only approach requires significant amounts of data to be sent to the cloud over the wireless network and puts significant computational pressure on the datacenter. However, as the computational resources in mobile devices become more powerful and energy efficient, questions arise as to whether this cloud-only processing is desirable moving forward, and what are the implications of pushing some or all of this compute to the mobile devices on the edge. In this paper, we examine the status quo approach of cloud-only processing and investigate computation partitioning strategies that effectively leverage both the cycles in the cloud and on the mobile device to achieve low latency, low energy consumption, and high datacenter throughput for this class of intelligent applications. Our study uses 8 intelligent applications spanning computer vision, speech, and natural language domains, all employing state-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as the core machine learning technique. We find that given the characteristics of DNN algorithms, a fine-grained, layer-level computation partitioning strategy based on the data and computation variations of each layer within a DNN has significant latency and energy advantages over the status quo approach. Using this insight, we design Neurosurgeon, a lightweight scheduler to automatically partition DNN computation between mobile devices and datacenters at the granularity of neural network layers. Neurosurgeon does not require per-application profiling. It adapts to various DNN architectures, hardware platforms, wireless networks, and server load levels, intelligently partitioning computation for best latency or best mobile energy. We evaluate Neurosurgeon on a state-of-the-art mobile development platform and show that it improves end-to-end latency by 3.1X on average and up to 40.7X, reduces mobile energy consumption by 59.5% on average and up to 94.7%, and improves datacenter throughput by 1.5X on average and up to 6.7X.","author":["Yiping Kang","Johann Hauswald","Cao Gao","Austin Rovinski","Trevor Mudge","Jason Mars","Lingjia Tang"],"issue":["ASPLOS '17: Proceedings of the Twenty-Second International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","April 2017","Pages   615\u2013629","https://doi.org/10.1145/3037697.3037698"],"date":"04 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"Wearables market to be worth$25 billion by 2019. http://www.ccsinsight.com/press/company-news/2332-wearables-market-to-be-worth-25-billion-by-2019-reveals-ccs-insight.

Infrequently accessed application data can be stored in such memories to achieve significant memory cost savings. Past research on two-tiered main memory has assumed a 4KB page size. However, 2MB huge pages are performance critical in cloud applications with large memory footprints, especially in virtualized cloud environments, where nested paging drastically increases the cost of 4KB page management. We present Thermostat, an application-transparent huge-page-aware mechanism to place pages in a dual-technology hybrid memory system while achieving both the cost advantages of two-tiered memory and performance advantages of transparent huge pages. We present an online page classification mechanism that accurately classifies both 4KB and 2MB pages as hot or cold while incurring no observable performance overhead across several representative cloud applications. We implement Thermostat in Linux kernel version 4.5 and evaluate its effectiveness on representative cloud computing workloads running under KVM virtualization. We emulate slow memory with performance characteristics approximating near-future high-density memory technology and show that Thermostat migrates up to 50% of application footprint to slow memory while limiting performance degradation to 3%, thereby reducing memory cost up to 30%.","author":["Neha Agarwal","Thomas F.

However, the exploration of deep neural networks on recommender systems has received relatively less scrutiny. In this work, we strive to develop techniques based on neural networks to tackle the key problem in recommendation --- collaborative filtering --- on the basis of implicit feedback. Although some recent work has employed deep learning for recommendation, they primarily used it to model auxiliary information, such as textual descriptions of items and acoustic features of musics. When it comes to model the key factor in collaborative filtering --- the interaction between user and item features, they still resorted to matrix factorization and applied an inner product on the latent features of users and items. By replacing the inner product with a neural architecture that can learn an arbitrary function from data, we present a general framework named NCF, short for Neural network-based Collaborative Filtering. NCF is generic and can express and generalize matrix factorization under its framework. To supercharge NCF modelling with non-linearities, we propose to leverage a multi-layer perceptron to learn the user-item interaction function. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show significant improvements of our proposed NCF framework over the state-of-the-art methods. Empirical evidence shows that using deeper layers of neural networks offers better recommendation performance.","author":["Xiangnan He","Lizi Liao","Hanwang Zhang","Liqiang Nie","Xia Hu","Tat-Seng Chua"],"issue":["WWW '17: Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web","April 2017","Pages   173\u2013182","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052569"],"date":"03 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"I.

However, designing with FPGAs requires specialized hardware design skills and hours-long CAD processing times. To reduce and accelerate the design effort, we can implement an overlay architecture on the FPGA, on which we then more easily construct the desired system but at a large cost in performance and area relative to a direct FPGA implementation. In this work, we compare the micro-architecture, performance, and area of two soft-processor overlays: the Octavo multi-threaded soft-processor and the MXP soft vector processor. To measure the area and performance penalties of these overlays relative to the underlying FPGA hardware, we compare direct FPGA implementations of the micro-benchmarks written in C synthesized with the LegUp HLS tool and also written in the Verilog HDL. Overall, Octavo\u2019s higher operating frequency and MXP\u2019s more efficient code execution results in similar performance from both, within an order of magnitude of direct FPGA implementations, but with a penalty of an order of magnitude greater area.","author":["Charles Eric Laforest","Jason H.

However, nearly all of such algorithms are optimized for platform-based performance and may not be useful for diverse and flexible applications. The National Security Agency (NSA) has proposed two relatively recent families of lightweight ciphers, that is, Simon and Speck, designed as efficient ciphers on both hardware and software platforms. This article proposes concurrent error detection schemes to provide reliable architectures for these two families of lightweight block ciphers. The research work on analyzing the reliability of these algorithms and providing fault diagnosis approaches has not been undertaken to date to the best of our knowledge. The main aim of the proposed reliable architectures is to provide high error coverage while maintaining acceptable area and power consumption overheads. To achieve this, we propose a variant of recomputing with encoded operands. These low-complexity schemes are suited for low-resource applications such as sensitive, constrained implantable and wearable medical devices. We perform fault simulations for the proposed architectures by developing a fault model framework. The architectures are simulated and analyzed on recent field-programmable grate array (FPGA) platforms, and it is shown that the proposed schemes provide high error coverage. The proposed low-complexity concurrent error detection schemes are a step forward toward more reliable architectures for Simon and Speck algorithms in lightweight, secure applications.","author":["Prashant Ahir","Mehran Mozaffari-Kermani","Reza Azarderakhsh"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 16","Issue 4","September 2017","Article No.: 109","pp   1\u201317","https://doi.org/10.1145/3055514"],"date":"11 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"M.

In this technical correspondence, we want to point out some inaccuracies in the way DBSCAN was represented, and why the criticism should have been directed at the assumption about the performance of spatial index structures such as R-trees and not at an algorithm that can use such indexes. We will also discuss the relationship of DBSCAN performance and the indexability of the dataset, and discuss some heuristics for choosing appropriate DBSCAN parameters. Some indicators of bad parameters will be proposed to help guide future users of this algorithm in choosing parameters such as to obtain both meaningful results and good performance. In new experiments, we show that the new SIGMOD 2015 methods do not appear to offer practical benefits if the DBSCAN parameters are well chosen and thus they are primarily of theoretical interest. In conclusion, the original DBSCAN algorithm with effective indexes and reasonably chosen parameter values performs competitively compared to the method proposed by Gan and Tao.","author":["Erich Schubert","J\u00f6rg Sander","Martin Ester","Hans Peter Kriegel","Xiaowei Xu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Database Systems","Volume 42","Issue 3","August 2017","Article No.: 19","pp   1\u201321","https://doi.org/10.1145/3068335"],"date":"31 July 2017","ref":[{"text":"Pankaj K.

Each user may create a user identity, which can includes profile, content, or network information, to represent his or her unique public figure in every social network. Thus, a fundamental question arises -- can we link user identities across online social networks? User identity linkage across online social networks is an emerging task in social media and has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Advancements in user identity linkage could potentially impact various domains such as recommendation and link prediction. Due to the unique characteristics of social network data, this problem faces tremendous challenges. To tackle these challenges, recent approaches generally consist of (1) extracting features and (2) constructing predictive models from a variety of perspectives. In this paper, we review key achievements of user identity linkage across online social networks including stateof- the-art algorithms, evaluation metrics, and representative datasets. We also discuss related research areas, open problems, and future research directions for user identity linkage across online social networks.","author":["Kai Shu","Suhang Wang","Jiliang Tang","Reza Zafarani","Huan Liu"],"issue":["ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter","Volume 18","Issue 2","December 2016","pp   5\u201317","https://doi.org/10.1145/3068777.3068781"],"date":"22 March 2017","ref":[{"text":"Mohammad Al Hasan, Vineet Chaoji, Saeed Salem, and Mohammed Zaki.

Approximate Computing is being touted as a viable solution for high performance computation by relaxing the accuracy constraints of applications. This trend has been accentuated by emerging data intensive applications in domains like image/video processing, machine learning and big data analytics that allow inaccurate outputs within an acceptable variance. Leveraging relaxed accuracy for high throughput in Networks-on-Chip (NoCs), which have rapidly become the accepted method for connecting a large number of on-chip components, has not yet been explored. We propose APPROX-NoC, a hardware data approximation framework with an online data error control mechanism for high performance NoCs. APPROX-NoC facilitates approximate matching of data patterns, within a controllable value range, to compress them thereby reducing the volume of data movement across the chip. Our evaluation shows that APPROX-NoC achieves on average up to 9% latency reduction and 60% throughput improvement compared with state-of-the-art NoC data compression mechanisms, while maintaining low application error. Additionally, with a data intensive graph processing application we achieve a 36.7% latency reduction compared to state-of-the-art compression mechanisms.","author":["Rahul Boyapati","Jiayi Huang","Pritam Majumder","Ki Hwan Yum","Eun Jung Kim"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   666\u2013677","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080241"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Banit Agrawal and Timothy Sherwood. 2008.

Existing programmable and \"general purpose\" solutions (eg. SIMD, GPGPUs) are insufficient, as evidenced by the order-of-magnitude improvements and industry adoption of application and domain-specific accelerators in important areas like machine learning, computer vision and big data. The stark tradeoffs between efficiency and generality at these two extremes poses a difficult question: how could domain-specific hardware efficiency be achieved without domain-specific hardware solutions? In this work, we rely on the insight that \"acceleratable\" algorithms have broad common properties: high computational intensity with long phases, simple control patterns and dependences, and simple streaming memory access and reuse patterns. We define a general architecture (a hardware-software interface) which can more efficiently expresses program with these properties called stream-dataflow. The dataflow component of this architecture enables high concurrency, and the stream component enables communication and coordination at very-low power and area overhead. This paper explores the hardware and software implications, describes its detailed microarchitecture, and evaluates an implementation. Compared to a state-of-the-art domain specific accelerator (DianNao), and fixed-function accelerators for MachSuite, Softbrain can match their performance with only 2x power overhead on average.","author":["Tony Nowatzki","Vinay Gangadhar","Newsha Ardalani","Karthikeyan Sankaralingam"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   416\u2013429","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080255"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Jonathan Bachrach, Huy Vo, Brian Richards, Yunsup Lee, Andrew Waterman, Rimas Avi\u017eienis, John Wawrzynek, and Krste Asanovi\u0107. 2012.

Feature selection is powerful to prepare high-dimensional data by finding a subset of relevant features. A vast majority of existing feature selection algorithms for social media data exclusively focus on positive interactions among linked instances such as friendships and user following relations. However, in many real-world social networks, instances may also be negatively interconnected. Recent work shows that negative links have an added value over positive links in advancing many learning tasks. In this paper, we study a novel problem of unsupervised feature selection in signed social networks and propose a novel framework SignedFS. In particular, we provide a principled way to model positive and negative links for user latent representation learning. Then we embed the user latent representations into feature selection when label information is not available. Also, we revisit the principle of homophily and balance theory in signed social networks and incorporate the signed graph regularization into the feature selection framework to capture the first-order and the second-order proximity among users in signed social networks. Experiments on two real-world signed social networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Further experiments are conducted to understand the impacts of different components of SignedFS.","author":["Kewei Cheng","Jundong Li","Huan Liu"],"issue":["KDD '17: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2017","Pages   777\u2013786","https://doi.org/10.1145/3097983.3098106"],"date":"04 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Lada A Adamic and Bernardo A Huberman 2000.

In particular, previous proposals dynamically configure circuit switches in response to changes in workload, requiring network-wide demand estimation, centralized circuit assignment, and tight time synchronization between various network elements--- resulting in a complex and unwieldy control plane. Moreover, limitations in the technologies underlying the individual circuit switches restrict both the rate at which they can be reconfigured and the scale of the network that can be constructed. We propose RotorNet, a circuit-based network design that addresses these two challenges. While RotorNet dynamically reconfigures its constituent circuit switches, it decouples switch configuration from traffic patterns, obviating the need for demand collection and admitting a fully decentralized control plane. At the physical layer, RotorNet relaxes the requirements on the underlying circuit switches---in particular by not requiring individual switches to implement a full crossbar---enabling them to scale to 1000s of ports. We show that RotorNet outperforms comparably priced Fat Tree topologies under a variety of workload conditions, including traces taken from two commercial datacenters. We also demonstrate a small-scale RotorNet operating in practice on an eight-node testbed.","author":["William M. Mellette","Rob McGuinness","Arjun Roy","Alex Forencich","George Papen","Alex C.

As a result, Deep Neural Networks have supplanted other approaches to solving problems in these areas, and enabled many new applications. While the design of Deep Neural Nets is still something of an art form, in our work we have found basic principles of design space exploration used to develop embedded microprocessor architectures to be highly applicable to the design of Deep Neural Net architectures. In particular, we have used these design principles to create a novel Deep Neural Net called SqueezeNet that requires only 480KB of storage for its model parameters. We have further integrated all these experiences to develop something of a playbook for creating small Deep Neural Nets for embedded systems.","author":["Forrest Iandola","Kurt Keutzer"],"issue":["CODES '17: Proceedings of the Twelfth IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis Companion","October 2017","Article No.: 1","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3125502.3125606"],"date":"15 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Abadi, M. et al. 2016.

Existing approaches for popularity prediction fall into two paradigms: feature-based approaches and generative approaches. Feature-based approaches extract various features (e.g., user, content, structural, and temporal features), and predict the future popularity of information by training a regression/classification model. Their predictive performance heavily depends on the quality of hand-crafted features. In contrast, generative approaches devote to characterizing and modeling the process that a piece of information accrues attentions, offering us high ease to understand the underlying mechanisms governing the popularity dynamics of information cascades. But they have less desirable predictive power since they are not optimized for popularity prediction. In this paper, we propose DeepHawkes to combat the defects of existing methods, leveraging end-to-end deep learning to make an analogy to interpretable factors of Hawkes process --- a widely-used generative process to model information cascade. DeepHawkes inherits the high interpretability of Hawkes process and possesses the high predictive power of deep learning methods, bridging the gap between prediction and understanding of information cascades. We verify the effectiveness of DeepHawkes by applying it to predict retweet cascades of Sina Weibo and citation cascades of a longitudinal citation dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepHawkes outperforms both feature-based and generative approaches.","author":["Qi Cao","Huawei Shen","Keting Cen","Wentao Ouyang","Xueqi Cheng"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   1149\u20131158","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132973"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, we argue in this paper that active storage is ill-suited for cloud storage for two reasons: 1. Lack of elasticity: Computing can only scale out with the number of storage nodes; and 2. Resource Contention: Sharing compute resources can produce interferences in the storage system. Serverless computing is now emerging as a promising alternative for ensuring painless scalability, and also, for simplifying the development of disaggregated computing tasks. Here we present an innovative data-driven serverless computing middleware for object storage. It is a lightweight compute solution that allows users to create small, stateless functions that intercept and operate on data flows in a scalable manner without the need to manage a server or a runtime environment. We demonstrate through different use cases how our solution scales with minimal overhead, while getting rid of the resource contention problems incurred by active storage tasks.","author":["Josep Samp\u00e9","Marc S\u00e1nchez-Artigas","Pedro Garc\u00eda-L\u00f3pez","Gerard Par\u00eds"],"issue":["Middleware '17: Proceedings of the 18th ACM/IFIP/USENIX Middleware Conference","December 2017","Pages   121\u2013133","https://doi.org/10.1145/3135974.3135980"],"date":"11 December 2017","ref":[{"text":"Amazon. 2017.

A central element is a set of metamorphic relations, which are necessary properties of the target function or algorithm in relation to multiple inputs and their expected outputs. Since its first publication, we have witnessed a rapidly increasing body of work examining metamorphic testing from various perspectives, including metamorphic relation identification, test case generation, integration with other software engineering techniques, and the validation and evaluation of software systems. In this article, we review the current research of metamorphic testing and discuss the challenges yet to be addressed. We also present visions for further improvement of metamorphic testing and highlight opportunities for new research.","author":["Tsong Yueh Chen","Fei-Ching Kuo","Huai Liu","Pak-Lok Poon","Dave Towey","T.

Many characterization tools have been used to elucidate specific aspects of parallel I/O performance, but analyzing components of complex I/O subsystems in isolation fails to provide insight into critical questions: how do the I/O components interact, what are reasonable expectations for application performance, and what are the underlying causes of I/O performance problems? To address these questions while capitalizing on existing component-level characterization tools, we propose an approach that combines on-demand, modular synthesis of I/O characterization data into a unified monitoring and metrics interface (UMAMI) to provide a normalized, holistic view of I/O behavior. We evaluate the feasibility of this approach by applying it to a month-long benchmarking study on two distinct large-scale computing platforms. We present three case studies that highlight the importance of analyzing application I/O performance in context with both contemporaneous and historical component metrics, and we provide new insights into the factors affecting I/O performance. By demonstrating the generality of our approach, we lay the groundwork for a production-grade framework for holistic I/O analysis.","author":["Glenn K.

They also expose various optimization opportunities, which cannot be easily explored at the register-transfer level. With the increasing adoption of the HLS design methodology and continued advances of synthesis optimization, there is a growing need for realistic benchmarks to (1) facilitate comparisons between tools, (2) evaluate and stress-test new synthesis techniques, and (3) establish meaningful performance baselines to track progress of the HLS technology. While several HLS benchmark suites already exist, they are primarily comprised of small textbook-style function kernels, instead of complete and complex applications. To address this limitation, we introduce Rosetta, a realistic benchmark suite for software programmable FPGAs. Designs in Rosetta are fully-developed applications. They are associated with realistic performance constraints, and optimized with advanced features of modern HLS tools. We believe that Rosetta is not only useful for the HLS research community, but can also serve as a set of design tutorials for non-expert HLS users. In this paper we describe the characteristics of our benchmarks and the optimization techniques applied to them. We further report experimental results on an embedded FPGA device as well as a cloud FPGA platform.","author":["Yuan Zhou","Udit Gupta","Steve Dai","Ritchie Zhao","Nitish Srivastava","Hanchen Jin","Joseph Featherston","Yi-Hsiang Lai","Gai Liu","Gustavo Angarita Velasquez","Wenping Wang","Zhiru Zhang"],"issue":["FPGA '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2018","Pages   269\u2013278","https://doi.org/10.1145/3174243.3174255"],"date":"15 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Amazon Web Services.

Next to architectural insights we provide evidence for the pervasive presence of heavy-tail distribution characteristics in all aspect of file system usage.

While they have been studied extensively in academic literature, they find limited use in deployed systems. We review FPGA reconfiguration, looking at architectures built for the purpose, and the properties of modern commercial architectures. We then investigate design flows and identify the key challenges in making reconfigurable FPGA systems easier to design. Finally, we look at applications where reconfiguration has found use, as well as proposing new areas where this capability places FPGAs in a unique position for adoption.","author":["Kizheppatt Vipin","Suhaib A.

While existing works have developed various embedding methods for network data, they have primarily focused on homogeneous networks in general and overlooked the special properties of bipartite networks. As such, these methods can be suboptimal for embedding bipartite networks. In this paper, we propose a new method named BiNE, short for Bipartite Network Embedding, to learn the vertex representations for bipartite networks. By performing biased random walks purposefully, we generate vertex sequences that can well preserve the long-tail distribution of vertices in the original bipartite network. We then propose a novel optimization framework by accounting for both the explicit relations (i.e., observed links) and implicit relations (i.e., unobserved but transitive links) in learning the vertex representations. We conduct extensive experiments on several real datasets covering the tasks of link prediction (classification), recommendation (personalized ranking), and visualization. Both quantitative results and qualitative analysis verify the effectiveness and rationality of our BiNE method.","author":["Ming Gao","Leihui Chen","Xiangnan He","Aoying Zhou"],"issue":["SIGIR '18: The 41st International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research & Development in Information Retrieval","June 2018","Pages   715\u2013724","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3209987"],"date":"27 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Hongbo Deng, Michael R.

Previous works based on either specialized or commercial hardware all require multiple links, preventing their wide adoption in scenarios like homes where typically only one single AP is installed. The key insight underlying Widar2.0 to circumvent the use of multiple links is to leverage multi-dimensional signal parameters from one single link. To this end, we build a unified model accounting for Angle-of-Arrival, Time-of-Flight, and Doppler shifts together and devise an efficient algorithm for their joint estimation. We then design a pipeline to translate the erroneous raw parameters into precise locations, which first finds parameters corresponding to the reflections of interests, then refines range estimates, and ultimately outputs target locations. Our implementation and evaluation on commodity WiFi devices demonstrate that Widar2.0 achieves better or comparable performance to state-of-the-art localization systems, which either use specialized hardwares or require 2 to 40 Wi-Fi links.","author":["Kun Qian","Chenshu Wu","Yi Zhang","Guidong Zhang","Zheng Yang","Yunhao Liu"],"issue":["MobiSys '18: Proceedings of the 16th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services","June 2018","Pages   350\u2013361","https://doi.org/10.1145/3210240.3210314"],"date":"10 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"2018.

Accordingly, recent developments in the fields of deep learning configuration platforms have led to renewed interests in neural network unified format (NNUF) for standardized deep learning computation. The attempt of making NNUF becomes quite challenging because primarily used platforms change over time and the structures of deep learning computation models are continuously evolving. This paper presents the design and implementation of a parser of NNUF for standardized deep learning computation. We call the platform implemented with the neural network exchange framework (NNEF) standard as the NNUF. This framework provides platform-independent processes for configuring and training deep learning neural networks, where the independence is offered by the NNUF model. This model allows us to configure all components of neural network graphs. Our framework also allows the resulting graph to be easily shared with other platform-dependent descriptions which configure various neural network architectures in their own ways. This paper presents the details of the parser design, JavaCC-based implementation, and initial results.","author":["MyungJae Shin","Joongheon Kim","Aziz Mohaisen","Jaebok Park","Kyung Hee Lee"],"issue":["EMDL'18: Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Embedded and Mobile Deep Learning","June 2018","Pages   37\u201341","https://doi.org/10.1145/3212725.3212727"],"date":"15 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"JavaCC Introduction. http://www-I06.ibm.comldeveloperworks/javailibrary/x-javaccl.html.","order":1},{"text":"Baylor, D., Breck, E., Cheng, H.-T., Fiedel, N., Foo, C.

We utilize the unique features of D-FEFET to design two variants of non-volatile flip-flops (NVFFs). In both designs, D-FEFETs are operated in the volatile mode for normal operations and in the non-volatile mode to backup the state of the flip-flop during a power outage. The first design comprises of a truly embedded non-volatile element (D-FEFET) which enables a fully automatic backup operation. In the second design, we introduce need-based backup, which lowers energy during normal operation at the cost of area with respect to the first design. Compared to a previously proposed FEFET based NVFF, the first design achieves 19% area reduction along with 96% lower backup energy and 9% lower restore energy, but at 14%-35% larger operation energy. The second design shows 11% lower area, 21% lower backup energy, 16% decrease in backup delay and similar operation energy but with a penalty of 17% and 19% in the restore energy and delay, respectively. System-level analysis of the proposed NVFFs in context of a state-of-the-art intermittently-powered system using real benchmarks yielded 5%-33% energy savings.","author":["S. K. Thirumala","A.

Recently deep learning based models have been proposed, which follow a similar Embedding&MLP paradigm. In these methods large scale sparse input features are first mapped into low dimensional embedding vectors, and then transformed into fixed-length vectors in a group-wise manner, finally concatenated together to fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to learn the nonlinear relations among features. In this way, user features are compressed into a fixed-length representation vector, in regardless of what candidate ads are. The use of fixed-length vector will be a bottleneck, which brings difficulty for Embedding&MLP methods to capture user's diverse interests effectively from rich historical behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel model: Deep Interest Network (DIN) which tackles this challenge by designing a local activation unit to adaptively learn the representation of user interests from historical behaviors with respect to a certain ad. This representation vector varies over different ads, improving the expressive ability of model greatly. Besides, we develop two techniques: mini-batch aware regularization and data adaptive activation function which can help training industrial deep networks with hundreds of millions of parameters. Experiments on two public datasets as well as an Alibaba real production dataset with over 2 billion samples demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approaches, which achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. DIN now has been successfully deployed in the online display advertising system in Alibaba, serving the main traffic.","author":["Guorui Zhou","Xiaoqiang Zhu","Chenru Song","Ying Fan","Han Zhu","Xiao Ma","Yanghui Yan","Junqi Jin","Han Li","Kun Gai"],"issue":["KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2018","Pages   1059\u20131068","https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3219823"],"date":"19 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2015.

In this case, traffic characteristics including available bandwidth, packet rate, and flow size distribution vary drastically, significantly degrading the performance of measurements. To address this issue, we propose the Elastic sketch. It is adaptive to currently traffic characteristics. Besides, it is generic to measurement tasks and platforms. We implement the Elastic sketch on six platforms: P4, FPGA, GPU, CPU, multi-core CPU, and OVS, to process six typical measurement tasks. Experimental results and theoretical analysis show that the Elastic sketch can adapt well to traffic characteristics. Compared to the state-of-the-art, the Elastic sketch achieves 44.6 \u223c 45.2 times faster speed and 2.0 \u223c 273.7 smaller error rate.","author":["Tong Yang","Jie Jiang","Peng Liu","Qun Huang","Junzhi Gong","Yang Zhou","Rui Miao","Xiaoming Li","Steve Uhlig"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '18: Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication","August 2018","Pages   561\u2013575","https://doi.org/10.1145/3230543.3230544"],"date":"07 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"Gurmeet Singh Manku and Rajeev Motwani.

State-of-the-art ABR algorithms like BOLA and MPC rely on parameters that are sensitive to network conditions, so may perform poorly for some users and/or videos. In this paper, we propose a technique called Oboe to auto-tune these parameters to different network conditions. Oboe pre-computes, for a given ABR algorithm, the best possible parameters for different network conditions, then dynamically adapts the parameters at run-time for the current network conditions. Using testbed experiments, we show that Oboe significantly improves BOLA, MPC, and a commercially deployed ABR. Oboe also betters a recently proposed reinforcement learning based ABR, Pensieve, by 24% on average on a composite QoE metric, in part because it is able to better specialize ABR behavior across different network states.","author":["Zahaib Akhtar","Yun Seong Nam","Ramesh Govindan","Sanjay Rao","Jessica Chen","Ethan Katz-Bassett","Bruno Ribeiro","Jibin Zhan","Hui Zhang"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '18: Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication","August 2018","Pages   44\u201358","https://doi.org/10.1145/3230543.3230558"],"date":"07 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"Microsoft Smooth Streaming. http://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/smooth-streaming.","order":1},{"text":"Toward A Practical Perceptual Video Quality Metric. https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/toward-a-practical-perceptual-video-quality-metric-653f208b9652.","order":2},{"text":"Adobe OSMF player. http://www.osmf.org.","order":3},{"text":"Oracle: 5 Reasons to Consider SaaS for Your Business Applications. http://www.oracle.com/us/solutions/cloud/saas-business-applications-1945540.pdf.","order":4},{"text":"Chrome Remote Interface. https://github.com/cyrus-and/chrome-remote-interface.","order":5},{"text":"Cisco: It Came to Me in a Stream. https://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac79/docs/sp/Online-Video-Consumption_Consumers.pdf.","order":6},{"text":"DASH Industry Forum. https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js.","order":7},{"text":"Federal Communications Commission.

Specificly, Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have achieved impressive results in various generative tasks. VAE is well established and theoretically elegant, but tends to generate blurry samples. In contrast, GAN has shown the advantage in visual quality of generated images, but suffers the difficulty in translating a random vector into a desired high-dimensional sample. As a result, the training dynamics in GAN are often unstable and the generated samples could collapse to limited modes. In this paper, we propose a new Auto-Encoder Generative Adversarial Networks (AEGAN), which takes advantages of both VAE and GAN. In our approach, instead of matching the encoded distribution of training samples to the prior Pz as in VAE, we map the random vector into the encoded latent space by adversarial training based on GAN. Besides, we also match the decoded distribution of training samples with that from random vectors. To evaluate our approach, we make comparison with other encoder-decoder based generative models on three public datasets. The experiments with both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over the comparison generative models.","author":["Jiayu Wang","Wengang Zhou","Jinhui Tang","Zhongqian Fu","Qi Tian","Houqiang Li"],"issue":["MM '18: Proceedings of the 26th ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2018","Pages   709\u2013717","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240508.3240569"],"date":"15 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Guillaume Alain, Yoshua Bengio, Li Yao, Jason Yosinski, \u00c9ric Thibodeau-Laufer, Saizheng Zhang, and Pascal Vincent. 2015.

In Add-Net, the computationally expensive convolution operations (i.e. Multiplication and Accumulation) are converted into hardware-friendly Addition operations. We meticulously investigate and analyze the Add-Net's performance (i.e. accuracy, parameter size and computational cost) in object recognition application compared to traditional baseline CNN using the most popular large scale ImageNet dataset. Accordingly, we propose a <u>D</u>epthwise CNN <u>I</u>n-<u>M</u>emory <u>A</u>ccelerator (DIMA) based on SOT-MRAM computational sub-arrays to efficiently accelerate Add-Net within non-volatile MRAM. Our device-to-architecture co-simulation results show that, with almost the same inference accuracy to the baseline CNN on different data-sets, DIMA can obtain ~1.4\u00d7 better energy-efficiency and 15.7\u00d7 speedup compared to ASICs, and, ~1.6\u00d7 better energy-efficiency and 5.6\u00d7 speedup over the best processing-in-DRAM accelerators.","author":["Shaahin Angizi","Zhezhi He","Deliang Fan"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 122","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240799"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"L.

The security of users' calls, SMSs, and mobile data depends on the guarantees provided by the Authenticated Key Exchange protocols used. For the next-generation network (5G), the 3GPP group has standardized the 5G AKA protocol for this purpose. We provide the first comprehensive formal model of a protocol from the AKA family: 5G AKA. We also extract precise requirements from the 3GPP standards defining 5G and we identify missing security goals. Using the security protocol verification tool Tamarin, we conduct a full, systematic, security evaluation of the model with respect to the 5G security goals. Our automated analysis identifies the minimal security assumptions required for each security goal and we find that some critical security goals are not met, except under additional assumptions missing from the standard. Finally, we make explicit recommendations with provably secure fixes for the attacks and weaknesses we found.","author":["David Basin","Jannik Dreier","Lucca Hirschi","Sa\u0161a Radomirovic","Ralf Sasse","Vincent Stettler"],"issue":["CCS '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2018","Pages   1383\u20131396","https://doi.org/10.1145/3243734.3243846"],"date":"15 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"3GPP. 2001. 3G Security: Formal Analysis of the 3G Authentication Protocol.

PI has been conventionally formalized as a binary classification task and widely used in many talks such as text summarization, plagiarism detection, etc. The emergence of deep neural networks (DNNs) renovates and dominates the learning paradigm of PI, as DNNs do not rely on lexical nor syntactic knowledge of a language, unlike traditional methods. State-of-the-art DNNs-based approaches to PI mainly adopt multi-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to model paraphrastic sentences, which could discover alignments of phrases with the same length (unigram-to-unigram, bigram-to-bigram, trigram-to-trigram, etc.) at each layer. However, paraphrasing phenomena globally exist at all levels of granularity between a pair of paraphrastic sentences, i.e., word-to-word, word-to-phrase, phrase-to-phrase, and even sentence-to-sentence. In this paper, we contribute a globalization-semantic matching neural network (GSMNN) paradigm which has been deployed in Baidu.com to tackle practical PI problems. Established on a weight-sharing single-layer CNN, GSMNN is composed of a multi-granular matching layer with the attention mechanism and a sentence-level matching layer. These layers are designed to capture essentially all phenomena of semantic matching. Evaluations are conducted on a public large-scale dataset for PI: Quora-QP which contains more than 400,000 paraphrasing and non-paraphrasing question pairs from Quora.com. Experimental results show that GSMNN outperforms the state-of-the-art model by a substantial margin.","author":["Miao Fan","Wutao Lin","Yue Feng","Mingming Sun","Ping Li"],"issue":["CIKM '18: Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2018","Pages   2067\u20132075","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3272004"],"date":"17 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

Offloading computations to the memory is a promising strategy to overcome such challenges. In this paper, we exploit the resistive memory (ReRAM) based processing-in-memory (PIM) technology to accelerate graph applications. The proposed solution, GRAM, can efficiently executes vertex-centric model, which is widely used in large-scale parallel graph processing programs, in the computational memory. The hardware-software co-design used in GRAM maximizes the computation parallelism while minimizing the number of data movements. Based on our experiments with three important graph kernels on seven real-world graphs, GRAM provides 122.5X and 11.1x speedup compared with an in-memory graph system and optimized multithreading algorithms running on a multi-core CPU. Compared to a GPU-based graph acceleration library and a recently proposed PIM accelerator, GRAM improves the performance by 7.1X and 3.8X respectively.","author":["Minxuan Zhou","Mohsen Imani","Saransh Gupta","Yeseong Kim","Tajana Rosing"],"issue":["ASPDAC '19: Proceedings of the 24th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2019","Pages   591\u2013596","https://doi.org/10.1145/3287624.3287711"],"date":"21 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"S.

These falls often result in severe injuries which lead into huge medical expenses. Over the recent years, many ICT based fall detection and fall prevention solutions emerged to address the risk factors associated with falls. However, despite of these research studies, predicting the likelihood of falls still remains as a huge challenge in both medical and IT research domains. Data related to these risk factors being scattered among different healthcare providers can be attributed as a main reason for this challenge. This is further amplified by healthcare providers being reluctant to disseminate the data beyond their entities due to the security and privacy concerns. However, in recent years, blockchain has been proven as a promising technology to address the security and privacy challenges in healthcare data exchange as it provides a shared, immutable, and transparent audit trail for accessing data. Therefore, in this paper, we are going to propose a conceptual blockchain based fall prediction model leveraging smart contracts and FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard to identify the elderly people who are at a higher risk of falling.","author":["Tharuka Rupasinghe","Frada Burstein","Carsten Rudolph","Steven Strange"],"issue":["ACSW 2019: Proceedings of the Australasian Computer Science Week Multiconference","January 2019","Article No.: 32","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3290688.3290736"],"date":"29 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Abdullah Al Omar, Mohammad Shahriar Rahman, Anirban Basu, and Shinsaku Kiyomoto. 2017.

We present multi-party computation (MPC) framework designed for large-scale data mining tasks. PrivPy combines an easy-to-use and highly flexible Python programming interface with state-of-the-art secret-sharing-based MPC backend. With essential data types and operations (such as NumPy arrays and broadcasting), as well as automatic code-rewriting, programmers can write modern data mining algorithms conveniently in familiar Python. We demonstrate that we can support many real-world machine learning algorithms (e.g. logistic regression and convolutional neural networks) and large datasets (e.g. 5000-by-1-million matrix) with minimal algorithm porting effort.","author":["Yi Li","Wei Xu"],"issue":["KDD '19: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2019","Pages   1299\u20131307","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292500.3330920"],"date":"25 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, and Michael Isard. 2016.

Image captioning requires recognizing the important objects, their attributes, and their relationships in an image. It also needs to generate syntactically and semantically correct sentences. Deep-learning-based techniques are capable of handling the complexities and challenges of image captioning. In this survey article, we aim to present a comprehensive review of existing deep-learning-based image captioning techniques. We discuss the foundation of the techniques to analyze their performances, strengths, and limitations. We also discuss the datasets and the evaluation metrics popularly used in deep-learning-based automatic image captioning.","author":["MD.

Previous research shows that 1) popular network embedding benchmarks, such as DeepWalk, are in essence implicitly factorizing a matrix with a closed form, and 2) the explicit factorization of such matrix generates more powerful embeddings than existing methods. However, directly constructing and factorizing this matrix-which is dense-is prohibitively expensive in terms of both time and space, making it not scalable for large networks.  In this work, we present the algorithm of large-scale network embedding as sparse matrix factorization (NetSMF). NetSMF leverages theories from spectral sparsification to efficiently sparsify the aforementioned dense matrix, enabling significantly improved efficiency in embedding learning. The sparsified matrix is spectrally close to the original dense one with a theoretically bounded approximation error, which helps maintain the representation power of the learned embeddings. We conduct experiments on networks of various scales and types. Results show that among both popular benchmarks and factorization based methods, NetSMF is the only method that achieves both high efficiency and effectiveness. We show that NetSMF requires only 24 hours to generate effective embeddings for a large-scale academic collaboration network with tens of millions of nodes, while it would cost DeepWalk months and is computationally infeasible for the dense matrix factorization solution. The source code of NetSMF is publicly available1.","author":["Jiezhong Qiu","Yuxiao Dong","Hao Ma","Jian Li","Chi Wang","Kuansan Wang","Jie Tang"],"issue":["WWW '19: The World Wide Web Conference","May 2019","Pages   1509\u20131520","https://doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313446"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Nitin Agarwal, Huan Liu, Sudheendra Murthy, Arunabha Sen, and Xufei Wang. 2009.

Various emerging applications are promising to enrich users\u2019 traveling experiences and daily life. However, how to execute computing-intensive applications on resource-constrained vehicles still faces huge challenges. In this article, we construct an intelligent offloading system for vehicular edge computing by leveraging deep reinforcement learning. First, both the communication and computation states are modelled by finite Markov chains. Moreover, the task scheduling and resource allocation strategy is formulated as a joint optimization problem to maximize users\u2019 Quality of Experience (QoE). Due to its complexity, the original problem is further divided into two sub-optimization problems. A two-sided matching scheme and a deep reinforcement learning approach are developed to schedule offloading requests and allocate network resources, respectively. Performance evaluations illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of our constructed system.","author":["Zhaolong Ning","Peiran Dong","Xiaojie Wang","Joel J. P. C.

It provides a cheaper and greener alternative computing infrastructure that can complement the dedicated, centralized, and expensive data centres. The aggregated idle computing resources of devices ranging from desktop computers to routers and smart TVs are being utilized to provide the much needed computing infrastructure for compute intensive tasks such as scientific simulations and big data analysis. However, the use of Volunteer Computing is still dominated by scientific applications and only a very small fraction of the potential volunteer nodes are participating. This article provides a comprehensive survey of Volunteer Computing, covering key technical and operational issues such as security, task distribution, resource management, and incentive models. The article also presents a taxonomy of Volunteer Computing systems, together with discussions of the characteristics of specific systems in each category. To harness the full potentials of Volunteer Computing and make it a reliable alternative computing infrastructure for general applications, we need to improve the existing techniques and device new mechanisms. Thus, this article also sheds light on important issues regarding the future research and development of Volunteer Computing systems with the aim of making them a viable alternative computing infrastructure.","author":["Tessema M.

The trusted computing of CPS includes the complete protection mechanisms, such as hardware, firmware, and software, the combination of which is responsible for enforcing a system security policy. A Trust Detection-based Secured Routing (TDSR) scheme is proposed to establish security routes from source nodes to the data center under malicious environment to ensure network security. In the TDSR scheme, sensor nodes in the routing path send detection routing to identify relay nodes\u2019 trust. And then, data packets are routed through trustworthy nodes to sink securely. In the TDSR scheme, the detection routing is executed in those nodes that have abundant energy; thus, the network lifetime cannot be affected. Performance evaluation through simulation is carried out for success of routing ratio, compromised node detection ratio, and detection routing overhead. The experiment results show that the performance can be improved in the TDSR scheme compared to previous schemes.","author":["Yuxin Liu","Xiao Liu","Anfeng Liu","Neal N.

Meanwhile, mobile applications become more complicated, consisting of multiple dependent tasks which are typically modeled as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). In edge computing, when an application arrives, we need to place and schedule its tasks onto edge servers and/or the remote cloud, where the functions to execute the tasks are configured. In this work, we jointly consider the problem of dependent task placement and scheduling with on-demand function configuration on servers. Our objective is to minimize the application completion time. Specifically, for the special case when the configuration on each edge server is fixed, we derive an algorithm to find the optimal task placement and scheduling efficiently. When the on-demand function configuration is allowed, we propose a novel approximation algorithm, named GenDoc, and analyze theoretically its additive error from the optimal solution. Our extensive experiments on the cluster trace from Alibaba (including 20365 unique applications with DAG information) show that GenDoc outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in processing 86.14% of these unique applications, and reduces their average completion time by at least 24% (and up to 54%). Moreover, GenDoc consistently performs well on various settings of key parameters.","author":["Liuyan Liu","Haisheng Tan","Shaofeng H.-C.

The potent combination of these attractive characteristics makes it possible for SCM to unify the main memory and storage to reduce the storage hierarchy. Aiming for this, several persistent memory systems were designed. However, the heavy metadata and transaction cost degrade the system performance. Moreover, neither of them pays attention to wear-leveling strategy.In this article, we present a lightweight persistent memory system, LiwePMS, which allows a fast access to persistent data stored in SCM with wear-aware memory management. LiwePMS makes performance improvement by simplifying the metadata management and the consistency method. LiwePMS abstracts SCM as heap space with container-based dynamic address mapping. Also, LiwePMS implements efficient wear-aware dynamic memory allocator and lightweight transaction mechanism for data consistency in user-space library. The experiments showed that LiwePMS persists key-value records 1.5\u00d7 faster than Redis RDB mechanism. LiwePMS improves the performance of persistent region operation by more than 45%, 63%, and 1.1\u00d7 comparing with HEAPO, Mnemosyne, and NVML, respectively. Also, the wear-leveling policy of memory allocator outperforms that of NVMalloc from 35% to 30%, and the transaction method promotes the transaction performance to 1.8\u00d7 compared to NVML.","author":["Sumin Li","Kaixin Huang","Linpeng Huang","Jiashun Zhu"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 15","Issue 3","June 2019","Article No.: 30","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/3327963"],"date":"10 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"spark.apache.org. {n.d.}.

Therefore, how to minimize the storage cost of video data in 3DFTs is a challenge for cloud storage systems. Although there are several solutions like approximate storage technique, they cannot guarantee low storage cost and high data reliability concurrently. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose Approximate Code, which is an erasure coding framework for tiered video storage in cloud systems. The key idea of Approximate Code is distinguishing the important and unimportant data with different capabilities of fault tolerance. On one hand, for important data, Approximate Code provides triple parities to ensure high reliability. On the other hand, single/double parities are applied for unimportant data, which can save the storage cost and accelerate the recovery process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Approximate Code, we conduct several experiments in Hadoop systems. The results show that, compared to traditional 3DFTs using various erasure codes such as RS, LRC, STAR and TIP-Code, Approximate Code reduces the number of parities by up to 55%, saves the storage cost by up to 20.8% and increase the recovery speed by up to 4.7X when double nodes fail.","author":["Huayi Jin","Chentao Wu","Xin Xie","Jie Li","Minyi Guo","Hao Lin","Jianfeng Zhang"],"issue":["ICPP 2019: Proceedings of the 48th International Conference on Parallel Processing","August 2019","Article No.: 95","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3337821.3337869"],"date":"05 August 2019","ref":[{"text":"Sami Abu-El-Haija, Nisarg Kothari, Joonseok Lee, Paul Natsev, George Toderici, Balakrishnan Varadarajan, and Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan. 2016.

Serval provides an extensible infrastructure for creating verifiers by lifting interpreters under symbolic evaluation, and a systematic approach to identifying and repairing verification performance bottlenecks using symbolic profiling and optimizations. Using Serval, we build automated verifiers for the RISC-V, x86--32, LLVM, and BPF instruction sets. We report our experience of retrofitting CertiKOS and Komodo, two systems previously verified using Coq and Dafny, respectively, for automated verification using Serval, and discuss trade-offs of different verification methodologies. In addition, we apply Serval to the Keystone security monitor and the BPF compilers in the Linux kernel, and uncover 18 new bugs through verification, all confirmed and fixed by developers.","author":["Luke Nelson","James Bornholt","Ronghui Gu","Andrew Baumann","Emina Torlak","Xi Wang"],"issue":["SOSP '19: Proceedings of the 27th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","October 2019","Pages   225\u2013242","https://doi.org/10.1145/3341301.3359641"],"date":"27 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Eyad Alkassar, Wolfgang J.

Since words that share semantics are expected to be clustered together, it is common to use a feature vector representation generated from a distributional theory-based word embedding method. The goal of this work is to utilize Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) for better clustering performance of the low-resource Iraqi vocabulary. We began with a new Dialect Fast Stemming Algorithm (DFSA) that utilizes the MSA data. The proposed algorithm achieved 0.85 accuracy measured by the F1 score. Then, the distributional theory-based word embedding method and a new simple, yet effective, feature vector named Wasf-Vec word embedding are tested. Wasf-Vec word representation utilizes a word\u2019s topology features. The difference between Wasf-Vec and distributional theory-based word embedding is that Wasf-Vec captures relations that are not contextually based. The embedding is followed by an analysis of how the dialect words are clustered within other MSA words. The analysis is based on the word semantic relations that are well supported by solid linguistic theories to shed light on the strong and weak word relation representations identified by each embedding method. The analysis is handled by visualizing the feature vector in two-dimensional (2D) space. The feature vectors of the distributional theory-based word embedding method are plotted in 2D space using the t-sne algorithm, while the Wasf-Vec feature vectors are plotted directly in 2D space. A word\u2019s nearest neighbors and the distance-histograms of the plotted words are examined. For validation purpose of the word classification used in this article, the produced classes are employed in Class-based Language Modeling (CBLM). Wasf-Vec CBLM achieved a 7% lower perplexity (pp) than the distributional theory-based word embedding method CBLM. This result is significant when working with low-resource languages.","author":["Tiba Zaki Abdulhameed","Imed Zitouni","Ikhlas Abdel-Qader"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing","Volume 19","Issue 2","March 2020","Article No.: 22","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/3345517"],"date":"12 December 2019","ref":[{"text":"Tiba Zaki Abdulhameed, Imed Zitouni, and Ikhlas Abdel-Qader. 2018.

Most notably, Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) enables programmers to develop cloud applications as individual functions that can run and scale independently. Yet, due to the disaggregation of storage and compute resources in FaaS, applications that require fine-grained support for mutable state and synchronization, such as machine learning and scientific computing, are hard to build. In this work, we present Crucial, a system to program highly-concurrent stateful applications with serverless architectures. Its programming model keeps the simplicity of FaaS and allows to port effortlessly multi-threaded algorithms to this new environment. Crucial is built upon the key insight that FaaS resembles to concurrent programming at the scale of a data center. As a consequence, a distributed shared memory layer is the right answer to the need for fine-grained state management and coordination in serverless. We validate our system with the help of micro-benchmarks and various applications. In particular, we implement two common machine learning algorithms: k-means clustering and logistic regression. For both cases, Crucial obtains superior or comparable performance to an equivalent Spark cluster.","author":["Daniel Barcelona-Pons","Marc S\u00e1nchez-Artigas","Gerard Par\u00eds","Pierre Sutra","Pedro Garc\u00eda-L\u00f3pez"],"issue":["Middleware '19: Proceedings of the 20th International Middleware Conference","December 2019","Pages   41\u201354","https://doi.org/10.1145/3361525.3361535"],"date":"09 December 2019","ref":[{"text":"Istemi Ekin Akkus, Ruichuan Chen, Ivica Rimac, Manuel Stein, Klaus Satzke, Andre Beck, Paarijaat Aditya, and Volker Hilt. 2018.

Since Hinton proposed the concept of deep learning in 2006, the development of neural networks is getting faster and faster, and a variety of neural networks appear. Among them, RNN neural network and LSTM neural network are applied to all fields of our daily life for the property of well-processed time series. Therefore, we use LSTM neural network to construct our model, and optimize the model by Attention mechanism to establish an Attention-LSTM hydrological time series prediction model. The experimental results show that the Attention-LSTM model has better improvement in the mean square error and absolute error of the predicted values than the common LSTM model and the traditional BP model. And due to the introduction of the Attention mechanism, it can highlight the key factors to some extent. influences.The experimental results show that the Attention-LSTM model has the advantages of high prediction accuracy and small lag error, which is helpful for the application of deep learning algorithm in hydrological time series prediction.","author":["Yiran Li","Juan Yang"],"issue":["MLMI 2019: Proceedings of the 2019 2nd International Conference on Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence","September 2019","Pages   21\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/3366750.3366756"],"date":"18 September 2019","ref":[{"text":"Azzouni A, Pujolle G.

Word embeddings that can map the words to low-dimensional vector representations have been widely used in natural language processing tasks. But the word embeddings based on context such as Word2Vec and GloVe fail to capture the sentiment information. Most of existing sentiment analysis methods incorporate emotional polarity (positive and negative) to improve the sentiment embeddings for the emotion classification. This article takes advantage of an emotional psychology model to learn the emotional embeddings in Chinese first. In order to combine the semantic space and an emotional space, we present two different purifying models from local (LPM) and global (GPM) perspectives based on Plutchik's wheel of emotions to add the emotional information into word vectors. The two models aim to improve the word vectors so that not only the semantically similar words but also the sentimentally similar words can be closer than before. The Plutchik's wheel of emotions model can give eight-dimensional vector for one word in emotional space that can capture more sentiment information than the binary polarity labels. The obvious advantage of the local purifying model is that it can be fit for any pretrained word embeddings. For the global purifying model, we can get the final emotional embeddings at once. These models have been extended to handle English texts. The experimental results on Chinese and English datasets show that our purifying model can improve the conventional word embeddings and some proposed sentiment embeddings for sentiment classification and multi-emotion classification.","author":["Shuo Wang","Aishan Maoliniyazi","Xinle Wu","Xiaofeng Meng"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Internet Technology","Volume 20","Issue 2","May 2020","Article No.: 13","pp   1\u201317","https://doi.org/10.1145/3372152"],"date":"13 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"R.

It is a type of attack where certain types of hashes are misused as message authentication codes and allowing for inclusion of extra information. In this study, the researchers introduced an improved padding scheme and hashing process for SHA256 to address this problem. To prove that the modified hash function is cryptographically secure, statistical tests using Strict Avalanche Effect, Frequency Test (Monobit), Frequency Test within a Block, and Run Test were performed to evaluate the results of the Message Digest. Test results show that the number of ones and zeros in each element is distributed uniformly random in the final hash value. Additionally, runtime execution is much faster in generating the hash code since it has reduced the number of rounds to 32.","author":["Dan Michael A. Cortez","Ariel M. Sison","Ruji P.

First, we show that system level characterization of file block references is inadequate for maximizing buffer cache performance. We show that a finer-grained characterization approach is needed. Though application level characterization methods have been proposed, this is the first attempt, to the best of our knowledge, to consider file level characterizations. We propose an Application/File-level Characterization (AFC) scheme where we detect on-line the reference characteristics at the application level and then at the file level, if necessary. The results of this characterization are used to employ appropriate replacement policies in the buffer cache to maximize performance. The second contribution is in proposing an efficient and fair buffer allocation scheme. Application or file level resource management is infeasible unless there exists an allocation scheme that is efficient and fair. We propose the \u0394HIT allocation scheme that takes away a block from the application/file where the removal results in the smallest reduction in the number of expected buffer cache hits. Both the AFC and \u0394HIT schemes are on-line schemes that detect and allocate as applications execute. Experiments using trace-driven simulations show that substantial performance improvements can be made. For single application executions the hit ratio increased an average of 13 percentage points compared to the LRU policy, with a maximum increase of 59 percentage points, while for multiple application executions, the increase is an average of 12 percentage points, with a maximum of 32 percentage points for the workloads considered.","author":["Jongmoo Choi","Sam H.

The in-memory-computing schemes have shown distinct advantages and concerns when applying to different types of memory technologies, from conventional SRAM, DRAM to emerging ReRAM. Moreover, the next-generation smart edge systems are expected to support various intelligent applications by employing multi-task machine learning models which would be dynamically activated. To attain an efficient design within short design cycle, it is imperative to have an integrated design framework with automated tools to support hybrid memory systems and perform effective optimization across design stages. This work will introduce a unified framework which integrates EDA solutions to address the design and optimization challenges at different aspects of next-generation memory-centric designs, including fast reconfiguring in-memory/near-memory computing designs to provide optimized solutions (behavioral models and APR cell layouts) for designers to choose the best suitable architectures for their applications.","author":["Hung-Ming Chen","Chia-Lin Hu","Kang-Yu Chang","Alexandra K\u00fcster","Yu-Hsien Lin","Po-Shen Kuo","Wei-Tung Chao","Bo-Cheng Lai","Chien-Nan Liu","Shyh-Jye Jou"],"issue":["ICCAD '20: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2020","Article No.: 127","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3400302.3415772"],"date":"02 November 2020","ref":[{"text":"E.

MemSZ\u00a0introduces a low latency, parallel design of the Squeeze (SZ) algorithm offering aggressive compression ratios, up to 16:1 in our implementation. Our compressor is placed between the memory controller and the cache hierarchy of a processor to reduce the memory traffic of applications that tolerate approximations in parts of their data. Thereby, the available off-chip bandwidth is utilized more efficiently improving system performance and energy efficiency. Two alternative multi-core variants of the MemSZ\u00a0system are described. The first variant has a shared last-level cache (LLC) on the processor-die, which is modified to store both compressed and uncompressed data. The second has a 3D-stacked DRAM cache with larger cache lines that match the granularity of the compressed memory blocks and stores only uncompressed data. For applications that tolerate aggressive approximation in large fractions of their data, MemSZ\u00a0reduces baseline memory traffic by up to 81%, execution time by up to 62%, and energy costs by up to 25% introducing up to 1.8% error to the application output. Compared to the current state-of-the-art lossy memory compression design, MemSZ\u00a0improves the execution time, energy, and memory traffic by up to 15%, 9%, and 64%, respectively.","author":["Albin Eldst\u00e5l-Ahrens","Ioannis Sourdis"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 17","Issue 4","December 2020","Article No.: 40","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/3424668"],"date":"10 November 2020","ref":[{"text":"NVIDIA. 2015.

To resolve the preceding challenges, we first introduce a new Tibetan dependency analysis dataset, and then propose a neural-based framework that resolves the reliance on the expert knowledge issue by automatically extracting feature vectors of words and predicts their head words and type of dependency arcs. Specifically, we convert the words in the sentence into distributional vectors and employ a sequence to vector network to extract feature words. Furthermore, we introduce a head classifier and type classifier to predict the head word and type of dependency arc, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves promising performance on the Tibetan dependency analysis task.","author":["Bo An","Congjun Long"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing","Volume 20","Issue 2","April 2021","Article No.: 30","pp   1\u201316","https://doi.org/10.1145/3429456"],"date":"15 March 2021","ref":[{"text":"Daniel Andor, Chris Alberti, David J.

GLS combined with geographic forwarding allows the construction of ad hoc mobile networks that scale to a larger number of nodes than possible with previous work. GLS is decentralized and runs on the mobile nodes themselves, requiring no fixed infrastructure. Each mobile node periodically updates a small set of other nodes (its location servers) with its current location. A node sends its position updates to its location servers without knowing their actual identities, assisted by a predefined ordering of node identifiers and a predefined geographic hierarchy. Queries for a mobile node's location also use the predefined identifier ordering and spatial hierarchy to find a location server for that node.\nExperiments using the ns simulator for up to 600 mobile nodes show that the storage and bandwidth requirements of GLS grow slowly with the size of the network. Furthermore, GLS tolerates node failures well: each failure has only a limited effect and query performance degrades gracefully as nodes fail and restart. The query performance of GLS is also relatively insensitive to node speeds. Simple geographic forwarding combined with GLS compares favorably with Dynamic Source Routing (DSR): in larger networks (over 200 nodes) our approach delivers more packets, but consumes fewer network resources.","author":["Jinyang Li","John Jannotti","Douglas S.

It is similar to both Knuth's LR(k) algorithm and the familiar top-down algorithm. It has a time bound proportional to n3 (where n is the length of the string being parsed) in general; it has an n2 bound for unambiguous grammars; and it runs in linear time on a large class of grammars, which seems to include most practical context-free programming language grammars.

Described in this paper are a number of techniques that have been used to build a LISP system utilizing a drum for its principal storage medium, with a surprisingly low time penalty for use of this slow storage device. The techniques include careful segmentation of system programs, allocation of virtual memory to allow address arithmetic for type determination, and a special algorithm for building reasonably linearized lists. A scheme for binding variables is described which is good in this environment and allows for complete compatibility between compiled and interpreted programs with no special declarations.","author":["Daniel G.

Such wirelessly connected sensors are released in many diverse environments to perform various monitoring tasks. In many such tasks, location awareness is inherently one of the most essential system parameters. It is not only needed to report the origins of events, but also to assist group querying of sensors, routing, and to answer questions on the network coverage. In this paper we present a novel approach to the localization of sensors in an ad-hoc network. We describe a system called AHLoS (Ad-Hoc Localization System) that enables sensor nodes to discover their locations using a set distributed iterative algorithms. The operation of AHLoS is demonstrated with an accuracy of a few centimeters using our prototype testbed while scalability and performance are studied through simulation.","author":["Andreas Savvides","Chih-Chieh Han","Mani B.

By considering G as a relation, this graphical query language can be viewed as a relational query language, and its expressive power can be compared to that of other relational query languages. We do not propose G as an alternative to general purpose relational query languages, but rather as a complementary language in which recursive queries are simple to formulate. The user is aided in this formulation by means of a graphical interface. The provision of regular expressions in G allows recursive queries more general than transitive closure to be posed, although the language is not as powerful as those based on function-free Horn clauses.

In this paper we take a first step towards unifying the various theories of \u00ac1NF databases. We start by determining an appropriate model to couch our formalisms in. We then define an extended relational calculus as the theoretical basis for our \u00ac1NF database query language. We define a minimal extended relational algebra and prove its equivalence to the \u00ac1NF relational calculus. We define a class of \u00ac1NF relations with certain \u201cgood\u201d properties and extend our algebra operators to work within this domain.

Most existing algorithms cluster documents and words separately but not simultaneously. In this paper we present the novel idea of modeling the document collection as a bipartite graph between documents and words, using which the simultaneous clustering problem can be posed as a bipartite graph partitioning problem. To solve the partitioning problem, we use a new spectral co-clustering algorithm that uses the second left and right singular vectors of an appropriately scaled word-document matrix to yield good bipartitionings. The spectral algorithm enjoys some optimality properties; it can be shown that the singular vectors solve a real relaxation to the NP-complete graph bipartitioning problem. We present experimental results to verify that the resulting co-clustering algorithm works well in practice.","author":["Inderjit S.

Its key feature is the ability to perform computations in hardware to increase performance, while retaining much of the flexibility of a software solution. In this survey, we explore the hardware aspects of reconfigurable computing machines, from single chip architectures to multi-chip systems, including internal structures and external coupling. We also focus on the software that targets these machines, such as compilation tools that map high-level algorithms directly to the reconfigurable substrate. Finally, we consider the issues involved in run-time reconfigurable systems, which reuse the configurable hardware during program execution.","author":["Katherine Compton","Scott Hauck"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 34","Issue 2","June 2002","pp   171\u2013210","https://doi.org/10.1145/508352.508353"],"date":"01 June 2002","ref":[{"text":"Abouzeid, P., Babba, P., De Paulet, M.

Previous work, such as LRU-K and 2Q, attempts to enhance LRU capacity by making use of additional history information of previous block references other than only the recency information used in LRU. These algorithms greatly increase complexity and/or can not consistently provide performance improvement. Many recently proposed policies, such as UBM and SEQ, improve replacement performance by exploiting access regularities in references. They only address LRU problems on certain specific and well-defined cases such as access patterns like sequences and loops. Motivated by the limits of previous studies, we propose an efficient buffer cache replacement policy, called Low Inter-reference Recency Set (LIRS). LIRS effectively addresses the limits of LRU by using recency to evaluate Inter-Reference Recency (IRR) for making a replacement decision. This is in contrast to what LRU does: directly using recency to predict next reference timing. At the same time, LIRS almost retains the same simple assumption of LRU to predict future access behavior of blocks. Our objectives are to effectively address the limits of LRU for a general purpose, to retain the low overhead merit of LRU, and to outperform those replacement policies relying on the access regularity detections. Conducting simulations with a variety of traces and a wide range of cache sizes, we show that LIRS significantly outperforms LRU, and outperforms other existing replacement algorithms in most cases. Furthermore, we show that the additional cost for implementing LIRS is trivial in comparison with LRU.","author":["Song Jiang","Xiaodong Zhang"],"issue":["ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review","Volume 30","Issue 1","June 2002","pp   31\u201342","https://doi.org/10.1145/511399.511340"],"date":"01 June 2002","ref":[{"text":"L.

To yield more accurate search results, we propose computing a set of PageRank vectors, biased using a set of representative topics, to capture more accurately the notion of importance with respect to a particular topic. By using these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate query-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic PageRank vector. For ordinary keyword search queries, we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords.

A Monte Carlo technique computes the indirect contributions to illuminance at locations chosen by the rendering process. The indirect illuminance values are averaged over surfaces and used in place of a constant \"ambient\" term. Illuminance calculations are made only for those areas participating in the selected view, and the results are stored so that subsequent views can reuse common values. The density of the calculation is adjusted to maintain a constant accuracy, permitting less populated portions of the scene to be computed quickly. Successive reflections use proportionally fewer samples, which speeds the process and provides a natural limit to recursion. The technique can also model diffuse transmission and illumination from large area sources, such as the sky.","author":["Gregory J. Ward","Francis M. Rubinstein","Robert D.

These instructions are called SIMD instructions, since they apply a single instruction to multiple data elements. SIMD technology was initially built into commodity processors in order to accelerate the performance of multimedia applications. SIMD instructions provide new opportunities for database engine design and implementation. We study various kinds of operations in a database context, and show how the inner loop of the operations can be accelerated using SIMD instructions. The use of SIMD instructions has two immediate performance benefits: It allows a degree of parallelism, so that many operands can be processed at once. It also often leads to the elimination of conditional branch instructions, reducing branch mispredictions.We consider the most important database operations, including sequential scans, aggregation, index operations, and joins. We present techniques for implementing these using SIMD instructions. We show that there are significant benefits in redesigning traditional query processing algorithms so that they can make better use of SIMD technology. Our study shows that using a SIMD parallelism of four, the CPU time for the new algorithms is from 10% to more than four times less than for the traditional algorithms. Superlinear speedups are obtained as a result of the elimination of branch misprediction effects.","author":["Jingren Zhou","Kenneth A.

Several algorithms have been previously proposed to create more useful displays by controlling the aspect ratios of the rectangles that make up a treemap. While these algorithms do improve visibility of small items in a single layout, they introduce instability over time in the display of dynamically changing data, fail to preserve order of the underlying data, and create layouts that are difficult to visually search. In addition, continuous treemap algorithms are not suitable for displaying fixed-sized objects within them, such as images.This paper introduces a new \"strip\" treemap algorithm which addresses these shortcomings, and analyzes other \"pivot\" algorithms we recently developed showing the trade-offs between them. These ordered treemap algorithms ensure that items near each other in the given order will be near each other in the treemap layout. Using experimental evidence from Monte Carlo trials and from actual stock market data, we show that, compared to other layout algorithms, ordered treemaps are more stable, while maintaining relatively favorable aspect ratios of the constituent rectangles. A user study with 20 participants clarifies the human performance benefits of the new algorithms. Finally, we present quantum treemap algorithms, which modify the layout of the continuous treemap algorithms to generate rectangles that are integral multiples of an input object size. The quantum treemap algorithm has been applied to PhotoMesa, an application that supports browsing of large numbers of images.","author":["Benjamin B.

We argue that the current performance measures, and therefore design strategies, are incomplete as they do not consider transience of peers. The routers in application level multicast systems are participant clients, and not infrastructure units. As such, the assumptions on the behavior of these application routers are significantly different from the infrastructure routing units that traditional research has dealt with, especially in a peer-to-peer setting where peers are multi-use and the management is decentralized. we argue that the transience in peer behavior has implications on end-performance enabled.

We investigate the feasibility of applying link-based methods in new applications domains. The specific application we consider is to partition authors into opposite camps within a given topic in the context of newsgroups. A typical newsgroup posting consists of one or more quoted lines from another posting followed by the opinion of the author. This social behavior gives rise to a network in which the vertices are individuals and the links represent \"responded-to\" relationships. An interesting characteristic of many newsgroups is that people more frequently respond to a message when they disagree than when they agree. This behavior is in sharp contrast to the WWW link graph, where linkage is an indicator of agreement or common interest. By analyzing the graph structure of the responses, we are able to effectively classify people into opposite camps. In contrast, methods based on statistical analysis of text yield low accuracy on such datasets because the vocabulary used by the two sides tends to be largely identical, and many newsgroup postings consist of relatively few words of text.","author":["Rakesh Agrawal","Sridhar Rajagopalan","Ramakrishnan Srikant","Yirong Xu"],"issue":["WWW '03: Proceedings of the 12th international conference on World Wide Web","May 2003","Pages   529\u2013535","https://doi.org/10.1145/775152.775227"],"date":"20 May 2003","ref":[{"text":"R.

PDES has attracted a considerable amount of interest in recent years. From a pragmatic standpoint, this interest arises from the fact that large simulations in engineering, computer science, economics, and military applications, to mention a few, consume enormous amounts of time on sequential machines. From an academic point of view, parallel simulation is interesting because it represents a problem domain that often contains substantial amounts of parallelism (e.g., see [59]), yet paradoxically, is surprisingly difficult to parallelize in practice. A sufficiently general solution to the PDES problem may lead to new insights in parallel computation as a whole. Historically, the irregular, data-dependent nature of PDES programs has identified it as an application where vectorization techniques using supercomputer hardware provide little benefit [14].A discrete event simulation model assumes the system being simulated only changes state at discrete points in simulated time. The simulation model jumps from one state to another upon the occurrence of an event. For example, a simulator of a store-and-forward communication network might include state variables to indicate the length of message queues, the status of communication links (busy or idle), etc. Typical events might include arrival of a message at some node in the network, forwarding a message to another network node, component failures, etc.We are especially concerned with the simulation of asynchronous systems where events are not synchronized by a global clock, but rather, occur at irregular time intervals. For these systems, few simulator events occur at any single point in simulated time; therefore parallelization techniques based on lock-step execution using a global simulation clock perform poorly or require assumptions in the timing model that may compromise the fidelity of the simulation. Concurrent execution of events at different points in simulated time is required, but as we shall soon see, this introduces interesting synchronization problems that are at the heart of the PDES problem.This article deals with the execution of a simulation program on a parallel computer by decomposing the simulation application into a set of concurrently executing processes. For completeness, we conclude this section by mentioning other approaches to exploiting parallelism in simulation problems.Comfort and Shepard et al. have proposed using dedicated functional units to implement specific sequential simulation functions, (e.g., event list manipulation and random number generation [20, 23, 47]). This method can provide only a limited amount of speedup, however. Zhang, Zeigler, and Concepcion use the hierarchical decomposition of the simulation model to allow an event consisting of several subevents to be processed concurrently [21, 98]. A third alternative is to execute independent, sequential simulation programs on different processors [11, 39]. This replicated trials approach is useful if the simulation is largely stochastic and one is performing long simulation runs to reduce variance, or if one is attempting to simulate a specific simulation problem across a large number of different parameter settings. However, one drawback with this approach is that each processor must contain sufficient memory to hold the entire simulation. Furthermore, this approach is less suitable in a design environment where results of one experiment are used to determine the experiment that should be performed next because one must wait for a sequential execution to be completed before results are obtained.","author":["Richard M.

Evaluating such techniques, however, requires a thermal model that is practical for architectural studies.This paper describes HotSpot, an accurate yet fast model based on an equivalent circuit of thermal resistances and capacitances that correspond to microarchitecture blocks and essential aspects of the thermal package. Validation was performed using finite-element simulation. The paper also introduces several effective methods for dynamic thermal management (DTM): \"temperature-tracking\" frequency scaling, localized toggling, and migrating computation to spare hardware units. Modeling temperature at the microarchitecture level also shows that power metrics are poor predictors of temperature, and that sensor imprecision has a substantial impact on the performance of DTM.","author":["Kevin Skadron","Mircea R.

VDM is based on per-pixel processing, and with hardware acceleration it can render mesostructure with rich visual appearance in real time.","author":["Lifeng Wang","Xi Wang","Xin Tong","Stephen Lin","Shimin Hu","Baining Guo","Heung-Yeung Shum"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 22","Issue 3","July 2003","pp   334\u2013339","https://doi.org/10.1145/882262.882272"],"date":"01 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"BECKER, B.

It has recently been shown that it is possible to express a Steiner patch in an implicit equation which is a degree four polynomial in x,y,z. Furthermore, the parameters of a point known to be on the surface can be computed as rational polynomial functions of x,y,z. These findings lead to a straightforward algorithm for ray tracing Steiner patches in which the ray intersection equation is a degree four polynomial in the parameter of the ray. The algorithm presented represents a major simplification over existing techniques for ray tracing free-form surface patches.","author":["Thomas W. Sederberg","David C.

Current light reflection models used in computer graphics do not account for the object-to-object reflection between diffuse surfaces, and thus incorrectly compute the global illumination effects. The new procedure, based on methods used in thermal engineering, includes the effects of diffuse light sources of finite area, as well as the \u201ccolor-bleeding\u201d effects which are caused by the diffuse reflections. A simple environment is used to illustrate these simulated effects and is presented with photographs of a physical model. The procedure is applicable to environments composed of ideal diffuse reflectors and can account for direct illumination from a variety of light sources.

With a strong demand of high-capacity storage devices, the usages of flash memory quickly grow beyond their original designs. The very distinct characteristics of flash memory introduce serious challenges to engineers in resolving the quick degradation of system performance and the huge demand of main-memory space for flash-memory management when high-capacity flash memory is considered. Although some brute-force solutions could be taken, such as the enlarging of management granularity for flash memory, we showed that little advantage is received when system performance is considered. This paper proposes a flexible management scheme for large-scale flash-memory storage systems. The objective is to efficiently manage high-capacity flash-memory storage systems based on the behaviors of realistic access patterns. The proposed scheme could significantly reduce the main-memory usages without noticeable performance degradation.","author":["Li-Pin Chang","Tei-Wei Kuo"],"issue":["SAC '04: Proceedings of the 2004 ACM symposium on Applied computing","March 2004","Pages   862\u2013868","https://doi.org/10.1145/967900.968076"],"date":"14 March 2004","ref":[{"text":"A.

With rising energy costs and increasing power use due to the ever-growing demand for computing power (servers, storage, networks), electricity bills have become a significant expense for today's data centers. In the very near future, energy efficiency is expected to be one of the key purchasing arguments. Some performance organizations, such as SPEC, have developed power benchmarks for single servers (SPECpower_ssj2008), but so far, no benchmark exists that measures the power consumption of transaction processing systems. In this paper, we develop a power consumption model based on data readily available in the TPC-C full disclosure report of published benchmarks. We verify our model with measurements taken from three fully scaled and optimized TPC-C configurations including client (middle-tier) systems, database server, and storage subsystem. By applying this model to a subset of 7 years of TPC-C results, we identify the most power-intensive components and demonstrate the existing power consumption trends over time. Assuming similar trends in the future, the hardware enhancements alone will not be able to satisfy the demand for energy efficiency. In its outlook, this paper looks at potential hardware and software enhancements to meet the energy efficiency demands of future systems. Realizing the importance of energy efficiency, the Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC) has formed a working group to look into adding energy efficiency metrics to all its benchmarks. This paper is expected to complement this initiative.","author":["Meikel Poess","Raghunath Othayoth Nambiar"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 1","Issue 2","August 2008","pp   1229\u20131240","https://doi.org/10.14778/1454159.1454162"],"date":"01 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"2 Processor TPC-C results as of 1-Feb-2008: http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/results/tpcc_advanced_sort.asp?PRINTVER=false&FLTCOL1=tpcc.c_server_procs&FLTCOLOPR1=%3D&FLTCHO1=2&ADDFILTERROW=&filterRowCount=1&SRTCOL1=tpcc.c_tpmc&SRTDIR1=ASC&ADDSORTROW=&sortRowCount=1&DISPRES=100+PERCENT&include_withdrawn_results=none","order":1},{"text":"AMD Opteron family of processors: http://www.amd.com","order":2},{"text":"Barroso, Luiz Andr\u00e9. 2005.","doi":"10.1145/1095408.1095420","order":3},{"text":"Dimitris Economous, Suzanne Rivoire, Christos Kozyrakis, and Parthasarathy Ranganathan: Full-system Power Analysis and Modeling for Server Environments, Workshop on Modeling, Benchmarking, and Simulation (MoBS), June 2006","order":4},{"text":"Efficiency of Power Supplies in the Active Mode: http://www.efficientpowersupplies.org/","order":5},{"text":"Fan, Xiaobo, Wolf-Dietrich Weber, and Luiz Andr\u00e9 Barroso. 2007.

Existing studies have shown that the shared LLC is beneficial to concurrent query processes with commonly shared data sets. However, the shared LLC can also be a performance bottleneck to concurrent queries, each of which has private data structures, such as a hash table for the widely used hash join operator, causing serious cache conflicts. We show that cache conflicts on multi-core processors can significantly degrade overall database performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid system method called MCC-DB for accelerating executions of warehouse-style queries, which relies on the DBMS knowledge of data access patterns to minimize LLC conflicts in multi-core systems through an enhanced OS facility of cache partitioning. MCC-DB consists of three components: (1) a cacheaware query optimizer carefully selects query plans in order to balance the numbers of cache-sensitive and cache-insensitive plans; (2) a query execution scheduler makes decisions to co-run queries with an objective of minimizing LLC conflicts; and (3) an enhanced OS kernel facility partitions the shared LLC according to each query's cache capacity need and locality strength. We have implemented MCC-DB by patching the three components in PostgreSQL and Linux kernel. Our intensive measurements on an Intel multi-core system with warehouse-style queries show that MCC-DB can reduce query execution times by up to 33%.","author":["Rubao Lee","Xiaoning Ding","Feng Chen","Qingda Lu","Xiaodong Zhang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 2","Issue 1","August 2009","pp   373\u2013384","https://doi.org/10.14778/1687627.1687670"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"S.

Discovery of evolutionary communities in dynamic networks has become a critical task. The previous evolutionary clustering methods usually adopt the temporal smoothness framework, which has a desirable feature of controlling the balance between temporal noise and true concept drift of communities. They, however, have some major drawbacks: (1) assuming only a fixed number of communities over time; and (2) not allowing arbitrary start/stop of community over time. The forming of new communities and dissolving of existing communities are very common phenomena in real dynamic networks. In this paper, we propose a new particle-and-density based evolutionary clustering method that efficiently discovers a variable number of communities of arbitrary forming and dissolving. We first model a dynamic network as a collection of lots of particles called nano-communities, and a community as a densely connected subset of particles, called a quasi l-clique-by-clique (shortly, l-KK). Each particle contains a small amount of information about the evolution of data or patterns, and the quasi l-KKs inherent in a given dynamic network provide us with guidance on how to find a variable number of communities of arbitrary forming and dissolving. We propose a density-based clustering method that efficiently finds temporally smoothed local clusters of high quality by using a cost embedding technique and optimal modularity. We also propose a mapping method based on information theory that makes sequences of smoothed local clusters as close as possible to data-inherent quasi l-KKs. The result of the mapping method allows us to easily identify the stage of each community among the three stages: evolving, forming, and dissolving. Experimental studies, by using various data sets, demonstrate that our method improves the clustering accuracy, and at the same time, the time performance by an order of magnitude compared with the current state-of-the art method.","author":["Min-Soo Kim","Jiawei Han"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 2","Issue 1","August 2009","pp   622\u2013633","https://doi.org/10.14778/1687627.1687698"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"S.

Elasticity, pay-per-use, low upfront investment, low time to market, and transfer of risks are some of the major enabling features that make cloud computing a ubiquitous paradigm for deploying novel applications which were not economically feasible in a traditional enterprise infrastructure settings. This has seen a proliferation in the number of applications which leverage various cloud platforms, resulting in a tremendous increase in the scale of the data generated as well as consumed by such applications.

Due to the increasing number of users, OLTP systems require high throughput for executing tens of thousands of transactions in a short time period. Encouraged by the recent success of GPGPU (General-Purpose computation on Graphics Processors), we propose GPUTx, an OLTP engine performing high-throughput transaction executions on the GPU for in-memory databases. Compared with existing GPGPU studies usually optimizing a single task, transaction executions require handling many small tasks concurrently. Specifically, we propose the bulk execution model to group multiple transactions into a bulk and to execute the bulk on the GPU as a single task. The transactions within the bulk are executed concurrently on the GPU. We study three basic execution strategies (one with locks and the other two lock-free), and optimize them with the GPU features including the hardware support of atomic operations, the massive thread parallelism and the SPMD (Single Program Multiple Data) execution. We evaluate GPUTx on a recent NVIDIA GPU in comparison with its counterpart on a quad-core CPU. Our experimental results show that optimizations on GPUTx significantly improve the throughput, and the optimized GPUTx achieves 4-10 times higher throughput than its CPU-based counterpart on public transaction processing benchmarks.","author":["Bingsheng He","Jeffrey Xu Yu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 4","Issue 5","February 2011","pp   314\u2013325","https://doi.org/10.14778/1952376.1952381"],"date":"01 February 2011","ref":[{"text":"N.

MTurk tasks for processing datasets with humans are currently designed with significant reimplementation of common workflows and ad-hoc selection of parameters such as price to pay per task. We describe how we have integrated crowds into a declarative workflow engine called Qurk to reduce the burden on workflow designers. In this paper, we focus on how to use humans to compare items for sorting and joining data, two of the most common operations in DBMSs. We describe our basic query interface and the user interface of the tasks we post to MTurk. We also propose a number of optimizations, including task batching, replacing pairwise comparisons with numerical ratings, and pre-filtering tables before joining them, which dramatically reduce the overall cost of running sorts and joins on the crowd. In an experiment joining two sets of images, we reduce the overall cost from $67 in a naive implementation to about $3, without substantially affecting accuracy or latency. In an end-to-end experiment, we reduced cost by a factor of 14.5.","author":["Adam Marcus","Eugene Wu","David Karger","Samuel Madden","Robert Miller"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 5","Issue 1","September 2011","pp   13\u201324","https://doi.org/10.14778/2047485.2047487"],"date":"01 September 2011","ref":[{"text":"M.

Not only analysts need to focus on cohesive subgraphs to study patterns among social actors, but also normal users are interested in discovering what happening in their neighborhood. However, effectively storing large scale social network and efficiently identifying cohesive subgraphs is challenging. In this work we introduce a novel subgraph concept to capture the cohesion in social interactions, and propose an I/O efficient approach to discover cohesive subgraphs.Besides, we propose an analytic system which allows users to perform intuitive, visual browsing on large scale social networks. Our system stores the network as a social graph in the graph database, retrieves a local cohesive subgraph based on the input keywords, and then hierarchically visualizes the subgraph out on orbital layout, in which more important social actors are located in the center. By summarizing textual interactions between social actors as tag cloud, we provide a way to quickly locate active social communities and their interactions in a unified view.","author":["Feng Zhao","Anthony K.

We will demonstrate diverse workloads, including extract-transform-load MapReduce jobs, iterative machine learning algorithms, and ad-hoc declarative query processing. At its core, REEF builds atop YARN (Apache Hadoop 2's resource manager) to provide retainable hardware resources with lifetimes that are decoupled from those of computational tasks. This allows us to build persistent (cross-job) caches and cluster-wide services, but, more importantly, supports high-performance iterative graph processing and machine learning algorithms.Unlike existing systems, REEF aims for composability of jobs across computational models, providing significant performance and usability gains, even with legacy code. REEF includes a library of interoperable data management primitives optimized for communication and data movement (which are distinct from storage locality). The library also allows REEF applications to access external services, such as user-facing relational databases.We were careful to decouple lower levels of REEF from the data models and semantics of systems built atop it. The result was two new standalone systems: Tang, a configuration manager and dependency injector, and Wake, a state-of-the-art event-driven programming and data movement framework. Both are language independent, allowing REEF to bridge the JVM and .NET.","author":["Byung-Gon Chun","Tyson Condie","Carlo Curino","Chris Douglas","Sergiy Matusevych","Brandon Myers","Shravan Narayanamurthy","Raghu Ramakrishnan","Sriram Rao","Josh Rosen","Russell Sears","Markus Weimer"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 12","August 2013","pp   1370\u20131373","https://doi.org/10.14778/2536274.2536318"],"date":"01 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"Ananthanarayanan, Ganesh, Ghodsi, Ali, Wang, Andrew, Borthakur, Dhruba, Kandula, Srikanth, Shenker, Scott, and Stoica, Ion.

Examples include the personalized results, related searches, similarity search, popular and relaxed queries. In this work we introduce a novel query paradigm that considers a user query as an example of the data in which the user is interested. We call these queries exemplar queries and claim that they can play an important role in dealing with the information deluge. We provide a formal specification of the semantics of such queries and show that they are fundamentally different from notions like queries by example, approximate and related queries. We provide an implementation of these semantics for graph-based data and present an exact solution with a number of optimizations that improve performance without compromising the quality of the answers. We also provide an approximate solution that prunes the search space and achieves considerably better time-performance with minimal or no impact on effectiveness. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of these solutions with synthetic and real datasets, and illustrate the usefulness of exemplar queries in practice.","author":["Davide Mottin","Matteo Lissandrini","Yannis Velegrakis","Themis Palpanas"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 5","Janary 2014","pp   365\u2013376","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732269.2732273"],"date":"01 January 2014","ref":[{"text":"R.

And how can we tell which accounts belong to liberal, conservative or centrist users? Often, we can answer such questions and label nodes in a network based on the labels of their neighbors and appropriate assumptions of homophily (\"birds of a feather flock together\") or heterophily (\"opposites attract\"). One of the most widely used methods for this kind of inference is Belief Propagation (BP) which iteratively propagates the information from a few nodes with explicit labels throughout a network until convergence. A well-known problem with BP, however, is that there are no known exact guarantees of convergence in graphs with loops.This paper introduces Linearized Belief Propagation (LinBP), a linearization of BP that allows a closed-form solution via intuitive matrix equations and, thus, comes with exact convergence guarantees. It handles homophily, heterophily, and more general cases that arise in multi-class settings. Plus, it allows a compact implementation in SQL. The paper also introduces Single-pass Belief Propagation (SBP), a localized (or \"myopic\") version of LinBP that propagates information across every edge at most once and for which the final class assignments depend only on the nearest labeled neighbors. In addition, SBP allows fast incremental updates in dynamic networks. Our runtime experiments show that LinBP and SBP are orders of magnitude faster than standard BP, while leading to almost identical node labels.","author":["Wolfgang Gatterbauer","Stephan G\u00fcnnemann","Danai Koutra","Christos Faloutsos"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 5","January 2015","pp   581\u2013592","https://doi.org/10.14778/2735479.2735490"],"date":"01 January 2015","ref":[{"text":"M.

In addition, many OLTP workloads are heavily skewed to \"hot\" tuples or ranges of tuples. For example, the majority of NYSE volume involves only 40 stocks. To deal with such fluctuations, an OLTP DBMS needs to be elastic; that is, it must be able to expand and contract resources in response to load fluctuations and dynamically balance load as hot tuples vary over time.This paper presents E-Store, an elastic partitioning framework for distributed OLTP DBMSs. It automatically scales resources in response to demand spikes, periodic events, and gradual changes in an application's workload. E-Store addresses localized bottlenecks through a two-tier data placement strategy: cold data is distributed in large chunks, while smaller ranges of hot tuples are assigned explicitly to individual nodes. This is in contrast to traditional single-tier hash and range partitioning strategies. Our experimental evaluation of E-Store shows the viability of our approach and its efficacy under variations in load across a cluster of machines. Compared to single-tier approaches, E-Store improves throughput by up to 130% while reducing latency by 80%.","author":["Rebecca Taft","Essam Mansour","Marco Serafini","Jennie Duggan","Aaron J.

We propose a new approach that relies on endogenous signals, namely, the correctness of factual information provided by the source. A source that has few false facts is considered to be trustworthy.The facts are automatically extracted from each source by information extraction methods commonly used to construct knowledge bases. We propose a way to distinguish errors made in the extraction process from factual errors in the web source per se, by using joint inference in a novel multi-layer probabilistic model.We call the trustworthiness score we computed Knowledge-Based Trust (KBT). On synthetic data, we show that our method can reliably compute the true trustworthiness levels of the sources. We then apply it to a database of 2.8B facts extracted from the web, and thereby estimate the trustworthiness of 119M webpages. Manual evaluation of a subset of the results confirms the effectiveness of the method.","author":["Xin Luna Dong","Evgeniy Gabrilovich","Kevin Murphy","Van Dang","Wilko Horn","Camillo Lugaresi","Shaohua Sun","Wei Zhang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 9","May 2015","pp   938\u2013949","https://doi.org/10.14778/2777598.2777603"],"date":"01 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"J.

These systems are commonly built under the assumption that the network is the primary bottleneck and should be avoided at all costs, but this assumption no longer holds. For instance, with InfiniBand FDR 4\u00d7, the bandwidth available to transfer data across the network is in the same ballpark as the bandwidth of one memory channel. Moreover, RDMA transfer latencies continue to rapidly improve as well. In this paper, we first argue that traditional distributed DBMS architectures cannot take full advantage of high-performance networks and suggest a new architecture to address this problem. Then, we discuss initial results from a prototype implementation of our proposed architecture for OLTP and OLAP, showing remarkable performance improvements over existing designs.","author":["Carsten Binnig","Andrew Crotty","Alex Galakatos","Tim Kraska","Erfan Zamanian"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 9","Issue 7","March 2016","pp   528\u2013539","https://doi.org/10.14778/2904483.2904485"],"date":"01 March 2016","ref":[{"text":"www.jedec.org/standards-documents/docs/jesd-79-3d.","order":1},{"text":"http://snowflake.net/product/architecture.","order":2},{"text":"Delivering Application Performance with Oracles InfiniBand Tech. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/networking/documentation/o12-020-1653901.pdf, 2012.","order":3},{"text":"Shared Memory Communications over RDMA. http://ibm.com/software/network/commserver/SMCR/, 2013.","order":4},{"text":"Intel Data Direct I/O Technology. http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/io/direct-data-i-o.html, 2014.","order":5},{"text":"I.

Thus, the ever-increasing size of RDF data collections raises the need for scalable distributed approaches. We endorse the usage of existing infrastructures for Big Data processing like Hadoop for this purpose. Yet, SPARQL query performance is a major challenge as Hadoop is not intentionally designed for RDF processing. Existing approaches often favor certain query pattern shapes while performance drops significantly for other shapes. In this paper, we introduce a novel relational partitioning schema for RDF data called ExtVP that uses a semi-join based preprocessing, akin to the concept of Join Indices in relational databases, to efficiently minimize query input size regardless of its pattern shape and diameter. Our prototype system S2RDF is built on top of Spark and uses SQL to execute SPARQL queries over ExtVP. We demonstrate its superior performance in comparison to state of the art SPARQL-on-Hadoop approaches.","author":["Alexander Sch\u00e4tzle","Martin Przyjaciel-Zablocki","Simon Skilevic","Georg Lausen"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 9","Issue 10","June 2016","pp   804\u2013815","https://doi.org/10.14778/2977797.2977806"],"date":"01 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"D.

While rumours can have severe real-world implications, their detection is notoriously hard: Content on social platforms is short and lacks semantics; it spreads quickly through a dynamically evolving network; and without considering the context of content, it may be impossible to arrive at a truthful interpretation. Traditional approaches to rumour detection, however, exploit solely a single content modality, e.g., social media posts, which limits their detection accuracy. In this paper, we cope with the aforementioned challenges by means of a multi-modal approach to rumour detection that identifies anomalies in both, the entities (e.g., users, posts, and hashtags) of a social platform and their relations. Based on local anomalies, we show how to detect rumours at the network level, following a graph-based scan approach. In addition, we propose incremental methods, which enable us to detect rumours using streaming data of social platforms. We illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach with a real-world dataset of 4M tweets with more than 1000 rumours.","author":["Nguyen Thanh Tam","Matthias Weidlich","Bolong Zheng","Hongzhi Yin","Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung","Bela Stantic"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 12","Issue 9","May 2019","pp   1016\u20131029","https://doi.org/10.14778/3329772.3329778"],"date":"01 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"http://docs.spinn3r.com/.","order":1},{"text":"https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/21/facebook-rates-user-trustworthiness/.","order":2},{"text":"https://www.networkworld.com/article/2235277/data-center/data-center-fact-checking-the-fact-checkers-snopes-com-gets-an-a.html.","order":3},{"text":"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/las-vegas-shooting-rumors-hoaxes-and-conspiracy-theories/.","order":4},{"text":"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-aid-puerto-rico/.","order":5},{"text":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17763886/facebook-trust-ratings-fake-news-reporting-score.","order":6},{"text":"http://tiny.cc/las-vegas-shooting.","order":7},{"text":"http://tiny.cc/p1s2qy.","order":8},{"text":"E. \u00c1lvarez-Miranda, I.

Researchers are developing systems for effectively and efficiently analyzing visual data at scale. A significant challenge that these systems encounter lies in the drift in real-world visual data. For instance, a model for self-driving vehicles that is not trained on images containing snow does not work well when it encounters them in practice. This drift phenomenon limits the accuracy of models employed for visual data analytics.In this paper, we present a visual data analytics system, called Odin, that automatically detects and recovers from drift. Odin uses adversarial autoencoders to learn the distribution of high-dimensional images. We present an unsupervised algorithm for detecting drift by comparing the distributions of the given data against that of previously seen data. When Odin detects drift, it invokes a drift recovery algorithm to deploy specialized models tailored towards the novel data points. These specialized models outperform their non-specialized counterpart on accuracy, performance, and memory footprint. Lastly, we present a model selection algorithm for picking an ensemble of best-fit specialized models to process a given input. We evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of Odin on high-resolution dashboard camera videos captured under diverse environments from the Berkeley DeepDrive dataset. We demonstrate that Odin's models deliver 6X higher throughput, 2X higher accuracy, and 6X smaller memory footprint compared to a baseline system without automated drift detection and recovery.","author":["Abhijit Suprem","Joy Arulraj","Calton Pu","Joao Ferreira"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 13","Issue 12","August 2020","pp   2453\u20132465","https://doi.org/10.14778/3407790.3407837"],"date":"01 July 2020","ref":[{"text":"P.

To answer this need, we have developed a representation framework comprised of an abstract model for a variety of different annotation types (e.g., morpho-syntactic tagging, syntactic annotation, co-reference annotation, etc.), which can be instantiated in different ways depending on the annotator s approach and goals. In this paper we provide an overview of our representation framework and demonstrate its applicability to syntactic annotation. We show how the framework can contribute to comparative evaluation and merging of parser output and diverse syntactic annotation schemes.","author":["Nancy Ide","Laurent Romary"],"issue":["ACL '01: Proceedings of the 39th Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics","July 2001","Pages   306\u2013313","https://doi.org/10.3115/1073012.1073052"],"date":"06 July 2001","ref":[{"text":"Anne Abeill (ed.), forthcoming.

HBG incorporates lexical, syntactic, semantic, and structural information from the parse tree into the disambiguation process in a novel way. We use a corpus of bracketed sentences, called a Treebank, in combination with decision tree building to tease out the relevant aspects of a parse tree that will determine the correct parse of a sentence. This stands in contrast to the usual approach of further grammar tailoring via the usual linguistic introspection in the hope of generating the correct parse. In head-to-head tests against one of the best existing robust probabilistic parsing models, which we call P-CFG, the HBG model significantly outperforms P-CFG, increasing the parsing accuracy rate from 60% to 75%, a 37% reduction in error.","author":["Ezra Black","Fred Jelinek","John Lafferty","David M.

The theme of the research is to vindicate the stand that- if morphology is strong and harnessable, then lack of training corpora is not debilitating. We establish a methodology of POS tagging which the resource disadvantaged (lacking annotated corpora) languages can make use of. The methodology makes use of locally annotated modestly-sized corpora (15,562 words), exhaustive morpohological analysis backed by high-coverage lexicon and a decision tree based learning algorithm (CN2). The evaluation of the system was done with 4-fold cross validation of the corpora in the news domain (www.bbc.co.uk/hindi). The current accuracy of POS tagging is 93.45% and can be further improved.","author":["Smriti Singh","Kuhoo Gupta","Manish Shrivastava","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"issue":["COLING-ACL '06: Proceedings of the COLING/ACL on Main conference poster sessions","July 2006","Pages   779\u2013786"],"date":"17 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"A.

We compute and merge two partitionings of word graphs: one based on context similarity of high frequency words, another on log-likelihood statistics for words of lower frequencies. Using the resulting word clusters as a lexicon, a Viterbi POS tagger is trained, which is refined by a morphological component. The approach is evaluated on three different languages by measuring agreement with existing taggers.","author":["Chris Biemann"],"issue":["COLING ACL '06: Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on computational Linguistics and 44th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Student Research Workshop","July 2006","Pages   7\u201312"],"date":"20 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"C.
