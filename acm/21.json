[{"_id":"10.1145/1008992.1009051","title":"An automatic weighting scheme for collaborative filtering","abstract":"Collaborative filtering identifies information interest of a particular user based on the information provided by other similar users. The memory-based approaches for collaborative filtering (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient approach) identify the similarity between two users by comparing their ratings on a set of items. In these approaches, different items are weighted either equally or by some predefined functions. The impact of rating discrepancies among different users has not been taken into consideration. For example, an item that is highly favored by most users should have a smaller impact on the user-similarity than an item for which different types of users tend to give different ratings. Even though simple weighting methods such as variance weighting try to address this problem, empirical studies have shown that they are ineffective in improving the performance of collaborative filtering. In this paper, we present an optimization algorithm to automatically compute the weights for different items based on their ratings from training users. More specifically, the new weighting scheme will create a clustered distribution for user vectors in the item space by bringing users of similar interests closer and separating users of different interests more distant. Empirical studies over two datasets have shown that our new weighting scheme substantially improves the performance of the Pearson correlation coefficient method for collaborative filtering.","author":["Rong Jin","Joyce Y.

This is difficult because most high-performance named entity recognition systems operate by sequentially classifying words as to whether or not they participate in an entity name; however, the most useful similarity measures score entire candidate names. To correct this mismatch we formalize a semi-Markov extraction process, which is based on sequentially classifying segments of several adjacent words, rather than single words. In addition to allowing a natural way of coupling high-performance NER methods and high-performance similarity functions, this formalism also allows the direct use of other useful entity-level features, and provides a more natural formulation of the NER problem than sequential word classification. Experiments in multiple domains show that the new model can substantially improve extraction performance over previous methods for using external dictionaries in NER.","author":["William W.

We present a compiler and runtime system that abstracts and virtualizes many aspects of graphics hardware. In addition, we present an analysis of the effectiveness of the GPU as a compute engine compared to the CPU, to determine when the GPU can outperform the CPU for a particular algorithm. We evaluate our system with five applications, the SAXPY and SGEMV BLAS operators, image segmentation, FFT, and ray tracing. For these applications, we demonstrate that our Brook implementations perform comparably to hand-written GPU code and up to seven times faster than their CPU counterparts.","author":["Ian Buck","Tim Foley","Daniel Horn","Jeremy Sugerman","Kayvon Fatahalian","Mike Houston","Pat Hanrahan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 23","Issue 3","August 2004","pp   777\u2013786","https://doi.org/10.1145/1015706.1015800"],"date":"01 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"ATI, 2004.

However, passively monitoring the memory traffic can be far from being effective as idle periods between consecutive memory accesses are often too short for existing power-management techniques to take full advantage of the deeper power-saving state implemented in modern DRAM architectures. In this paper, we propose a new technique that will actively reshape the memory traffic to coalesce short idle periods --- which were previously unusable for power management --- into longer ones, thus enabling existing techniques to effectively exploit idleness in the memory","author":["Hai Huang","Kang G.

In particular, if all the files are small, the disk block size should be small, too, to avoid wasting too large a fraction of the disk. On the other hand, if files are generally large, choosing a large block size is good since it leads to more efficient transfers. Only by knowing the file size distribution can reasonable choices be made. In 1984, we published the file size distribution for a university computer science department. We have now made the same measurements 20 years later to see how file sizes have changed. In short, the median file size has more than doubled (from 1080 bytes to 2475 bytes), but large files still dominate the storage requirements.","author":["Andrew S. Tanenbaum","Jorrit N.

We are motivated to make these measurements to enable system designers to make better informed hoices between these two media and to give insight to FPGA makers on the deficiencies to attack and thereby improve FPGAs. In the paper, we describe the methodology by which the measurements were obtained and we show that, for circuits containing only combinational logic and flip-flops, the ratio of silicon area required to implement them in FPGAs and ASICs is on average 40. Modern FPGAs also contain \"hard\" blocks such as multiplier/accumulators and block memories and we find that these blocks reduce this average area gap significantly to as little as 21. The ratio of critical path delay, from FPGA to ASIC, is roughly 3 to 4, with less influence from block memory and hard multipliers. The dynamic power onsumption ratio is approximately 12 times and, with hard blocks, this gap generally becomes smaller.","author":["Ian Kuon","Jonathan Rose"],"issue":["FPGA '06: Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/SIGDA 14th international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2006","Pages   21\u201330","https://doi.org/10.1145/1117201.1117205"],"date":"22 February 2006","ref":[{"text":"Altera Corporation.

Automation is changing the nature of these laboratories, and there is a long-running debate about the value of hands-on versus simulated laboratories. In addition, the introduction of remote laboratories adds a third category to the debate. Through a review of the literature related to these labs in education, the authors draw several conclusions about the state of current research. The debate over different technologies is confounded by the use of different educational objectives as criteria for judging the laboratories: Hands-on advocates emphasize design skills, while remote lab advocates focus on conceptual understanding. We observe that the boundaries among the three labs are blurred in the sense that most laboratories are mediated by computers, and that the psychology of presence may be as important as technology.

However, most of the existing behavior-level scheduling heuristics either have a limited efficiency in a specific class of applications or lack general support of various design constraints.In this paper we describe a new scheduler that converts a rich set of scheduling constraints into a system of difference constraints (SDC) and performs a variety of powerful optimizations under a unified mathematical programming framework. In particular, we show that our SDC-based scheduling algorithm can efficiently support resource constraints, frequency constraints, latency constraints, and relative timing constraints, and effectively optimize longest path latency, expected overall latency, and the slack distribution. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed technique provides efficient solutions for a broader range of applications with higher quality of results (in terms of system performance) when compared to the state-of-the-art scheduling heuristics.","author":["Jason Cong","Zhiru Zhang"],"issue":["DAC '06: Proceedings of the 43rd annual Design Automation Conference","July 2006","Pages   433\u2013438","https://doi.org/10.1145/1146909.1147025"],"date":"24 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"Altera Website. http://www.altera.com.","order":1},{"text":"S.

However, such disaster scenarios pose an interesting design challenge since the sensor nodes used to collect and communicate data may themselves fail suddenly and unpredictably, resulting in the loss of valuable data. Furthermore, because these networks are often expected to be deployed in response to a disaster, or because of sudden configuration changes due to failure, these networks are often expected to operate in a \"zero-configuration\" paradigm, where data collection and transmission must be initiated immediately, before the nodes have a chance to assess the current network topology. In this paper, we design and analyze techniques to increase \"persistence\" of sensed data, so that data is more likely to reach a data sink, even as network nodes fail. This is done by replicating data compactly at neighboring nodes using novel \"Growth Codes\" that increase in efficiency as data accumulates at the sink. We show that Growth Codes preserve more data in the presence of node failures than previously proposed erasure resilient techniques.","author":["Abhinav Kamra","Vishal Misra","Jon Feldman","Dan Rubenstein"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 36","Issue 4","October 2006","pp   255\u2013266","https://doi.org/10.1145/1151659.1159943"],"date":"11 August 2006","ref":[{"text":"Crossbow micaz motes.","order":1},{"text":"TinyOS Homepage.","order":2},{"text":"S.

Such systems must evenly distribute data and workload to efficiently utilize available resources and maximize system performance, while facilitating system growth and managing hardware failures. We have developed CRUSH, a scalable pseudorandom data distribution function designed for distributed object-based storage systems that efficiently maps data objects to storage devices without relying on a central directory. Because large systems are inherently dynamic, CRUSH is designed to facilitate the addition and removal of storage while minimizing unnecessary data movement. The algorithm accommodates a wide variety of data replication and reliability mechanisms and distributes data in terms of user-defined policies that enforce separation of replicas across failure domains.","author":["Sage A.

It examines the performance of HPC architectures using kernels with various memory access patterns of well known computational kernels. Consequently, HPCC results bound the performance of real applications as a function of memory access characteristics and define performance boundaries of HPC architectures. The suite was intended to augment the TOP500 list and by now the results are publicly available for 6 out of 10 of the world's fastest computers. Implementations exist in most of the major high-end programming languages and environments, accompanied by countless optimization efforts. The increased publicity enjoyed by HPCC doesn't necessarily translate into deeper understanding of the performance issues that HPCC benchmarks. And so this tutorial will introduce attendees to HPCC, provide tools to examine differences in HPC architectures, and give hands-on training that will hopefully lead to better understanding of parallel environments.","author":["Piotr R Luszczek","David H Bailey","Jack J Dongarra","Jeremy Kepner","Robert F Lucas","Rolf Rabenseifner","Daisuke Takahashi"],"issue":["SC '06: Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/IEEE conference on Supercomputing","November 2006","Pages   213\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.1145/1188455.1188677"],"date":"11 November 2006"},{"_id":"10.1145/121133.121164","doi":"10.1145/121133.121164","title":"Measurements of a distributed file system","abstract":"We analyzed the user-level file access patterns and caching behavior of the Sprite distributed file system. The first part of our analysis repeated a study done in 1985 of the: BSD UNIX file system. We found that file throughput has increased by a factor of 20 to an average of 8 Kbytes per second per active user over 10-minute intervals, and that the use of process migration for load sharing increased burst rates by another factor of six. Also, many more very large (multi-megabyte) files are in use today than in 1985. The second part of our analysis measured the behavior of Sprite's main-memory file caches. Client-level caches average about 7 Mbytes in size (about one-quarter to one-third of main memory) and filter out about 50% of the traffic between clients and servers. 35% of the remaining server traffic is caused by paging, even on workstations with large memories. We found that client cache consistency is needed to prevent stale data errors, but that it is not invoked often enough to degrade overall system performance.","author":["Mary G. Baker","John H.

Exploiting data reuse opportunities in the application, we can reduce this energy by making copies of frequently used data in a small local memory and replacing speed- and power-inefficient transfers from main off-chip memory by more efficient local data transfers. In this article we present an automated approach for analyzing these opportunities in a program that allows modification of the program to use custom scratch-pad memory configurations comprising a hierarchical set of buffers for local storage of frequently reused data. Using our approach we are able to both reduce energy consumption of the memory subsystem when using a scratch-pad memory by about a factor of two, on average, and improve memory system performance compared to a cache of the same size.","author":["Ilya Issenin","Erik Brockmeyer","Miguel Miranda","Nikil Dutt"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 12","Issue 2","April 2007","pp   15\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.1145/1230800.1230807"],"date":"01 April 2007","ref":[{"text":"Avissar, O., Barua, R., and Stewart, D. 2002.

Digital library resources provided the content base for human experts to construct a domain competency model for earthquakes and plate tectonics encoded as a knowledge map. The experts then assessed student essays using comparisons against the constructed domain competency model and prepared personalized instruction plans using the competency model and digital library resources. The results from this study indicate that domain competency models generated from select digital library resources may provide the desired degree of content coverage to support both automated diagnosis and personalized instruction in the context of nationally-recognized science learning goals.

Versioning file systems protect data from accidents by transparently retaining old versions, but do less well in protecting data from malicious attack. These systems remain vulnerable to attackers who gain unauthorized access to prune old file versions, who bypass the file system to directly manipulate storage, or who exploit bugs in any part of the operating system.This paper presents VDisk, a secure, block-level versioning system that adds file-grain versioning to a standard, unmodified file system. VDisk consists of a set of untrusted user-mode tools and a trusted, secure kernel that is implemented within an isolated Xen virtual machine domain. The secure kernel is designed to be simple and thus trustworthy. This kernel logs file-system updates to a secure log, exports a read-only view of the log to the rest of the system and securely removes unwanted versions from the log. Secure cleaning is implemented in a two-level manner. An untrusted, user-mode cleaner selects log entries for reclamation and submits cleaning requests to the trusted VDisk kernel along with a proof that the request satisifies the device's version-retention policy. The secure kernel verifies the proof and updates the log.","author":["Jake Wires","Michael J.

A wide range of biologically interesting phenomena, however, occur over time scales on the order of a millisecond--about three orders of magnitude beyond the duration of the longest current MD simulations.In this paper, we describe a massively parallel machine called Anton, which should be capable of executing millisecond-scale classical MD simulations of such biomolecular systems. The machine, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2008, is based on 512 identical MD-specific ASICs that interact in a tightly coupled manner using a specialized high-speed communication network. Anton has been designed to use both novel parallel algorithms and special-purpose logic to dramatically accelerate those calculations that dominate the time required for a typical MD simulation. The remainder of the simulation algorithm is executed by a programmable portion of each chip that achieves a substantial degree of parallelism while preserving the flexibility necessary to accommodate anticipated advances in physical models and simulation methods.","author":["David E.

The problem is worse in large-scale shared memory systems, where remote memory latencies are hundreds, and soon thousands, of processor cycles. To mitigate this problem, we propose the use of Active Memory Operations (AMOs), in which select operations can be sent to and executed on the home memory controller of data. AMOs can eliminate significant number of coherence messages, minimize intranode and internode memory traffic, and create opportunities for parallelism. Our implementation of AMOs is cache-coherent and requires no changes to the processor core or DRAM chips. In this paper we present architectural and programming models for AMOs, and compare its performance to that of several other memory architectures on a variety of scientific and commercial benchmarks. Through simulation we show that AMOs offer dramatic performance improvements for an important set of data-intensive operations, e.g., up to 50X faster barriers, 12X faster spinlocks, 8.5X-15X faster stream/array operations, and 3X faster database queries. Based on a standard cell implementation, we predict that the circuitry required to support AMOs is less than 1% of the typical chip area of a high performance microprocessor.","author":["Zhen Fang","Lixin Zhang","John B.

The robust Schmitt trigger based memory cell exhibits built in process variation tolerance that gives tight SNM distribution across the process corners. It utilizes fully differential operation and hence does not require any architectural changes from the present 6T architecture. At iso-area and iso-read-failure probability the proposed memory bitcell operates at a lower (175mV) VDD with 18% reduction in leakage and 50% reduction in read/write power compared to the conventional 6T cell.

The use of Web spam is widespread and difficult to solve, mostly due to the large size of the Web which means that, in practice, many algorithms are infeasible.We perform a statistical analysis of a large collection of Web pages. In particular, we compute statistics of the links in the vicinity of every Web page applying rank propagation and probabilistic counting over the entire Web graph in a scalable way. These statistical features are used to build Web spam classifiers which only consider the link structure of the Web, regardless of page contents. We then present a study of the performance of each of the classifiers alone, as well as their combined performance, by testing them over a large collection of Web link spam. After tenfold cross-validation, our best classifiers have a performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art spam classifiers that use content attributes, but are orthogonal to content-based methods.","author":["Luca Becchetti","Carlos Castillo","Debora Donato","Ricardo Baeza-YATES","Stefano Leonardi"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on the Web","Volume 2","Issue 1","February 2008","Article No.: 2","pp   1\u201342","https://doi.org/10.1145/1326561.1326563"],"date":"03 March 2008","ref":[{"text":"Alon, N., Matias, Y., and Szegedy, M. 1999.

High-performance implementations use multiple levels of tiling to exploit the hierarchy of parallelism and cache/register locality. Efficient generation of multi-level tiled code is essential for effective use of multi-level tiling. Parameterized tiled code, where tile sizes are not fixed but left as symbolic parameters can enable several dynamic and run-time optimizations. Previous solutions to multi-level tiled loop generation are limited to the case where tile sizes are fixed at compile time. We present an algorithm that can generate multi-level parameterized tiled loops at the same cost as generating single-level tiled loops. The efficiency of our method is demonstrated on several benchmarks. We also present a method-useful in register tiling-for separating partial and full tiles at any arbitrary level of tiling. The code generator we have implemented is available as an open source tool.","author":["DaeGon Kim","Lakshminarayanan Renganarayanan","Dave Rostron","Sanjay Rajopadhye","Michelle Mills Strout"],"issue":["SC '07: Proceedings of the 2007 ACM/IEEE conference on Supercomputing","November 2007","Article No.: 51","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/1362622.1362691"],"date":"10 November 2007","ref":[{"text":"S.

To understand the underlying characteristics of large graphs, graph summarization techniques are critical. However, existing graph summarization methods are mostly statistical (studying statistics such as degree distributions, hop-plots and clustering coefficients). These statistical methods are very useful, but the resolutions of the summaries are hard to control. In this paper, we introduce two database-style operations to summarize graphs. Like the OLAP-style aggregation methods that allow users to drill-down or roll-up to control the resolution of summarization, our methods provide an analogous functionality for large graph datasets. The first operation, called SNAP, produces a summary graph by grouping nodes based on user-selected node attributes and relationships. The second operation, called k-SNAP, further allows users to control the resolutions of summaries and provides the \"drill-down\" and \"roll-up\" abilities to navigate through summaries with different resolutions. We propose an efficient algorithm to evaluate the SNAP operation. In addition, we prove that the k-SNAP computation is NP-complete. We propose two heuristic methods to approximate the k-SNAP results. Through extensive experiments on a variety of real and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.","author":["Yuanyuan Tian","Richard A.

In case of application domains such as streaming multimedia and real-time systems, a deterministic read/write access time is desired during design time. We propose a novel NAND flash translation layer called GFTL that guarantees fixed upper bounds (i.e., worst case service rates) for reads and writes that are comparable to a theoretical ideal case. Such guarantees are made possible by eliminating sources of non-determinism in GFTL design and using partial block cleaning. GFTL performs garbage collection in partial steps by dividing the garbage collection of a single block into several chunks, thereby interleaving and hiding the garbage collection latency while servicing requests. Further, GFTL guarantees are independent of flash utilization, size or state. Along with theoretical bounds, benchmark results show the efficacy of our approach. Based on our experiments, GFTL requires an additional 16% of total blocks for flash management. GFTL service guarantees can be calculated from flash specifications. Thus, with GFTL, a designer can determine the service guarantees and size requirements apriori, during design time.","author":["Siddharth Choudhuri","Tony Givargis"],"issue":["CODES+ISSS '08: Proceedings of the 6th IEEE/ACM/IFIP international conference on Hardware/Software codesign and system synthesis","October 2008","Pages   19\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/1450135.1450141"],"date":"19 October 2008","ref":[{"text":"New techniques for real-time fat filesystem in mobile multi media devices.

Virtually all large systems which evaluate images require the registration of images, or a closely related operation, as an intermediate step. Specific examples of systems where image registration is a significant component include matching a target with a real-time image of a scene for target recognition, monitoring global land usage using satellite images, matching stereo images to recover shape for autonomous navigation, and aligning images from different medical modalities for diagnosis.Over the years, a broad range of techniques has been developed for various types of data and problems.  These techniques have been independently studied for several different applications, resulting in a large body of research. This paper organizes this material by establishing the relationship between the variations in the images and the type of registration techniques which can most appropriately be applied. Three major types of variations are distinguished. The first type are the variations due to the differences in acquisition which cause the images to be misaligned. To register images, a spatial transformation is found which will remove these variations. The class of transformations which must be searched to find the optimal transformation is determined by knowledge about the variations of this type. The transformation class in turn influences the general technique that should be taken. The second type of variations are those which are also due to differences in acquisition, but cannot be modeled easily such as lighting and atmospheric conditions. This type usually effects intensity values, but they may also be spatial, such as perspective distortions. The third type of variations are differences in the images that are of interest such as object movements, growths, or other scene changes. Variations of the second and third type are not directly removed by registration, but they make registration more difficult since an exact match is no longer possible. In particular, it is critical that variations of the third type are not removed. Knowledge about the characteristics of each type of variation effect the choice of feature space, similarity measure, search space,  and search strategy which will make up the final technique. All registration techniques can be viewed as different combinations of these choices. This framework is useful for understanding the merits and relationships between the wide variety of existing techniques and for assisting in the selection of the most suitable technique for a specific problem.","author":["Lisa Gottesfeld Brown"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 24","Issue 4","Dec. 1992","pp   325\u2013376","https://doi.org/10.1145/146370.146374"],"date":"01 December 1992","ref":[{"text":"ALLINEY, S., AND MORANDI, C. 1986.

Thus, efficient algorithms for accessing and manipulating large sets and sequences will be required to provide acceptable performance. The advent of object-oriented and extensible database systems will not solve this problem. On the contrary, modern data models exacerbate the problem: In order to manipulate large sets of complex objects as efficiently as today's database systems manipulate simple records, query-processing algorithms and software will become more complex, and a solid understanding of algorithm and architectural issues is essential for the designer of database management software.This survey provides a foundation for the design and implementation of query execution facilities in new database management systems. It describes a wide array of practical query evaluation techniques for both relational and postrelational database systems, including iterative execution of complex query evaluation plans, the duality of sort- and hash-based set-matching algorithms, types of parallel query execution and their implementation, and special operators for emerging database application domains.","author":["Goetz Graefe"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 25","Issue 2","June 1993","pp   73\u2013169","https://doi.org/10.1145/152610.152611"],"date":"01 June 1993","ref":[{"text":"ADAM, N.

The integration of MRAM in FPGAs allows the logic circuit to rapidly configure the algorithm, the routing and logic functions, and easily realize the Runtime Reconfiguration (RTR) and multicontext configuration. However, the conventional MRAM technology based on the Field Induced Magnetic Switching (FIMS) writing approach consumes very high power, large circuit surfaces, and produces high disturbance between memory cells. These drawbacks prevent FIMS-MRAM\u2019s further development in memory and logic circuit. Thermally Assisted Switching (TAS)-based MRAM is then evaluated to address these issues. In this article, some design techniques, novel computing architecture, and logic components for FPGA logic circuits based on TAS-MRAM technology are presented. By using STMicroelectronics CMOS 90nm technology and a complete TAS-MTJ spice model, some chip characteristic results such as the programming latency (~25ns) and power dissipation (~124pJ) have been calculated or simulated to demonstrate the expected performance of TAS-MRAM-based FPGA logic circuits.","author":["Weisheng Zhao","Eric Belhaire","Claude Chappert","Bernard Dieny","Guillaume Prenat"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 2","Issue 2","June 2009","Article No.: 8","pp   1\u201319","https://doi.org/10.1145/1534916.1534918"],"date":"01 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"1992.","order":1},{"text":"2007.

When ISLs are tiled across a parallel architecture, there are usually halo regions that need to be updated and exchanged among different processing elements (PEs). In addition, synchronization is often used to signal the completion of halo exchanges. Both communication and synchronization may incur significant overhead on parallel architectures with shared memory. This is especially true in the case of graphics processors (GPUs), which do not preserve the state of the per-core L1 storage across global synchronizations. To reduce these overheads, ghost zones can be created to replicate stencil operations, reducing communication and synchronization costs at the expense of redundantly computing some values on multiple PEs. However, the selection of the optimal ghost zone size depends on the characteristics of both the architecture and the application, and it has only been studied for message-passing systems in a grid environment. To automate this process on shared memory systems, we establish a performance model using NVIDIA's Tesla architecture as a case study and propose a framework that uses the performance model to automatically select the ghost zone size that performs best and generate appropriate code. The modeling is validated by four diverse ISL applications, for which the predicted ghost zone configurations are able to achieve a speedup no less than 98% of the optimal speedup.","author":["Jiayuan Meng","Kevin Skadron"],"issue":["ICS '09: Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on Supercomputing","June 2009","Pages   256\u2013265","https://doi.org/10.1145/1542275.1542313"],"date":"08 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"G.

Even if the location and nature of hard errors are known a priori, either at manufacture-time or in the field, cores with such errors must be disabled in the absence of hard-error tolerance. While caches, with their regular and repetitive structures, are easily covered against hard errors by providing spare arrays or spare lines, structures within a core are neither as regular nor as repetitive. Previous work has proposed microarchitectural core salvaging to exploit structural redundancy within a core and maintain functionality in the presence of hard errors. Unfortunately microarchitectural salvaging introduces complexity and may provide only limited coverage of core area against hard errors due to a lack of natural redundancy in the core. This paper makes a case for architectural core salvaging. We observe that even if some individual cores cannot execute certain operations, a CPU die can be instruction-set-architecture (ISA) compliant, that is execute all of the instructions required by its ISA, by exploiting natural cross-core redundancy. We propose using hardware to migrate offending threads to another core that can execute the operation. Architectural core salvaging can cover a large core area against faults, and be implemented by leveraging known techniques that minimize changes to the microarchitecture. We show it is possible to optimize architectural core salvaging such that the performance on a faulty die approaches that of a fault-free die--assuring significantly better performance than core disabling for many workloads and no worse performance than core disabling for the remainder.","author":["Michael D.

The first is a package of Fortran subroutines that perform a variety of arithmetic operations and transcendental functions on floating point numbers of arbitrarily high precision. This package is in some cases over 200 times faster than that of certain other packages that have been developed for this purpose.The second utility is a translator program, which facilitates the conversion of ordinary Fortran programs to use this package. By means of source directives (special comments) in the original Fortran program, the user declares the precision level and specifies which variables in each subprogram are to be treated as multiprecision. The translator program reads this source program and outputs a  program with the appropriate multiprecision subroutine calls.This translator supports multiprecision integer, real, and complex datatypes. The required array space for multiprecision data types is automatically allocated. In the evaluation of computational expressions, all of the usual conventions for operator precedence and mixed mode operations are upheld. Furthermore, most of the Fortran-77 intrinsics, such as ABS, MOD, NINT, COS, EXP are supported and produce true multiprecision values.","author":["David H.

Unfortunately, magnetic disks are ill-suited for the small sequential write pattern of synchronous logging. Alternative solutions (e.g., backup servers or sophisticated battery-backed write caches in high-end disk arrays) are either expensive or complicated. In this paper, we exploit flash devices for synchronous logging based on the observation that flash devices support small sequential writes well. Comparing a wide variety of flash devices, we find that USB flash drives are a good match for this task because of its unique characteristics: widely available USB ports, hot-plug capability useful for coping with flash wear, and low price so that multiple drives are affordable. We propose FlashLogging, a logging solution that exploits multiple (USB) flash drives for synchronous logging. We identify and address four challenges: (i) efficiently exploiting multiple flash drives for logging; (ii) coping with the large variance of write latencies because of device erasure operations; (iii) efficient recovery processing; and (iv) combining flash drives and disks for better logging and recovery performance. We implemented our solution within MySQL-InnoDB. Our real machine experiments running online transaction processing workloads (TPCC) show that FlashLogging achieves up to 5.7X improvements over magnetic-disk-based logging, and obtains up to 98.6% of the ideal performance. We further compare our design with one that uses Solid-State Drives (SSDs), and find that although SSDs improve logging performance, multiple USB flash drives can achieve comparable or better performance with much lower price.","author":["Shimin Chen"],"issue":["SIGMOD '09: Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data","June 2009","Pages   73\u201386","https://doi.org/10.1145/1559845.1559855"],"date":"29 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"T.

Where existing schemes reboot an entire node on an error, Neutron's compiler and runtime extensions divide programs into recovery units and reboot only the faulting unit. The TinyOS kernel itself is a recovery unit: a kernel safety violation appears to applications as the processor being unavailable for 10-20 milliseconds. Neutron further minimizes safety violation cost by supporting \"precious\" state that persists across reboots. Application data, time synchronization state, and routing tables can all be declared as precious. Neutron's reboot sequence conservatively checks that precious state is not the source of a fault before preserving it. Together, recovery units and precious state allow Neutron to reduce a safety violation's cost to time synchronization by 94% and to a routing protocol by 99.5%. Neutron also protects applications from losing data. Neutron provides this recovery on the very limited resources of a tiny, low-power microcontroller.","author":["Yang Chen","Omprakash Gnawali","Maria Kazandjieva","Philip Levis","John Regehr"],"issue":["SOSP '09: Proceedings of the ACM SIGOPS 22nd symposium on Operating systems principles","October 2009","Pages   235\u2013246","https://doi.org/10.1145/1629575.1629598"],"date":"11 October 2009","ref":[{"text":"Atmel, Inc.

Many applications insulate themselves from failures by checkpointing. For many applications, checkpointing into a shared single file is most convenient. With such an approach, the size of writes are often small and not aligned with file system boundaries. Unfortunately for these applications, this preferred data layout results in pathologically poor performance from the underlying file system which is optimized for large, aligned writes to non-shared files. To address this fundamental mismatch, we have developed a virtual parallel log structured file system, PLFS. PLFS remaps an application's preferred data layout into one which is optimized for the underlying file system. Through testing on PanFS, Lustre, and GPFS, we have seen that this layer of indirection and reorganization can reduce checkpoint time by an order of magnitude for several important benchmarks and real applications without any application modification.","author":["John Bent","Garth Gibson","Gary Grider","Ben McClelland","Paul Nowoczynski","James Nunez","Milo Polte","Meghan Wingate"],"issue":["SC '09: Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Computing Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2009","Article No.: 21","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/1654059.1654081"],"date":"14 November 2009","ref":[{"text":"FUSE: Filesystem in Userspace. http://fuse.sourceforge.net/.","order":1},{"text":"The HDF Group. http://www.hdfgroup.org/.","order":2},{"text":"Top 500 Supercomputer Sites. http://www.top500.org/.","order":3},{"text":"Apple Inc.

Current hard disk drive (HDD) checkpointing results in overhead of 25% or more at the petascale. With a direct correlation between checkpoint frequencies and node counts, novel techniques that can take more frequent checkpoints with minimum overhead are critical to implement a reliable exascale system. In this work, we leverage the upcoming Phase-Change Random Access Memory (PCRAM) technology and propose a hybrid local/global checkpointing mechanism after a thorough analysis of MPP systems failure rates and failure sources. We propose three variants of PCRAM-based hybrid checkpointing schemes, DIMM+HDD, DIMM+DIMM, and 3D+3D, to reduce the checkpoint overhead and offer a smooth transition from the conventional pure HDD checkpoint to the ideal 3D PCRAM mechanism. The proposed pure 3D PCRAM-based mechanism can ultimately take checkpoints with overhead less than 4% on a projected exascale system.","author":["Xiangyu Dong","Naveen Muralimanohar","Norm Jouppi","Richard Kaufmann","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["SC '09: Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Computing Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2009","Article No.: 57","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/1654059.1654117"],"date":"14 November 2009","ref":[{"text":"D.

Today they appear in the product lines of most major computer manufacturers. This article gives a comprehensive overview of disk arrays and provides a framework in which to organize current and future work. First, the article introduces disk technology and reviews the driving forces that have popularized disk arrays: performance and reliability. It discusses the two architectural techniques used in disk arrays: striping across multiple disks to improve performance and redundancy to improve reliability. Next, the article describes seven disk array architectures, called RAID (Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks) levels 0\u20136 and compares their  performance, cost, and reliability. It goes on to discuss advanced research and implementation topics such as refining the basic RAID levels to improve performance and designing algorithms to maintain data consistency. Last, the article describes six disk array prototypes of products and discusses future opportunities for research, with an annotated bibliography disk array-related literature.","author":["Peter M.

In particular, the bit error rate (BER) of an SSD climbs as it receives more writes. As a result, RAID arrays composed from SSDs are subject to correlated failures. By balancing writes evenly across the array, RAID schemes can wear out devices at similar times. When a device in the array fails towards the end of its lifetime, the high BER of the remaining devices can result in data loss. We propose Diff-RAID, a parity-based redundancy solution that creates an age differential in an array of SSDs. Diff-RAID distributes parity blocks unevenly across the array, leveraging their higher update rate to age devices at different rates. To maintain this age differential when old devices are replaced by new ones, Diff-RAID reshuffles the parity distribution on each drive replacement. We evaluate Diff-RAID's reliability by using real BER data from 12 flash chips on a simulator and show that it is more reliable than RAID-5, in some cases by multiple orders of magnitude. We also evaluate Diff-RAID's performance using a software implementation on a 5-device array of 80 GB Intel X25-M SSDs and show that it offers a trade-off between throughput and reliability.","author":["Mahesh Balakrishnan","Asim Kadav","Vijayan Prabhakaran","Dahlia Malkhi"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 6","Issue 2","July 2010","Article No.: 4","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/1807060.1807061"],"date":"30 July 2010","ref":[{"text":"Andersen, D.

This paper explores the sources of these performance and energy overheads in general-purpose processing systems by quantifying the overheads of a 720p HD H.264 encoder running on a general-purpose CMP system. It then explores methods to eliminate these overheads by transforming the CPU into a specialized system for H.264 encoding. We evaluate the gains from customizations useful to broad classes of algorithms, such as SIMD units, as well as those specific to particular computation, such as customized storage and functional units.The ASIC is 500x more energy efficient than our original four-processor CMP. Broadly applicable optimizations improve performance by 10x and energy by 7x. However, the very low energy costs of actual core ops (100s fJ in 90nm) mean that over 90% of the energy used in these solutions is still \"overhead\". Achieving ASIC-like performance and efficiency requires algorithm-specific optimizations. For each sub-algorithm of H.264, we create a large, specialized functional unit that is capable of executing 100s of operations per instruction. This improves performance and energy by an additional 25x and the final customized CMP matches an ASIC solution's performance within 3x of its energy and within comparable area.","author":["Rehan Hameed","Wajahat Qadeer","Megan Wachs","Omid Azizi","Alex Solomatnikov","Benjamin C.

We also synchronize wash-droplet routing with sample/reagent droplet-routing steps by controlling the arrival order of droplets at cross-contamination sites.

The traditional techniques of processing such information by first storing them in databases and then manipulating and serving them through large computers are becoming too expensive. These complex large systems have a high acquisition cost, but in addition, suffer also from high running costs, especially in power consumption. Both these costs can be contained by recognizing that there is a precision implied by traditional computing that is not needed in the processing of most new types of data. The relaxation of precision can help in the wider exploitation of known energy-efficient modes of computing like throughput computing. More important, such relaxation provides us an opportunity to deploy in the processing of this vast new data the same low-power, low-cost technology that was used to generate the data in the first place. Such energy-efficient circuits suffer from greater unreliability and variability in performance when used in the high-throughput mode, but these problems can be addressed by changing the way we design such systems, changing the nature of the algorithms for such systems, and by modifying the expectation of the quality of results produced by such systems. We have called this the approximate computing paradigm. There are two sources of imperfection in approximate computing. The first arises from imperfect execution of an algorithm. The second arises from imperfection in the data stream itself. All these imperfections could potentially be rectified through the use of expensive techniques such as redundancy, conservative design, or conservative device operating range. The goal of approximate computing, however, is to combat these sources of imperfection inexpensively and in an energy-efficient manner while producing results that may be different, yet acceptable. Computing models that achieve this goal have to address both the detection and the correction of such imperfections. The detection of such imperfections can be done either by the user observing and reacting to a wrong result, by the algorithm expecting a range of correct results, or by the run-time monitoring of the execution of the system. The correction of system behavior can be done either by attempting a different algorithm, by patching the code, or by repeating the execution. We will argue in this talk that future systems will need to combine all these techniques and integrate new ones into a single dynamically optimized system that employs feedback from the user to guide the high-level choice of energy-efficient algorithms, and that employs prediction based on past experience to guide the low-level energy-efficient execution of the system. This has a tantalizing similarity to some models of functioning of a remarkably efficient approximate computing appliance we all know -- the human brain.","author":["Ravi Nair"],"issue":["ISLPED '10: Proceedings of the 16th ACM/IEEE international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2010","Pages   359\u2013360","https://doi.org/10.1145/1840845.1840921"],"date":"18 August 2010","ref":[{"text":"R.

The underlying type theory is a \u03bb-calculus equipped with refinement types for expressing pre- and post-conditions within first-order logic. We derive formal cryptographic primitives and represent active adversaries within the type theory. Well-typed programs enjoy assertion-based security properties, with respect to a realistic threat model including key compromise. The implementation amounts to an enhanced typechecker for the general-purpose functional language F#; typechecking generates verification conditions that are passed to an SMT solver. We describe a series of checked examples. This is the first tool to verify authentication properties of cryptographic protocols by typechecking their source code.","author":["Jesper Bengtson","Karthikeyan Bhargavan","C\u00e9dric Fournet","Andrew D.

A new architecture that allows dynamic deployment of different TM functions is presented. By considering the processing requirements of operations such as policing and congestion, queuing, shaping, and scheduling, a solution has been derived that is scalable with a consistent programmable interface. Programmability is achieved using a function computation unit which determines the action (e.g., drop, queue, remark, forward) based on the packet attribute information and a memory storage part.

Suppose we have a data matrix, which is the superposition of a low-rank component and a sparse component. Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the \u21131 norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces.","author":["Emmanuel J.

Traditional EL methods usually link name mentions in a document by assuming them to be independent. However, there is often additional interdependence between different EL decisions, i.e., the entities in the same document should be semantically related to each other. In these cases, Collective Entity Linking, in which the name mentions in the same document are linked jointly by exploiting the interdependence between them, can improve the entity linking accuracy. This paper proposes a graph-based collective EL method, which can model and exploit the global interdependence between different EL decisions. Specifically, we first propose a graph-based representation, called Referent Graph, which can model the global interdependence between different EL decisions. Then we propose a collective inference algorithm, which can jointly infer the referent entities of all name mentions by exploiting the interdependence captured in Referent Graph. The key benefit of our method comes from: 1) The global interdependence model of EL decisions; 2) The purely collective nature of the inference algorithm, in which evidence for related EL decisions can be reinforced into high-probability decisions. Experimental results show that our method can achieve significant performance improvement over the traditional EL methods.","author":["Xianpei Han","Le Sun","Jun Zhao"],"issue":["SIGIR '11: Proceedings of the 34th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in Information Retrieval","July 2011","Pages   765\u2013774","https://doi.org/10.1145/2009916.2010019"],"date":"24 July 2011","ref":[{"text":"Adafre, S.

This information is valuable for music recommendation. However, there are two main challenges to exploit this rich social media information: (a) There are many different types of objects and relations in music social communities, which makes it difficult to develop a unified framework taking into account all objects and relations. (b) In these communities, some relations are much more sophisticated than pairwise relation, and thus cannot be simply modeled by a graph. We propose a novel music recommendation algorithm by using both multiple kinds of social media information and music acoustic-based content. Instead of graph, we use hypergraph to model the various objects and relations, and consider music recommendation as a ranking problem on this hypergraph. While an edge of an ordinary graph connects only two objects, a hyperedge represents a set of objects. In this way, hypergraph can be naturally used to model high-order relations.","author":["Shulong Tan","Jiajun Bu","Chun Chen","Bin Xu","Can Wang","Xiaofei He"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications","Volume 7S","Issue 1","October 2011","Article No.: 22","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/2037676.2037679"],"date":"04 November 2011","ref":[{"text":"Adomavicius, G. and Tuzhilin, A. 2005.

The demand of specific areas follows strong diurnal patterns with high peak to valley ratios that result in poor average utilization across a day. In this paper, we show how to rescue unutilized bandwidth across multiple datacenters and backbone networks and use it for non-real-time applications, such as backups, propagation of bulky updates, and migration of data. Achieving the above is non-trivial since leftover bandwidth appears at different times, for different durations, and at different places in the world.For this purpose, we have designed, implemented, and validated NetStitcher, a system that employs a network of storage nodes to stitch together unutilized bandwidth, whenever and wherever it exists. It gathers information about leftover resources, uses a store-and-forward algorithm to schedule data transfers, and adapts to resource fluctuations.We have compared NetStitcher with other bulk transfer mechanisms using both a testbed and a live deployment on a real CDN. Our testbed evaluation shows that NetStitcher outperforms all other mechanisms and can rescue up to five times additional datacenter bandwidth thus making it a valuable tool for datacenter providers. Our live CDN deployment demonstrates that our solution can perform large data transfers at a much lower cost than naive end-to-end or store-and-forward schemes.","author":["Nikolaos Laoutaris","Michael Sirivianos","Xiaoyuan Yang","Pablo Rodriguez"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 41","Issue 4","August 2011","pp   74\u201385","https://doi.org/10.1145/2043164.2018446"],"date":"15 August 2011","ref":[{"text":"Amazon Simple Storage Service. aws.amazon.com/s3/.","order":1},{"text":"Datacenter map. www.datacentermap.com/datacenters.html.","order":2},{"text":"Equinix datacenter map. www.equinix.com/data-center-locations/map/.","order":3},{"text":"Facebook Statistics. www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics.","order":4},{"text":"James Hamilton's blog: Inter-datacenter replication & geo-redundancy. perspectives.mvdirona.com/2010/05/10/InterDatacenterReplicationGeoRedundancy.aspx.","order":5},{"text":"Personal communication.","order":6},{"text":"Riverbed Products & Services. http://www.riverbed.com/us/products/index.php.","order":7},{"text":"Signiant Products. www.signiant.com/Products-content-distribution-management/.","order":8},{"text":"Telefonica International Wholesale Services Network Map. http://www.e-mergia.com/en/mapaRed.html.","order":9},{"text":"Forrester Research.

Compared to MLC-only solutions, the former exploits fast and short random writes while the latter brings large capacity. On the whole, one achieves an overall tangible performance improvement for a moderate extra cost. Yet, device lifetime is an important aspect often overlooked. In this paper, we show how a dynamic SLC-MLC scheme provides significant lifetime improvement (up to 10 times) at no cost compared to any classic static SLC-MLC partitioning based on any state of the art Flash Translation Layer policy.","author":["Xavier Jimenez","David Novo","Paolo Ienne"],"issue":["DAC '12: Proceedings of the 49th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2012","Pages   229\u2013234","https://doi.org/10.1145/2228360.2228404"],"date":"03 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"(2011, Oct.)

This paper introduces a framework to model on-chip DRAM accesses and analyzes performance, power, and temperature tradeoffs of 3D systems. We propose a runtime optimization policy to maximize performance while maintaining power and thermal constraints. Our policy dynamically monitors workload behavior and selects among low-power and turbo operating modes accordingly. Experiments with multithreaded workloads demonstrate up to 49% energy efficiency improvements compared to existing thermal management policies.","author":["Jie Meng","Katsutoshi Kawakami","Ayse K.

While traditional network file systems rely on a central server machine, a serverless system utilizes workstations cooperating as peers to provide all file system services. Any machine in the system can store, cache, or control any block of data. Our approach uses this location independence, in combination with fast local area networks, to provide better performance and scalability than traditional file systems. Furthermore, because any machine in the system can assume the responsibilities of a failed component, our serverless design also provides high availability via redundatn data storage. To demonstrate our approach, we have implemented a prototype serverless network file system called xFS. Preliminary performance measurements suggest that our architecture achieves its goal of scalability. For instance, in a 32-node xFS system with 32 active clients, each client receives nearly as much read or write throughput as it would see if it were the only active client.","author":["Thomas E.

In this article, we present a class of universal switch modules. Each of our switch modules has 6Wswitches and switch-module flexibility three (i.e, Fs=3). We prove that no switch module with less than 6W switches can be universal. We also compare our switch modules with those used in the Xilinx XC4000 family FPGAs and the antisymmetric switch modules (with  FS=3) suggested by Rose and Brown [1991]. Although these two kinds of switch modules also have FS=3 and 6W switches, we show that they are not universal. Based on combinatorial counting techniques, we show that each of our universal switch modules can accommodate up to 25% more routing instances, compared with the XC4000-type switch module of the same size. Experimental results demonstrate that our universal switch modules improve routability at the chip level. Finally, our work also provides a theoretical insight into the important observation by Rose and Brown [1991] (based on extensive experiments) that FS=3 is often sufficient to provide high  routability.","author":["Yao-Wen Chang","D.

Our key observation is that certain locations in an indoor environment present identifiable signatures on one or more sensing dimensions. An elevator, for instance, imposes a distinct pattern on a smartphone's accelerometer; a corridor-corner may overhear a unique set of WiFi access points; a specific spot may experience an unusual magnetic fluctuation. We hypothesize that these kind of signatures naturally exist in the environment, and can be envisioned as internal landmarks of a building. Mobile devices that \"sense\" these landmarks can recalibrate their locations, while dead-reckoning schemes can track them between landmarks. Results from 3 different indoor settings, including a shopping mall, demonstrate median location errors of 1:69m. War-driving is not necessary, neither are floorplans the system simultaneously computes the locations of users and landmarks, in a manner that they converge reasonably quickly. We believe this is an unconventional approach to indoor localization, holding promise for real-world deployment.","author":["He Wang","Souvik Sen","Ahmed Elgohary","Moustafa Farid","Moustafa Youssef","Romit Roy Choudhury"],"issue":["MobiSys '12: Proceedings of the 10th international conference on Mobile systems, applications, and services","June 2012","Pages   197\u2013210","https://doi.org/10.1145/2307636.2307655"],"date":"25 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"V.

It is easy to focus on a narrow aspect of one's field and lose track of the big picture. Information overload is indeed a major challenge for scientists today, and is especially daunting for new investigators attempting to master a discipline and scientists who seek to cross disciplinary borders. In this paper, we propose metrics of influence, coverage and connectivity for scientific literature. We use these metrics to create structured summaries of information, which we call metro maps. Most importantly, metro maps explicitly show the relations between papers in a way which captures developments in the field. Pilot user studies demonstrate that our method helps researchers acquire new knowledge efficiently: map users achieved better precision and recall scores and found more seminal papers while performing fewer searches.","author":["Dafna Shahaf","Carlos Guestrin","Eric Horvitz"],"issue":["KDD '12: Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2012","Pages   1122\u20131130","https://doi.org/10.1145/2339530.2339706"],"date":"12 August 2012","ref":[{"text":"Allan, J., Gupta, R., and Khandelwal, V.

We propose a large-scale data mining approach to learning word-word relatedness, where known pairs of related words impose constraints on the learning process. We learn for each word a low-dimensional representation, which strives to maximize the likelihood of a word given the contexts in which it appears. Our method, called CLEAR, is shown to significantly outperform previously published approaches. The proposed method is based on first principles, and is generic enough to exploit diverse types of text corpora, while having the flexibility to impose constraints on the derived word similarities. We also make publicly available a new labeled dataset for evaluating word relatedness algorithms, which we believe to be the largest such dataset to date.","author":["Guy Halawi","Gideon Dror","Evgeniy Gabrilovich","Yehuda Koren"],"issue":["KDD '12: Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2012","Pages   1406\u20131414","https://doi.org/10.1145/2339530.2339751"],"date":"12 August 2012","ref":[{"text":"M.

It focuses on the design of search tasks assigned in such studies. Based on a review of past studies, a set of task characteristics associated with exploratory search tasks are identified: exploratory search tasks focus on learning and investigative search goals; they are general (rather than specific), open-ended, and often target multiple items/documents; they involve uncertainty and are motivated by ill-defined or ill-structured problems; they are dynamic and evolve over time; they are multi-faceted and may be procedurally complex; and they are often accompanied by other information or cognitive behaviors, such as sensemaking.

In this paper, an alternative is put forth. First, a definition is given of what it is for two programs or program parts to be equivalent for all observers; then two program parts are said to be observation congruent if they are, in all program contexts, equivalent. The behavior of a program part, that is, its meaning, is defined to be its observation congruence class.The paper demonstrates, for a sequence of simple languages expressing finite (terminating) behaviors, that in each case observation congruence can be axiomatized algebraically. Moreover, with the addition of recursion and another simple extension, the algebraic language described here becomes a calculus for writing and specifying concurrent programs and for proving their properties.","author":["Matthew Hennessy","Robin Milner"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 32","Issue 1","Jan. 1985","pp   137\u2013161","https://doi.org/10.1145/2455.2460"],"date":"01 January 1985","ref":[{"text":"GORDON, M.

However, MLC flash has many reliability concerns, including the potential for corruption due to supply voltage fluctuations. This paper characterizes MLC flash when the chip is underpowered (i.e., power fading and voltage droops). We demonstrate that underpowering flash can cause serious errors, but also help saving up to 45% of operation energy without incurring failure.","author":["Hung-Wei Tseng","Laura M.

GPS is similar to Google's proprietary Pregel system, with three new features: (1) an extended API to make global computations more easily expressed and more efficient; (2) a dynamic repartitioning scheme that reassigns vertices to different workers during the computation, based on messaging patterns; and (3) an optimization that distributes adjacency lists of high-degree vertices across all compute nodes to improve performance. In addition to presenting the implementation of GPS and its novel features, we also present experimental results on the performance effects of both static and dynamic graph partitioning schemes, and we describe the compilation of a high-level domain-specific programming language to GPS, enabling easy expression of complex algorithms.","author":["Semih Salihoglu","Jennifer Widom"],"issue":["SSDBM: Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management","July 2013","Article No.: 22","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2484838.2484843"],"date":"29 July 2013","ref":[{"text":"Apache Incubator Giraph. http://incubator.apache.org/giraph/.","order":1},{"text":"Apache Hadoop. http://hadoop.apache.org/.","order":2},{"text":"Apache Mahout. http://mahout.apache.org/.","order":3},{"text":"Apache MINA. http://mina.apache.org/.","order":4},{"text":"P.

In contrast, its random access latency has remained relatively stagnant, as it is still around 100 CPU clock cycles. Modern computer systems rely on caches or other latency tolerance techniques to lower the average access latency. However, not all applications have ample parallelism or locality that would help hide or reduce the latency. Moreover, applications' demands for memory space continue to grow, while the capacity gap between last-level caches and main memory is unlikely to shrink. Consequently, reducing the main-memory latency is important for application performance. Unfortunately, previous proposals have not adequately addressed this problem, as they have focused only on improving the bandwidth and capacity or reduced the latency at the cost of significant area overhead. We propose asymmetric DRAM bank organizations to reduce the average main-memory access latency. We first analyze the access and cycle times of a modern DRAM device to identify key delay components for latency reduction. Then we reorganize a subset of DRAM banks to reduce their access and cycle times by half with low area overhead. By synergistically combining these reorganized DRAM banks with support for non-uniform bank accesses, we introduce a novel DRAM bank organization with center high-aspect-ratio mats called CHARM. Experiments on a simulated chip-multiprocessor system show that CHARM improves both the instructions per cycle and system-wide energy-delay product up to 21% and 32%, respectively, with only a 3% increase in die area.","author":["Young Hoon Son","O.

This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey and a structural understanding of online portfolio selection techniques published in the literature. From an online machine learning perspective, we first formulate online portfolio selection as a sequential decision problem, and then we survey a variety of state-of-the-art approaches, which are grouped into several major categories, including benchmarks, Follow-the-Winner approaches, Follow-the-Loser approaches, Pattern-Matching--based approaches, and Meta-Learning Algorithms. In addition to the problem formulation and related algorithms, we also discuss the relationship of these algorithms with the capital growth theory so as to better understand the similarities and differences of their underlying trading ideas. This article aims to provide a timely and comprehensive survey for both machine learning and data mining researchers in academia and quantitative portfolio managers in the financial industry to help them understand the state of the art and facilitate their research and practical applications. We also discuss some open issues and evaluate some emerging new trends for future research.","author":["Bin Li","Steven C. H.

Cache compression can increase effective cache capacity and reduce misses, improve performance, and potentially reduce system energy. However, previous compressed cache designs have demonstrated only limited benefits due to internal fragmentation and limited tags. In this paper, we propose the Decoupled Compressed Cache (DCC), which exploits spatial locality to improve both the performance and energy-efficiency of cache compression. DCC uses decoupled super-blocks and non-contiguous sub-block allocation to decrease tag overhead without increasing internal fragmentation. Non-contiguous sub-blocks also eliminate the need for energy-expensive re-compaction when a block's size changes. Compared to earlier compressed caches, DCC increases normalized effective capacity to a maximum of 4 and an average of 2.2 for a wide range of workloads. A further optimized Co-DCC (Co-Compacted DCC) design improves the average normalized effective capacity to 2.6 by co-compacting the compressed blocks in a super-block. Our simulations show that DCC nearly doubles the benefits of previous compressed caches with similar area overhead. We also demonstrate a practical DCC design based on a recent commercial LLC design.","author":["Somayeh Sardashti","David A.

One basic quality metric is routability. Traditionally, minimizing cut (the number of external signals) has been used as the main criterion in packing for routability optimization. This paper shows that minimizing cut is a sub-optimal criterion, and argues to use the Rent characteristic as the new criterion for FPGA packing. We further propose using a recursive bipartitioning-based k-way partitioner to optimize the Rent characteristic during packing. We developed a new packer, PPack2, based on this approach. Compared to T-VPack, PPack2 achieves 35.4%, 35.6%, and 11.2% reduction in wire length, minimal channel width, and critical path delay, respectively. These improvements show that PPack2 outperforms all previous leading packing tools (including iRAC, HDPack, and the original PPack) by a wide margin.","author":["Wenyi Feng","Jonathan Greene","Kristofer Vorwerk","Val Pevzner","Arun Kundu"],"issue":["FPGA '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM/SIGDA international symposium on Field-programmable gate arrays","February 2014","Pages   31\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/2554688.2554763"],"date":"26 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"Microsemi SoC products group (formerly Actel). http://www.actel.com.","order":1},{"text":"Altera Corp. http://www.altera.com.","order":2},{"text":"Lattice Semiconductor Corp. http://www.latticesemi.com.","order":3},{"text":"Xilinx Corp. http://www.xilinx.com.","order":4},{"text":"V.

The resulting research progress has established the importance of the user-item (U-I) matrix, which encodes the individual preferences of users for items in a collection, for recommender systems. The U-I matrix provides the basis for collaborative filtering (CF) techniques, the dominant framework for recommender systems. Currently, new recommendation scenarios are emerging that offer promising new information that goes beyond the U-I matrix. This information can be divided into two categories related to its source: rich side information concerning users and items, and interaction information associated with the interplay of users and items. In this survey, we summarize and analyze recommendation scenarios involving information sources and the CF algorithms that have been recently developed to address them. We provide a comprehensive introduction to a large body of research, more than 200 key references, with the aim of supporting the further development of recommender systems exploiting information beyond the U-I matrix. On the basis of this material, we identify and discuss what we see as the central challenges lying ahead for recommender system technology, both in terms of extensions of existing techniques as well as of the integration of techniques and technologies drawn from other research areas.","author":["Yue Shi","Martha Larson","Alan Hanjalic"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 47","Issue 1","July 2014","Article No.: 3","pp   1\u201345","https://doi.org/10.1145/2556270"],"date":"01 May 2014","ref":[{"text":"Silvana Aciar, Debbie Zhang, Simeon Simoff, and John Debenham. 2007.

However, solving complex design problems by means of genetic programming requires parallel implementations of search methods and fitness functions. This paper deals with the design of highly optimized implementations of CGP and their detailed evaluation in the task of evolutionary circuit design. Several sequential implementations of CGP have been analyzed and the effect of various additional optimizations has been investigated. Furthermore, the parallelism at the instruction, data, thread and process level has been applied in order to take advantage of modern processor architectures and computer clusters. Combinational adders and multipliers have been chosen to give a performance comparison with state of the art methods.","author":["Radek Hrbacek","Lukas Sekanina"],"issue":["GECCO '14: Proceedings of the 2014 Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation","July 2014","Pages   1015\u20131022","https://doi.org/10.1145/2576768.2598343"],"date":"12 July 2014","ref":[{"text":"T.

FPGA device production is often outsourced to off-shore facilities for economic reasons. This opens up the opportunities for insertion of malicious design alterations in the foundry, referred to as hardware Trojan attacks, to cause logical and physical malfunction. The vulnerability of these devices to hardware attacks raises security concerns regarding hardware and design assurance. In this paper, we analyze hardware Trojan attacks in FPGA considering diverse activation and payload characteristics and derive a taxonomy of Trojan attacks in FPGA. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to analyze Trojan threats in FPGA hardware. Next, we propose a novel redundancy-based protection approach based on Trojan tolerance that modifies the application mapping process to provide high-level of protection against Trojans of varying forms and sizes. We show that the proposed approach incurs significantly higher security at lower overhead than conventional fault-tolerance schemes by exploiting the nature of Trojans and reconfiguration of FPGA resources.","author":["Sanchita Mal-Sarkar","Aswin Krishna","Anandaroop Ghosh","Swarup Bhunia"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '14: Proceedings of the 24th edition of the great lakes symposium on VLSI","May 2014","Pages   287\u2013292","https://doi.org/10.1145/2591513.2591520"],"date":"20 May 2014","ref":[{"text":"S.

This paper reviews the case for considering also the comprehensibility (interpretability) of classification models, and discusses the interpretability of five types of classification models, namely decision trees, classification rules, decision tables, nearest neighbors and Bayesian network classifiers. We discuss both interpretability issues which are specific to each of those model types and more generic interpretability issues, namely the drawbacks of using model size as the only criterion to evaluate the comprehensibility of a model, and the use of monotonicity constraints to improve the comprehensibility and acceptance of classification models by users.","author":["Alex A.

Current datacenter networks inherit the principles that went into the design of the Internet, where packet transmission and path selection decisions are distributed among the endpoints and routers. Instead, we propose that each sender should delegate control---to a centralized arbiter---of when each packet should be transmitted and what path it should follow. This paper describes Fastpass, a datacenter network architecture built using this principle. Fastpass incorporates two fast algorithms: the first determines the time at which each packet should be transmitted, while the second determines the path to use for that packet. In addition, Fastpass uses an efficient protocol between the endpoints and the arbiter and an arbiter replication strategy for fault-tolerant failover. We deployed and evaluated Fastpass in a portion of Facebook's datacenter network. Our results show that Fastpass achieves high throughput comparable to current networks at a 240x reduction is queue lengths (4.35 Mbytes reducing to 18 Kbytes), achieves much fairer and consistent flow throughputs than the baseline TCP (5200x reduction in the standard deviation of per-flow throughput with five concurrent connections), scalability from 1 to 8 cores in the arbiter implementation with the ability to schedule 2.21 Terabits/s of traffic in software on eight cores, and a 2.5x reduction in the number of TCP retransmissions in a latency-sensitive service at Facebook.","author":["Jonathan Perry","Amy Ousterhout","Hari Balakrishnan","Devavrat Shah","Hans Fugal"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM conference on SIGCOMM","August 2014","Pages   307\u2013318","https://doi.org/10.1145/2619239.2626309"],"date":"17 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"Packet processing on intel architecture. http://www.intel.com/go/dpdk.","order":1},{"text":"Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual.

RayCore facilitates high-quality rendering effects, such as reflection, refraction, and shadows, on mobile devices by performing real-time Whitted ray tracing. RayCore consists of two major components: ray-tracing units (RTUs) based on a unified traversal and intersection pipeline and a tree-building unit (TBU) for dynamic scenes. The overall RayCore architecture offers considerable benefits in terms of die area, memory access, and power consumption. We have evaluated our architecture based on FPGA and ASIC evaluations and demonstrate its performance on different benchmarks. According to the results, our architecture demonstrates high performance per unit area and unit energy, making it highly suitable for use in mobile devices.","author":["Jae-Ho Nah","Hyuck-Joo Kwon","Dong-Seok Kim","Cheol-Ho Jeong","Jinhong Park","Tack-Don Han","Dinesh Manocha","Woo-Chan Park"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 33","Issue 5","August 2014","Article No.: 162","pp   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/2629634"],"date":"23 September 2014","ref":[{"text":"Timo Aila and Tero Karras. 2010.

Given that educational roles need reliable methods to understand and optimize their social learning environment, it seems clear that social network analysis is the best suited approximation. Despite the abovementioned, very few learning management systems integrate these kinds of tools to help teachers and students enhance their social learning processes. The aim of this paper is to encourage learning management systems engineers to integrate (as default) tools for social network analysis. This way, social network analysis is presented in its fundamentals and applicability to different social learning situations. Moreover, researchers are also encouraged to work on easy models of use for both teachers and learning management system engineers.","author":["Daniel Amo Filv\u00e0","Francisco J.

However, as DRAM process technology scales down to smaller dimensions, it becomes more difficult to prevent DRAM cells from electrically interacting with each other. In this paper, we expose the vulnerability of commodity DRAM chips to disturbance errors. By reading from the same address in DRAM, we show that it is possible to corrupt data in nearby addresses. More specifically, activating the same row in DRAM corrupts data in nearby rows. We demonstrate this phenomenon on Intel and AMD systems using a malicious program that generates many DRAM accesses. We induce errors in most DRAM modules (110 out of 129) from three major DRAM manufacturers. From this we conclude that many deployed systems are likely to be at risk. We identify the root cause of disturbance errors as the repeated toggling of a DRAM row's wordline, which stresses inter-cell coupling effects that accelerate charge leakage from nearby rows. We provide an extensive characterization study of disturbance errors and their behavior using an FPGA-based testing platform. Among our key findings, we show that (i) it takes as few as 139K accesses to induce an error and (ii) up to one in every 1.7K cells is susceptible to errors. After examining various potential ways of addressing the problem, we propose a low-overhead solution to prevent the errors","author":["Yoongu Kim","Ross Daly","Jeremie Kim","Chris Fallin","Ji Hye Lee","Donghyuk Lee","Chris Wilkerson","Konrad Lai","Onur Mutlu"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 42","Issue 3","June 2014","pp   361\u2013372","https://doi.org/10.1145/2678373.2665726"],"date":"14 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"Memtest86+ v4.20. http://www.memtest.org.","order":1},{"text":"The GNU GRUB Manual. http://www.gnu.org/software/grub.","order":2},{"text":"Z.

It has simplified the way we think about scalar variables. It has simplified the design of some optimizations and has made other optimizations more effective. Unfortunately none of this can be be said for SSA form for arrays. The current SSA processing of arrays views an array as a single object. But the kinds of analyses that sophisticated compilers need to perform on arrays, for example those that drive loop parallelization, are at the element level. Current SSA form for arrays is incapable of providing the element-level data flow information required for such analyses.In this paper, we introduce an Array SSA form that captures precise element-level data flow information for array variables in all cases. It is general and simple, and coincides with standard SSA form when applied to scalar variables. It can also be used for structures and other variable types that can be modeled as arrays. An important application of Array SSA form is in automatic parallelization. We show how Array SSA form can enable parallelization of any loop that is free of loop-carried true data dependences. This includes loops with loop-carried anti and output dependences, unanalyzable subscript expressions, and arbitrary control flow within an iteration. Array SSA form achieves this level of generality by making manifest its - functions as runtime computations in cases that are not amenable to compile-time analysis.","author":["Kathleen Knobe","Vivek Sarkar"],"issue":["POPL '98: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT symposium on Principles of programming languages","January 1998","Pages   107\u2013120","https://doi.org/10.1145/268946.268956"],"date":"21 January 1998","ref":[{"text":"A.V.

However, because memory speeds have been not been keeping pace with CPU speeds, the cost of moving data into CPU caches has begun to dominate certain operations within in-memory data systems. Recent advances in hardware architectures point to near memory computation capabilities becoming possible soon. This allows us to rethink how database systems process queries and how they split computation across the various computational units. In this paper, we present JAFAR, a near data processing accelerator for pushing selects down to memory. Through a detailed simulation of JAFAR hardware we show it has the potential to provide up to 900\\% improvement for select operations in modern column-stores.","author":["Aurelia Augusta","Stratos Idreos"],"issue":["SIGMOD '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","May 2015","Pages   2069\u20132070","https://doi.org/10.1145/2723372.2764942"],"date":"27 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"D.

These virtualized systems employ distributed resource management (DRM) to achieve high resource utilization and energy savings by dynamically migrating and consolidating virtual machines. DRM schemes usually use operating-system-level metrics, such as CPU utilization, memory capacity demand and I/O utilization, to detect and balance resource contention. However, they are oblivious to microarchitecture-level resource interference (e.g., memory bandwidth contention between different VMs running on a host), which is currently not exposed to the operating system. We observe that the lack of visibility into microarchitecture-level resource interference significantly impacts the performance of virtualized systems. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel architecture-aware DRM scheme (ADRM), that takes into account microarchitecture-level resource interference when making migration decisions in a virtualized cluster. ADRM makes use of three core techniques: 1) a profiler to monitor the microarchitecture-level resource usage behavior online for each physical host, 2) a memory bandwidth interference model to assess the interference degree among virtual machines on a host, and 3) a cost-benefit analysis to determine a candidate virtual machine and a host for migration. Real system experiments on thirty randomly selected combinations of applications from the CPU2006, PARSEC, STREAM, NAS Parallel Benchmark suites in a four-host virtualized cluster show that ADRM can improve performance by up to 26.55%, with an average of 9.67%, compared to traditional DRM schemes that lack visibility into microarchitecture-level resource utilization and contention.","author":["Hui Wang","Canturk Isci","Lavanya Subramanian","Jongmoo Choi","Depei Qian","Onur Mutlu"],"issue":["VEE '15: Proceedings of the 11th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGOPS International Conference on Virtual Execution Environments","March 2015","Pages   93\u2013106","https://doi.org/10.1145/2731186.2731202"],"date":"14 March 2015","ref":[{"text":"Windows Azure. http://www.windowsazure.com/en-un/.","order":1},{"text":"Amazon EC2. http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/.","order":2},{"text":"libvirt: The virtualization API. http://libvirt.org.","order":3},{"text":"NAS Parallel Benchmarks. http://www.nas.nasa.gov/publications/npb.html.","order":4},{"text":"QEMU. http://qemu.org.","order":5},{"text":"SPEC CPU2006. http://www.spec.org/spec2006.","order":6},{"text":"STREAM Benchmark. http://www.streambench.org/.","order":7},{"text":"J.

Most existing graph embedding methods do not scale for real world information networks which usually contain millions of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel network embedding method called the ``LINE,'' which is suitable for arbitrary types of information networks: undirected, directed, and/or weighted. The method optimizes a carefully designed objective function that preserves both the local and global network structures. An edge-sampling algorithm is proposed that addresses the limitation of the classical stochastic gradient descent and improves both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the inference. Empirical experiments prove the effectiveness of the LINE on a variety of real-world information networks, including language networks, social networks, and citation networks. The algorithm is very efficient, which is able to learn the embedding of a network with millions of vertices and billions of edges in a few hours on a typical single machine.

The spiking neural network (SNN), which encodes and processes information with bionic spikes, is an emerging neuromorphic model with great potential to drastically promote the performance and efficiency of computing systems. However, an energy efficient hardware implementation and the difficulty of training the model significantly limit the application of the spiking neural network. In this work, we address these issues by building an SNN-based energy efficient system for real time classification with metal-oxide resistive switching random-access memory (RRAM) devices. We implement different training algorithms of SNN, including Spiking Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and Neural Sampling method. Our RRAM SNN systems for these two training algorithms show good power efficiency and recognition performance on realtime classification tasks, such as the MNIST digit recognition. Finally, we propose a possible direction to further improve the classification accuracy by boosting multiple SNNs.","author":["Yu Wang","Tianqi Tang","Lixue Xia","Boxun Li","Peng Gu","Huazhong Yang","Hai Li","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '15: Proceedings of the 25th edition on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2015","Pages   189\u2013194","https://doi.org/10.1145/2742060.2743756"],"date":"20 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"C.

We observe that the Visible Light Communication (VLC) methods in existing VLP systems rely on intensity-based modulation, and thus they require a high pulse rate to prevent flickering. However, the high pulse rate adds an unnecessary and heavy burden to receiving devices. To eliminate this burden, we propose the polarization-based modulation, which is flicker-free, to enable a low pulse rate VLC. In this way, we make VLP light-weight enough even for resource-constrained wearable devices, e.g. smart glasses. Moreover, the polarization-based VLC can be applied to any illuminating light sources, thereby eliminating the dependency on LED. This paper presents the VLP system PIXEL, which realizes our idea. In PIXEL, we develop three techniques, each of which addresses a design challenge: 1) a novel color-based modulation scheme to handle users? mobility, 2) an adaptive downsampling algorithm to tackle the uneven sampling problem of wearables? low-cost camera and 3) a computational optimization method for the positioning algorithm to enable real-time processing. We implement PIXEL?s hardware using commodity components and develop a software program for both smartphone and Google glass. Our experiments based on the prototype show that PIXEL can provide accurate realtime VLP for wearables and smartphones with camera resolution as coarse as 60 pixel x 80 pixel and CPU frequency as low as 300MHz.","author":["Zhice Yang","Zeyu Wang","Jiansong Zhang","Chenyu Huang","Qian Zhang"],"issue":["MobiSys '15: Proceedings of the 13th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services","May 2015","Pages   317\u2013330","https://doi.org/10.1145/2742647.2742648"],"date":"18 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"Android 5.0. https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-5.0.html, Mar 2015.","order":1},{"text":"Colour rendering of spectra. http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/specrend/, Mar 2015.","order":2},{"text":"ffmpeg/ffprobe. http://www.ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html, Mar 2015.","order":3},{"text":"Lcd. http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/3D-Shutter-glasses-lcd-with-90_1909619852.html?s=p, Mar 2015.","order":4},{"text":"Pi cell. http://www.liquidcrystaltechnologies.com/tech_support/Pi_Cell.htm, Mar 2015.","order":5},{"text":"Polarizing film. http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Polarizer-film_458324790.html?s=p, Mar 2015.","order":6},{"text":"Quartz glass. http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/clear-optical-quartz-plate-glass_846087937.html, Mar 2015.","order":7},{"text":"Spectrum data. https://plot.ly/~arducordermini, Mar 2015.","order":8},{"text":"P.

However, harvested energy is intrinsically unstable, which could frequently interrupt a processor's execution. To tackle this problem, non-volatile processors have been proposed to checkpoint the whole volatile processor state into attached non-volatile memories periodically. When power resumes, the processor can copy the checkpointed state back to volatile memories and continue execution. However, without careful consideration, the process of checkpointing and resuming could cause inconsistency among different memory addresses and lead to irreversible errors. In this paper, we present a consistency aware checkpointing scheme that ensures correctness for all checkpoints. The proposed technique efficiently identifies all possible inconsistency positions in programs and inserts auxiliary code to ensure correctness. Evaluation results show that the proposed checkpointing technique can successfully eliminate inconsistency errors and greatly reduce the checkpointing overhead.","author":["Mimi Xie","Mengying Zhao","Chen Pan","Jingtong Hu","Yongpan Liu","Chun Jason Xue"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 184","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744842"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"M.

However, little has been published about soft errors in uncore components, such as memory subsystem and I/O controllers, of a System-on-a-Chip (SoC). In this work, we study how soft errors in uncore components affect system-level behaviors. We have created a new mixed-mode simulation platform that combines simulators at two different levels of abstraction, and achieves 20,000x speedup over RTL-only simulation. Using this platform, we present the first study of the system-level impact of soft errors inside various uncore components of a large-scale, multi-core SoC using the industrial-grade, open-source OpenSPARC T2 SoC design. Our results show that soft errors in uncore components can significantly impact system-level reliability. We also demonstrate that uncore soft errors can create major challenges for traditional system-level checkpoint recovery techniques. To overcome such recovery challenges, we present a new replay recovery technique for uncore components belonging to the memory subsystem. For the L2 cache controller and the DRAM controller components of OpenSPARC T2, our new technique reduces the probability that an application run fails to produce correct results due to soft errors by more than 100x with 3.32% and 6.09% chip-level area and power impact, respectively.","author":["Hyungmin Cho","Chen-Yong Cher","Thomas Shepherd","Subhasish Mitra"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 89","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744923"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"{Ando 03} H.

Still, both the energy efficiency and performance of such accelerators remain limited by memory accesses. In this paper, we focus on image applications, arguably the most important category among recognition and mining applications. The neural networks which are state-of-the-art for these applications are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and they have an important property: weights are shared among many neurons, considerably reducing the neural network memory footprint. This property allows to entirely map a CNN within an SRAM, eliminating all DRAM accesses for weights. By further hoisting this accelerator next to the image sensor, it is possible to eliminate all remaining DRAM accesses, i.e., for inputs and outputs. In this paper, we propose such a CNN accelerator, placed next to a CMOS or CCD sensor. The absence of DRAM accesses combined with a careful exploitation of the specific data access patterns within CNNs allows us to design an accelerator which is 60&times more energy efficient than the previous state-of-the-art neural network accelerator. We present a full design down to the layout at 65 nm, with a modest footprint of 4.86mm2 and consuming only 320mW, but still about 30\u00d7 faster than high-end GPUs.","author":["Zidong Du","Robert Fasthuber","Tianshi Chen","Paolo Ienne","Ling Li","Tao Luo","Xiaobing Feng","Yunji Chen","Olivier Temam"],"issue":["ISCA '15: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2015","Pages   92\u2013104","https://doi.org/10.1145/2749469.2750389"],"date":"13 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"Berkeley Vision and Learning Center, \"Caffe: a deep learning framework.\" Available: http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/","order":1},{"text":"S.

The model simulates not only the resistance change by phase (as corresponding to the two states, amorphous and crystalline), but also the temperature profile, the crystalline fraction during the programming and the drift behavior in resistance and threshold voltage. The proposed macromodel (consisting of two models) generates the I-V and R-I plots of a PCM cell at a very small error compared with experimental data. The electrical-based modeling by HSPICE allows to fully characterize the holding voltage and the continuous behavior of the PCM resistance, while assessing the impact of the programming time. Furthermore, the proposed model takes into account the drift behavior of few parameters when the PCM is not been programmed or read, making the model more realistic. Selection of the parameters is based on operational features, so the electrical characterization of the PCM is simple, easy to simulate and intuitive.","author":["Pilin Junsangsri","Fabrizio Lombardi","Jie Han"],"issue":["NANOARCH '12: Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","July 2012","Pages   77\u201384","https://doi.org/10.1145/2765491.2765506"],"date":"04 July 2012","ref":[{"text":"X.

However, comparing to sophisticated deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, these methods usually yield inferior results when applied to particular machine learning tasks. One possible reason is that these text embedding methods learn the representation of text in a fully unsupervised way, without leveraging the labeled information available for the task. Although the low dimensional representations learned are applicable to many different tasks, they are not particularly tuned for any task. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a semi-supervised representation learning method for text data, which we call the predictive text embedding (PTE). Predictive text embedding utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data to learn the embedding of text. The labeled information and different levels of word co-occurrence information are first represented as a large-scale heterogeneous text network, which is then embedded into a low dimensional space through a principled and efficient algorithm. This low dimensional embedding not only preserves the semantic closeness of words and documents, but also has a strong predictive power for the particular task. Compared to recent supervised approaches based on convolutional neural networks, predictive text embedding is comparable or more effective, much more efficient, and has fewer parameters to tune.","author":["Jian Tang","Meng Qu","Qiaozhu Mei"],"issue":["KDD '15: Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2015","Pages   1165\u20131174","https://doi.org/10.1145/2783258.2783307"],"date":"10 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"M.

However, these systems need to be able to learn new activities to adapt to a user's needs. Learning new activities is especially challenging in practical scenarios when a user provides only a few annotations for training an AR model. In this work, we study the problem of recognizing new activities with a limited amount of labeled training data. Due to the shortage of labeled data, small variations of the new activity will not be detected resulting in a significant degradation of the system's recall. We propose the FE-AT (Feature-based and Attribute-based learning) approach, which leverages the relationship between existing and new activities to compensate for the shortage of the labeled data. We evaluate FE-AT on three public datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms traditional AR approaches in recognizing new activities, especially when only a few training instances are available.","author":["Le T.

In this work, we propose a deep learning model named Social Restricted Boltzmann Machine (SRBM) for human behavior modeling and prediction in health social networks. In the proposed SRBM model, we naturally incorporate self-motivation, implicit and explicit social influences, and environmental events together into three layers which are historical, visible, and hidden layers. The interactions among these behavior determinants are naturally simulated through parameters connecting these layers together. The contrastive divergence and back-propagation algorithms are employed for training the model.

The unprecedented accuracy of deep learning methods has turned them into the foundation of new AI-based services on the Internet. Commercial companies that collect user data on a large scale have been the main beneficiaries of this trend since the success of deep learning techniques is directly proportional to the amount of data available for training. Massive data collection required for deep learning presents obvious privacy issues. Users' personal, highly sensitive data such as photos and voice recordings is kept indefinitely by the companies that collect it. Users can neither delete it, nor restrict the purposes for which it is used. Furthermore, centrally kept data is subject to legal subpoenas and extra-judicial surveillance. Many data owners--for example, medical institutions that may want to apply deep learning methods to clinical records--are prevented by privacy and confidentiality concerns from sharing the data and thus benefitting from large-scale deep learning. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate a practical system that enables multiple parties to jointly learn an accurate neural-network model for a given objective without sharing their input datasets. We exploit the fact that the optimization algorithms used in modern deep learning, namely, those based on stochastic gradient descent, can be parallelized and executed asynchronously. Our system lets participants train independently on their own datasets and selectively share small subsets of their models' key parameters during training. This offers an attractive point in the utility/privacy tradeoff space: participants preserve the privacy of their respective data while still benefitting from other participants' models and thus boosting their learning accuracy beyond what is achievable solely on their own inputs. We demonstrate the accuracy of our privacy-preserving deep learning on benchmark datasets.","author":["Reza Shokri","Vitaly Shmatikov"],"issue":["CCS '15: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2015","Pages   1310\u20131321","https://doi.org/10.1145/2810103.2813687"],"date":"12 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"A.

Recently, a new approach has been proposed: it is based on the theory of point processes and it leverages tools from stochastic geometry for tractable system-level modeling, performance evaluation and optimization. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy of this emerging abstraction for modeling cellular networks, by explicitly taking realistic base station locations, building footprints, spatial blockages and antenna radiation patterns into account. More specifically, the base station locations and the building footprints are taken from two publicly available databases from the United Kingdom. Our study confirms that the abstraction model based on stochastic geometry is capable of accurately modeling the communication performance of cellular networks in dense urban environments.","author":["Wei Lu","Marco Di Renzo"],"issue":["MSWiM '15: Proceedings of the 18th ACM International Conference on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems","November 2015","Pages   179\u2013188","https://doi.org/10.1145/2811587.2811597"],"date":"02 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"5G-PPP, \"5G Vision - The 5G Infrastructure Public Private Partnership: The next generation of communication networks and services\", Available: http://5g-ppp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/5G-Vision-Brochure-v1.pdf.%","order":1},{"text":"D.

Unfortunately, very little is known about the internal operation and general characteristics of Personal Clouds since they are proprietary services. In this paper, we focus on understanding the nature of Personal Clouds by presenting the internal structure and a measurement study of UbuntuOne (U1). We first detail the U$1$ architecture, core components involved in the U1 metadata service hosted in the datacenter of Canonical, as well as the interactions of U$1$ with Amazon S3 to outsource data storage. To our knowledge, this is the first research work to describe the internals of a large-scale Personal Cloud. Second, by means of tracing the U$1$ servers, we provide an extensive analysis of its back-end activity for one month. Our analysis includes the study of the storage workload, the user behavior and the performance of the U1 metadata store. Moreover, based on our analysis, we suggest improvements to U1 that can also benefit similar Personal Cloud systems. Finally, we contribute our dataset to the community, which is the first to contain the back-end activity of a large-scale Personal Cloud. We believe that our dataset provides unique opportunities for extending research in the field.","author":["Ra\u00fal Gracia-Tinedo","Yongchao Tian","Josep Samp\u00e9","Hamza Harkous","John Lenton","Pedro Garc\u00eda-L\u00f3pez","Marc S\u00e1nchez-Artigas","Marko Vukolic"],"issue":["IMC '15: Proceedings of the 2015 Internet Measurement Conference","October 2015","Pages   155\u2013168","https://doi.org/10.1145/2815675.2815677"],"date":"28 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"F.

A larger and deeper cache hierarchy benefits locality-friendly computation, but offers limited improvement to irregular, data intensive applications. In this work we explore a novel approach to accelerating these applications through in-memory data restructuring. Unlike other proposed processing-in-memory architectures, the rearrangement hardware performs data reduction, not compute offload. Using a custom FPGA emulator, we quantitatively evaluate performance and energy benefits of near-memory hardware structures that dynamically restructure in-memory data to cache-friendly layout, minimizing wasted memory bandwidth. Our results on representative irregular benchmarks using the Micron Hybrid Memory Cube memory model show speedup, bandwidth savings, and energy reduction. We present an API for the near-memory accelerator and describe the interaction between the CPU and the rearrangement hardware with application examples. The merits of an SRAM vs. a DRAM scratchpad buffer for rearranged data are explored.","author":["Maya Gokhale","Scott Lloyd","Chris Hajas"],"issue":["MEMSYS '15: Proceedings of the 2015 International Symposium on Memory Systems","October 2015","Pages   283\u2013290","https://doi.org/10.1145/2818950.2818986"],"date":"05 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"RandomAccess. http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projectsfiles/hpcc/RandomAccess/, 2012.","order":1},{"text":"Arira design. http://www.ariradesign.com, 2015.","order":2},{"text":"J.

These knowledge bases store structured information about real-world people, places, organizations, etc. However, due to limitations of human knowledge and information extraction algorithms, these knowledge bases are still far from complete. In this paper, we study the problem of mining first-order inference rules to facilitate knowledge expansion. We propose the Ontological Pathfinding algorithm (OP) that scales to web-scale knowledge bases via a series of parallelization and optimization techniques: a relational knowledge base model to apply inference rules in batches, a new rule mining algorithm that parallelizes the join queries, a novel partitioning algorithm to break the mining tasks into smaller independent sub-tasks, and a pruning strategy to eliminate unsound and resource-consuming rules before applying them. Combining these techniques, we develop the first rule mining system that scales to Freebase, the largest public knowledge base with 112 million entities and 388 million facts. We mine 36,625 inference rules in 34 hours; no existing approach achieves this scale.","author":["Yang Chen","Sean Goldberg","Daisy Zhe Wang","Soumitra Siddharth Johri"],"issue":["SIGMOD '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data","June 2016","Pages   835\u2013846","https://doi.org/10.1145/2882903.2882954"],"date":"14 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"R.

Based on the non-volatile spin transfer torque (STT) magnetic technology, we introduce a basic set of non-volatile reconfigurable Look-Up-Table (LUT) logic components (NV-STT-based LUTs). STT-based LUT with significantly different set of characteristics compared to CMOS provides new opportunities to enhance design security yet makes it challenging to remain highly competitive with custom CMOS or even SRAM-based LUT in terms of power, performance and area. To address these challenges, we propose several algorithms to select and replace custom CMOS gates with reconfigurable STT-based LUTs during design implementation such that the functionality of STT-based components and therefore the entire design cannot be determined in any manageable time, rendering any design reverse engineering attack ineffective. Our study conducted on a large number of standard circuit benchmarks concludes significant resiliency of hybrid STT-CMOS circuits against various types of attacks. Furthermore, the selection algorithms on average have a small impact of less than 3%, 8%, and 3% on design parametric constraints including performance, power and area, respectively.","author":["Theodore Winograd","Hassan Salmani","Hamid Mahmoodi","Kris Gaj","Houman Homayoun"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 88","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898099"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"B.

For example, large-scale artificial neural networks (popularly called deep learning) now represent the state-of-the art in a wide and ever-increasing range of video/image/audio/text recognition problems. However, the growth in data sets and network complexities have led to deep learning becoming one of the most challenging workloads across the computing spectrum. We posit that approximate computing can play a key role in the quest for energy-efficient neuromorphic systems. We show how the principles of approximate computing can be applied to the design of neuromorphic systems at various layers of the computing stack. At the algorithm level, we present techniques to significantly scale down the computational requirements of a neural network with minimal impact on its accuracy. At the circuit level, we show how approximate logic and memory can be used to implement neurons and synapses in an energy-efficient manner, while still meeting accuracy requirements. A fundamental limitation to the efficiency of neuromorphic computing in traditional implementations (software and custom hardware alike) is the mismatch between neuromorphic algorithms and the underlying computing models such as von Neumann architecture and Boolean logic. To overcome this limitation, we describe how emerging spintronic devices can offer highly efficient, approximate realization of the building blocks of neuromorphic computing systems.","author":["Priyadarshini Panda","Abhronil Sengupta","Syed Shakib Sarwar","Gopalakrishnan Srinivasan","Swagath Venkataramani","Anand Raghunathan","Kaushik Roy"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 98","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2905009"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"A.

This paper describes the complete implementation of the support for threadlevel speculation on the Hydra chip multiprocessor (CMP). The support consists of a number of software speculation control handlers and modifications to the shared secondary cache memory system of the CMP This support is evaluated using five representative integer applications. Our results show that the speculative support is only able to improve performance when there is a substantial amount of medium--grained loop-level parallelism in the application. When the granularity of parallelism is too small or there is little inherent parallelism in the application, the overhead of the software handlers overwhelms any potential performance benefits from speculative-thread parallelism. Overall, thread-level speculation still appears to be a promising approach for expanding the class of applications that can be automatically parallelized, but more hardware intensive implementations for managing speculation control are required to achieve performance improvements on a wide class of integer applications.","author":["Lance Hammond","Mark Willey","Kunle Olukotun"],"issue":["ASPLOS VIII: Proceedings of the eighth international conference on Architectural support for programming languages and operating systems","October 1998","Pages   58\u201369","https://doi.org/10.1145/291069.291020"],"date":"01 October 1998","ref":[{"text":"M.

In order to identify the class of \u201crobust\u201d learning algorithms in the most general way, we formalize a new but related model of learning from statistical queries. Intuitively, in this model a learning algorithm is forbidden to examine individual examples of the unknown target function, but is given acess to an oracle providing estimates of probabilities over the sample space of random examples.One of our main results shows that any class of functions learnable from statistical queries is in fact learnable with classification noise in Valiant's model, with a  noise rate approaching the  information-theoretic barrier of 1/2. We then demonstrate the generality of the statistical query model, showing that practically every class learnable in Valiant's model and its variants can also be learned in the new model (and thus can be learned in the presence of noise). A notable exception to this statement is the class of parity functions, which we prove is not learnable from statistical queries, and for which no noise-tolerant algorithm is known.","author":["Michael Kearns"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 45","Issue 6","Nov. 1998","pp   983\u20131006","https://doi.org/10.1145/293347.293351"],"date":"01 November 1998","ref":[{"text":"ANGLUIN, D., AND LAIRD, P. 1988.

Today we realize that many applications have to deal with situation awareness: Customer Relationship Management, Human Capital Management, Supply Chain Management, patient care, power grid management, and cloud services management, as well as any IoT (Internet of Things) related application; the list seems to be endless. Situation awareness requires applications to support the management of data, knowledge, processes, and other services such as social networking in an integrated way. These applications additionally require high personalization as well as rapid and continuous evolution. They must provide a wide variety of operational and functional requirements, including real time processing.Handcrafting these applications is an almost impossible task requiring exhaustive resources for development and maintenance. Due to the resources and time involved in their development, these applications typically fall way short of the desired functionality, operational characteristics, and ease and speed of evolution. We - the authors - have developed a model enabling the development and maintenance of situation-aware applications in a declarative and therefore economical manner; we call this model KIDS - Knowledge Intensive Data-processing System.","author":["Arun Kumar","Robert McCann","Jeffrey Naughton","Jignesh M.

In this paper, we present a detailed comparative analysis of a number of design tradeoffs for CMOS front-end and back-end compatible devices for silicon photonic interconnects. A cross-layer optimization of multiple device-level and link-level design parameters is performed to enable the design of energy-efficient on-chip photonic interconnects using BCSP devices. The optimized design of BCSP on-chip links renders more energy-efficiency and aggregate bandwidth than FCSP on-chip links, in spite of the inferior opto-electronic properties of BCSP devices. Our experimental analysis compares the use of BCSP and FCSP links at the architecture level, and shows that the optimized design of the BCSP-based Firefly PNoC achieves 1.15x greater throughput and 12.4% less energy-per-bit on average than the optimized design of FCSP-based Firefly PNoC. Similarly, the optimized design of the BCSP-based Corona PNoC achieves 3.5x greater throughput and 39.5% less energy-per-bit on average than the optimized design of FCSP-based Corona PNoC.","author":["Ishan G.

Unfortunately, it is foreseen that conventional NoC architectures cannot sustain the performance, power, and reliability requirements demanded by the next generation of manycore architectures. Recently, emerging on-chip communication technologies, like wireless Networks-on-Chip (WiNoCs), have been proposed as candidate solutions for addressing the scalability limitations of conventional multi-hop NoC architectures. In a WiNoC, a subset of network nodes are equipped with a wireless interface which allows them long-range communication in a single hop. Assessing the performance and power figures of NoC and WiNoC architectures requires the availability of simulation tools that are often limited on modeling specific network configurations. This article presents Noxim, an open, configurable, extendible, cycle-accurate NoC simulator developed in SystemC, which allows to analyze the performance and power figures of both conventional wired NoC and emerging WiNoC architectures.","author":["Vincenzo Catania","Andrea Mineo","Salvatore Monteleone","Maurizio Palesi","Davide Patti"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation","Volume 27","Issue 1","November 2016","Article No.: 4","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2953878"],"date":"16 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"Sergi Abadal, Mario Iannazzo, Mario Nemirovsky, Albert Cabellos-Aparicio, Heekwan Lee, and Eduard Alarc\u00f3n. 2015.

One of the most important components of a multicore chip is its communication backbone. Due to inherent irregularities in data movements manifested by graph-based applications, it is essential to design efficient on-chip interconnection architectures for multicore chips performing graph analytics. In this article, we present a detailed analysis of the traffic patterns generated by graph-based applications when mapped to multicore chips. Based on this analysis, we explore the design-space for the Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture to enable an efficient implementation of graph analytics. We principally consider three types of NoC architectures, viz., traditional mesh, small-world, and high-radix networks. We demonstrate that the small-world-network-enabled wireless NoC (WiNoC) is the most suitable platform for executing the considered graph applications. The WiNoC achieves an average of 38% and 18% full-system Energy Delay Product savings compared to wireline-mesh and high-radix NoCs, respectively.","author":["Karthi Duraisamy","Hao Lu","Partha Pratim Pande","Ananth Kalyanaraman"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 15","Issue 4","August 2016","Article No.: 66","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/2961027"],"date":"01 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"N.

Moreover, algorithms for entity linking and entity retrieval have improved tremendously in the past years. These developments give rise to a new line of research that exploits and combines these developments for the purposes of text-centric information retrieval applications. This tutorial focuses on a) how to retrieve a set of entities for an ad-hoc query, or more broadly, assessing relevance of KB elements for the information need, b) how to annotate text with such elements, and c) how to use this information to assess the relevance of text. We discuss different kinds of information available in a knowledge graph and how to leverage each most effectively. We start the tutorial with a brief overview of different types of knowledge bases, their structure and information contained in popular general-purpose and domain-specific knowledge bases. In particular, we focus on the representation of entity-centric information in the knowledge base through names, terms, relations, and type taxonomies. Next, we will provide a recap on ad-hoc object retrieval from knowledge graphs as well as entity linking and retrieval. This is essential technology, which the remainder of the tutorial builds on. Next we will cover essential components within successful entity linking systems, including the collection of entity name information and techniques for disambiguation with contextual entity mentions. We will present the details of four previously proposed systems that successfully leverage knowledge bases to improve ad-hoc document retrieval. These systems combine the notion of entity retrieval and semantic search on one hand, with text retrieval models and entity linking on the other. Finally, we also touch on entity aspects and links in the knowledge graph as it can help to understand the entities' context. This tutorial is the first to compile, summarize, and disseminate progress in this emerging area and we provide both an overview of state-of-the-art methods and outline open research problems to encourage new contributions.","author":["Laura Dietz","Alexander Kotov","Edgar Meij"],"issue":["ICTIR '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval","September 2016","Pages   5","https://doi.org/10.1145/2970398.2970441"],"date":"12 September 2016"},{"_id":"10.1145/2989081.2989087","title":"Data-Centric Computing Frontiers: A Survey On Processing-In-Memory","abstract":"A major shift from compute-centric to data-centric computing systems can be perceived, as novel big data workloads like cognitive computing and machine learning strongly enforce embarrassingly parallel and highly efficient processor architectures. With Moore's law having surrendered, innovative architectural concepts as well as technologies are urgently required, to enable a path for tackling exascale and beyond -- even though current computing systems face the inevitable instruction-level parallelism, power, memory, and bandwidth walls. As part of any computing system, the general perception of memories depicts unreliability, power hungriness and slowness, resulting in a future prospective bottleneck. The latter being an outcome of a pin limitation derived by packaging constraints, an unexploited tremendous row bandwidth is determinable, which off-chip diminishes to a bare minimum. Building upon a shift towards data-centric computing systems, the near-memory processing concept seems to be most promising, since power efficiency and computing performance increase by co-locating tasks on bandwidth-rich in-memory processing units, whereas data motion mitigates by the avoidance of entire memory hierarchies. By considering the umbrella of near-data processing as the urgent required breakthrough for future computing systems, this survey presents its derivations with a special emphasis on Processing-In-Memory (PIM), highlighting historical achievements in technology as well as architecture while depicting its advantages and obstacles.","author":["Patrick Siegl","Rainer Buchty","Mladen Berekovic"],"issue":["MEMSYS '16: Proceedings of the Second International Symposium on Memory Systems","October 2016","Pages   295\u2013308","https://doi.org/10.1145/2989081.2989087"],"date":"03 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"The road to the amd \"fiji\" gpu.

Temporal dynamics are purely reactive, that is, they are inferred after they are observed, e.g. after a user's taste has changed or based on hand-engineered temporal bias corrections for movies. We propose Recurrent Recommender Networks (RRN) that are able to predict future behavioral trajectories. This is achieved by endowing both users and movies with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoregressive model that captures dynamics, in addition to a more traditional low-rank factorization. On multiple real-world datasets, our model offers excellent prediction accuracy and it is very compact, since we need not learn latent state but rather just the state transition function.","author":["Chao-Yuan Wu","Amr Ahmed","Alex Beutel","Alexander J.

Currently, executing the software-based DCNNs requires high-performance servers, restricting the widespread deployment on embedded and mobile IoT devices. To overcome this obstacle, considerable research efforts have been made to develop highly-parallel and specialized DCNN accelerators using GPGPUs, FPGAs or ASICs. Stochastic Computing (SC), which uses a bit-stream to represent a number within [-1, 1] by counting the number of ones in the bit-stream, has high potential for implementing DCNNs with high scalability and ultra-low hardware footprint. Since multiplications and additions can be calculated using AND gates and multiplexers in SC, significant reductions in power (energy) and hardware footprint can be achieved compared to the conventional binary arithmetic implementations. The tremendous savings in power (energy) and hardware resources allow immense design space for enhancing scalability and robustness for hardware DCNNs. This paper presents SC-DCNN, the first comprehensive design and optimization framework of SC-based DCNNs, using a bottom-up approach. We first present the designs of function blocks that perform the basic operations in DCNN, including inner product, pooling, and activation function. Then we propose four designs of feature extraction blocks, which are in charge of extracting features from input feature maps, by connecting different basic function blocks with joint optimization. Moreover, the efficient weight storage methods are proposed to reduce the area and power (energy) consumption. Putting all together, with feature extraction blocks carefully selected, SC-DCNN is holistically optimized to minimize area and power (energy) consumption while maintaining high network accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the LeNet5 implemented in SC-DCNN consumes only 17 mm2 area and 1.53 W power, achieves throughput of 781250 images/s, area efficiency of 45946 images/s/mm2, and energy efficiency of 510734 images/J.","author":["Ao Ren","Zhe Li","Caiwen Ding","Qinru Qiu","Yanzhi Wang","Ji Li","Xuehai Qian","Bo Yuan"],"issue":["ASPLOS '17: Proceedings of the Twenty-Second International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","April 2017","Pages   405\u2013418","https://doi.org/10.1145/3037697.3037746"],"date":"04 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"Stanford cs class, cs231n: Convolutional neural networks for visual recognition, 2016.

Due to the unique crossbar structure, ReRAM can be constructed with a very high density. However, ReRAM's crossbar structure causes an IR drop problem which results in non-uniform access latency in ReRAM banks and reduces its reliability. Besides, the access latency and reliability of ReRAM arrays are greatly influenced by the data patterns involved in a write operation. In this paper, we propose a performance and reliability efficient ReRAM-based main memory structure. At the circuit level, we propose a double-sided write driver design to reduce the IR drops along bitlines. At the architecture level, a region partition with address remapping method and two flip schemes are proposed to reduce the access latency and improve the reliability of ReRAM arrays. The experimental results show that the proposed design can improve the system performance by 30.3% on average and reduce the memory access latency by 25.9% on average over an aggressive baseline, meanwhile the design improves the reliability of ReRAM-based memory system.","author":["Yang Zhang","Dan Feng","Jingning Liu","Wei Tong","Bing Wu","Caihua Fang"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 82","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062191"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"ITRS Roadmap.

Given a query and a set of documents, K-NRM uses a translation matrix that models word-level similarities via word embeddings, a new kernel-pooling technique that uses kernels to extract multi-level soft match features, and a learning-to-rank layer that combines those features into the final ranking score. The whole model is trained end-to-end. The ranking layer learns desired feature patterns from the pairwise ranking loss. The kernels transfer the feature patterns into soft-match targets at each similarity level and enforce them on the translation matrix. The word embeddings are tuned accordingly so that they can produce the desired soft matches. Experiments on a commercial search engine's query log demonstrate the improvements of K-NRM over prior feature-based and neural-based states-of-the-art, and explain the source of K-NRM's advantage: Its kernel-guided embedding encodes a similarity metric tailored for matching query words to document words, and provides effective multi-level soft matches.","author":["Chenyan Xiong","Zhuyun Dai","Jamie Callan","Zhiyuan Liu","Russell Power"],"issue":["SIGIR '17: Proceedings of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2017","Pages   55\u201364","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080809"],"date":"07 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

In video hyperlinking, a task that aims at retrieving video segments, the state of the art is a variation of two interlocked networks working in opposing directions. These systems provide good multimodal embeddings and are also capable of translating from one representation space to the other. Operating on representation spaces, these networks lack the ability to operate in the original spaces (text or image), which makes it difficult to visualize the crossmodal function, and do not generalize well to unseen data. Recently, generative adversarial networks have gained popularity and have been used for generating realistic synthetic data and for obtaining high-level, single-modal latent representation spaces. In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of using GANs to obtain multimodal representations. We show that GANs can be used for multimodal representation learning and that they provide multimodal representations that are superior to representations obtained with multimodal autoencoders. Additionally, we illustrate the ability of visualizing crossmodal translations that can provide human-interpretable insights on learned GAN-based video hyperlinking models.","author":["Vedran Vukoti\u0107","Christian Raymond","Guillaume Gravier"],"issue":["ICMR '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval","June 2017","Pages   416\u2013419","https://doi.org/10.1145/3078971.3079038"],"date":"06 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"George Awad, Jonathan Fiscus, Martial Michel, David Joy, Wessel Kraaij, Alan F Smeaton, Georges Qu\u00e9not, Maria Eskevich, Robin Aly, and Roeland Ordelman. 2016.

A popular form of NVM is Battery-backed DRAM, which is available and in use today with DRAMs latency and without the endurance problems of emerging NVM technologies. Modern servers can be provisioned with up-to 4 TB of DRAM, and provisioning battery backup to write out such large memories is hard because of the large battery sizes and the added hardware and cooling costs. We present Viyojit, a system that exploits the skew in write working sets of applications to provision substantially smaller batteries while still ensuring durability for the entire DRAM capacity. Viyojit achieves this by bounding the number of dirty pages in DRAM based on the provisioned battery capacity and proactively writing out infrequently written pages to an SSD. Even for write-heavy workloads with less skew than we observe in analysis of real data center traces, Viyojit reduces the required battery capacity to 11% of the original size, with a performance overhead of 7-25%. Thus, Viyojit frees battery-backed DRAM from stunted growth of battery capacities and enables servers with terabytes of battery-backed DRAM.","author":["Rajat Kateja","Anirudh Badam","Sriram Govindan","Bikash Sharma","Greg Ganger"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   613\u2013626","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080236"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"AGIGARAM Non-Volatile System. http://www.agigatech.com/agigaram.php.","order":1},{"text":"Amazon S3: Amazon Simple Storage Servive. https://aws.amazon.com/s3/.","order":2},{"text":"Azure Blob Storage. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/.","order":3},{"text":"Google's One Battery Per Server Design. https://gigaom.com/2009/04/01/a-key-to-googles-data-center-efficiency-one-backup-battery-per-server/.","order":4},{"text":"HPE Persistent Memory. https://www.hpe.com/us/en/servers/persistent-memory.html.","order":5},{"text":"Inside the Open Compute Project Server at Facebook. https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/inside-the-open-compute-project-server/10150144796738920/.","order":6},{"text":"Intel Nehalem Class Core i7 Processor. http://ark.intel.com/products/37150/Intel-Core-i7-950-Processor-8M-Cache-3_06-GHz-4_80-GTs-Intel-QPI.","order":7},{"text":"Intel Optane/Micron 3d-XPoint Memory. http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/non-volatile-memory.html.","order":8},{"text":"Microsoft Azure. http://azure.microsoft.com.","order":9},{"text":"Microsoft Reinvents Datacenter Power Backup with Lithium-ion Batteries. https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/hybridcloud/2015/03/10/microsoft-reinvents-datacenter-power-backup-with-new-open-compute-project-specification/.","order":10},{"text":"NETLIST's NVvault NVDIMM-N. http://www.netlist.com/products/vault-memory-storage/nvvault-ddr4-nvdimm/default.aspx.","order":11},{"text":"Persistent Memory Emulation. http://pmem.io/2016/02/22/pm-emulation.html.","order":12},{"text":"PMEM: Intel persistent memory library. http://pmem.io.","order":13},{"text":"Redis: in-memory key value store. http://redis.io/.","order":14},{"text":"Samsung 128 GB DIMM. https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-starts-mass-producing-industrys-first-128-gigabyte-ddr4-modules-for-enterprise-servers.","order":15},{"text":"SMART's NVDIMM. http://www.smartm.com/products/dram/NVDIMM_products.asp.","order":16},{"text":"System Support for NVMs in Linux. http://nvdimm.wiki.kernel.org.","order":17},{"text":"Tesla Future of Transportation Session Presentation. https://www.slideshare.net/vvfvilar/jb-16-x9-tesla-vail-global-energy.","order":18},{"text":"Understanding the Linux Virtual Memory Manager. https://www.kernel.org/doc/gorman/pdf/understand.pdf.","order":19},{"text":"Viking Non-Volatile Memory. http://www.vikingtechnology.com/nvdimm-technology.","order":20},{"text":"Joy Arulraj, Andrew Pavlo, and Subramanya R.

We first discuss two popular graph data models: edge-labelled graphs, where nodes are connected by directed, labelled edges, and property graphs, where nodes and edges can further have attributes. Next we discuss the two most fundamental graph querying functionalities: graph patterns and navigational expressions. We start with graph patterns, in which a graph-structured query is matched against the data. Thereafter, we discuss navigational expressions, in which patterns can be matched recursively against the graph to navigate paths of arbitrary length; we give an overview of what kinds of expressions have been proposed and how they can be combined with graph patterns. We also discuss several semantics under which queries using the previous features can be evaluated, what effects the selection of features and semantics has on complexity, and offer examples of such features in three modern languages that are used to query graphs: SPARQL, Cypher, and Gremlin. We conclude by discussing the importance of formalisation for graph query languages; a summary of what is known about SPARQL, Cypher, and Gremlin in terms of expressivity and complexity; and an outline of possible future directions for the area.","author":["Renzo Angles","Marcelo Arenas","Pablo Barcel\u00f3","Aidan Hogan","Juan Reutter","Domagoj Vrgo\u010d"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 50","Issue 5","November 2017","Article No.: 68","pp   1\u201340","https://doi.org/10.1145/3104031"],"date":"26 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"Serge Abiteboul, Richard Hull, and Victor Vianu. 1995.

Significant research endeavors have been devoted to aligning the feature distributions between the source and the target domains in the top fully connected layers based on unsupervised DNN-based models. However, the domain adaptation has been arbitrarily constrained near the output ends of the DNN models, which thus brings about inadequate knowledge transfer in DNN-based domain adaptation process, especially near the input end. We develop an attention transfer process for convolutional domain adaptation. The domain discrepancy, measured in correlation alignment loss, is minimized on the second-order correlation statistics of the attention maps for both source and target domains. Then we propose Deep Unsupervised Convolutional Domain Adaptation DUCDA method, which jointly minimizes the supervised classification loss of labeled source data and the unsupervised correlation alignment loss measured on both convolutional layers and fully connected layers. The multi-layer domain adaptation process collaborately reinforces each individual domain adaptation component, and significantly enhances the generalization ability of the CNN models. Extensive cross-domain object classification experiments show DUCDA outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, and validate the promising power of DUCDA towards large scale real world application.","author":["Junbao Zhuo","Shuhui Wang","Weigang Zhang","Qingming Huang"],"issue":["MM '17: Proceedings of the 25th ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2017","Pages   261\u2013269","https://doi.org/10.1145/3123266.3123292"],"date":"19 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Mahsa Baktashmotlagh, Mehrtash T.

This paper presents a classful Token Bucket Filter (TBF) policy for the Lustre file system. The TBF enforces Remote Procedure Call (RPC) rate limitations based on (potentially complex) Quality of Service (QoS) rules. The QoS rules are enforced in Lustre's Object Storage Servers, where each request is assigned to an automatically created QoS class. The proposed QoS implementation for Lustre enables various features for each class including the support for high-priority and real-time requests even under heavy load and the utilization of spare bandwidth by less important tasks under light load. The framework also enables dependent rules to change a job's RPC rate even at very small timescales. Furthermore, we propose a Global Rate Limiting (GRL) algorithm to enforce system-wide RPC rate limitations.","author":["Yingjin Qian","Xi Li","Shuichi Ihara","Lingfang Zeng","J\u00fcrgen Kaiser","Tim S\u00fc\u00df","Andr\u00e9 Brinkmann"],"issue":["SC '17: Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2017","Article No.: 6","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/3126908.3126932"],"date":"12 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"Jon C.

In-home insomnia monitoring is important for both diagnosis and treatment. Existing solutions, however, require the user to either maintain a sleep diary or wear a sensor while sleeping. Both can be quite cumbersome. This paper introduces EZ-Sleep, a new approach for monitoring insomnia and sleep. EZ-Sleep has three properties. First, it is zero effort, i.e., it neither requires the user to wear a sensor nor to record any data. It monitors the user remotely by analyzing the radio signals that bounce off her body. Second, it delivers new features unavailable with other devices such as automatically detecting where the user sleeps and her exact bed schedule, while simultaneously monitoring multiple users in different beds. Third, it is highly accurate. Its average error in measuring sleep latency and total sleep time is 4.9 min and 10.3 min, respectively.","author":["Chen-Yu Hsu","Aayush Ahuja","Shichao Yue","Rumen Hristov","Zachary Kabelac","Dina Katabi"],"issue":["Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies","Volume 1","Issue 3","September 2017","Article No.: 59","pp   1\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/3130924"],"date":"11 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"2017.

It aims to integrate multiple views by taking advantages of the consensus and complimentary information from multiple views. Most of the existing works in multi-view clustering utilize the vector-based representation for features in each view. However, in many real-world applications, instances are represented by graphs, where those vector-based models cannot fully capture the structure of the graphs from each view. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a Multi-view Clustering framework on graph instances with Graph Embedding (MCGE). Specifically, we model the multi-view graph data as tensors and apply tensor factorization to learn the multi-view graph embeddings, thereby capturing the local structure of graphs. We build an iterative framework by incorporating multi-view graph embedding into the multi-view clustering task on graph instances, jointly performing multi-view clustering and multi-view graph embedding simultaneously. The multi-view clustering results are used for refining the multi-view graph embedding, and the updated multi-view graph embedding results further improve the multi-view clustering. Extensive experiments on two real brain network datasets (i.e., HIV and Bipolar) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MCGE approach in multi-view connectome analysis for clinical investigation and application.","author":["Guixiang Ma","Lifang He","Chun-Ta Lu","Weixiang Shao","Philip S.

In this paper, we explore the reasons for the lack of adoption and posit that the rise of two recent paradigms: Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Analytics (NA), will facilitate the adoption of AI techniques in the context of network operation and control. We describe a new paradigm that accommodates and exploits SDN, NA and AI, and provide use-cases that illustrate its applicability and benefits. We also present simple experimental results that support, for some relevant use-cases, its feasibility.

Significant research has focused on how time, location, interfaces, and a plethora of other contextual features affect recommendations. However, in using deep neural networks for recommender systems, researchers often ignore these contexts or incorporate them as ordinary features in the model. In this paper, we study how to effectively treat contextual data in neural recommender systems. We begin with an empirical analysis of the conventional approach to context as features in feed-forward recommenders and demonstrate that this approach is inefficient in capturing common feature crosses. We apply this insight to design a state-of-the-art RNN recommender system. We first describe our RNN-based recommender system in use at YouTube. Next, we offer \"Latent Cross,\" an easy-to-use technique to incorporate contextual data in the RNN by embedding the context feature first and then performing an element-wise product of the context embedding with model's hidden states. We demonstrate the improvement in performance by using this Latent Cross technique in multiple experimental settings.","author":["Alex Beutel","Paul Covington","Sagar Jain","Can Xu","Jia Li","Vince Gatto","Ed H.

Simple and practical bit-vector algorithms have been designed for this problem, most notably the one used in agrep. These algorithms compute a bit representation of the current state-set of the k-difference automaton for the query, and asymptotically run in either O(nm/w) or O(nm log \u03c3/w) time where w is the word size of the machine (e.g., 32 or 64 in practice), and \u03c3 is the size of the pattern alphabet. Here we present an algorithm  of comparable simplicity that  requires only O(nm/w) time by virtue of computing a bit representation of the relocatable dynamic programming matrix for the problem. Thus, the algorithm's performance is independent of k, and it is found to be more efficient than the previous results for many choices of k and \nsmallm.Moreover, because the algorithm is not \ndependent on k, it can be used to rapidly compute blocks of the dynamic programming matrix as in the 4-Russians algorithm of Wu et al.(1996). This gives rise to an O(kn/w) expected-time algorithm for the case where m may be arbitrarily large. In practice this new algorithm,  that computes a region of the dynamic progr amming (d.p.) matrx w entries at a time using the basic algorithm as a subroutine is significantly faster  than our previous 4-Russians algorithm, that computes the same region 4 or 5 entries at a time using table lookup. This performance improvement yields a code that is either superior or competitive with all existing algorithms except for some filtration algorithms that are superior when k/m is sufficiently small.","author":["Gene Myers"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 46","Issue 3","May 1999","pp   395\u2013415","https://doi.org/10.1145/316542.316550"],"date":"01 May 1999","ref":[{"text":"BAEZA-YATES, R.

Genomics data, however, is far outpacing Moore\u00bbs Law. Third-generation sequencing technologies produce 100X longer reads than second generation technologies and reveal a much broader mutation spectrum of disease and evolution. However, these technologies incur prohibitively high computational costs. Over 1,300 CPU hours are required for reference-guided assembly of the human genome, and over 15,600 CPU hours are required for de novo assembly. This paper describes \"Darwin\" --- a co-processor for genomic sequence alignment that, without sacrificing sensitivity, provides up to $15,000X speedup over the state-of-the-art software for reference-guided assembly of third-generation reads. Darwin achieves this speedup through hardware/algorithm co-design, trading more easily accelerated alignment for less memory-intensive filtering, and by optimizing the memory system for filtering. Darwin combines a hardware-accelerated version of D-SOFT, a novel filtering algorithm, alignment at high speed, and with a hardware-accelerated version of GACT, a novel alignment algorithm. GACT generates near-optimal alignments of arbitrarily long genomic sequences using constant memory for the compute-intensive step. Darwin is adaptable, with tunable speed and sensitivity to match emerging sequencing technologies and to meet the requirements of genomic applications beyond read assembly.","author":["Yatish Turakhia","Gill Bejerano","William J.

We use these annotations for building a morphological segmenter and part-of-speech (POS) tagger for CA. With character-level classification and features from the word and its lexical context, the segmenter achieves a word accuracy of 96.8% with the main issue being a high rate of out-of-vocabulary words. A token-based POS tagger achieves an accuracy of 96.22% with 97.72% on known tokens despite the small size of the corpus. An error analysis shows that most of the tagging errors are results of segmentation and that quality improves with more data being added. The morphological segmenter and tagger have a wide range of potential applications in processing CA, a low-resource variety of the language.","author":["Emad Mohamed"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing","Volume 17","Issue 3","May 2018","Article No.: 22","pp   1\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178459"],"date":"02 April 2018","ref":[{"text":"Musaed Bin-Muqbil. 2006.

Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing block-chain platforms that require \"smart-contracts\" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks. This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.","author":["Elli Androulaki","Artem Barger","Vita Bortnikov","Christian Cachin","Konstantinos Christidis","Angelo De Caro","David Enyeart","Christopher Ferris","Gennady Laventman","Yacov Manevich","Srinivasan Muralidharan","Chet Murthy","Binh Nguyen","Manish Sethi","Gari Singh","Keith Smith","Alessandro Sorniotti","Chrysoula Stathakopoulou","Marko Vukoli\u0107","Sharon Weed Cocco","Jason Yellick"],"issue":["EuroSys '18: Proceedings of the Thirteenth EuroSys Conference","April 2018","Article No.: 30","Pages   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/3190508.3190538"],"date":"23 April 2018","ref":[{"text":"Apache CouchDB. http://couchdb.apache.org.","order":1},{"text":"Apache Kafka. http://kafka.apache.org.","order":2},{"text":"Bitcoin. http://bitcoin.org.","order":3},{"text":"Chain. http://chain.com.","order":4},{"text":"Ethereum. http://ethereum.org.","order":5},{"text":"gRPC. http://grpc.io.","order":6},{"text":"Hyperledger. http://www.hyperledger.org.","order":7},{"text":"Hyperledger Fabric. http://github.com/hyperledger/fabric.","order":8},{"text":"Hyperledger Sawtooth. http://sawtooth.hyperledger.org.","order":9},{"text":"LevelDB in Go. https://github.com/syndtr/goleveldb/.","order":10},{"text":"The Linux Foundation. http://www.linuxfoundation.org.","order":11},{"text":"MultiChain. http://www.multichain.com/.","order":12},{"text":"Quorum. http://www.jpmorgan.com/global/Quorum.","order":13},{"text":"Tendermint. http://tendermint.com.","order":14},{"text":"IBM announces major blockchain solution to speed global payments. https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/53290.wss, 2017.","order":15},{"text":"R.

Booming data volume demands significant computational resources and creates challenges for 'Sequence Alignment', which is the most fundamental application in bioinformatics. Consequently, many researchers exploit both software and hardware methods to accelerate the most widely used sequence alignment algorithm - Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). However, prior work suffers from moving huge DNA databases from the storage to computational units. Such data movement is both time and energy consuming. Based on the observation that the bottlenecks of BLAST involve a large amount of comparison operations, we propose a 3D Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) based DNA Alignment Accelerator Architecture (RADAR) which performs most computational operations locally without moving DNA databases. To improve the storage density for various lengths of DNA sequences without damaging the performance, we propose a dense data mapping scheme to handle DNA sequences efficiently and a Tail Bits Duplication (TBD) technique to enable fully parallel computation for RADAR. Experimental results show that RADAR can achieve 5114x speedup and 386x energy reduction when compared to a single CPU. Compared to the Multi-Core/FPGA/GPU based accelerators, RADAR outperforms them between 53x and 1896x in processing speed.","author":["Wenqin Huangfu","Shuangchen Li","Xing Hu","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["DAC '18: Proceedings of the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2018","Article No.: 59","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3196098"],"date":"24 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Stephen F Altschul, Warren Gish, Webb Miller, Eugene W Myers, and David J Lipman. 1990.

A common optimization strategy for such stencils is to expose sufficient data reuse by means such as loop unrolling, with the expectation of register-level reuse. However, the resulting code is often highly constrained by register pressure. While current state-of-the-art register allocators are satisfactory for most applications, they are unable to effectively manage register pressure for such complex high-order stencils, resulting in sub-optimal code with a large number of register spills. In this paper, we develop a statement reordering framework that models stencil computations as a DAG of trees with shared leaves, and adapts an optimal scheduling algorithm for minimizing register usage for expression trees. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through experimental results on a range of stencils extracted from application codes.","author":["Prashant Singh Rawat","Fabrice Rastello","Aravind Sukumaran-Rajam","Louis-No\u00ebl Pouchet","Atanas Rountev","P.

Since such hybrid DRAM-NVRAM database systems will keep the primary data solely persistent in the NVRAM, efficient replication mechanisms need to be considered to prevent data losses and to guarantee high availability in case of NVDIMM failures. In this paper, we argue for a software-based replication approach and present compute node-local mechanisms to provide the building blocks for an efficient NVRAM replication with a low latency and throughput penalty. Within our evaluation, we measured up to 10x less overhead for our optimized replication mechanisms compared to the basic replication mechanism of the Intel persistent memory development kit (PMDK).","author":["Mikhail Zarubin","Thomas Kissinger","Dirk Habich","Wolfgang Lehner"],"issue":["DAMON '18: Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware","June 2018","Article No.: 7","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/3211922.3211931"],"date":"11 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Alfons Kemper Thomas Neumann Takushi Hashida Kazuichi Oe Yoshiyasu Doi Lilian Harada Sato Mitsuru Alexander van Renen, Viktor Leis. 2018.

These models are often developed and evaluated on datasets with heterogeneous patient populations. However, good predictive performance on the aggregate population does not imply good performance for specific groups. In this work, we present a two-step framework to 1) learn relevant patient subgroups, and 2) predict an outcome for separate patient populations in a multi-task framework, where each population is a separate task. We demonstrate how to discover relevant groups in an unsupervised way with a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder. We show that using these groups in a multi-task framework leads to better predictive performance of in-hospital mortality both across groups and overall. We also highlight the need for more granular evaluation of performance when dealing with heterogeneous populations.","author":["Harini Suresh","Jen J. Gong","John V.

Most existing network embedding models, with shallow or deep architectures, learn vertex representations from the sampled vertex sequences such that the low-dimensional embeddings preserve the locality property and/or global reconstruction capability. The resultant representations, however, are difficult for model generalization due to the intrinsic sparsity of sampled sequences from the input network. As such, an ideal approach to address the problem is to generate vertex representations by learning a probability density function over the sampled sequences. However, in many cases, such a distribution in a low-dimensional manifold may not always have an analytic form. In this study, we propose to learn the network representations with adversarially regularized autoencoders (NetRA). NetRA learns smoothly regularized vertex representations that well capture the network structure through jointly considering both locality-preserving and global reconstruction constraints. The joint inference is encapsulated in a generative adversarial training process to circumvent the requirement of an explicit prior distribution, and thus obtains better generalization performance. We demonstrate empirically how well key properties of the network structure are captured and the effectiveness of NetRA on a variety of tasks, including network reconstruction, link prediction, and multi-label classification.","author":["Wenchao Yu","Cheng Zheng","Wei Cheng","Charu C.

Although most libraries have API reference documentation, it is not easy to find appropriate APIs due to the lexical gap and knowledge gap between the natural language description of the programming task and the API description in API documentation. Here, the lexical gap refers to the fact that the same semantic meaning can be expressed by different words, and the knowledge gap refers to the fact that API documentation mainly describes API functionality and structure but lacks other types of information like concepts and purposes, which are usually the key information in the task description. In this paper, we propose an API recommendation approach named BIKER (Bi-Information source based KnowledgE Recommendation) to tackle these two gaps. To bridge the lexical gap, BIKER uses word embedding technique to calculate the similarity score between two text descriptions. Inspired by our survey findings that developers incorporate Stack Overflow posts and API documentation for bridging the knowledge gap, BIKER leverages Stack Overflow posts to extract candidate APIs for a program task, and ranks candidate APIs by considering the query\u2019s similarity with both Stack Overflow posts and API documentation. It also summarizes supplementary information (e.g., API description, code examples in Stack Overflow posts) for each API to help developers select the APIs that are most relevant to their tasks. Our evaluation with 413 API-related questions confirms the effectiveness of BIKER for both class- and method-level API recommendation, compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Our user study with 28 Java developers further demonstrates the practicality of BIKER for API search.","author":["Qiao Huang","Xin Xia","Zhenchang Xing","David Lo","Xinyu Wang"],"issue":["ASE 2018: Proceedings of the 33rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automated Software Engineering","September 2018","Pages   293\u2013304","https://doi.org/10.1145/3238147.3238191"],"date":"03 September 2018","ref":[{"text":"2017.

However, static and dynamic behaviors and trends of users and items, which highly influence the feasibility of recommendations, were not adequately addressed in previous works. In this work, we leverage the temporal and latent feature modelling capabilities of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), respectively, to propose a Recurrent Generative Adversarial Network (RecGAN). We use customized Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells to capture latent features of users and items observable from short-term and long-term temporal profiles. The modification also includes collaborative filtering mechanisms to improve the relevance of recommended items. We evaluate RecGAN using two datasets on food and movie recommendation. Results indicate that our model outperforms other baseline models irrespective of user behavior and density of training data.","author":["Homanga Bharadhwaj","Homin Park","Brian Y.

The system incorporates a series of novel text analysis procedures that automatically computes (1) a set of social networks detailing who is responding to and/or citing whom in the newsgroup; (2) a set of \u201cdiscussion themes\u201d that are frequently used in the newsgroup archive; and, (3) a set of semantic networks that represent the main terms under discussion and some of their relationships to one another. The text analysis procedures are written in the Perl programming language. Their results are recorded as HTML, and the HTML is displayed with a Java applet. With the Java-based graphical interface one can browse a set of Usenet newsgroup articles according to who is \u201ctalking\u201d to whom, what they are \u201ctalking\u201d about, and the central terms and possible emergent metaphors of the conversation. In this paper it is argued that the Conversation Map system is just one example of a new kind of content-based browser that will combine the analysis powers of computational linguistics with a graphical interface to allow network documents and messages to be viewed in ways not possible with today's, existing, format-based browsers which do not analyze the contents of the documents or messages.","author":["Warren Sack"],"issue":["IUI '00: Proceedings of the 5th international conference on Intelligent user interfaces","January 2000","Pages   233\u2013240","https://doi.org/10.1145/325737.325856"],"date":"09 January 2000","ref":[{"text":"Michael Berthold, Fay Sudweeks, Sid Newton, Richard Coyne. \"It makes sense: Using an autoassociative neural network to explore typicality in computer mediated discussions\" In F.

More recently, unikernels have emerged as a way to reuse VM isolation while also being lightweight by eliminating the general purpose OS (e.g., Linux) from the VM. Instead, unikernels directly run the application (linked with a library OS) on the virtual hardware. In this paper, we show that unikernels do not actually require a virtual hardware abstraction, but can achieve similar levels of isolation when running as processes by leveraging existing kernel system call whitelisting mechanisms. Moreover, we show that running unikernels as processes reduces hardware requirements, enables the use of standard process debugging and management tooling, and improves the already impressive performance that unikernels exhibit.","author":["Dan Williams","Ricardo Koller","Martin Lucina","Nikhil Prakash"],"issue":["SoCC '18: Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing","October 2018","Pages   199\u2013211","https://doi.org/10.1145/3267809.3267845"],"date":"11 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"AWS Lambda. https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/.

In addition to the obvious content-fetching use cases which have been the subject of a large body of work, ICN has also shown promise as a substrate to effectively support remote computation, both pure functional programming (as exemplified by Named Function Networking) and more general remote invocation models such as RPC and web transactions. Providing a unified remote computation capability in ICN presents some unique challenges, among which are timer management, client authorization, and binding to state held by servers, while maintaining the advantages of ICN protocol designs like CCN and NDN. In this paper we present a unified approach to remote function invocation in ICN that exploits the attractive ICN properties of name-based routing, receiver-driven flow and congestion control, flow balance, and object-oriented security while presenting a natural programming model to the application developer.","author":["Micha\u0142 Kr\u00f3l","Karim Habak","David Oran","Dirk Kutscher","Ioannis Psaras"],"issue":["ICN '18: Proceedings of the 5th ACM Conference on Information-Centric Networking","September 2018","Pages   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/3267955.3267956"],"date":"21 September 2018","ref":[{"text":"{n. d.}.

In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based collaborative filtering (CF) framework to provide higher accuracy in recommendation. We first identify a fundamental problem of existing GAN-based methods in CF and highlight it quantitatively via a series of experiments. Next, we suggest a new direction of vector-wise adversarial training to solve the problem and propose our GAN-based CF framework, called CFGAN, based on the direction. We identify a unique challenge that arises when vector-wise adversarial training is employed in CF. We then propose three CF methods realized on top of our CFGAN that are able to address the challenge. Finally, via extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we validate that vector-wise adversarial training employed in CFGAN is really effective to solve the problem of existing GAN-based CF methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed CF methods on CFGAN provide recommendation accuracy consistently and universally higher than those of the state-of-the-art recommenders.","author":["Dong-Kyu Chae","Jin-Soo Kang","Sang-Wook Kim","Jung-Tae Lee"],"issue":["CIKM '18: Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2018","Pages   137\u2013146","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271743"],"date":"17 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Gediminas Adomavicius and Alexander Tuzhilin. 2005.

However, the low area advantage comes at an exponential price in latency, making the area x delay cost unattractive. In this paper, we present a novel method which uses a hybrid binary / unary representation to perform computations. We first divide the input range into a few sub-regions, perform unary computations on each sub-region individually, and finally pack the outputs of all sub-regions back to compact binary. Moreover, we propose a synthesis methodology and a regression model to predict an optimal or sub-optimal design in the design space. The proposed method is especially well-suited to FPGAs due to the abundant availability of routing and flip-flop resources. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show a scalable method based on the principles of stochastic computing that can beat conventional binary in terms of a real cost, i.e., area x delay. Our method outperforms the binary and fully unary methods on a number of functions and on a common edge detection algorithm. In terms of area x delay cost, our cost is on average only 2.51% and 10.2% of the binary for 8- and 10-bit resolutions, respectively. These numbers are 2--3 orders of magnitude better than the results of traditional stochastic methods. Our method is not competitive with the binary method for high-resolution oscillating functions such as sin(15x).","author":["S.

We require that the user data, such as queries, results, and their feature representations are never communicated for the purpose of the ranker's training. We believe this setup is interesting, as it combines unique requirements for the learning algorithm: (a) preserving the user privacy, (b) low communication and computation costs, (c) learning from noisy bandit feedback, and (d) learning with non-continuous ranking quality measures. We propose a learning algorithm FOLtR-ES that satisfies these requirements. A part of FOLtR-ES is a privatization procedure that allows it to provide \u03b5-local differential privacy guarantees, i.e. protecting the clients from an adversary who has access to the communicated messages. This procedure can be applied to any absolute online metric that takes finitely many values or can be discretized to a finite domain. Our experimental study is based on a widely used click simulation approach and publicly available learning to rank datasets MQ2007 and MQ2008. We evaluate FOLtR-ES against offline baselines that are trained using relevance labels, linear regression model and RankingSVM. From our experiments, we observe that FOLtR-ES can optimize a ranking model to perform similarly to the baselines in terms of the optimized online metric, Max Reciprocal Rank.","author":["Eugene Kharitonov"],"issue":["WSDM '19: Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","January 2019","Pages   249\u2013257","https://doi.org/10.1145/3289600.3290968"],"date":"30 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Martin Abadi, Andy Chu, Ian Goodfellow, Brendan McMahan, Ilya Mironov, Kunal Talwar, and Li Zhang. 2016.

The autonomous systems have special requirements of real-time, energy-e cient implementations of DNNs on a power-budgeted system. Two research thrusts are dedicated to per- formance and energy e ciency enhancement of the inference phase of DNNs. The first one is model compression techniques while the second is e cient hardware implementations. Recent researches on extremely-low-bit CNNs such as binary neural network (BNN) and XNOR-Net replace the traditional oating point operations with bi- nary bit operations, signi cantly reducing memory bandwidth and storage requirement, whereas suffering non-negligible accuracy loss and waste of digital signal processing (DSP) blocks on FPGAs. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes REQ-YOLO, a resource aware, systematic weight quantization framework for object detection, considering both algorithm and hardware resource aspects in object detection. We adopt the block-circulant matrix method and propose a heterogeneous weight quantization using Alternative Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), an e ective optimization technique for general, non-convex optimization problems. To achieve real-time, highly efficient implementations on FPGA, we present the detailed hardware implementation of block circulant matrices on CONV layers and de- velop an e cient processing element (PE) structure supporting the heterogeneous weight quantization, CONV data ow and pipelining techniques, design optimization, and a template-based automatic synthesis framework to optimally exploit hardware resource. Experimental results show that our proposed REQ-YOLO framework can signi cantly compress the YOLO model while introducing very small accuracy degradation.

We then present an \u201carchitecture generator\u201d built into the VPR CAD tool [1, 2] that converts this high-level architecture description into a detailed and completely specified flat FPGA architecture. This flat architecture is the representation with which CAD optimization and visualization modules typically work. By allowing FPGA researchers to specify an architecture at a high-level, an architecture generator enables quick and easy \u201cwhat-if\u201d experimentation with a wide range of FPGA architectures. The net effect is a more fully optimized final FPGA architecture. In contrast, when FPGA architects are forced to use more traditional methods of describing an FPGA (such as the manual specification of every switch in the basic file of the FPGA), far less experimentation can be performed in the same time, and the architectures experimented upon are likely to be highly similar, leaving important parts of the design space completely unexplored.This paper describes the automated routing architecture generation problem, and highlights the two key difficulties \u2014 creating an FPGA architecture that matches all of an FPGA architect's specifications, while simultaneously determining good values for the many unspecified portions of an FPGA so that a high quality FPGA results. We describe the method by which we generate FPGA routing architectures automatically, and present several examples.","author":["Vaughn Betz","Jonathan Rose"],"issue":["FPGA '00: Proceedings of the 2000 ACM/SIGDA eighth international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2000","Pages   175\u2013184","https://doi.org/10.1145/329166.329203"],"date":"01 February 2000","ref":[{"text":"V.

Heterogeneous architectures that feature specialized hardware accelerators are widely considered a promising paradigm for resolving this issue. Among different heterogeneous devices, FPGAs that can be reconfigured to accelerate a broad class of applications with orders-of-magnitude performance/watt gains, are attracting increased attention from both academia and industry. As a consequence, a variety of CPU-FPGA acceleration platforms with diversified microarchitectural features have been supplied by industry vendors. Such diversity, however, poses a serious challenge to application developers in selecting the appropriate platform for a specific application or application domain.This article aims to address this challenge by determining which microarchitectural characteristics affect performance, and in what ways. Specifically, we conduct a quantitative comparison and an in-depth analysis on five state-of-the-art CPU-FPGA acceleration platforms: (1) the Alpha Data board and (2) the Amazon F1 instance that represent the traditional PCIe-based platform with private device memory; (3) the IBM CAPI that represents the PCIe-based system with coherent shared memory; (4) the first generation of the Intel Xeon+FPGA Accelerator Platform that represents the QPI-based system with coherent shared memory; and (5) the second generation of the Intel Xeon+FPGA Accelerator Platform that represents a hybrid PCIe-based (non-coherent) and QPI-based (coherent) system with shared memory. Based on the analysis of their CPU-FPGA communication latency and bandwidth characteristics, we provide a series of insights for both application developers and platform designers. Furthermore, we conduct two case studies to demonstrate how these insights can be leveraged to optimize accelerator designs. The microbenchmarks used for evaluation have been released for public use.","author":["Young-Kyu Choi","Jason Cong","Zhenman Fang","Yuchen Hao","Glenn Reinman","Peng Wei"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 12","Issue 1","April 2018","Article No.: 4","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/3294054"],"date":"17 February 2019","ref":[{"text":"Jeff Burt. 2016.

They have been shown to be effective in special-purpose accelerators for a limited set of neural network applications. We present the Programmable Ultra-efficient Memristor-based Accelerator (PUMA) which enhances memristor crossbars with general purpose execution units to enable the acceleration of a wide variety of Machine Learning (ML) inference workloads. PUMA's microarchitecture techniques exposed through a specialized Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) retain the efficiency of in-memory computing and analog circuitry, without compromising programmability. We also present the PUMA compiler which translates high-level code to PUMA ISA. The compiler partitions the computational graph and optimizes instruction scheduling and register allocation to generate code for large and complex workloads to run on thousands of spatial cores. We have developed a detailed architecture simulator that incorporates the functionality, timing, and power models of PUMA's components to evaluate performance and energy consumption. A PUMA accelerator running at 1 GHz can reach area and power efficiency of 577 GOPS/s/mm 2  and 837~GOPS/s/W, respectively. Our evaluation of diverse ML applications from image recognition, machine translation, and language modelling (5M-800M synapses) shows that PUMA achieves up to 2,446\u00d7 energy and 66\u00d7 latency improvement for inference compared to state-of-the-art GPUs. Compared to an application-specific memristor-based accelerator, PUMA incurs small energy overheads at similar inference latency and added programmability.","author":["Aayush Ankit","Izzat El Hajj","Sai Rahul Chalamalasetti","Geoffrey Ndu","Martin Foltin","R.

Convolutional neural networks (CoNNs) belong to one of the most popular types of DNN architectures. This article presents the design and evaluation of an accelerator for CoNNs. The system-level architecture is based on mixed-signal, cellular neural networks (CeNNs). Specifically, we present (i) the implementation of different layers, including convolution, ReLU, and pooling, in a CoNN using CeNN, (ii) modified CoNN structures with CeNN-friendly layers to reduce computational overheads typically associated with a CoNN, (iii) a mixed-signal CeNN architecture that performs CoNN computations in the analog and mixed signal domain, and (iv) design space exploration that identifies what CeNN-based algorithm and architectural features fare best compared to existing algorithms and architectures when evaluated over common datasets\u2014MNIST and CIFAR-10. Notably, the proposed approach can lead to 8.7\u00d7 improvements in energy-delay product (EDP) per digit classification for the MNIST dataset at iso-accuracy when compared with the state-of-the-art DNN engine, while our approach could offer 4.3\u00d7 improvements in EDP when compared to other network implementations for the CIFAR-10 dataset.","author":["Qiuwen Lou","Chenyun Pan","John McGuinness","Andras Horvath","Azad Naeemi","Michael Niemier","X.

As a result, the beams of both the transmitter and the receiver must be constantly aligned. In this paper, the beam alignment (BA) problem is formulated as an adversarial multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, yielding to a distributed BA search between the transmitter and receiver. First, we analyze the optimal codebook size for the BA that reduces the search space while insuring good performance levels. Then, we propose to use the exponential weights algorithm at both the transmitter and the receiver to match their beams. Our distributed algorithm relies on a single bit of feedback information and its performance is demonstrated via numerical results and compared with existing schemes.","author":["Irched Chafaa","E.

Most of existing node embedding algorithms and systems are capable of processing networks with hundreds of thousands or a few millions of nodes. However, how to scale them to networks that have tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of nodes remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose GraphVite, a high-performance CPU-GPU hybrid system for training node embeddings, by co-optimizing the algorithm and the system. On the CPU end, augmented edge samples are parallelly generated by random walks in an online fashion on the network, and serve as the training data. On the GPU end, a novel parallel negative sampling is proposed to leverage multiple GPUs to train node embeddings simultaneously, without much data transfer and synchronization. Moreover, an efficient collaboration strategy is proposed to further reduce the synchronization cost between CPUs and GPUs. Experiments on multiple real-world networks show that GraphVite is super efficient. It takes only about one minute for a network with 1 million nodes and 5 million edges on a single machine with 4 GPUs, and takes around 20 hours for a network with 66 million nodes and 1.8 billion edges. Compared to the current fastest system, GraphVite is about 50 times faster without any sacrifice on performance.","author":["Zhaocheng Zhu","Shizhen Xu","Jian Tang","Meng Qu"],"issue":["WWW '19: The World Wide Web Conference","May 2019","Pages   2494\u20132504","https://doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313508"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, 2016.

We observe that there are two diverse branches of network embedding: for homogeneous graphs and for multi-relational graphs. This paper then proposes MARINE, a unified embedding framework for both homogeneous and multi-relational networks to preserve both the proximity and relation information. We also extend the framework to incorporate existing features of nodes in a graph, which can further be exploited for the ensemble of embedding. Our solution possesses complexity linear to the number of edges, which is suitable for large-scale network applications. Experiments conducted on several real-world network datasets, along with applications in link prediction and multi-label classification, exhibit the superiority of our proposed MARINE.","author":["Ming-Han Feng","Chin-Chi Hsu","Cheng-Te Li","Mi-Yen Yeh","Shou-De Lin"],"issue":["WWW '19: The World Wide Web Conference","May 2019","Pages   470\u2013479","https://doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313715"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Amr Ahmed, Nino Shervashidze, Shravan Narayanamurthy, Vanja Josifovski, and Alexander J.

In this paper, we add a variable bit-width memory unit in a RISC-V processor. Integrating both computation and memory units with variable bit-width leads to a power reduction: from 7% to 29% for Sobel filter application and from 13% to 24% for an application that computes the position of a robotic arm (forwardk2j). We also propose a global energy model for a RISC-V processor with variable bit-width units (for computation and memory).

This news environment has naturally suffered from challenges related to mis- and dis-information, encumbered by an increasingly complex landscape of factors and players including social media services, fact-checkers, censorship policies, and astroturfing. Interviews with 44 Chinese WeChat users were conducted to understand how individuals perceive misinformation and how it impacts their news consumption practices. Overall, this work exposes the diverse attitudes and coping strategies that Chinese users employ in complex social media environments. Due to the complex nature of censorship in China and participants' lack of understanding of censor-ship, they expressed varied opinions about its influence on the credibility of online information sources. Further, although most participants claimed that their opinions would not be easily swayed by astroturfers, many admitted that they could not effectively distinguish astroturfers from ordinary Internet users. Participants' inability to make sense of comments found online lead many participants to hold pro-censorship attitudes: the Government's Dividend.","author":["Zhicong Lu","Yue Jiang","Cheng Lu","Mor Naaman","Daniel Wigdor"],"issue":["CHI '20: Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","April 2020","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376612"],"date":"21 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"Hongyi Bai, Hailun Jiang, and Bin Chen. 2019. 2018 Annual Fake News Research Report (in Chinese).

Previous LSTM-specific architectures set large on-chip memory for weight storage to alleviate the memory-bound issue and facilitate the LSTM inference in cloud computing. In this paper, E-LSTM is proposed for embedded scenarios with the consideration of the chip-area and limited data-access bandwidth. The heterogeneous hardware in E-LSTM tightly couples an LSTM co-processor with an embedded RISC-V CPU. The eSELL format is developed to represent the sparse weight matrix. With the proposed cell fusion optimization based on the inherent sparsity in computation, E-LSTM achieves up to 2.2\u00d7 speedup of processing throughput.","author":["Runbin Shi","Junjie Liu","Hayden K.-H.

Based on the soon-available STT-MRAM, we report the first binary deep convolutional neural network (NV-BNN) capable of both local and remote learning. Exploiting intrinsic cumulative switching probability, accurate online training of CIFAR-10 color images (~ 90%) is realized using a relaxed endurance spec (switching \u2264 20 times) and hybrid digital/IMC design.

The STT-MRAM bitcell and a 2 Mbit macro have been optimized and designed to address the viability of the co-integration process and advantages of vertical channel transistors for STT-MRAM selectors. An architectural system simulator GEM5 has been also employed with Polybench workloads to assess energy saving at system-level. In order to enable this co-integration, four extra masks are required, which costs below 10% in embedded chips. A 36% area reduction can be achieved for the STT-MRAM bitcell implemented with VFET selectors. With a UVLT flavor, the STT-MRAM bitcell comprising of 3-nanosheet could deliver the same performance of the 4-fin LVT FinFET selector. A 2 Mbit STT-MRAM macro designed with VFET selector can offer a 17% and a 21% reduction for read access latency and energy per operation respectively, and a 10% for write energy per operation. A 7% energy saving for the STT-MRAM L2 cache using VFET selector has been observed at the system level with Polybench workloads.","author":["Trong Huynh-Bao","Anabela Veloso","Sushil Sakhare","Philippe Matagne","Julien Ryckaert","Manu Perumkunnil","Davide Crotti","Farrukh Yasin","Alessio Spessot","Arnaud Furnemont","Gouri Kar","Anda Mocuta"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 13","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317886"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"M.

In the proposed constraint DMPs, constraints are simply specified in the two-dimensional decision space. In the same manner, high-dimensional problems and multimodal problems can also be generated. Computational experiments show different behaviors by different algorithms in various constraint DMPs.","author":["Yusuke Nojima","Takafumi Fukase","Yiping Liu","Naoki Masuyama","Hisao Ishibuchi"],"issue":["GECCO '19: Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference","July 2019","Pages   586\u2013594","https://doi.org/10.1145/3321707.3321878"],"date":"13 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"C.

We focus on supporting the operation of the Radio Access Network (RAN) slice broker, which maps slice requirements into allocation of Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs). We first develop a new metric, REVA, based on the number of PRBs available to a single Very Active bearer. REVA is independent of channel conditions and allows easy derivation of an individual wireless link's throughput. In order for the slice broker to efficiently utilize the RAN, there is a need for reliable and short term prediction of resource usage by a slice. To support such prediction, we construct an LTE testbed and develop custom additions to the scheduler. Using data collected from the testbed, we compute REVA and develop a realistic time series prediction model for REVA. Specifically, we present the X-LSTM prediction model, based upon Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Evaluated with data collected in the testbed, X-LSTM outperforms Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) and LSTM neural networks by up to 31%. X-LSTM also achieves over 91% accuracy in predicting REVA. By using X-LSTM to predict future usage, a slice broker is more adept to provision a slice and reduce over-provisioning and SLA violation costs by more than 10% in comparison to LSTM and ARIMA.","author":["Craig Gutterman","Edward Grinshpun","Sameer Sharma","Gil Zussman"],"issue":["Mobihoc '19: Proceedings of the Twentieth ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing","July 2019","Pages   231\u2013240","https://doi.org/10.1145/3323679.3326521"],"date":"02 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"2016.

In this paper, we would like to focus on solving the problem of high-resolution image blending, where the composite images are provided. We propose a framework called Gaussian-Poisson Generative Adversarial Network (GP-GAN) to leverage the strengths of the classical gradient-based approach and Generative Adversarial Networks. To the best of our knowledge, it's the first work that explores the capability of GANs in high-resolution image blending task. Concretely, we propose Gaussian-Poisson Equation to formulate the high-resolution image blending problem, which is a joint optimization constrained by the gradient and color information. Inspired by the prior works, we obtain gradient information via applying gradient filters. To generate the color information, we propose a Blending GAN to learn the mapping between the composite images and the well-blended ones. Compared to the alternative methods, our approach can deliver high-resolution, realistic images with fewer bleedings and unpleasant artifacts. Experiments confirm that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Transient Attributes dataset. A user study on Amazon Mechanical Turk finds that the majority of workers are in favor of the proposed method.

Although numerous accelerator designs are being proposed, how to discover the most efficient way to execute the perfectly nested loop of an application onto computational and memory resources of a given dataflow accelerator (execution method) remains an essential and yet unsolved challenge. In this paper, we propose dMazeRunner -- to efficiently and accurately explore the vast space of the different ways to spatiotemporally execute a perfectly nested loop on dataflow accelerators (execution methods). The novelty of dMazeRunner framework is in: i) a holistic representation of the loop nests, that can succinctly capture the various execution methods, ii) accurate energy and performance models that explicitly capture the computation and communication patterns, data movement, and data buffering of the different execution methods, and iii) drastic pruning of the vast search space by discarding invalid solutions and the solutions that lead to the same cost. Our experiments on various convolution layers (perfectly nested loops) of popular deep learning applications demonstrate that the solutions discovered by dMazeRunner are on average 9.16\u00d7 better in Energy-Delay-Product (EDP) and 5.83\u00d7 better in execution time, as compared to prior approaches. With additional pruning heuristics, dMazeRunner reduces the search time from days to seconds with a mere 2.56% increase in EDP, as compared to the optimal solution.","author":["Shail Dave","Youngbin Kim","Sasikanth Avancha","Kyoungwoo Lee","Aviral Shrivastava"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 18","Issue 5s","October 2019","Article No.: 70","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/3358198"],"date":"08 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Saining Xie, Ross Girshick, Piotr Doll\u00e1r, Zhuowen Tu, and Kaiming He. 2017.

Network-on-Chip (NoC) enables the integration of a large number of processing elements (PEs) in a single die. To design optimized manycore systems, we need to establish suitable trade-offs among multiple objectives including power, performance, and thermal. Therefore, we consider multi-objective design space exploration (MO-DSE) problems arising in the design of NoC-enabled manycore systems: placement of PEs and communication links to optimize two or more objectives (e.g., latency, energy, and throughput). Existing algorithms to solve MO-DSE problems suffer from scalability and accuracy challenges as size of the design space and the number of objectives grow. In this paper, we propose a novel framework referred as Multi-Objective Optimistic Search (MOOS) that performs adaptive design space exploration using a data-driven model to improve the speed and accuracy of multi-objective design optimization process. We apply MOOS to design both 3D heterogeneous and homogeneous manycore systems using Rodinia, PARSEC, and SPLASH2 benchmark suites. We demonstrate that MOOS improves the speed of finding solutions compared to state-of-the-art methods by up to 13X while uncovering designs that are up to 20% better in terms of NoC. The optimized 3D manycore systems improve the EDP up to 38% when compared to 3D mesh-based designs optimized for the placement of PEs.","author":["Aryan Deshwal","Nitthilan Kanappan Jayakodi","Biresh Kumar Joardar","Janardhan Rao Doppa","Partha Pratim Pande"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 18","Issue 5s","October 2019","Article No.: 77","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3358206"],"date":"08 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Peter Auer, Nicolo Cesa-Bianchi, and Paul Fischer. 2002.

However, most GNNs are designed for homogeneous graphs, in which all nodes and edges belong to the same types, making it infeasible to represent heterogeneous structures. In this paper, we present the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) architecture for modeling Web-scale heterogeneous graphs. To model heterogeneity, we design node- and edge-type dependent parameters to characterize the heterogeneous attention over each edge, empowering HGT to maintain dedicated representations for different types of nodes and edges. To handle Web-scale graph data, we design the heterogeneous mini-batch graph sampling algorithm\u2014HGSampling\u2014for efficient and scalable training. Extensive experiments on the Open Academic Graph of 179 million nodes and 2 billion edges show that the proposed HGT model consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art GNN baselines by 9\u201321 on various downstream tasks.

It is challenging to accelerate training of GCNs, due to (1) substantial and irregular data communication to propagate information within the graph, and (2) intensive computation to propagate information along the neural network layers. To address these challenges, we design a novel accelerator for training GCNs on CPU-FPGA heterogeneous systems, by incorporating multiple algorithm-architecture co-optimizations. We first analyze the computation and communication characteristics of various GCN training algorithms, and select a subgraph-based algorithm that is well suited for hardware execution. To optimize the feature propagation within subgraphs, we propose a light-weight pre-processing step based on a graph theoretic approach. Such pre-processing performed on the CPU significantly reduces the memory access requirements and the computation to be performed on the FPGA. To accelerate the weight update in GCN layers, we propose a systolic array based design for efficient parallelization. We integrate the above optimizations into a complete hardware pipeline, and analyze its load-balance and resource utilization by accurate performance modeling. We evaluate our design on a Xilinx Alveo U200 board hosted by a 40-core Xeon server. On three large graphs, we achieve an order of magnitude training speedup with negligible accuracy loss, compared with state-of-the-art implementation on a multi-core platform.","author":["Hanqing Zeng","Viktor Prasanna"],"issue":["FPGA '20: Proceedings of the 2020 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2020","Pages   255\u2013265","https://doi.org/10.1145/3373087.3375312"],"date":"23 February 2020","ref":[{"text":"[n. d.].

Unfortunately, the cost model of Bluespec has been unclear, with performance details depending on a mix of user hints and opaque static analysis of potential concurrency conflicts within a design. In this paper we present Koika, a derivative of Bluespec that preserves its desirable properties and yet gives direct control over the scheduling decisions that determine performance. Koika has a novel and deterministic operational semantics that uses dynamic analysis to avoid concurrency anomalies. Our implementation includes Coq definitions of syntax, semantics, key metatheorems, and a verified compiler to circuits. We argue that most of the extra circuitry required for dynamic analysis can be eliminated by compile-time BSV-style static analysis.","author":["Thomas Bourgeat","Cl\u00e9ment Pit-Claudel","Adam Chlipala","Arvind"],"issue":["PLDI 2020: Proceedings of the 41st ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation","June 2020","Pages   243\u2013257","https://doi.org/10.1145/3385412.3385965"],"date":"11 June 2020","ref":[{"text":"Abhinav Agarwal, Man Cheuk Ng, and Arvind. 2010.

In contrast to the floating point (FP) representation, posit provides variable precision with a fixed number of total bits (i.e., tapered accuracy). Posit can represent a set of numbers with higher precision than FP and has garnered significant interest in various domains. The posit ecosystem currently does not have a native general-purpose math library. This paper presents our results in developing a math library for posits using the CORDIC method. CORDIC is an iterative algorithm to approximate trigonometric functions by rotating a vector with different angles in each iteration. This paper proposes two extensions to the CORDIC algorithm to account for tapered accuracy with posits that improves precision: (1) fast-forwarding of iterations to start the CORDIC algorithm at a later iteration and (2) the use of a wide accumulator (i.e., the quire data type) to minimize precision loss with accumulation. Our results show that a 32-bit posit implementation of trigonometric functions with our extensions is more accurate than a 32-bit FP implementation.","author":["Jay P.

The end of Moore's law and process scaling as well as the memory wall associated with von Neumann architectures have throttled the rapid development of conventional architectures based on CMOS technology, and cross-layer efforts that involve the interactions from low-end devices to high-end applications have been prominently studied to overcome the aforementioned challenges. On one hand, various emerging devices, e.g., Ferroelectric FET, have been proposed to either sustain the scaling trends or enable novel circuit and architecture innovations. On the other hand, novel computing architectures/algorithms, e.g., computing-in-memory (CiM), have been proposed to address the challenges faced by conventional von Neumann architectures. Naturally, integrated approaches across the emerging devices and computing architectures/algorithms for data-intensive applications are of great interests. This paper uses the FeFET as a representative device, and discuss about the challenges, opportunities and contributions for the emerging trends of cross-layer co-design for CiM.","author":["Hussam Amrouch","Xiaobo Sharon Hu","Mohsen Imani","Ann Franchesca Laguna","Michael Niemier","Simon Thomann","Xunzhao Yin","Cheng Zhuo"],"issue":["ASPDAC '21: Proceedings of the 26th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2021","Pages   132\u2013139","https://doi.org/10.1145/3394885.3431617"],"date":"18 January 2021","ref":[{"text":"D.

In each system, a user can operate a robot arm having a force sensor by using a haptic interface device while watching video. An electric hand is attached to the robot arm to hold an object. In the robot-robot case, we also make a comparison of the efficiency between the case where the position follow-up control previously proposed by us is carried out and the case where the control is not performed. In our experiment, a human or one robot arm hand-delivers an object to the other moving robot arm. Experiment results illustrate that the efficiency of the hand delivery of the object can be improved under the position follow-up control; however, the force applied to the object is somewhat larger than that in the human-robot case.","author":["Qin Qian","Yutaka Ishibashi","Pingguo Huang","Yuichiro Tateiwa"],"issue":["ICIET 2020: Proceedings of the 2020 8th International Conference on Information and Education Technology","March 2020","Pages   306\u2013310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3395245.3396418"],"date":"28 March 2020","ref":[{"text":"Iwano, Y., Osuka, K., and Amano, H. 2005.

The platform combines a modular tile-based architecture with a variety of application-oriented flows for the design and optimization of accelerators. The ESP architecture is highly scalable and strikes a balance between regularity and specialization. The companion methodology raises the level of abstraction to system-level design and enables an automated flow from software and hardware development to full-system prototyping on FPGA. For application developers, ESP offers domain-specific automated solutions to synthesize new accelerators for their software and to map complex workloads onto the SoC architecture. For hardware engineers, ESP offers automated solutions to integrate their accelerator designs into the complete SoC. Conceived as a heterogeneous integration platform and tested through years of teaching at Columbia University, ESP supports the open-source hardware community by providing a flexible platform for agile SoC development.","author":["Paolo Mantovani","Davide Giri","Giuseppe Di Guglielmo","Luca Piccolboni","Joseph Zuckerman","Emilio G.

Such networks have compact models in which weights are constrained to only 1 bit and can be packed several in one memory entry that minimizes memory footprint to its finest. Packing weights also facilitates executing single instruction, multiple data with simple circuitry that allows maximizing performance and efficiency. The proposed BiNMAC has light-weight cores that support domain-specific instructions, and a router-based memory access architecture that helps with efficient implementation of layers in binary precision weight/activation neural networks of proper size. With only 3.73% and 1.98% area and average power overhead, respectively, novel instructions such as Combined Population-Count-XNOR, Patch-Select, and Bit-based Accumulation are added to the instruction set architecture of the BiNMAC, each of which replaces execution cycles of frequently used functions with 1 clock cycle that otherwise would have taken 54, 4, and 3 clock cycles, respectively. Additionally, customized logic is added to every core to transpose 16\u00d716-bit blocks of memory on a bit-level basis, that expedites reshaping intermediate data to be well-aligned for bitwise operations. A 64-cluster architecture of the BiNMAC is fully placed and routed in 65-nm TSMC CMOS technology, where a single cluster occupies an area of 0.53 mm2 with an average power of 232\u00a0mW at 1-GHz clock frequency and 1.1\u00a0V. The 64-cluster architecture takes 36.5\u00a0mm2 area and, if fully exploited, consumes a total power of 16.4\u00a0W and can perform 1,360 Giga Operations Per Second (GOPS) while providing full programmability. To demonstrate its scalability, four binarized case studies including ResNet-20 and LeNet-5 for high-performance image classification, as well as a ConvNet and a multilayer perceptron for low-power physiological applications were implemented on BiNMAC. The implementation results indicate that the population-count instruction alone can expedite the performance by approximately 5\u00d7. When other new instructions are added to a RISC machine with existing population-count instruction, the performance is increased by 58% on average. To compare the performance of the BiNMAC with other commercial-off-the-shelf platforms, the case studies with their double-precision floating-point models are also implemented on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 SoC (CPU+GPU). The results indicate that, within a margin of \u223c2.1%--9.5% accuracy loss, BiNMAC on average outperforms the TX2 GPU by approximately 1.9\u00d7 (or 7.5\u00d7 with fabrication technology scaled) in energy consumption for image classification applications. On low power settings and within a margin of \u223c3.7%--5.5% accuracy loss compared to ARM Cortex-A57 CPU implementation, BiNMAC is roughly \u223c9.7\u00d7--17.2\u00d7 (or 38.8\u00d7--68.8\u00d7 with fabrication technology scaled) more energy efficient for physiological applications while meeting the application deadline.","author":["Morteza Hosseini","Tinoosh Mohsenin"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 17","Issue 2","April 2021","Article No.: 19","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/3423136"],"date":"05 April 2021","ref":[{"text":"T.

However, success has been accompanied with a major new arising challenge: Many applications of machine learning (ML) are adversarial in nature [146]. In recent years, it has been shown that these methods are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., subtle but non-random perturbations designed to force recommendation models to produce erroneous outputs.The goal of this survey is two-fold: (i) to present recent advances on adversarial machine learning (AML) for the security of RS (i.e., attacking and defense recommendation models) and (ii) to show another successful application of AML in generative adversarial networks (GANs) for generative applications, thanks to their ability for learning (high-dimensional) data distributions. In this survey, we provide an exhaustive literature review of 76 articles published in major RS and ML journals and conferences.

We also use analogy when we learn subjects like economics, medicine, and law. This paper presents a theory of analogy and describes an implemented system that embodies the theory. The specific competence to be understood is that of using analogies to do certain kinds of learning and reasoning. Learning takes place when analogy is used to generate a constraint description in one domain, given a constraint description in another, as when we learn Ohm's law by way of knowledge about water pipes. Reasoning takes place when analogy is used to answer questions about one situation, given another situation that is supposed to be a precedent, as when we answer questions about Hamlet by way of knowledge about Macbeth.","author":["Patrick H.

In this paper, we present a dynamic programming approach to cut sequence generation. If certain assumptions hold, these sequences are optimal. After study of these optimal sequences, we observe that an extremely simple method can be used to construct sequences that are near optimal.Using this method, our bisection based placement tool Feng Shui outperforms the previously presented Capo tool by 11% on a large benchmark. By integrating our cut sequence method into Capo, we are able to improve performance by 5%, bringing the results of Feng Shui and Capo closer together.","author":["Mehmet Can Yildiz","Patrick H.

Partial synchrony lies between the cases of a synchronous system and an asynchronous system. In a synchronous system, there is a known fixed upper bound \u0394 on the time required for a message to be sent from one processor to another and a known fixed upper bound \u03a6 on the relative speeds of different processors. In an asynchronous system no fixed upper bounds \u0394 and \u03a6 exist. In one version of partial synchrony, fixed bounds \u0394 and \u03a6 exist, but they are not known a priori. The problem is to design protocols that work correctly in the partially synchronous system regardless of the actual values of the bounds \u0394 and \u03a6. In another version of partial synchrony, the bounds are known, but are only guaranteed to hold starting at some unknown time T, and protocols must be designed to work correctly regardless of when time T occurs. Fault-tolerant consensus protocols are given for various cases of partial synchrony and various fault models. Lower bounds that show in most cases that our protocols are optimal with respect to the number of faults tolerated are also given. Our consensus protocols for partially synchronous processors use new protocols for fault-tolerant \u201cdistributed clocks\u201d that allow partially synchronous processors to reach some approximately common notion of time.","author":["Cynthia Dwork","Nancy Lynch","Larry Stockmeyer"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 35","Issue 2","April 1988","pp   288\u2013323","https://doi.org/10.1145/42282.42283"],"date":"01 April 1988","ref":[{"text":"ATTIYA, A., DOLEV, D., AND GIL, J.

In particular, recent events have illustrated the Internet's vulnerability to both denial of service (DoS) attacks and flash crowds in which one or more links in the network (or servers at the edge of the network) become severely congested. In both DoS attacks and flash crowds the congestion is due neither to a single flow, nor to a general increase in traffic, but to a well-defined subset of the traffic --- an aggregate. This paper proposes mechanisms for detecting and controlling such high bandwidth aggregates. Our design involves both a local mechanism for detecting and controlling an aggregate at a single router, and a cooperative pushback mechanism in which a router can ask upstream routers to control an aggregate. While certainly not a panacea, these mechanisms could provide some needed relief from flash crowds and flooding-style DoS attacks. The presentation in this paper is a first step towards a more rigorous evaluation of these mechanisms.","author":["Ratul Mahajan","Steven M.

Our type system allows programmers to partition the locks into a fixed number of equivalence classes and specify a partial order among the equivalence classes. The type checker then statically verifies that whenever a thread holds more than one lock, the thread acquires the locks in the descending order.Our system also allows programmers to use recursive tree-based data structures to describe the partial order. For example, programmers can specify that nodes in a tree must be locked in the tree order. Our system allows mutations to the data structure that change the partial order at runtime. The type checker statically verifies that the mutations do not introduce cycles in the partial order, and that the changing of the partial order does not lead to deadlocks. We do not know of any other sound static system for preventing deadlocks that allows changes to the partial order at runtime.Our system uses a variant of ownership types to prevent data races and deadlocks. Ownership types provide a statically enforceable way of specifying object encapsulation. Ownership types are useful for preventing data races and deadlocks because the lock that protects an object can also protect its encapsulated objects. This paper describes how to use our type system to statically enforce object encapsulation as well as prevent data races and deadlocks. The paper also contains a detailed discussion of different ownership type systems and the encapsulation guarantees they provide.","author":["Chandrasekhar Boyapati","Robert Lee","Martin Rinard"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 37","Issue 11","November 2002","pp   211\u2013230","https://doi.org/10.1145/583854.582440"],"date":"04 November 2002","ref":[{"text":"O.

This paper extends the definition of silent stores to encompass sets of stores that change the value stored at a memory location, but only temporarily, and subsequently return a previous value of interest to the memory location. The stores that cause the value to revert are called temporally silent stores. We redefine multiprocessor sharing to account for temporal silence and show that in the limit, up to 45% of communication misses in scientific and commercial applications can be eliminated by exploiting values that change only temporarily. We describe a practical mechanism that detects temporally silent stores and removes the coherence traffic they cause in conventional multiprocessors. We find that up to 42% of communication misses can be eliminated with a simple extension to the MESI protocol. Further, we examine application and operating system code to provide insight into the temporal silence phenomenon and characterize temporal silence by examining value frequencies and dynamic instruction distances between temporally silent pairs. These studies indicate that the operating system is involved heavily in temporal silence, in both commercial and scientific workloads, and that while detectable synchronization primitives provide substantial contributions, significant opportunity exists outside these references.","author":["Kevin M.

In many cases, such networks contain multiple types of objects and links, as well as different kinds of attributes. The clustering of these objects can provide useful insights in many applications. However, the clustering of such networks can be challenging since (a) the attribute values of objects are often incomplete, which implies that an object may carry only partial attributes or even no attributes to correctly label itself; and (b) the links of different types may carry different kinds of semantic meanings, and it is a difficult task to determine the nature of their relative importance in helping the clustering for a given purpose. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a model-based clustering algorithm. We design a probabilistic model which clusters the objects of different types into a common hidden space, by using a user-specified set of attributes, as well as the links from different relations. The strengths of different types of links are automatically learned, and are determined by the given purpose of clustering. An iterative algorithm is designed for solving the clustering problem, in which the strengths of different types of links and the quality of clustering results mutually enhance each other. Our experimental results on real and synthetic data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm.","author":["Yizhou Sun","Charu C.

GeoSNs have created a fertile ground for novel location-based social interactions and advertising. These can be facilitated by GeoSN queries, which extract useful information combining both the social relationships and the current location of the users. This paper constitutes the first systematic work on GeoSN query processing. We propose a general framework that offers flexible data management and algorithmic design. Our architecture segregates the social, geographical and query processing modules. Each GeoSN query is processed via a transparent combination of primitive queries issued to the social and geographical modules. We demonstrate the power of our framework by introducing several \"basic\" and \"advanced\" query types, and devising various solutions for each type. Finally, we perform an exhaustive experimental evaluation with real and synthetic datasets, based on realistic implementations with both commercial software (such as MongoDB) and state-of-the-art research methods.

Answering vertex join queries over large graphs is meaningful and interesting, which can benefit friend recommendation in social networks and link prediction, etc. In this paper, we adopt \"SimRank\" to evaluate the similarity of two vertices in a large graph because of its generality. Note that \"SimRank\" is purely structure dependent and it does not rely on the domain knowledge. Specifically, we define a SimRank-based join (SRJ) query to find all the vertex pairs satisfying the threshold in a data graph G. In order to reduce the search space, we propose an estimated shortest-path distance based upper bound for SimRank scores to prune unpromising vertex pairs. In the verification, we propose a novel index, called h-go cover, to efficiently compute the SimRank score of a single vertex pair. Given a graph G, we only materialize the SimRank scores of a small proportion of vertex pairs (called h-go covers), based on which, the SimRank score of any vertex pair can be computed easily. In order to handle large graphs, we extend our technique to the partition-based framework. Thorough theoretical analysis and extensive experiments over both real and synthetic datasets confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our solution.","author":["Weiguo Zheng","Lei Zou","Yansong Feng","Lei Chen","Dongyan Zhao"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 7","May 2013","pp   493\u2013504","https://doi.org/10.14778/2536349.2536350"],"date":"01 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"Z.

Due to the lack of structure support, a keyword query might generate an excessive number of matches, referred to as \"answer graphs\", that could include different relationships among keywords. An ignored yet important task is to group and summarize answer graphs that share similar structures and contents for better query interpretation and result understanding. This paper studies the summarization problem for the answer graphs induced by a keyword query Q. (1) A notion of summary graph is proposed to characterize the summarization of answer graphs. Given Q and a set of answer graphs G, a summary graph preserves the relation of the keywords in Q by summarizing the paths connecting the keywords nodes in G. (2) A quality metric of summary graphs, called coverage ratio, is developed to measure information loss of summarization. (3) Based on the metric, a set of summarization problems are formulated, which aim to find minimized summary graphs with certain coverage ratio. (a) We show that the complexity of these summarization problems ranges from ptime to NP-complete. (b) We provide exact and heuristic summarization algorithms. (4) Using real-life and synthetic graphs, we experimentally verify the effectiveness and the efficiency of our techniques.","author":["Yinghui Wu","Shengqi Yang","Mudhakar Srivatsa","Arun Iyengar","Xifeng Yan"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 14","September 2013","pp   1774\u20131785","https://doi.org/10.14778/2556549.2556561"],"date":"01 September 2013","ref":[{"text":"C.

In order to improve performance given high disk latency, these systems use a multi-threaded architecture with dynamic record-level locking that allows multiple transactions to access the database at the same time. Previous research has shown that this results in substantial overhead for on-line transaction processing (OLTP) applications [15].The next generation DBMSs seek to overcome these limitations with architecture based on main memory resident data. To overcome the restriction that all data fit in main memory, we propose a new technique, called anti-caching, where cold data is moved to disk in a transactionally-safe manner as the database grows in size. Because data initially resides in memory, an anti-caching architecture reverses the traditional storage hierarchy of disk-based systems. Main memory is now the primary storage device.We implemented a prototype of our anti-caching proposal in a high-performance, main memory OLTP DBMS and performed a series of experiments across a range of database sizes, workload skews, and read/write mixes. We compared its performance with an open-source, disk-based DBMS optionally fronted by a distributed main memory cache. Our results show that for higher skewed workloads the anti-caching architecture has a performance advantage over either of the other architectures tested of up to 9\u00d7 for a data size 8\u00d7 larger than memory.","author":["Justin DeBrabant","Andrew Pavlo","Stephen Tu","Michael Stonebraker","Stan Zdonik"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 14","September 2013","pp   1942\u20131953","https://doi.org/10.14778/2556549.2556575"],"date":"01 September 2013","ref":[{"text":"eXtremeDB. http://www.mcobject.com.","order":1},{"text":"H-Store. http://hstore.cs.brown.edu.","order":2},{"text":"MemSQL. http://www.memsql.com.","order":3},{"text":"VoltDB. http://www.voltdb.com.","order":4},{"text":"Oracle TimesTen Products and Technologies.

Developers should be able to leverage high-level programming languages without having to pay a price in efficiency. To realize our vision of abstraction without regret, we present LegoBase, a query engine written in the high-level programming language Scala. The key technique to regain efficiency is to apply generative programming: the Scala code that constitutes the query engine, despite its high-level appearance, is actually a program generator that emits specialized, low-level C code. We show how the combination of high-level and generative programming allows to easily implement a wide spectrum of optimizations that are difficult to achieve with existing low-level query compilers, and how it can continuously optimize the query engine.We evaluate our approach with the TPC-H benchmark and show that: (a) with all optimizations enabled, our architecture significantly outperforms a commercial in-memory database system as well as an existing query compiler, (b) these performance improvements require programming just a few hundred lines of high-level code instead of complicated low-level code that is required by existing query compilers and, finally, that (c) the compilation overhead is low compared to the overall execution time, thus making our approach usable in practice for efficiently compiling query engines.","author":["Yannis Klonatos","Christoph Koch","Tiark Rompf","Hassan Chafi"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 10","June 2014","pp   853\u2013864","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732951.2732959"],"date":"01 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"D.

We build on this comprehensive study to raise awareness of the fact that empirical running time performance findings in main-memory settings are results of not only the algorithms and data structures employed, but also their implementation, which complicates the interpretation of the results.In particular, we re-implement the worst performing technique without changing the underlying high-level algorithm, and we then offer evidence that the resulting re-implementation is capable of outperforming all the other techniques. This study demonstrates that in main memory, where no time-consuming I/O can mask variations in implementation, implementation details are very important; and it offers a concrete illustration of how it is difficult to make conclusions from empirical running time performance findings in main-memory settings about data structures and algorithms studied.","author":["Darius \u0160idlauskas","Christian S.

Users frequently express these complex analytics tasks as workflows of user-defined functions (UDFs) that specify each algorithmic step. However, given typical hardware configurations and dataset sizes, the core challenge of complex analytics is no longer sheer data volume but rather the computation itself, and the next generation of analytics frameworks must focus on optimizing for this computation bottleneck. While query compilation has gained widespread popularity as a way to tackle the computation bottleneck for traditional SQL workloads, relatively little work addresses UDF-centric workflows in the domain of complex analytics.In this paper, we describe a novel architecture for automatically compiling workflows of UDFs. We also propose several optimizations that consider properties of the data, UDFs, and hardware together in order to generate different code on a case-by-case basis. To evaluate our approach, we implemented these techniques in Tupleware, a new high-performance distributed analytics system, and our benchmarks show performance improvements of up to three orders of magnitude compared to alternative systems.","author":["Andrew Crotty","Alex Galakatos","Kayhan Dursun","Tim Kraska","Carsten Binnig","Ugur Cetintemel","Stan Zdonik"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 12","August 2015","pp   1466\u20131477","https://doi.org/10.14778/2824032.2824045"],"date":"01 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"Apache Hadoop. http://hadoop.apache.org.","order":1},{"text":"BLAS. http://netlib.org/blas/.","order":2},{"text":"Lists of instruction latencies, throughputs and micro-operation breakdowns for Intel, AMD and VIA CPUs. http://agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf.","order":3},{"text":"Mahout. http://mahout.apache.org/.","order":4},{"text":"Matlab. http://mathworks.com/products/matlab/.","order":5},{"text":"MLlib. http://spark.apache.org/mllib/.","order":6},{"text":"R Project. http://r-project.org/.","order":7},{"text":"UK Crime Dataset. http://data.police.uk/.","order":8},{"text":"Wikipedia Webgraph. http://dumps.wikimedia.org/.","order":9},{"text":"S.

However, due to the openness of crowdsourcing, workers may yield low-quality answers, and a redundancy-based method is widely employed, which first assigns each task to multiple workers and then infers the correct answer (called truth) for the task based on the answers of the assigned workers. A fundamental problem in this method is Truth Inference, which decides how to effectively infer the truth. Recently, the database community and data mining community independently study this problem and propose various algorithms. However, these algorithms are not compared extensively under the same framework and it is hard for practitioners to select appropriate algorithms. To alleviate this problem, we provide a detailed survey on 17 existing algorithms and perform a comprehensive evaluation using 5 real datasets. We make all codes and datasets public for future research. Through experiments we find that existing algorithms are not stable across different datasets and there is no algorithm that outperforms others consistently. We believe that the truth inference problem is not fully solved, and identify the limitations of existing algorithms and point out promising research directions.","author":["Yudian Zheng","Guoliang Li","Yuanbing Li","Caihua Shan","Reynold Cheng"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 5","January 2017","pp   541\u2013552","https://doi.org/10.14778/3055540.3055547"],"date":"01 January 2017","ref":[{"text":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/RequesterUI/amt-ui.pdf.","order":1},{"text":"Amazon mechanical turk. https://www.mturk.com/.","order":2},{"text":"Chi-squared. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution.","order":3},{"text":"Adult Datset. https://github.com/ipeirotis/Get-Another-Label/tree/master/data.","order":4},{"text":"B.

In applications such as analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, citation graphs, and collaboration networks, nodes tend to have attributes. Unfortunately, most previous community search algorithms ignore attributes and result in communities with poor cohesion w.r.t. their node attributes. In this paper, we study the problem of attribute-driven community search, that is, given an undirected graph G where nodes are associated with attributes, and an input query Q consisting of nodes Vq and attributes Wq, find the communities containing Vq, in which most community members are densely inter-connected and have similar attributes.We formulate this problem as finding attributed truss communities (ATC), i.e., finding connected and close k-truss subgraphs containing Vq, with the largest attribute relevance score. We design a framework of desirable properties that good score function should satisfy. We show that the problem is NP-hard. However, we develop an efficient greedy algorithmic framework to iteratively remove nodes with the least popular attributes, and shrink the graph into an ATC. In addition, we also build an elegant index to maintain k-truss structure and attribute information, and propose efficient query processing algorithms. Extensive experiments on large real-world networks with ground-truth communities show that our algorithms significantly outperform the state of the art and demonstrates their efficiency and effectiveness.","author":["Xin Huang","Laks V.

While almost all ML tools require the input data to be presented as a single table, many datasets are multi-table. This forces data scientists to join those tables first, which often leads to data redundancy and runtime waste. Recent works on \"factorized\" ML mitigate this issue for a few specific ML algorithms by pushing ML through joins. But their approaches require a manual rewrite of ML implementations. Such piecemeal methods create a massive development overhead when extending such ideas to other ML algorithms. In this paper, we show that it is possible to mitigate this overhead by leveraging a popular formal algebra to represent the computations of many ML algorithms: linear algebra. We introduce a new logical data type to represent normalized data and devise a framework of algebraic rewrite rules to convert a large set of linear algebra operations over denormalized data into operations over normalized data. We show how this enables us to automatically \"factorize\" several popular ML algorithms, thus unifying and generalizing several prior works. We prototype our framework in the popular ML environment R and an industrial R-over-RDBMS tool. Experiments with both synthetic and real normalized data show that our framework also yields significant speed-ups, up to 36x on real data.","author":["Lingjiao Chen","Arun Kumar","Jeffrey Naughton","Jignesh M.

One popular write-optimized index is the Log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree) which provides indexed access to write-intensive data. It has been increasingly used as a storage backbone for many services, including file system metadata management, graph processing engines, and machine learning feature storage engines. Existing LSM-tree implementations often exhibit high write amplifications caused by compaction, and lack optimizations to maximize read performance on solid-state disks. The goal of this paper is to explore techniques that leverage common workload characteristics shared by many systems using key-value stores to reduce the read/write amplification overhead typically associated with general-purpose LSM-tree implementations. Our experiments show that by applying these design techniques, our new implementation of a key-value store, SlimDB, can be two to three times faster, use less memory to cache metadata indices, and show lower tail latency in read operations compared to popular LSM-tree implementations such as LevelDB and RocksDB.","author":["Kai Ren","Qing Zheng","Joy Arulraj","Garth Gibson"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 13","September 2017","pp   2037\u20132048","https://doi.org/10.14778/3151106.3151108"],"date":"01 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"T.

It is a challenging and fundamental task in data cleansing and data integration. In this work, we propose graph differential dependencies (GDDs) as an extension of the recently developed graph entity dependencies (which are formal constraints for graph data) to enable approximate matching of values. Furthermore, we investigate a special discovery of GDDs for ER by designing an algorithm for generating a non-redundant set of GDDs in labelled data. Then, we develop an effective ER technique, Certus, that employs the learned GDDs for improving the accuracy of ER results. We perform extensive empirical evaluation of our proposals on five real-world ER benchmark datasets and a proprietary database to test their effectiveness and efficiency. The results from the experiments show the discovery algorithm and Certus are efficient; and more importantly, GDDs significantly improve the precision of ER without considerable trade-off of recall.","author":["Selasi Kwashie","Lin Liu","Jixue Liu","Markus Stumptner","Jiuyong Li","Lujing Yang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 12","Issue 6","February 2019","pp   653\u2013666","https://doi.org/10.14778/3311880.3311883"],"date":"01 February 2019","ref":[{"text":"Cora dataset. http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/data/cora-refs.tar.gz.

Existing approaches rely on features and performance models engineered by human experts, but often fail to capture the complex interactions between query operators and input relations, and generally do not adapt naturally to workload characteristics and patterns in query execution plans. In this paper, we argue that deep learning can be applied to the query performance prediction problem, and we introduce a novel neural network architecture for the task: a plan-structured neural network. Our neural network architecture matches the structure of any optimizer-selected query execution plan and predict its latency with high accuracy, while eliminating the need for human-crafted input features. A number of optimizations are also proposed to reduce training overhead without sacrificing effectiveness. We evaluated our techniques on various workloads and we demonstrate that our approach can out-perform the state-of-the-art in query performance prediction.","author":["Ryan Marcus","Olga Papaemmanouil"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 12","Issue 11","July 2019","pp   1733\u20131746","https://doi.org/10.14778/3342263.3342646"],"date":"01 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"MySQL database, https://www.mysql.com/.","order":1},{"text":"PostgreSQL database, http://www.postgresql.org/.","order":2},{"text":"SQLite database, https://www.sqlite.org.","order":3},{"text":"TPC-H skewed, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52430.","order":4},{"text":"M.

We have recently reported on two new word-sense disambiguation systems, one trained on bilingual material (the Canadian Hansards) and the other trained on monolingual material (Roget's Thesaurus and Grolier's Encyclopedia). As this work was nearing completion, we observed a very strong discourse effect. That is, if a polysemous word such as sentence appears two or more times in a well-written discourse, it is extremely likely that they will all share the same sense. This paper describes an experiment which confirmed this hypothesis and found that the tendency to share sense in the same discourse is extremely strong (98%). This result can be used as an additional source of constraint for improving the performance of the word-sense disambiguation algorithm. In addition, it could also be used to help evaluate disambiguation algorithms that did not make use of the discourse constraint.","author":["William A. Gale","Kenneth W.

In the RM test, we report on speaker-independent (SI) recognition performance for the standard training condition using 109 speakers and for our recently proposed SI model made from only 12 training speakers. Surprisingly, the 12-speaker model performs as well as the one made from 109 speakers. Also within the RM domain, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art SI models perform poorly for speakers with strong dialects. But we show that this degradation can be overcome by using speaker adaptation from multiple-reference speakers. For the ATIS benchmarks, we ran a new system configuration which first produced a rank-ordered list of the N-best word-sequence hypotheses. The list of hypotheses was then reordered using more detailed acoustic and language models. In the ATIS benchmarks, we report SI recognition results on two conditions. The first is a baseline condition using only training data available from NIST on CD-ROM and a word-based statistical bi-gram grammar developed at MIT/Lincoln. In the second condition, we added training data from speakers collected at BBN and used a 4-gram class grammar. These changes reduced the word error rate by 25%.","author":["F. Kubala","S.

However, there are many settings involved in creating a CWS system such as various specifications and CWS methods. This paper investigates the effect of these settings to SMT. We tested dictionary-based and CRF-based approaches and found there was no significant difference between the two in the qualty of the resulting translations. We also found the correlation between the CWS F-score and SMT BLEU score was very weak. This paper also proposes two methods of combining advantages of different specifications: a simple concatenation of training data and a feature interpolation approach in which the same types of features of translation models from various CWS schemes are linearly interpolated. We found these approaches were very effective in improving quality of translations.","author":["Ruiqiang Zhang","Keiji Yasuda","Eiichiro Sumita"],"issue":["StatMT '08: Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation","June 2008","Pages   216\u2013223"],"date":"19 June 2008","ref":[{"text":"Thomas Emerson. 2005.
