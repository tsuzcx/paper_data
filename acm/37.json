We assume that the configurable logic blocks of the FPGA can be programmed using either a high supply voltage (high-Vdd) or a low supply voltage (low-Vdd). We carry out the clustering procedure with the guarantee that the delay of the circuit under the general delay model is optimal, and in the meantime, logic blocks on the non-critical paths can be driven by low-Vdd to save power. We explore a set of dual-Vdd combinations to find the best ratio between low-Vdd and high-Vdd to achieve the largest power reduction. Experimental results show that our clustering algorithm can achieve power savings by 20.3% on average compared to the clustering result for an FPGA with a single high-Vdd. To our knowledge, this is the first work on dual-Vdd clustering for FPGA architectures.","author":["Deming Chen","Jason Cong"],"issue":["ISLPED '04: Proceedings of the 2004 international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2004","Pages   70\u201373","https://doi.org/10.1145/1013235.1013259"],"date":"09 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"J.

In particular, we develop an algorithm called TensorTextures that learns a parsimonious model of the bidirectional texture function (BTF) from observational data. Given an ensemble of images of a textured surface, our nonlinear, generative model explicitly represents the multifactor interaction implicit in the detailed appearance of the surface under varying photometric angles, including local (per-texel) reflectance, complex mesostructural self-occlusion, interreflection and self-shadowing, and other BTF-relevant phenomena. Mathematically, TensorTextures is based on multilinear algebra, the algebra of higher-order tensors, hence its name. It is computed through a decomposition known as the N-mode SVD, an extension to tensors of the conventional matrix singular value decomposition (SVD). We demonstrate the application of TensorTextures to the image-based rendering of natural and synthetic textured surfaces under continuously varying viewpoint and illumination conditions.","author":["M.

The paper is an important one and since its initial limited distribution, the paper has been frequently referenced in the open literature, but the paper itself has been unavailable in the open literature. Publication here is meant to correct the previous gap in the literature.As the paper was originally distributed only to other researchers intimately familiar with the area covered by the paper, the paper makes few concessions to the reader along the lines of introductory or tutorial material. Therefore, a bit of background material follows.ALOHA packet systems were originally described by Abramson (\"The ALOHA System--Another Alternative for Computer Communication,\" Proceedings of the AFIPS Fall Joint Computer Conference, Vol. 37, 1970, pp. 281--285). In an ALOHA a single broadcast channel is shared by a number of communicating devices. In the version originally described by Abramson, every device transmits its packets independent of any other device or any specific time. That is, the device transmits the whole packet at a random point in time; the device then times out for receiving an acknowledgment. If an acknowledgment is not received, it is assumed that a collision occured with a packet transmitted by some other device and the packet is retransmitted after a random additional waiting time (to avoid repeated collisions). Under a certain set of assumptions, Abramson showed that the effective capacity of such a channel is 1/(2e).Roberts in the present paper investigates methods of increasing the effective channel capacity of such a channel. One method he proposes to gain in capacity is to consider the channel to be slotted into segments of time whose duration is equal to the packet transmission time, and to require the devices to begin a packet transmission at the beginning of a time slot. Another method Roberts proposes to gain in capacity is to take advantage of the fact that even though packets from two devices collide in the channel (i.e., they are transmitted so they pass through the channel at overlapping times), it may be possible for the receiver(s) to \"capture\" the signal of one of the transmitters, and thus correctly receive one of the conflicting packets, if one of the transmitters has a sufficiently greater signal than the other. Roberts considers the cases of both satellite and ground radio channels.","author":["Lawrence G.

The buffers need to be fast, and so ideally they should be small enough to use fast memory technologies such as SRAM or all-optical buffering. Unfortunately, a widely used rule-of-thumb says we need a bandwidth-delay product of buffering at each router so as not to lose link utilization. This can be prohibitively large. In a recent paper, Appenzeller et al. challenged this rule-of-thumb and showed that for a backbone network, the buffer size can be divided by pN without sacrificing throughput, where N is the number of ows sharing the bottleneck. In this paper, we explore how buffers in the backbone can be significantly reduced even more, to as little as a few dozen packets, if we are willing to sacrifice a small amount of link capacity. We argue that if the TCP sources are not overly bursty, then fewer than twenty packet buffers are sufficient for high throughput. Specifically, we argue that O(log W) buffers are sufficient, where W is the window size of each ow. We support our claim with analysis and a variety of simulations. The change we need to make to TCP is minimal--each sender just needs to pace packet injections from its window. Moreover, there is some evidence that such small buffers are sufficient even if we don't modify the TCP sources so long as the access network is much slower than the backbone, which is true today and likely to remain true in the future. We conclude that buffers can be made small enough for all-optical routers with small integrated optical buffers.","author":["Mihaela Enachescu","Yashar Ganjali","Ashish Goel","Nick McKeown","Tim Roughgarden"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 35","Issue 3","July 2005","pp   83\u201390","https://doi.org/10.1145/1070873.1070886"],"date":"01 July 2005","ref":[{"text":"The network simulator - ns-2. http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/.","order":1},{"text":"A.

Although many tone mapping operators have been published in recent years, no thorough psychophysical experiments have yet been undertaken to compare such operators against the real scenes they are purporting to depict. In this paper, we present the results of a series of psychophysical experiments to validate six frequently used tone mapping operators against linearly mapped High Dynamic Range (HDR) scenes displayed on a novel HDR device. Individual operators address the tone mapping issue using a variety of approaches and the goals of these techniques are often quite different from one another. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was not simply to determine which is the \"best\" algorithm, but more generally to propose an experimental methodology to validate such operators and to determine the participants' impressions of the images produced compared to what is visible on a high contrast ratio display.","author":["Patrick Ledda","Alan Chalmers","Tom Troscianko","Helge Seetzen"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 24","Issue 3","July 2005","pp   640\u2013648","https://doi.org/10.1145/1073204.1073242"],"date":"01 July 2005","ref":[{"text":"David, H.

The main result is a theorem that, in the Fourier domain, a photograph formed by a full lens aperture is a 2D slice in the 4D light field. Photographs focused at different depths correspond to slices at different trajectories in the 4D space. The paper demonstrates the utility of this theorem in two different ways. First, the theorem is used to analyze the performance of digital refocusing, where one computes photographs focused at different depths from a single light field. The analysis shows in closed form that the sharpness of refocused photographs increases linearly with directional resolution. Second, the theorem yields a Fourier-domain algorithm for digital refocusing, where we extract the appropriate 2D slice of the light field's Fourier transform, and perform an inverse 2D Fourier transform. This method is faster than previous approaches.","author":["Ren Ng"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 24","Issue 3","July 2005","pp   735\u2013744","https://doi.org/10.1145/1073204.1073256"],"date":"01 July 2005","ref":[{"text":"Adelson, T., and Wang, J.

Known solutions to the mapping and routing problem first map cores onto a topology and then route communication, using separated and possibly conflicting objective functions. In this paper we present a unified single-objective algorithm, called Unified MApping, Routing and Slot allocation (UMARS). As the main contribution we show how to couple path selection, mapping of cores and TDMA time-slot allocation such that the network required to meet the constraints of the application is minimized. The time-complexity of UMARS is low and experimental results indicate a run-time only 20% higher than that of path selection alone. We apply the algorithm to an MPEG decoder System-on-Chip (SoC), reducing area by 33%, power by 35% and worst-case latency by a factor four over a traditional multi-step approach.","author":["Andreas Hansson","Kees Goossens","Andrei R\u01cedulescu"],"issue":["CODES+ISSS '05: Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE/ACM/IFIP international conference on Hardware/software codesign and system synthesis","September 2005","Pages   75\u201380","https://doi.org/10.1145/1084834.1084857"],"date":"19 September 2005","ref":[{"text":"L.

The exposure time defines a temporal box filter that smears the moving object across the image by convolution. This box filter destroys important high-frequency spatial details so that deblurring via deconvolution becomes an ill-posed problem.Rather than leaving the shutter open for the entire exposure duration, we \"flutter\" the camera's shutter open and closed during the chosen exposure time with a binary pseudo-random sequence. The flutter changes the box filter to a broad-band filter that preserves high-frequency spatial details in the blurred image and the corresponding deconvolution becomes a well-posed problem. We demonstrate that manually-specified point spread functions are sufficient for several challenging cases of motion-blur removal including extremely large motions, textured backgrounds and partial occluders.","author":["Ramesh Raskar","Amit Agrawal","Jack Tumblin"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 25","Issue 3","July 2006","pp   795\u2013804","https://doi.org/10.1145/1141911.1141957"],"date":"01 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"Bascle, B., Blake, A., and Zisserman, A. 1996.

Unlike previous approaches that also improve software using an FPGA but do so using a special compiler, a warp processor achieves these improvements completely transparently and operates from a standard binary. A warp processor dynamically detects the binary's critical regions, reimplements those regions as a custom hardware circuit in the FPGA, and replaces the software region by a call to the new hardware implementation of that region. While not all benchmarks can be improved using warp processing, many can, and the improvements are dramatically better than those achievable by more traditional architecture improvements. The hardest part of warp processing is that of dynamically reimplementing code regions on an FPGA, requiring partitioning, decompilation, synthesis, placement, and routing tools, all having to execute with minimal computation time and data memory so as to coexist on chip with the main processor. We describe the results of developing our warp processor. We developed a custom FPGA fabric specifically designed to enable lean place and route tools, and we developed extremely fast and efficient versions of partitioning, decompilation, synthesis, technology mapping, placement, and routing. Warp processors achieve overall application speedups of 6.3X with energy savings of 66% across a set of embedded benchmark applications. We further show that our tools utilize acceptably small amounts of computation and memory which are far less than traditional tools. Our work illustrates the feasibility and potential of warp processing, and we can foresee the possibility of warp processing becoming a feature in a variety of computing domains, including desktop, server, and embedded applications.","author":["Roman Lysecky","Greg Stitt","Frank Vahid"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 11","Issue 3","July 2006","pp   659\u2013681","https://doi.org/10.1145/1142980.1142986"],"date":"07 June 2004","ref":[{"text":"Altera Corp. 2006.

Our algorithm provides concurrent insert, delete, and find operations with an expected O(1) cost. It consists of very simple code, easily implementable using only load, store, and compare-and-swap operations. The new mathematical structure at the core of our algorithm is recursive split-ordering, a way of ordering elements in a linked list so that they can be repeatedly \u201csplit\u201d using a single compare-and-swap operation. Metaphorically speaking, our algorithm differs from prior known algorithms in that extensibility is derived by \u201cmoving the buckets among the items\u201d rather than \u201cthe items among the buckets.\u201d Though lock-free algorithms are expected to work best in multiprogrammed environments, empirical tests we conducted on a large shared memory multiprocessor show that even in non-multiprogrammed environments, the new algorithm performs as well as the most efficient known lock-based resizable hash-table algorithm, and in high load cases it significantly outperforms it.","author":["Ori Shalev","Nir Shavit"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 53","Issue 3","May 2006","pp   379\u2013405","https://doi.org/10.1145/1147954.1147958"],"date":"01 May 2006","ref":[{"text":"Agesen, O., Detlefs, D., Flood, C., Garthwaite, A., Martin, P., Shavit, N., and Steele, G. 2000.

The returned documents go through a clustering phase before reaching the end user, thus allowing more effective manipulation and supporting the decision making process. The proposed algorithm demonstrates increased applicability in semantic web settings, since they offer the infrastructure for the explicit declaration of web document attributes and their respective values, thus allowing for more automated retrieval. The proposed algorithm improves the k-means range algorithm, as it uses the already constructed range tree (i.e. during the personalized filtering phase) as the basic structure on which the clustering step is based, applying instead of the k-means, the k-windows algorithm. The total number of parameters used for modeling the web documents dictates the number of dimensions of the Euclidean space representation. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(logd-2n+v), where d is the number of dimensions, n is the total number of web documents and v is the size of the answer.","author":["Maria Rigou","Spiros Sirmakessis","Giannis Tzimas"],"issue":["APS '06: Proceedings of the joint international workshop on Adaptivity, personalization & the semantic web","August 2006","Pages   35\u201340","https://doi.org/10.1145/1149933.1149939"],"date":"23 August 2006","ref":[{"text":"Aldenderfer M., and Blashfield R.

Previously proposed approaches for LPM result in prohibitive cost and power dissipation (TCAMs) or in large memory requirements and long lookup latencies (tries), when considering future line-rates, table sizes and key lengths (e.g., IPv6). Hash-based approaches appear to be an excellent candidate for LPM with the possibility of low power, compact storage, and O(1) latencies. However, there are two key problems that hinder their practical deployment as LPM solutions. First, na\u00efve hash tables incur collisions and resolve them using chaining, adversely affecting worst-case lookup-rate guarantees that routers must provide. Second, hash functions cannot directly operate on wildcard bits, a requirement for LPM, and current solutions require either considerably complex hardware or large storage space. In this paper we propose a novel architecture which successfully addresses for the first time, both key problems in hash based LPM \u2014 making the following contributions: (1) We architect an LPM solution based upon a recently-proposed, collision-free hashing scheme called Bloomier filter, by eliminating its false positives in a storage efficient way. (2) We propose a novel scheme called prefix collapsing, which provides support for wildcard bits with small additional storage and reduced hardware complexity. (3) We exploit prefix collapsing and key characteristics found in real update traces to support fast and incremental updates, a feature generally not available in collision-free hashing schemes.","author":["Jahangir Hasan","Srihari Cadambi","Venkatta Jakkula","Srimat Chakradhar"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 34","Issue 2","May 2006","pp   203\u2013215","https://doi.org/10.1145/1150019.1136503"],"date":"01 May 2006","ref":[{"text":"{1} ARM 11 Embedded Architecture Family Summary http://www.arm.com/products/CPUs/families/ARM11Family.html","order":1},{"text":"{2} Y.

Our architecture uses a two level file buffer cache composed of a relatively small DRAM, which includes a primary file buffer cache, and a flash memory secondary file buffer cache. Compared to a conventional DRAM-only architecture, our architecture consumes orders of magnitude less idle power while remaining cost effective. This is a result of using flash memory, which consumes orders of magnitude less idle power than DRAM and is twice as dense. The client request behavior in web servers, allows us to show that the primary drawbacks of flash memory?endurance and long write latencies?can easily be overcome.

The generation of a multiplier block from the set of constants is known as the multiple constant multiplication (MCM) problem. Finding the optimal solution, namely, the one with the fewest number of additions and subtractions, is known to be NP-complete. We propose a new algorithm for the MCM problem, which produces solutions that require up to 20% less additions and subtractions than the best previously known algorithm. At the same time our algorithm, in contrast to the closest competing algorithm, is not limited by the constant bitwidths. We present our algorithm using a unifying formal framework for the best, graph-based MCM algorithms and provide a detailed runtime analysis and experimental evaluation. We show that our algorithm can handle problem sizes as large as 100 32-bit constants in a time acceptable for most applications.

The motivation behind the Farsite project was to harness the unused storage and network resources of desktop computers to provide a service that is reliable, available, and secure despite the fact that it runs on machines that are unreliable, often unavailable, and of limited security. A main premise of the project has been that building a scalable system requires more than scalable algorithms: To be scalable in a practical sense, a distributed system targeting 105 nodes must tolerate a significant (and never-zero) rate of machine failure, a small number of malicious participants, and a substantial number of opportunistic participants. It also must automatically adapt to the arrival and departure of machines and changes in machine availability, and it must be able to autonomically repartition its data and metadata as necessary to balance load and alleviate hotspots. We describe the history of the project, including its multiple versions of major system components, the unique programming style and software-engineering environment we created to facilitate development, our distributed debugging framework, and our experiences with formal system specification. We also report on the lessons we learned during this development.","author":["William J. Bolosky","John R.

We introduce an innovative visual analytic approach to integrate microscopic and macroscopic perspectives of a rapidly growing scientific knowledge domain. Specifically, our approach focuses on statistically unexpected phrases extracted from unstructured text of titles and abstracts at the microscopic level in association with the magnitude and timeliness of their citation impact at the macroscopic level. The H-index, originally defined to measure individual scientists. productivity in terms of their citation profiles, is extended in two ways: 1) to papers and terms as a means of dividing these items into two groups so as to replace the less optimal threshold-based divisions, and 2) to take into account the timeliness of the impact of knowledge diffusion in terms of the timing of citations and publications so that attention is particularly drawn towards potentially significant and timely papers. The selected terms are connected to higher-level performance indicators, such as measures derived from the H-index, in the form of decision trees. A top-down traversal of such decision trees provides an intuitive walkthrough of concepts and phrases that may underline potentially significant but currently still latent scientific discoveries. Timeliness measures can also help to identify institutions that are at the forefront of a research field. We illustrate how widely accessible tools such as Google Earth can be utilized to disseminate such insights. The practical significance for digital libraries and fostering scientific discoveries is demonstrated through the astronomical literature related to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).","author":["Chaomei Chen","Jian Zhang","Weizhong Zhu","Michael Vogeley"],"issue":["JCDL '07: Proceedings of the 7th ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on Digital libraries","June 2007","Pages   19\u201328","https://doi.org/10.1145/1255175.1255179"],"date":"18 June 2007","ref":[{"text":"Abt, H.

Unlike physical side channel attacks that mostly target embedded cryptographic devices, cache-based side channel attacks can also undermine general purpose systems. The attacks are easy to perform, effective on most platforms, and do not require special instruments or excessive computation power. In recently demonstrated attacks on software implementations of ciphers like AES and RSA, the full key can be recovered by an unprivileged user program performing simple timing measurements based on cache misses.We first analyze these attacks, identifying cache interference as the root cause of these attacks. We identify two basic mitigation approaches: the partition-based approach eliminates cache interference whereas the randomization-based approach randomizes cache interference so that zero information can be inferred. We present new security-aware cache designs, the Partition-Locked cache (PLcache) and Random Permutation cache (RPcache), analyze and prove their security, and evaluate their performance. Our results show that our new cache designs with built-in security can defend against cache-based side channel attacks in general-rather than only specific attacks on a given cryptographic algorithm-with very little performance degradation and hardware cost.","author":["Zhenghong Wang","Ruby B.

These models are compared with well-established algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and single hidden-layer feed-forward neural networks.","author":["Hugo Larochelle","Dumitru Erhan","Aaron Courville","James Bergstra","Yoshua Bengio"],"issue":["ICML '07: Proceedings of the 24th international conference on Machine learning","June 2007","Pages   473\u2013480","https://doi.org/10.1145/1273496.1273556"],"date":"20 June 2007","ref":[{"text":"Bengio, Y., Lamblin, P., Popovici, D., & Larochelle, H.

This debate could be advanced by large-scale randomized studies addressing the critical issue of whether remotely operated or simulation-based labs are as effective as the traditional hands-on lab format. The present article describes the results of a large-scale (N = 306) study comparing learning outcomes and student preferences for several different lab formats in an undergraduate engineering course. The lab formats that were evaluated included traditional hands-on labs, remotely operated labs, and simulations. Learning outcomes were assessed by a test of the specific concepts taught in each lab. These knowledge scores were as high or higher (depending on topic) after performing remote and simulated laboratories versus performing hands-on laboratories. In their responses to survey items, many students saw advantages to technology-enabled lab formats in terms of such attributes as convenience and reliability, but still expressed preference for hands-on labs. Also, differences in lab formats led to changes in group functions across the plan-experiment-analyze process: For example, students did less face-to-face work when engaged in remote or simulated laboratories, as opposed to hands-on laboratories.","author":["James E.

We show that a good quadratic placement, followed by local wirelength-driven spreading can produce excellent results on large-scale industrial ASIC designs. As opposed to the current top performing academic placers [4, 7, 11], RQL does not embed a linearization technique within the solver. Instead, it only requires a simpler, pure quadratic objective function in the spirit of [8, 10, 23]. Experimental results show that RQL outperforms all available academic placers on the ISPD-2005 placement contest benchmarks. In particular, RQL obtains an average wire-length improvement of 2.8%, 3.2%, 5.4%, 8.5%, and 14.6% versus mPL6 [5], NTUPlace3 [7], Kraftwerk [20], APlace2.0 [11], and Capo10.2 [18], respectively. In addition, RQL is three, seven, and ten times faster than mpL6, Capo10.2, and APlace2.0, respectively. On the ISPD-2006 placement contest benchmarks, on average, RQL obtains the best scaled wirelength among all available academic placers.","author":["Natarajan Viswanathan","Gi-Joon Nam","Charles J.

In particular, this paper focuses on <it>unconditional full privacy</it>, i.e., privacy that relies neither on trusted third parties (like auctioneers), nor on computational intractability assumptions (like the hardness of factoring). These constraints imply a scenario in which bidders exchange messages according to some predefined protocol in order to jointly determine the auction outcome without revealing any additional information. It turns out that the first-price sealed-bid auction can be emulated by an unconditionally fully private protocol. However, the protocol's round complexity is exponential in the bid size, and there is no more efficient protocol. On the other hand, we prove the impossibility of privately emulating the second-price sealed-bid auction for more than two bidders. This impossibility holds even when relaxing various privacy constraints such as allowing the revelation of all but one losing bid (while maintaining anonymity) or allowing the revelation of the second highest bidder's identity.","author":["Felix Brandt","Tuomas Sandholm"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information and System Security","Volume 11","Issue 2","March 2008","Article No.: 6","pp   1\u201321","https://doi.org/10.1145/1330332.1330338"],"date":"01 May 2008","ref":[{"text":"<scp>Abe, M. and Suzuki, K.</scp> 2002.

We study the problem of inferring the classification of all the objects from a labeled subset, using only the link-based information amongst the objects. We abstract the above as a labeling problem on multigraphs with weighted edges. We present two classes of algorithms, based on local and global similarities. Then we focus on multigraphs induced by blog data, and carefully apply our general algorithms to specifically infer labels such as age, gender and location associated with the blog based only on the link-structure amongst them. We perform a comprehensive set of experiments with real, large-scale blog data sets and show that significant accuracy is possible from little or no non-link information, and our methods scale to millions of nodes and edges.","author":["Smriti Bhagat","Irina Rozenbaum","Graham Cormode"],"issue":["WebKDD/SNA-KDD '07: Proceedings of the 9th WebKDD and 1st SNA-KDD 2007 workshop on Web mining and social network analysis","August 2007","Pages   92\u2013101","https://doi.org/10.1145/1348549.1348560"],"date":"12 August 2007","ref":[{"text":"L.

However, the majority of studies on personalized search focused on a rather simple type of search, which leaves an important research topic - the personalization in exploratory searches - as an under-studied area. In this paper, we present a study of personalization in task-based information exploration using a system called TaskSieve. TaskSieve is a Web search system that utilizes a relevance feedback based profile, called a \"task model\", for personalization. Its innovations include flexible and user controlled integration of queries and task models, task-infused text snippet generation, and on-screen visualization of task models. Through an empirical study using human subjects conducting task-based exploration searches, we demonstrate that TaskSieve pushes significantly more relevant documents to the top of search result lists as compared to a traditional search system. TaskSieve helps users select significantly more accurate information for their tasks, allows the users to do so with higher productivity, and is viewed more favorably by subjects under several usability related characteristics.","author":["Jae-wook Ahn","Peter Brusilovsky","Daqing He","Jonathan Grady","Qi Li"],"issue":["WWW '08: Proceedings of the 17th international conference on World Wide Web","April 2008","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/1367497.1367499"],"date":"21 April 2008","ref":[{"text":"Ahn, J.-w., Brusilovsky, P., Grady, J., He, D., Syn, S.

This paper presents DCell, a novel network structure that has many desirable features for data center networking. DCell is a recursively defined structure, in which a high-level DCell is constructed from many low-level DCells and DCells at the same level are fully connected with one another. DCell scales doubly exponentially as the node degree increases. DCell is fault tolerant since it does not have single point of failure and its distributed fault-tolerant routing protocol performs near shortest-path routing even in the presence of severe link or node failures. DCell also provides higher network capacity than the traditional tree-based structure for various types of services. Furthermore, DCell can be incrementally expanded and a partial DCell provides the same appealing features. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that DCell is a viable interconnection structure for data centers.","author":["Chuanxiong Guo","Haitao Wu","Kun Tan","Lei Shi","Yongguang Zhang","Songwu Lu"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 38","Issue 4","October 2008","pp   75\u201386","https://doi.org/10.1145/1402946.1402968"],"date":"17 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"S.

At the same time, power concerns have made it difficult to bring the necessary processing power to bear on querying, processing, and understanding this data. We describe Gordon, a system architecture for data-centric applications that combines low-power processors, flash memory, and data-centric programming systems to improve performance for data-centric applications while reducing power consumption. The paper presents an exhaustive analysis of the design space of Gordon systems, focusing on the trade-offs between power, energy, and performance that Gordon must make. It analyzes the impact of flash-storage and the Gordon architecture on the performance and power efficiency of data-centric applications. It also describes a novel flash translation layer tailored to data intensive workloads and large flash storage arrays. Our data show that, using technologies available in the near future, Gordon systems can out-perform disk-based clusters by 1.5\u00d7 and deliver up to 2.5\u00d7 more performance per Watt.","author":["Adrian M.

This learning problem is a natural extension of the \u201clearning from parity with error\u201d problem to higher moduli. It can also be viewed as the problem of decoding from a random linear code. This, we believe, gives a strong indication that these problems are hard. Our reduction, however, is quantum. Hence, an efficient solution to the learning problem implies a quantum algorithm for GapSVP and SIVP. A main open question is whether this reduction can be made classical (i.e., nonquantum).We also present a (classical) public-key cryptosystem whose security is based on the hardness of the learning problem. By the main result, its security is also based on the worst-case quantum hardness of GapSVP and SIVP. The new cryptosystem is much more efficient than previous lattice-based cryptosystems: the public key is of size \u00d5(n2) and encrypting a message increases its size by a factor of \u00d5(n) (in previous cryptosystems these values are \u00d5(n4) and \u00d5(n2), respectively). In fact, under the assumption that all parties share a random bit string of length \u00d5(n2), the size of the public key can be reduced to \u00d5(n).","author":["Oded Regev"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 56","Issue 6","September 2009","Article No.: 34","pp   1\u201340","https://doi.org/10.1145/1568318.1568324"],"date":"08 September 2009","ref":[{"text":"Aharonov, D. and Regev, O. 2005.

However, most of current recommender systems suffer the following problems: (1) The large-scale and sparse data of the user-item matrix seriously affect the recommendation quality. As a result, most of the recommender systems cannot easily deal with users who have made very few ratings. (2) The traditional recommender systems assume that all the users are independent and identically distributed; this assumption ignores the connections among users, which is not consistent with the real world recommendations. Aiming at modeling recommender systems more accurately and realistically, we propose a novel probabilistic factor analysis framework, which naturally fuses the users' tastes and their trusted friends' favors together. In this framework, we coin the term Social Trust Ensemble to represent the formulation of the social trust restrictions on the recommender systems. The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets since it scales linearly with the number of observations, while the experimental results show that our method performs better than the state-of-the-art approaches.","author":["Hao Ma","Irwin King","Michael R.

They have been widely deployed in mobile computers as disk drive replacements. Flash memory is organized in terms of erase blocks. With the current technology, a block can reach the end of its lifetime after thousands of erasure operations. Wear leveling is a technique to evenly erase the entire flash memory so that all blocks remain alive as long as possible. This study introduces a new wear-leveling algorithm based the observation that, under a real-life mobile PC's workload, most erasure operations are contributed by a small fraction of blocks. Our key ideas are 1) moving rarely updated data to a block that is extraordinarily worn and 2) avoiding repeatedly involving a block in wear-leveling activities. This study presents a successful implementation of the proposed wear-leveling algorithm using about 200 bytes of RAM in an SSD controller rated at 33 MHz. Evaluation results show that this algorithm achieves even wear of the entire flash memory while reducing the overheads of extra flash-memory operations.","author":["Li-Pin Chang","Chun-Da Du"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 15","Issue 1","December 2009","Article No.: 6","pp   1\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/1640457.1640463"],"date":"28 December 2009","ref":[{"text":"Agrawal, N., Prabhakaran, V., Wobber, T., Davis, J.

However, DRAM consumes an increasing power budget and faces difficulties in scaling down for small feature size CMOS processing technologies. Compared to conventional DRAM, emerging phase change random access memory (PRAM) demonstrates superior power efficiency and processing scalability as VLSI technologies and integration density continue to advance. Nevertheless, using nano-scale fabrication technologies will unavoidably introduce design parameter variability in the manufacturing stage. In the past, the impact of process variation (PV) on conventional transistor-based storage cells and combinational logic has been studied extensively. However, the implication of PV on non-volatile memory design using emerging phase change techniques has not been well understood. In this paper, we take the first step toward characterizing the effect of process variation on PRAM and explore PV-aware design techniques. We show that process variation increases the PRAM programming power by 96% and degrades PRAM endurance by 50X. Our proposed circuit and two microarchtiecture techniques with system-level support reduce PRAM power by 44%, 59% and 57% and improve PRAM endurance by 27X, 277X and 268X, relative to PV-affected PRAM design. Moreover, we show that the synergy of the proposed cross-layer approaches, which achieve an average 63% power savings and 13050X endurance improvement over the conventional case, provide an attractive design solution to mitigate the deleterious impact of PV for non-volatile memory in the upcoming nano-scale processing technology era.","author":["Wangyuan Zhang","Tao Li"],"issue":["MICRO 42: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2009","Pages   2\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/1669112.1669116"],"date":"12 December 2009","ref":[{"text":"C.

Based on corpus-based segmentation standard, we launched this study. In detail, we regard Chinese word segmentation as a character-based tagging problem. We show that there has been a potent trend of using a character-based tagging approach in this field. In particular, learning from segmented corpus with or without additional linguistic resources is treated in a unified way in which the only difference depends on how the feature template set is selected. It differs from existing work in that both feature template selection and tag set selection are considered in our approach, instead of the previous feature template focus only technique. We show that there is a significant performance difference as different tag sets are selected. This is especially applied to a six-tag set, which is good enough for most current segmented corpora. The linguistic meaning of a tag set is also discussed. Our results show that a simple learning system with six n-gram feature templates and a six-tag set can obtain competitive performance in the cases of learning only from a training corpus. In cases when additional linguistic resources are available, an ensemble learning technique, assistant segmenter, is proposed and its effectiveness is verified. Assistant segmenter is also proven to be an effective method as segmentation standard adaptation that outperforms existing ones. Based on the proposed approach, our system provides state-of-the-art performance in all 12 corpora of three international Chinese word segmentation bakeoffs.","author":["Hai Zhao","Chang-Ning Huang","Mu Li","Bao-Liang Lu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing","Volume 9","Issue 2","June 2010","Article No.: 5","pp   1\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/1781134.1781135"],"date":"01 June 2010","ref":[{"text":"2003.

However, as the Web and its latently embedded facts evolve, a knowledge base can never be complete and up-to-date. On the other hand, a rapidly increasing suite of Web services provide access to timely and high-quality information, but this is encapsulated by the service interface. We propose to leverage the information that could be dynamically obtained from Web services in order to enrich RDF knowledge bases on the fly whenever the knowledge base does not suffice to answer a user query. To this end, we develop a sound framework for appropriately generating queries to encapsulated Web services and efficient algorithms for query execution and result integration. The query generator composes sequences of function calls based on the available service interfaces. As Web service calls are expensive, our method aims to reduce the number of calls in order to retrieve results with sufficient recall. Our approach is fully implemented in a complete prototype system named ANGIE1. The user can query and browse the RDF knowledge base as if it already contained all the facts from the Web services. This data, however, is gathered and integrated on the fly, transparently to the user. We demonstrate the viability and efficiency of our approach in experiments based on real-life data provided by popular Web services.","author":["Nicoleta Preda","Gjergji Kasneci","Fabian M.

Several application domains offer the opportunity to tradeoff quality of service/solution (QoS) for improvements in performance and reduction in energy consumption. Programmers sometimes take advantage of such opportunities, albeit in an ad-hoc manner and often without providing any QoS guarantees.We propose a system called Green that provides a simple and flexible framework that allows programmers to take advantage of such approximation opportunities in a systematic manner while providing statistical QoS guarantees. Green enables programmers to approximate expensive functions and loops and operates in two phases. In the calibration phase, it builds a model of the QoS loss produced by the approximation. This model is used in the operational phase to make approximation decisions based on the QoS constraints specified by the programmer. The operational phase also includes an adaptation function that occasionally monitors the runtime behavior and changes the approximation decisions and QoS model to provide strong statistical QoS guarantees.To evaluate the effectiveness of Green, we implemented our system and language extensions using the Phoenix compiler framework. Our experiments using benchmarks from domains such as graphics, machine learning, signal processing, and finance, and an in-production, real-world web search engine, indicate that Green can produce significant improvements in performance and energy consumption with small and controlled QoS degradation.","author":["Woongki Baek","Trishul M.

We design and analyze an architecture which uses single lookup into a Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) to solve the subset query problem for small sets, i.e., to check whether a given set (the query) contains (or alternately, is contained in) any one of a large collection of sets in a database. We use each TCAM entry as a small Ternary Bloom Filter (each 'bit' of which is one of {0,1,wildcard}) to store one of the sets in the collection. Like Bloom filters, our architecture is susceptible to false positives. Since each TCAM entry is quite small, asymptotic analyses of Bloom filters do not directly apply. Surprisingly, we are able to show that the asymptotic false positive probability formula can be safely used if we penalize the small Bloom filter by taking away just one bit of storage and adding just half an extra set element before applying the formula. We believe that this analysis is independently interesting. The subset query problem has applications in databases, network intrusion detection, packet classification in Internet routers, and Information Retrieval. We demonstrate our architecture on one illustrative streaming application -- intrusion detection in network traffic. Be shingling (i.e., taking consecutive bytes of) the strings in the database, we can perform a single subset query and hence a single TCAM search, to skip many bytes in the stream. We evaluate our scheme on the open source CLAM anti-virus database, for worst-case as well as random streams. Our architecture appears to be at least one order of magnitude faster than previous approaches. Since the individual Bloom filters must fit in a single TCAM entry (currently 72 to 576 bits), our solution applies only when each set is of a small cardinality. However, this is sufficient for many typical applications. Also, recent algorithms for the subset-query problem use a small-set version as a subroutine","author":["Ashish Goel","Pankaj Gupta"],"issue":["ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review","Volume 38","Issue 1","June 2010","pp   143\u2013154","https://doi.org/10.1145/1811099.1811056"],"date":"14 June 2010","ref":[{"text":"K.

To keep dynamic power constant across process generations, traditional MOSFET scaling theory prescribes reducing supply and threshold voltages in proportion to device dimensions, a practice that induces an exponential increase in subthreshold leakage. As a result, leakage power has become comparable to dynamic power in current-generation processes, and will soon exceed it in magnitude if voltages are scaled down any further. Beyond this inflection point, multicore processors will not be able to afford keeping more than a small fraction of all cores active at any given moment. Multicore scaling will soon hit a power wall.This paper presents resistive computation, a new technique that aims at avoiding the power wall by migrating most of the functionality of a modern microprocessor from CMOS to spin-torque transfer magnetoresistive RAM (STT-MRAM)---a CMOS-compatible, leakage-resistant, non-volatile resistive memory technology. By implementing much of the on-chip storage and combinational logic using leakage-resistant, scalable RAM blocks and lookup tables, and by carefully re-architecting the pipeline, an STT-MRAM based implementation of an eight-core Sun Niagara-like CMT processor reduces chip-wide power dissipation by 1.7\u00d7 and leakage power by 2.1\u00d7 at the 32nm technology node, while maintaining 93% of the system throughput of a CMOS-based design.","author":["Xiaochen Guo","Engin Ipek","Tolga Soyata"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 38","Issue 3","June 2010","pp   371\u2013382","https://doi.org/10.1145/1816038.1816012"],"date":"19 June 2010","ref":[{"text":"V.

In this paper, we consider whether exposing hardware fault information to software and allowing software to control fault recovery simplifies hardware design and helps technology scaling.The combination of emerging applications and emerging many-core architectures makes software recovery a viable alternative to hardware-based fault recovery. Emerging applications tend to have few I/O and memory side-effects, which limits the amount of information that needs checkpointing, and they allow discarding individual sub-computations with small qualitative impact. Software recovery can harness these properties in ways that hardware recovery cannot.We describe Relax, an architectural framework for software recovery of hardware faults. Relax includes three core components: (1) an ISA extension that allows software to mark regions of code for software recovery, (2) a hardware organization that simplifies reliability considerations and provides energy efficiency with hardware recovery support removed, and (3) software support for compilers and programmers to utilize the Relax ISA. Applying Relax to counter the effects of process variation, our results show a 20% energy efficiency improvement for PARSEC applications with only minimal source code changes and simpler hardware.","author":["Marc de Kruijf","Shuou Nomura","Karthikeyan Sankaralingam"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 38","Issue 3","June 2010","pp   497\u2013508","https://doi.org/10.1145/1816038.1816026"],"date":"19 June 2010","ref":[{"text":"Google performance tools. http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools/.","order":1},{"text":"V.

Modulo Scheduling (MS) is a technique in which a loop is parallelized by overlapping different parts of successive iterations. This ability to extract parallelism makes MS an attractive synthesis technique for loop acceleration. In this work we consider two problems involved in the use of MS which are central when targeting FPGAs. Current MS scheduling techniques sacrifice execution times in order to meet resource and delay constraints. Let \u201cideal\u201d execution times be the ones that could have been obtained by MS had we ignored resource and delay constraints. Here we pose the opposite problem, which is more suitable for HLS, namely, how to reduce resource constraints without sacrificing the ideal execution time. We focus on reducing the number of memory ports used by the MS synthesis, which we believe is a crucial resource for HLS. In addition to reducing the number of memory ports we consider the need to develop MS techniques that are fast enough to allow interactive synthesis times and repeated applications of the MS to explore different possibilities of synthesizing the circuits. Current solutions for MS synthesis that can handle memory constraints are too slow to support interactive synthesis. We formalize the problem of reducing the number of parallel memory references in every row of the kernel by a novel combinatorial setting. The proposed technique is based on inserting dummy operations in the kernel and by doing so, performing modulo-shift operations such that the maximal number of parallel memory references in a row is reduced. Experimental results suggest improved execution times for the synthesized circuit. The synthesis takes only a few seconds even for large-size loops.","author":["Yosi Ben-Asher","Danny Meisler","Nadav Rotem"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 3","Issue 3","September 2010","Article No.: 15","pp   1\u201319","https://doi.org/10.1145/1839480.1839485"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"}}","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2008.10","order":1},{"text":"}}","order":2},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.1109/43.3188","order":3},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.1109/ICPPW.2006.74","order":4},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.1145/354880.354889","order":5},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.1145/237578.237613","order":6},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.5555/789083.1022788","order":7},{"text":"}}","order":8},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.5555/177080","order":9},{"text":"}}","order":10},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.1145/258915.258933","order":11},{"text":"}}","order":12},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.1145/157485.164900","order":13},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.1145/1176254.1176321","order":14},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.1145/53990.54022","order":15},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.1145/224818.224847","order":16},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.5555/882471.883302","order":17},{"text":"}}","order":18},{"text":"}}","order":19},{"text":"}}","order":20},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.1145/375977.375978","order":21},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.1145/192724.192731","order":22},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.1007/s10617-005-1195-3","order":23},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.1145/581630.581637","order":24},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.1109/54.386007","order":25},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.1007/BF02577737","order":26},{"text":"}}","order":27},{"text":"}}","order":28},{"text":"}}","doi":"10.1145/775832.775986","order":29}]},{"_id":"10.1145/1839667.1839672","doi":"10.1145/1839667.1839672","title":"A memory-efficient pipelined implementation of the aho-corasick string-matching algorithm","abstract":"With rapid advancement in Internet technology and usages, some emerging applications in data communications and network security require matching of huge volume of data against large signature sets with thousands of strings in real time. In this article, we present a memory-efficient hardware implementation of the well-known Aho-Corasick (AC) string-matching algorithm using a pipelining approach called P-AC. An attractive feature of the AC algorithm is that it can solve the string-matching problem in time linearly proportional to the length of the input stream, and the computation time is independent of the number of strings in the signature set. A major disadvantage of the AC algorithm is the high memory cost required to store the transition rules of the underlying deterministic finite automaton. By incorporating pipelined processing, the state graph is reduced to a character trie that only contains forward edges. Together with an intelligent implementation of look-up tables, the memory cost of P-AC is only about 18 bits per character for a signature set containing 6,166 strings extracted from Snort. The control structure of P-AC is simple and elegant. The cost of the control logic is very low. With the availability of dual-port memories in FPGA devices, we can double the system throughput by duplicating the control logic such that the system can process two data streams concurrently. Since our method is memory-based, incremental changes to the signature set can be accommodated by updating the look-up tables without reconfiguring the FPGA circuitry.","author":["Derek Pao","Wei Lin","Bin Liu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 7","Issue 2","September 2010","Article No.: 10","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/1839667.1839672"],"date":"05 October 2010","ref":[{"text":"}}Aho, A.

Given the intense competition from multicore and GPUs, there is now a question whether MD on HPRC can be competitive. We concentrate here on the MD kernel computation: determining the short-range force between particle pairs. In one part of the study, we systematically explore the design space of the force pipeline with respect to arithmetic algorithm, arithmetic mode, precision, and various other optimizations. We examine simplifications and find that some have little effect on simulation quality. In the other part, we present the first FPGA study of the filtering of particle pairs with nearly zero mutual force, a standard optimization in MD codes. There are several innovations, including a novel partitioning of the particle space, and new methods for filtering and mapping work onto the pipelines. As a consequence, highly efficient filtering can be implemented with only a small fraction of the FPGA\u2019s resources. Overall, we find that, for an Altera Stratix-III EP3ES260, 8 force pipelines running at nearly 200 MHz can fit on the FPGA, and that they can perform at 95% efficiency. This results in an 80-fold per core speed-up for the short-range force, which is likely to make FPGAs highly competitive for MD.","author":["Matt Chiu","Martin C.

Recently, several researchers have focused their efforts on the design and synthesis of efficient reversible logic circuits. In these works, the primary design focus has been on optimizing the number of reversible gates and the garbage outputs. The number of reversible gates is not a good metric of optimization as each reversible gate is of different type and computational complexity, and thus will have a different quantum cost and delay. The computational complexity of a reversible gate can be represented by its quantum cost. Further, delay constitutes an important metric, which has not been addressed in prior works on reversible sequential circuits as a design metric to be optimized. In this work, we present novel designs of reversible sequential circuits that are optimized in terms of quantum cost, delay and the garbage outputs. The optimized designs of several reversible sequential circuits are presented including the D Latch, the JK latch, the T latch and the SR latch, and their corresponding reversible master-slave flip-flop designs. The proposed master-slave flip-flop designs have the special property that they don't require the inversion of the clock for use in the slave latch. Further, we introduce a novel strategy of cascading a Fredkin gate at the outputs of a reversible latch to realize the designs of the Fredkin gate based asynchronous set/reset D latch and the master-slave D flip-flop. Finally, as an example of complex reversible sequential circuits, the reversible logic design of the universal shift register is introduced. The proposed reversible sequential designs were verified through simulations using Verilog HDL and simulation results are presented.","author":["Himanshu Thapliyal","Nagarajan Ranganathan"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 6","Issue 4","December 2010","Article No.: 14","pp   1\u201331","https://doi.org/10.1145/1877745.1877748"],"date":"21 December 2010","ref":[{"text":"Banerjee, A. and Pathak, A. 2007.

For example, the visitors to such a space may have their own opinions on how exhibits relate to one another. In this article, we explore the possibility of estimating the perceived relatedness of exhibits by museum visitors through a variety of ontological and document similarity-based methods. Specifically, we combine the Wikipedia category hierarchy with lexical similarity measures, and evaluate the correlation with the relatedness judgements of visitors. We compare our measure with simple document similarity calculations, based on either Wikipedia documents or Web pages taken from the Web site for the museum of interest. We also investigate the hypothesis that physical distance in the museum space is a direct representation of the conceptual distance between exhibits. We demonstrate that ontological similarity measures are highly effective at capturing perceived relatedness and that the proposed RACO (Related Article Conceptual Overlap) method is able to achieve results closest to relatedness judgements provided by human annotators compared to existing state-of-the art measures of semantic relatedness.","author":["Karl Grieser","Timothy Baldwin","Fabian Bohnert","Liz Sonenberg"],"issue":["Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage","Volume 3","Issue 3","March 2011","Article No.: 10","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/1921614.1921617"],"date":"11 February 2011","ref":[{"text":"Anderson, D., Lucas, K.

In the link prediction problem we are given a snapshot of a network and would like to infer which interactions among existing members are likely to occur in the near future or which existing interactions are we missing. Although this problem has been extensively studied, the challenge of how to effectively combine the information from the network structure with rich node and edge attribute data remains largely open. We develop an algorithm based on Supervised Random Walks that naturally combines the information from the network structure with node and edge level attributes. We achieve this by using these attributes to guide a random walk on the graph. We formulate a supervised learning task where the goal is to learn a function that assigns strengths to edges in the network such that a random walker is more likely to visit the nodes to which new links will be created in the future. We develop an efficient training algorithm to directly learn the edge strength estimation function. Our experiments on the Facebook social graph and large collaboration networks show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches as well as approaches that are based on feature extraction.","author":["Lars Backstrom","Jure Leskovec"],"issue":["WSDM '11: Proceedings of the fourth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining","February 2011","Pages   635\u2013644","https://doi.org/10.1145/1935826.1935914"],"date":"09 February 2011","ref":[{"text":"L.

By classifying data at the block-level, a filesystem can request that different classes of data (e.g., file, directory, executable, text) be handled with different policies (e.g., low-latency versus highbandwidth), and it is left to the storage system to enforce these policies. Our approach assumes that an I/O classifier can be included in-band with each I/O request (e.g., using a field in the SCSI block command set) and that the policy for each class can be specified out-of-band through the management interface of the storage system.We describe our prototypes based on Linux Ext3, Windows NTFS, and hybrid storage systems composed of rotating and solid-state disks. With very little modification, filesystems can identify latency sensitive I/O classes (e.g., small files, directories, metadata, and the journal) and request that the storage system provision the solid-state storage for just these classes; and this is simply one of many possibilities. As part of our ongoing work, across a variety of file and storage systems, we are exploring other policies and mechanisms that can be used to improve application performance, reliability, and security.","author":["Michael P.

PowerDial transforms static configuration parameters into dynamic knobs that the PowerDial control system can manipulate to dynamically trade off the accuracy of the computation in return for reductions in the computational resources that the application requires to produce its results. These reductions translate directly into performance improvements and power savings.Our experimental results show that PowerDial can enable our benchmark applications to execute responsively in the face of power caps that would otherwise significantly impair responsiveness. They also show that PowerDial can significantly reduce the number of machines required to service intermittent load spikes, enabling reductions in power and capital costs.","author":["Henry Hoffmann","Stelios Sidiroglou","Michael Carbin","Sasa Misailovic","Anant Agarwal","Martin Rinard"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 46","Issue 3","March 2011","pp   199\u2013212","https://doi.org/10.1145/1961296.1950390"],"date":"05 March 2011","ref":[{"text":"Intel Xeon Processor. http://www.intel.com/technology/Xeon.","order":1},{"text":"Project Gutenberg. http://www.gutenberg.org/.","order":2},{"text":"Intel Atom Processor. http://www.intel.com/technology/atom.","order":3},{"text":"Wattsup .net meter. http://www.wattsupmeters.com/.","order":4},{"text":"Xiph.org. http://xiph.org.","order":5},{"text":"D.

Although many of these facilities were originally produced by the authors in conjunction with the software package LANCELOT, we believe that they will be useful in their own right and should be available to researchers for their development of optimization software. The tools can be obtained by anonymous ftp from a number of sources and may, in many cases, be installed automatically. The scope of a major collection of test problems written in the standard input format (SIF) used by the LANCELOT software package is described. Recognizing that most software was not written with the SIF in mind, we provide tools to assist in building an interface between this input format and other optimization packages. These tools provide a link between the SIF and a number of existing packages, including MINOS and OSL. Additionally, as each problem includes a specific classification that is designed to be useful in identifying particular classes of problems, facilities are provided to build and manage a database of this information.

Stencil computation is one of the typical kernels in scientific computations, however its low operational-intensity makes the sustained performance limited by memory bandwidth on recent microprocessors and GPUs. So far we have proposed a scalable streaming-array (SSA) of processing elements, which provides almost linear scalability by increasing FPGAs with a constant externalmemory bandwidth. In order to facilitate custom computing and efficiently utilize hardware resources for various and complex stencil-computations, we design programmable SSA with limited but necessary functionality. We show the design concept, the programmable structure and the SIMD instruction set for SSA. Prototype implementation with nine FPGAs demonstrates that our programmable design with a lot of floating-point units exploits hardware resources well, efficiently achieving 260 GFlop/s, which is 87.4% of the peak, at 1295 MFlop/sW.","author":["Kentaro Sano","Satoru Yamamoto","Yoshiaki Hatsuda"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 39","Issue 4","September 2011","pp   44\u201349","https://doi.org/10.1145/2082156.2082168"],"date":"19 December 2011","ref":[{"text":"W.

The benefits of SSD's over HDD's include better durability, higher performance, and lower power consumption, but due to certain physical characteristics of NAND flash, which comprise SSD's, there are some challenging areas of improvement and further research. We focus on the layout and management of the small amount of RAM that serves as a cache between the SSD and the system that uses it. Of the techniques that have previously been proposed to manage this cache, we identify several sources of inefficient cache space management due to the way pages are clustered in blocks and the limited replacement policy. We find that in many traces hot pages reside in otherwise cold blocks, and that the spatial locality of most clusters can be fully exploited in a limited time period, so we develop a hybrid page/block architecture along with an advanced replacement policy, called BPAC, or Block-Page Adaptive Cache, to exploit both temporal and spatial locality. Our technique involves adaptively partitioning the SSD on-disk cache to separately hold pages with high temporal locality in a page list and clusters of pages with low temporal but high spatial locality in a block list. In addition, we have developed a novel mechanism for flash-based SSD's to characterize the spatial locality of the disk I/O workload and an approach to dynamically identify the set of low spatial locality clusters. We run trace-driven simulations to verify our design and find that it outperforms other popular flash-aware cache schemes under different workloads. For instance, compared to a popular flash aware cache algorithm BPLRU, BPAC reduces the number of cache evictions by up to 79.6% and 34% on average.","author":["Guanying Wu","Xubin He","Ben Eckart"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 8","Issue 1","February 2012","Article No.: 1","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/2093139.2093140"],"date":"24 February 2012","ref":[{"text":"Agrawal, N., Prabhakaran, V., Wobber, T., Davis, J.

The method is based on visible light computed tomography, and is made possible by a new stochastic tomographic reconstruction algorithm based on random walks. We show that this new stochastic algorithm is competitive with specialized tomography solvers such as SART, but can also easily include arbitrary convex regularizers that make it possible to obtain high-quality reconstructions with a very small number of views. Finally, we demonstrate that the same stochastic tomography approach can also be used to directly re-render arbitrary 2D projections without the need to ever store a 3D volume grid.","author":["James Gregson","Michael Krimerman","Matthias B.

MapReduce is a well-known programming model to process large amount of data on data center-scale clusters. Most MapReduce implementations have been designed and optimized for homogeneous clusters. Unfortunately, these implementations perform poorly on heterogeneous clusters (e.g., on a 90-node cluster that contains 10 Xeon-based servers and 80 Atom-based servers, Hadoop performs worse than on 10-node Xeon-only or 80-node Atom-only homogeneous sub-clusters for many of our benchmarks). This poor performance remains despite previously proposed optimizations related to management of straggler tasks. In this paper, we address MapReduce's poor performance on heterogeneous clusters. Our first contribution is that the poor performance is due to two key factors: (1) the non-intuitive effect that MapReduce's built-in load balancing results in excessive and bursty network communication during the Map phase, and (2) the intuitive effect that the heterogeneity amplifies load imbalance in the Reduce computation. Our second contribution is Tarazu, a suite of optimizations to improve MapReduce performance on heterogeneous clusters. Tarazu consists of (1) Communication-Aware Load Balancing of Map computation (CALB) across the nodes, (2) Communication-Aware Scheduling of Map computation (CAS) to avoid bursty network traffic and (3) Predictive Load Balancing of Reduce computation (PLB) across the nodes. Using the above 90-node cluster, we show that Tarazu significantly improves performance over a baseline of Hadoop with straightforward tuning for hardware heterogeneity.","author":["Faraz Ahmad","Srimat T.

It is responsible for managing the virtual to physical address mappings and emulating the functionality of a normal block-level device. SSD performance is highly dependent on the design of the FTL. For the last few years, several FTL schemes have been proposed. Hybrid FTL schemes have gained more popularity since they try to combine the benefits of both page-level mapping and block-level mapping schemes. Examples include BAST, FAST, LAST, etc. To provide high performance, FTL designers face several cross cutting issues: the right balance between coarse and fine grain address mapping, the asymmetric nature of reads and writes, the write amplification property of Flash memory, and the wear-out behavior of flash. The MapReduce paradigm has become a very popular paradigm for performing parallel and distributed computations on large data. Hadoop, an open-source implementation of MapReduce, has accelerated MapReduce adoption. Flash SSD is increasingly being used as a storage solution in Hadoop deployments for faster processing and better energy utilization. Little work has been done to understand the endurance implications of SSD on Hadoop-based workloads. In this paper, using a highly flexible and reconfigurable kernel-level simulation infrastructure, we investigate the internal characteristics of various hybrid FTL schemes using a representative set of Hadoop workloads. Our investigation brings out the wear-out behavior of SSD for Hadoop-based workloads including wear-leveling details, garbage collection, translation and block/page mappings, and advocates the need for dynamic tuning of FTL parameters for these workloads.","author":["Hyeran Jeon","Kaoutar El Maghraoui","Gokul B.

Current devices, however, are plagued by problems of yield, and durability. We present a limit study of an aggressive neural network application that has a high update rate and a strict latency requirement, analog neural branch predictor. Of course, traditional analog neural network (ANN) implementations of branch predictors are not built with the idea that the underlying bits are likely to fail due to both manufacturing and wear-out issues. Without some careful precautions, a direct one-to-one replacement will result in poor behavior. We propose a hybrid system that uses SRAM front-end cache, and a distributed-sum scheme to overcome memristors' limitations. Our design can leverage devices with even modest durability (surviving only hours of continuous switching) to provide a system lasting 5 or more years of continuous operation. In addition, these schemes allow for a fault-tolerant design as well. We find that, while a neural predictor benefits from larger density, current technology parameters do not allow high dense, energy-efficient design. Thus, we discuss a range of plausible memristor characteristics that would; as the technology advances; make them practical for our application.","author":["Hebatallah Saadeldeen","Diana Franklin","Guoping Long","Charlotte Hill","Aisha Browne","Dmitri Strukov","Timothy Sherwood","Frederic T.

However, 3D IC involves disruptive manufacturing technologies compared to conventional 2D IC. TSVs cause significant thermomechanical stress that may seriously affect performance, leakage, and reliability of circuits. In this paper, we discuss an efficient and accurate full-chip thermomechanical stress and reliability analysis tool as well as a design optimization methodology to alleviate mechanical reliability issues in 3D ICs. First, we analyze detailed thermomechanical stress induced by TSVs in conjunction with various associated structures such as landing pad and dielectric liner. Then, we explore and validate the linear superposition principle of stress tensors and demonstrate the accuracy of this method against detailed finite element analysis (FEA) simulations. Next, we apply this linear superposition method to full-chip stress simulation and a reliability metric named the von Mises yield criterion. Finally, we propose a design optimization methodology to mitigate the mechanical reliability problems in 3D ICs.","author":["Moongon Jung","Joydeep Mitra","David Z.

To do so, we first analyze how different PRF models behave through the characteristics of the terms they select and through their performance on two widely used test collections. This analysis reveals that several well-known models surprisingly tend to select very common terms, with low IDF (inverse document frequency). We then introduce several conditions PRF models should satisfy regarding both the terms they select and the way they weigh them, prior to study whether standard PRF models satisfy these conditions or not. This study reveals that most models are deficient with respect to at least one condition, and that this deficiency explains the results of our analysis of the behavior of the models, as well as some of the results reported on the respective performance of PRF models. Based on the PRF conditions, we finally propose possible corrections for the simple mixture model. The PRF models obtained after these corrections outperform their standard version and yield state-of-the-art PRF models which confirms the validity of our theoretical analysis.","author":["St\u00e9phane Clinchant","Eric Gaussier"],"issue":["ICTIR '13: Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval","September 2013","Pages   6\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/2499178.2499179"],"date":"29 September 2013","ref":[{"text":"G.

The HACC (Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code) framework exploits this diverse landscape at the largest scales of problem size, obtaining high scalability and sustained performance. Developed to satisfy the science requirements of cosmological surveys, HACC melds particle and grid methods using a novel algorithmic structure that flexibly maps across architectures, including CPU/GPU, multi/many-core, and Blue Gene systems. We demonstrate the success of HACC on two very different machines, the CPU/GPU system Titan and the BG/Q systems Sequoia and Mira, attaining unprecedented levels of scalable performance. We demonstrate strong and weak scaling on Titan, obtaining up to 99.2% parallel efficiency, evolving 1.1 trillion particles. On Sequoia, we reach 13.94 PFlops (69.2% of peak) and 90% parallel efficiency on 1,572,864 cores, with 3.6 trillion particles, the largest cosmological benchmark yet performed. HACC design concepts are applicable to several other supercomputer applications.","author":["Salman Habib","Vitali Morozov","Nicholas Frontiere","Hal Finkel","Adrian Pope","Katrin Heitmann"],"issue":["SC '13: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2013","Article No.: 6","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2503210.2504566"],"date":"17 November 2013","ref":[{"text":"Abell, P.

However, most such studies only consider a single type of relationship, e.g., social network. Notice that in many applications, the recommendation problem exists in an attribute-rich heterogeneous information network environment. In this paper, we study the entity recommendation problem in heterogeneous information networks. We propose to combine various relationship information from the network with user feedback to provide high quality recommendation results. The major challenge of building recommender systems in heterogeneous information networks is to systematically define features to represent the different types of relationships between entities, and learn the importance of each relationship type. In the proposed framework, we first use meta-path-based latent features to represent the connectivity between users and items along different paths in the related information network. We then define a recommendation model with such latent features and use Bayesian ranking optimization techniques to estimate the model. Empirical studies show that our approach outperforms several widely employed implicit feedback entity recommendation techniques.","author":["Xiao Yu","Xiang Ren","Yizhou Sun","Bradley Sturt","Urvashi Khandelwal","Quanquan Gu","Brandon Norick","Jiawei Han"],"issue":["RecSys '13: Proceedings of the 7th ACM conference on Recommender systems","October 2013","Pages   347\u2013350","https://doi.org/10.1145/2507157.2507230"],"date":"12 October 2013","ref":[{"text":"L.

This charge leaks off over time, eventually causing data to be lost. To prevent this data loss from occurring, DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed. Unfortunately, DRAM refresh operations waste energy and also degrade system performance by interfering with memory requests. These problems are expected to worsen as DRAM density increases.The amount of time that a DRAM cell can safely retain data without being refreshed is called the cell's retention time. In current systems, all DRAM cells are refreshed at the rate required to guarantee the integrity of the cell with the shortest retention time, resulting in unnecessary refreshes for cells with longer retention times. Prior work has proposed to reduce unnecessary refreshes by exploiting differences in retention time among DRAM cells; however, such mechanisms require knowledge of each cell's retention time.In this paper, we present a comprehensive quantitative study of retention behavior in modern DRAMs. Using a temperature-controlled FPGA-based testing platform, we collect retention time information from 248 commodity DDR3 DRAM chips from five major DRAM vendors. We observe two significant phenomena: data pattern dependence, where the retention time of each DRAM cell is significantly affected by the data stored in other DRAM cells, and variable retention time, where the retention time of some DRAM cells changes unpredictably over time. We discuss possible physical explanations for these phenomena, how their magnitude may be affected by DRAM technology scaling, and their ramifications for DRAM retention time profiling mechanisms.","author":["Jamie Liu","Ben Jaiyen","Yoongu Kim","Chris Wilkerson","Onur Mutlu"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 41","Issue 3","June 2013","pp   60\u201371","https://doi.org/10.1145/2508148.2485928"],"date":"23 June 2013","ref":[{"text":"J.-H.

The basic problem takes live overlapping depth maps as input and incrementally fuses these into a single 3D model. This is challenging particularly when real-time performance is desired without trading quality or scale. We contribute an online system for large and fine scale volumetric reconstruction based on a memory and speed efficient data structure. Our system uses a simple spatial hashing scheme that compresses space, and allows for real-time access and updates of implicit surface data, without the need for a regular or hierarchical grid data structure. Surface data is only stored densely where measurements are observed. Additionally, data can be streamed efficiently in or out of the hash table, allowing for further scalability during sensor motion. We show interactive reconstructions of a variety of scenes, reconstructing both fine-grained details and large scale environments. We illustrate how all parts of our pipeline from depth map pre-processing, camera pose estimation, depth map fusion, and surface rendering are performed at real-time rates on commodity graphics hardware. We conclude with a comparison to current state-of-the-art online systems, illustrating improved performance and reconstruction quality.","author":["Matthias Nie\u00dfner","Michael Zollh\u00f6fer","Shahram Izadi","Marc Stamminger"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 32","Issue 6","November 2013","Article No.: 169","pp   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/2508363.2508374"],"date":"01 November 2013","ref":[{"text":"Alcantara, D.

However, the cost and difficulty of hardware design is often prohibitive, and consequently, a software approach is used for most applications. In this article, we introduce a new high-level synthesis tool called LegUp that allows software techniques to be used for hardware design. LegUp accepts a standard C program as input and automatically compiles the program to a hybrid architecture containing an FPGA-based MIPS soft processor and custom hardware accelerators that communicate through a standard bus interface. In the hybrid processor/accelerator architecture, program segments that are unsuitable for hardware implementation can execute in software on the processor. LegUp can synthesize most of the C language to hardware, including fixed-sized multidimensional arrays, structs, global variables, and pointer arithmetic. Results show that the tool produces hardware solutions of comparable quality to a commercial high-level synthesis tool. We also give results demonstrating the ability of the tool to explore the hardware/software codesign space by varying the amount of a program that runs in software versus hardware. LegUp, along with a set of benchmark C programs, is open source and freely downloadable, providing a powerful platform that can be leveraged for new research on a wide range of high-level synthesis topics.","author":["Andrew Canis","Jongsok Choi","Mark Aldham","Victor Zhang","Ahmed Kammoona","Tomasz Czajkowski","Stephen D.

We find that parallel sorting on a NOW is competitive to sorting on the large-scale SMPs that have traditionally held the performance records. On a 64-node cluster, we sort 6.0 GB in just under one minute, while a 32-node cluster finishes the Datamation benchmark in 2.41 seconds.Our implementations can be applied to a variety of disk, memory, and processor configurations; we highlight salient issues for tuning each component of the system. We evaluate the use of commodity operating systems and hardware for parallel sorting. We find existing OS primitives for memory management and file access adequate. Due to aggregate communication and disk bandwidth requirements, the bottleneck of our system is the workstation I/O bus.","author":["Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau","Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau","David E.

Real-world graph data follows a pattern of sparsity, that is not uniform but highly skewed towards a few items. Implementing graph traversal, statistics and machine learning algorithms on such data in a scalable manner is quite challenging. As a result, several graph analytics frameworks (GraphLab, CombBLAS, Giraph, SociaLite and Galois among others) have been developed, each offering a solution with different programming models and targeted at different users. Unfortunately, the \"Ninja performance gap\" between optimized code and most of these frameworks is very large (2-30X for most frameworks and up to 560X for Giraph) for common graph algorithms, and moreover varies widely with algorithms. This makes the end-users' choice of graph framework dependent not only on ease of use but also on performance. In this work, we offer a quantitative roadmap for improving the performance of all these frameworks and bridging the \"ninja gap\". We first present hand-optimized baselines that get performance close to hardware limits and higher than any published performance figure for these graph algorithms. We characterize the performance of both this native implementation as well as popular graph frameworks on a variety of algorithms. This study helps end-users delineate bottlenecks arising from the algorithms themselves vs. programming model abstractions vs. the framework implementations. Further, by analyzing the system-level behavior of these frameworks, we obtain bottlenecks that are agnostic to specific algorithms. We recommend changes to alleviate these bottlenecks (and implement some of them) and reduce the performance gap with respect to native code. These changes will enable end-users to choose frameworks based mostly on ease of use.","author":["Nadathur Satish","Narayanan Sundaram","Md. Mostofa Ali Patwary","Jiwon Seo","Jongsoo Park","M.

In this paper, we propose a novel method of Bayesian model fusion on Bernoulli distribution (BMF-BD) for efficient yield estimation at the late stage by borrowing the prior knowledge from an early stage. BMF-BD is particularly developed to handle the cases where the pre-silicon simulation and/or post-silicon measurement results are binary: either \"pass\" or \"fail\". The key idea is to model the binary simulation/measurement outcome as a Bernoulli distribution and then encode the prior knowledge as a Beta distribution based on the theory of conjugate prior. As such, the late-stage yield can be accurately estimated through Bayesian inference with very few late-stage samples. Several circuit examples demonstrate that BMF-BD achieves up to 10\u00d7 cost reduction over the conventional estimator without surrendering any accuracy.","author":["Chenlei Fang","Fan Yang","Xuan Zeng","Xin Li"],"issue":["DAC '14: Proceedings of the 51st Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2014","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2593069.2593099"],"date":"01 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"X.

For this reason, the bottleneck of many applications is rapidly moving from computation to communication. More precisely, performance is often bound by the huge latency of direct memory accesses. In this scenario the challenge is to provide embedded multi and many-core systems with a powerful, low-latency, energy efficient and flexible way to move data through the memory hierarchy level. In this paper, a DMA engine optimized for clustered tightly coupled many-core systems is presented. The IP features a simple micro-coded programming interface and lock-free per-core command queues to improve flexibility while reducing the programming latency. Moreover it dramatically reduces the area and improves the energy efficiency with respect to conventional DMAs exploiting the cluster shared memory as local repository for data buffers. The proposed DMA engine improves the access and programming latency by one order of magnitude, it reduces IP area by 4x and power by 5x, with respect to a conventional DMA, while providing full bandwidth to 16 independent logical channels.","author":["Davide Rossi","Igor Loi","Germain Haugou","Luca Benini"],"issue":["CF '14: Proceedings of the 11th ACM Conference on Computing Frontiers","May 2014","Article No.: 15","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2597917.2597922"],"date":"20 May 2014","ref":[{"text":"Banakar R.; Steinke S.; Lee B.; Balakrishnan M; Marwedel.

Such multilingual users may serve an important function in diffusing information across different language editions of the encyclopedia, and prior work has suggested this could reduce the level of self-focus bias in each edition. This study finds multilingual users are much more active than their single-edition (monolingual) counterparts. They are found in all language editions, but smaller-sized editions with fewer users have a higher percentage of multilingual users than larger-sized editions. About a quarter of multilingual users always edit the same articles in multiple languages, while just over 40% of multilingual users edit different articles in different languages. When non-English users do edit a second language edition, that edition is most frequently English. Nonetheless, several regional and linguistic cross-editing patterns are also present.","author":["Scott A.

To consolidate various hardware resources in an elastic, programmable and reconfigurable manner, we design and build a flexible and consolidated framework, OpenANFV, to support virtualized accelerators for MBs in the cloud environment. OpenANFV is seamlessly and efficiently put into Openstack to provide high performance on top of commodity hardware to cope with various virtual function requirements. OpenANFV works as an independent component to manage and virtualize the acceleration resources (e.g. cinder manages block storage resources and nova manages computing resources). Specially, OpenANFV mainly has the following three features. (1)Automated Management. Provisioning for multiple Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) is automated to meet the dynamic requirements of NFV environment. Such automation alleviates the time pressure of the complicated provisioning and configuration as well as reduces the probability of manually induced configuration errors. (2) Elasticity. VNFs are created, migrated, and destroyed on demand in real time. The reconfigurable hardware resources in pool can rapidly and flexibly offload the corresponding services to the accelerator platform in the dynamic NFV environment. (3) Coordinating with Openstack. The design and implementation of the OpenANFV APIs coordinate with the mechanisms in Openstack to support required virtualized MBs for multiple tenants.","author":["Xiongzi Ge","Yi Liu","David H.C.

We make the case for using IEEE 802.11p DSRC instead, which has been adopted for vehicle-to-vehicle communications, providing lower latency and longer range. We demonstrate a prototype motivated by a novel fabrication process that deposits both III-V and CMOS devices on the same die. In our system prototype, the designed RF front-end is interfaced with a baseband processor on an FPGA, connected to Android phones. It consumes 0.02uJ/bit across 100m assuming free space.

We define a new microarchitecturally-triggered approximation technique called rollback-free value prediction. This technique predicts the value of safe-to-approximate loads when they miss in the cache without tracking mispredictions or requiring costly recovery from misspeculations. This technique mitigates the memory wall by allowing the core to continue computation without stalling for long-latency memory accesses. Our detailed study of the quality trade-offs shows that with a modern out-of-order processor, average 8% (up to 19%) performance improvement is possible with 0.8% (up to 1.8%) average quality loss on an approximable subset of SPEC CPU 2000/2006.","author":["Bradley Thwaites","Gennady Pekhimenko","Hadi Esmaeilzadeh","Amir Yazdanbakhsh","Onur Mutlu","Jongse Park","Girish Mururu","Todd Mowry"],"issue":["PACT '14: Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on Parallel architectures and compilation","August 2014","Pages   493\u2013494","https://doi.org/10.1145/2628071.2628110"],"date":"24 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"C.

Although keywords are very useful for many applications, most documents available online are not provided with keywords. We describe a method for extracting keywords from Arabic documents. This method identifies the keywords by combining linguistics and statistical analysis of the text without using prior knowledge from its domain or information from any related corpus. The text is preprocessed to extract the main linguistic information, such as the roots and morphological patterns of derivative words. A cleaning phase is then applied to eliminate the meaningless words from the text. The most frequent terms are clustered into equivalence classes in which the derivative words generated from the same root and the non-derivative words generated from the same stem are placed together, and their count is accumulated. A vector space model is then used to capture the most frequent N-gram in the text. Experiments carried out using a real-world dataset show that the proposed method achieves good results with an average precision of 31% and average recall of 53% when tested against manually assigned keywords.","author":["Arafat Awajan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing","Volume 14","Issue 2","March 2015","Article No.: 7","pp   1\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/2665077"],"date":"20 April 2015","ref":[{"text":"Al-Sughaier, I. and Al-Kharashi, I. 2004.

Recently proposed indoor localization solutions have required anywhere from zero additional infrastructure to customized RF hardware and have provided room-level to centimeter-level accuracy, typically in that respective order. One emerging technology that is proving a pragmatic solution for scalable, accurate localization is that of Bluetooth Low Energy beaconing, spearheaded by Apple's recently introduced iBeacon protocol. In this demo, we present a suite of localization tools developed around the iBeacon protocol, providing an in-depth look at Bluetooth Low Energy's viability as an indoor positioning technology.

In contrast to existing storage architectures, we consider a PCM-based storage architecture to enhance the reliability of storage systems. In PCM-based storage systems, the major challenge falls on how to prevent the frequently updated (meta)data from wearing out their residing PCM cells without excessively searching and moving metadata around the PCM space and without extensively updating the index structures of file systems. In this work, we propose an adaptive wear-leveling mechanism to prevent any PCM cell from being worn out prematurely by selecting appropriate data for swapping with constant search/sort cost. Meanwhile, the concept of indirect pointers is designed in the proposed mechanism to swap data without any modification to the file system's indexes. Experiments were conducted based on well-known benchmarks and realistic workloads to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed design, for which the results are encouraging.","author":["Hung-Sheng Chang","Yuan-Hao Chang","Pi-Cheng Hsiu","Tei-Wei Kuo","Hsiang-Pang Li"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 20","Issue 2","February 2015","Article No.: 25","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/2699831"],"date":"02 March 2015","ref":[{"text":"Axis Communications. 2004.

However, text data are mostly unstructured. Transforming unstructured text into structured units (e.g., semantically meaningful phrases) will substantially reduce semantic ambiguity and enhance the power and efficiency at manipulating such data using database technology. Thus mining quality phrases is a critical research problem in the field of databases. In this paper, we propose a new framework that extracts quality phrases from text corpora integrated with phrasal segmentation. The framework requires only limited training but the quality of phrases so generated is close to human judgment. Moreover, the method is scalable: both computation time and required space grow linearly as corpus size increases. Our experiments on large text corpora demonstrate the quality and efficiency of the new method.","author":["Jialu Liu","Jingbo Shang","Chi Wang","Xiang Ren","Jiawei Han"],"issue":["SIGMOD '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","May 2015","Pages   1729\u20131744","https://doi.org/10.1145/2723372.2751523"],"date":"27 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"K.

A number of open questions arise as to the design of a server platform specialized for DNN and how modern warehouse scale computers (WSCs) should be outfitted to provide DNN as a service for these applications. In this paper, we present DjiNN, an open infrastructure for DNN as a service in WSCs, and Tonic Suite, a suite of 7 end-to-end applications that span image, speech, and language processing. We use DjiNN to design a high throughput DNN system based on massive GPU server designs and provide insights as to the varying characteristics across applications. After studying the throughput, bandwidth, and power properties of DjiNN and Tonic Suite, we investigate several design points for future WSC architectures. We investigate the total cost of ownership implications of having a WSC with a disaggregated GPU pool versus a WSC composed of homogeneous integrated GPU servers. We improve DNN throughput by over 120x for all but one application (40x for Facial Recognition) on an NVIDIA K40 GPU. On a GPU server composed of 8 NVIDIA K40s, we achieve near-linear scaling (around 1000x throughput improvement) for 3 of the 7 applications. Through our analysis, we also find that GPU-enabled WSCs improve total cost of ownership over CPU-only designs by 4-20x, depending on the composition of the workload","author":["Johann Hauswald","Yiping Kang","Michael A.

Obtaining good performance for memory-mapped SSD content, however, is hard because the virtual memory layer, the file system and the flash translation layer (FTL) perform address translations, sanity and permission checks independently from each other. We introduce FlashMap, an SSD interface that is optimized for memory-mapped SSD-files. FlashMap combines all the address translations into page tables that are used to index files and also to store the FTL-level mappings without altering the guarantees of the file system or the FTL. It uses the state in the OS memory manager and the page tables to perform sanity and permission checks respectively. By combining these layers, FlashMap reduces critical-path latency and improves DRAM caching efficiency. We find that this increases performance for applications by up to 3.32x compared to state-of-the-art SSD file-mapping mechanisms. Additionally, latency of SSD accesses reduces by up to 53.2%.","author":["Jian Huang","Anirudh Badam","Moinuddin K.

Rather than flattening the design to gates, we preserve the datapath structure; this allows exploitation of specialized datapath features in FPGAs, retains regularity, and also results in a smaller problem size. To further achive high mapping speed, we formulate the problem as tree covering and solve it efficiently with a linear-time dynamic programming algorithm. In a novel extension to the tree-covering algorithm, we perform module placement simultaneously with the mapping, still in linear time. Integrating placement has the potential to increase the quality of the result since we can optimize total delay including routing delays.\nTo our knowledge this is the first effort to leverage a grammar-based tree covering tool for datapath module mapping. Further, it is the first work to integrate simultaneous placement with module mapping in a way that preserves linear time complexity.","author":["Timothy J.

Centiman provides serializability on top of a key-value store with a lightweight protocol based on optimistic concurrency control (OCC). Centiman is designed for the cloud setting, with an architecture that is loosely coupled and avoids synchronization wherever possible. Centiman supports sharded transaction validation; validators can be added or removed on-the-fly in an elastic manner. Processors and validators scale independently of each other and recover from failure transparently to each other. Centiman's loosely coupled design creates some challenges: it can cause spurious aborts and it makes it difficult to implement common performance optimizations for read-only transactions. To deal with these issues, Centiman uses a watermark abstraction to asynchronously propagate information about transaction commits through the system. In an extensive evaluation we show that Centiman provides fast elastic scaling, low-overhead serializability for read-heavy workloads, and scales to millions of operations per second.","author":["Bailu Ding","Lucja Kot","Alan Demers","Johannes Gehrke"],"issue":["SoCC '15: Proceedings of the Sixth ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing","August 2015","Pages   262\u2013275","https://doi.org/10.1145/2806777.2806837"],"date":"27 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"AmazonS3. http://aws.amazon.com/s3/.","order":1},{"text":"HBase. http://hbase.apache.org/.","order":2},{"text":"TATP. http://tatpbenchmark.sourceforge.net/.","order":3},{"text":"Apache Zookeeper. http://zookeeper.apache.org/.","order":4},{"text":"A.

Regent users compose programs with tasks (functions eligible for parallel execution) and logical regions (hierarchical collections of structured objects). Regent programs appear to execute sequentially, require no explicit synchronization, and are trivially deadlock-free. Regent's type system catches many common classes of mistakes and guarantees that a program with correct serial execution produces identical results on parallel and distributed machines. We present an optimizing compiler for Regent that translates Regent programs into efficient implementations for Legion, an asynchronous task-based model. Regent employs several novel compiler optimizations to minimize the dynamic overhead of the runtime system and enable efficient operation. We evaluate Regent on three benchmark applications and demonstrate that Regent achieves performance comparable to hand-tuned Legion.","author":["Elliott Slaughter","Wonchan Lee","Sean Treichler","Michael Bauer","Alex Aiken"],"issue":["SC '15: Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2015","Article No.: 81","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2807591.2807629"],"date":"15 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"High Performance Computing Center at Stanford University. http://hpcc.stanford.edu/.","order":1},{"text":"UPC language specification v1.2. upc.lbl.gov/docs/user/upc\\_spec\\_1.2.pdf, 2011.","order":2},{"text":"Mantevo project. https://mantevo.org/, Nov. 2014.","order":3},{"text":"The Open Community Runtime interface. https://xstackwiki.modelado.org/images/1/13/Ocr-v0.9-spec.pdf, 2014.","order":4},{"text":"T.

Up to half of the power consumption of future high density DRAM devices will be caused by refresh commands. Moreover, not only the refresh rate does depend on the device capacity, but it strongly depends on the temperature as well. In case of 3D integration of MPSoCs with Wide I/O DRAMs the power density and thermal dissipation are increased dramatically. Hence, in 3D-DRAM even more DRAM refresh operations are required. To master these challenges, clever DRAM refresh strategies are mandatory either on hardware or on software level using new or already available infrastructures and implementations, such as Partial Array Self Refresh (PASR) or Temperature Compensated Self Refresh (TCSR). In this paper, we show that for dedicated applications refresh can be disabled completely without or with negligible impact on the application performance. This is possible if it is assured that either the lifetime of the data is shorter than the currently required DRAM refresh period or if the application can tolerate bit errors to some degree in a given time window.","author":["Matthias Jung","\u00c9der Zulian","Deepak M.

This paper introduces the Variable Length Delta Prefetcher (VLDP), which builds up delta histories between successive cache line misses within physical pages, and then uses these histories to predict the order of cache line misses in new pages. One of VLDP's distinguishing features is its use of multiple prediction tables, each of which stores predictions based on a different length of input history. For example, the first prediction table takes as input only the single most recent delta between cache misses within a page, and attempts to predict the next cache miss in that page. The second prediction table takes as input a sequence of the two most recent deltas between cache misses within a page, and also attempts to predict the next cache miss in that page, and so on with additional tables. Longer histories generally yield more accurate predictions, so VLDP prefers to make predictions based on the longest history table that has a matching entry. Using a global history of patterns it has seen in the past, VLDP is able to issue prefetches without having to wait for additional per-page confirmation, and it is even able to prefetch patterns that show no repetition within a physical page. VLDP does not use the program counter (PC) to make its predictions, but our evaluation shows that it out-performs the highest-performing PC-based prefetcher by 7.1%, and the highest performing prefetcher that doesn't employ the PC by 5.8%.","author":["Manjunath Shevgoor","Sahil Koladiya","Rajeev Balasubramonian","Chris Wilkerson","Seth H.

The bottleneck of computing the CPD is multiplying a sparse tensor by several dense matrices. Algorithms for tensor-matrix products fall into two classes. The first class saves floating point operations by storing a compressed tensor for each dimension of the data. These methods are fast but suffer high memory costs. The second class uses a single uncompressed tensor at the cost of additional floating point operations. In this work, we bridge the gap between the two approaches and introduce the compressed sparse fiber (CSF) a data structure for sparse tensors along with a novel parallel algorithm for tensor-matrix multiplication. CSF offers similar operation reductions as existing compressed methods while using only a single tensor structure. We validate our contributions with experiments comparing against state-of-the-art methods on a diverse set of datasets. Our work uses 58% less memory than the state-of-the-art while achieving 81% of the parallel performance on 16 threads.","author":["Shaden Smith","George Karypis"],"issue":["IA3 '15: Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Irregular Applications: Architectures and Algorithms","November 2015","Article No.: 5","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.1145/2833179.2833183"],"date":"15 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"B.

The result of this interference, if it is not controlled well, is missed deadlines for HWAs and low CPU performance. Few previous works have tackled this problem. State-of-the-art mechanisms designed for CPU-GPU systems strive to meet a target frame rate for GPUs by prioritizing the GPU close to the time when it has to complete a frame. We observe two major problems when such an approach is adapted to a heterogeneous CPU-HWA system. First, HWAs miss deadlines because they are prioritized only when close to their deadlines. Second, such an approach does not consider the diverse memory access characteristics of different applications running on CPUs and HWAs, leading to low performance for latency-sensitive CPU applications and deadline misses for some HWAs, including GPUs.In this article, we propose a Deadline-Aware memory Scheduler for Heterogeneous systems (DASH), which overcomes these problems using three key ideas, with the goal of meeting HWAs\u2019 deadlines while providing high CPU performance. First, DASH prioritizes an HWA when it is not on track to meet its deadline any time during a deadline period, instead of prioritizing it only when close to a deadline. Second, DASH prioritizes HWAs over memory-intensive CPU applications based on the observation that memory-intensive applications\u2019 performance is not sensitive to memory latency. Third, DASH treats short-deadline HWAs differently as they are more likely to miss their deadlines and schedules their requests based on worst-case memory access time estimates.Extensive evaluations across a wide variety of different workloads and systems show that DASH achieves significantly better CPU performance than the best previous scheduler while always meeting the deadlines for all HWAs, including GPUs, thereby largely improving frame rates.","author":["Hiroyuki Usui","Lavanya Subramanian","Kevin Kai-Wei Chang","Onur Mutlu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 12","Issue 4","January 2016","Article No.: 65","pp   1\u201328","https://doi.org/10.1145/2847255"],"date":"04 January 2016","ref":[{"text":"L.

In recent years, HLS techniques and design flows have also advanced significantly, and as a result, many new FPGA designs are developed with HLS. However, despite many studies using HLS, the size and complexity of such applications remain generally small, and it is not well understood how to design and optimize for HLS with large, complex reference code. Typical HLS benchmark applications contain somewhere between 100 to 1400 lines of code and about 20 sub-functions, but typical input applications may contain many times more code and functions. To study such complex applications, we present a case study using HLS for a full H.264 decoder: an application with over 6000 lines of code and over 100 functions. We share our experience on code conversion for synthesizability, various HLS optimizations, HLS limitations while dealing with complex input code, and general design insights. Through our optimization process, we achieve 34 frames/s at 640x480 resolution (480p). To enable future study and benefit the research community, we open-source our synthe- sizable H.264 implementation.","author":["Xinheng Liu","Yao Chen","Tan Nguyen","Swathi Gurumani","Kyle Rupnow","Deming Chen"],"issue":["FPGA '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2016","Pages   224\u2013233","https://doi.org/10.1145/2847263.2847274"],"date":"21 February 2016","ref":[{"text":"H.264: Advanced video coding for generic audiovisual services.","order":1},{"text":"L.

Recent studies have shown serious security concerns due to \"rowhammer\" attacks, where repeated accesses to a row of memory cause bit flips in adjacent rows. Recent work by Google's Project Zero has shown how to leverage rowhammer-induced bit-flips as the basis for security exploits that include malicious code injection and memory privilege escalation. Being an important security concern, industry has attempted to defend against rowhammer attacks. Deployed defenses employ two strategies: (1) doubling the system DRAM refresh rate and (2) restricting access to the CLFLUSH instruction that attackers use to bypass the cache to increase memory access frequency (i.e., the rate of rowhammering). We demonstrate that such defenses are inadequte: we implement rowhammer attacks that both avoid using the CLFLUSH instruction and cause bit flips with a doubled refresh rate. Our next-generation CLFLUSH-free rowhammer attack bypasses the cache by manipulating cache replacement state to allow frequent misses out of the last-level cache to DRAM rows of our choosing. To protect existing systems from more advanced rowhammer attacks, we develop a software-based defense, ANVIL, which thwarts all known rowhammer attacks on existing systems. ANVIL detects rowhammer attacks by tracking the locality of DRAM accesses using existing hardware performance counters. Our detector identifies the rows being frequently accessed (i.e., the aggressors), then selectively refreshes the nearby victim rows to prevent hammering. Experiments running on real hardware with the SPEC2006 benchmarks show that ANVIL has less than a 1% false positive rate and an average slowdown of 1%. ANVIL is low-cost and robust, and our experiments indicate that it is an effective approach for protecting existing and future systems from even advanced rowhammer attacks.","author":["Zelalem Birhanu Aweke","Salessawi Ferede Yitbarek","Rui Qiao","Reetuparna Das","Matthew Hicks","Yossi Oren","Todd Austin"],"issue":["ASPLOS '16: Proceedings of the Twenty-First International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2016","Pages   743\u2013755","https://doi.org/10.1145/2872362.2872390"],"date":"25 March 2016","ref":[{"text":"https://twitter.com/lavados/status/685618703413698562.

Several recent techniques are proposed to identify malicious domains through analysis of DNS data. The general approach is to build classifiers based on DNS-related local domain features. One potential problem is that many local features, e.g., domain name patterns and temporal patterns, tend to be not robust. Attackers could easily alter these features to evade detection without affecting much their attack capabilities. In this paper, we take a complementary approach. Instead of focusing on local features, we propose to discover and analyze global associations among domains. The key challenges are (1) to build meaningful associations among domains; and (2) to use these associations to reason about the potential maliciousness of domains. For the first challenge, we take advantage of the modus operandi of attackers. To avoid detection, malicious domains exhibit dynamic behavior by, for example, frequently changing the malicious domain-IP resolutions and creating new domains. This makes it very likely for attackers to reuse resources. It is indeed commonly observed that over a period of time multiple malicious domains are hosted on the same IPs and multiple IPs host the same malicious domains, which creates intrinsic association among them. For the second challenge, we develop a graph-based inference technique over associated domains. Our approach is based on the intuition that a domain having strong associations with known malicious domains is likely to be malicious. Carefully established associations enable the discovery of a large set of new malicious domains using a very small set of previously known malicious ones. Our experiments over a public passive DNS database show that the proposed technique can achieve high true positive rates (over 95%) while maintaining low false positive rates (less than 0.5%). Further, even with a small set of known malicious domains (a couple of hundreds), our technique can discover a large set of potential malicious domains (in the scale of up to tens of thousands).","author":["Issa Khalil","Ting Yu","Bei Guan"],"issue":["ASIA CCS '16: Proceedings of the 11th ACM on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security","May 2016","Pages   663\u2013674","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897845.2897877"],"date":"30 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"M.

However, complex control results in complicated valve actuations. As a result, sophisticated interactions between control and flow layers substantially raise the design difficulty. Previous work on design automation for microfluidics neglects the interactions between the control and flow layers and designs each layer separately, which leads to unrealistic designs. We propose the first planarity-guaranteed architectural model, and the first physical-design module models for important microfluidic components, which have modelled the interactions between both control and flow layers, while reducing the design difficulty. Based on the above, we propose the co-layout synthesis tool called Columba, which considers the pressure sharing among different valves, and routes channels in an any-angled manner.

However, 3D NAND needs to consume enormous time for garbage collection because of live-page copying overhead and long block erase time. To alleviate the impact of live-page copying on the performance of 3D NAND, a sub-block erase design has been designed. With sub-block erase design, this paper proposes a performance booster strategy to extremely boost the performance of garbage collection.

Unfortunately, DWDM increases susceptibility to intermodulation effects, which reduces signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for photonic data transfers. Additionally, process variations induce variations in the width and thickness of MRs causing resonance wavelength shifts, which further reduces SNR, and creates communication errors. This paper proposes a novel framework (called PICO) for mitigating heterodyne crosstalk due to process variations and intermodulation effects in PNoC architectures. Experimental results indicate that our approach can improve the worst-case SNR by up to 4.4\u00d7 and significantly enhance the reliability of DWDM-based PNoC architectures.","author":["Sai Vineel Reddy Chittamuru","Ishan G.

As adders are the key building blocks in many applications, approximate adders have been widely studied recently. However, existing approximate adders may introduce sign bit error when doing two's complement signed addition, which is not tolerable for some applications. In this work, we propose a scheme that can correct sign bit error with low area and delay overhead. It is a general design applicable to many block-based approximate adders. This design not only can correct the sign bit error when it occurs, but also can fix some errors in the most significant bits even if there is no sign bit error. Experimental results on a real application, namely edge detection, showed that the approximate adders with our sign bit error correction module were up to 5.5 times better in peak signal-to-noise ratio than the original approximate adders, while the area and delay overhead is small.","author":["Rui Zhou","Weikang Qian"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '16: Proceedings of the 26th edition on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2016","Pages   221\u2013226","https://doi.org/10.1145/2902961.2903012"],"date":"18 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"J.

While previous work has proposed programming language extensions to allow this static checking, the resulting languages are too restrictive for practical use and have not been implemented. In this paper, we describe the new language JFlow, an extension to the Java language that adds statically-checked information flow annotations. JFlow provides several new features that make information flow checking more flexible and convenient than in previous models: a decentralized label model, label polymorphism, run-time label checking, and automatic label inference. JFlow also supports many language features that have never been integrated successfully with static information flow control, including objects, subclassing, dynamic type tests, access control, and exceptions. This paper defines the JFlow language and presents formal rules that are used to check JFlow programs for correctness. Because most checking is static, there is little code space, data space, or run-time overhead in the JFlow implementation.","author":["Andrew C.

Unlike traditional computing environment, the workload of IoT significantly varies overtime. Thus, an efficient runtime profiling is required to extract highly frequent computations and pre-store them for memory-based computing. In this paper, we propose an approximate computing technique using a low-cost adaptive associative memory, named ACAM, which utilizes runtime learning and profiling. To recognize the temporal locality of data in real-world applications, our design exploits a reinforcement learning algorithm with a least recently use (LRU) strategy to select images to be profiled; the profiler is implemented using an approximate concurrent state machine. The profiling results are then stored into ACAM for computation reuse. Since the selected images represent the observed input dataset, we can avoid redundant computations thanks to high hit rates displayed in the associative memory. We evaluate ACAM on the recent AMD Southern Island GPU architecture, and the experimental results shows that the proposed design achieves by 34.7% energy saving for image processing applications with an acceptable quality of service (i.e., PSNR>30dB).","author":["Mohsen Imani","Yeseong Kim","Abbas Rahimi","Tajana Rosing"],"issue":["ISLPED '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","August 2016","Pages   162\u2013167","https://doi.org/10.1145/2934583.2934595"],"date":"08 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"S.

The data is stored in the form of polarization of the ferroelectric (FE) layer in the gate stack of the FEFET. The proposed flip-flop utilizes the non-volatility of the three-terminal FEFET to optimize the data backup and restore operations. We perform an extensive device-circuit analysis to provide insights into the design of the proposed flip-flop. We discuss the optimization of the FE thickness in the gate stack of the FEFET to introduce suitable non-volatility and present the implications at the circuit level. Our analysis shows that by virtue of the three terminal structure of the FEFET and the order of magnitude difference in the current for the two polarization states, the design of the backup/restore module is considerably simplified. Compared to a FE capacitor based non-volatile flip-flop, the proposed flip-flop achieves 40%--50% smaller backup delay, 27%--40% lower backup energy, comparable restore delay and up to an order of magnitude lower restore energy. While the FE capacitor based design leads to 76% area penalty compared to a conventional (volatile) flip-flop, the proposed design incurs only 35% area overhead.","author":["Danni Wang","Sumitha George","Ahmedullah Aziz","Suman Datta","Vijaykrishnan Narayanan","Sumeet K.

A number of kernel approximation methods have thus been proposed in the recent years, among which the random features method gains much popularity due to its simplicity and direct reduction of nonlinear problem to a linear one. Different random feature functions have since been proposed to approximate a variety of kernel functions. Among them the Random Binning (RB) feature, proposed in the first random-feature paper [21], has drawn much less attention than the Random Fourier (RF) feature proposed also in [21]. In this work, we observe that the RB features, with right choice of optimization solver, could be orders-of-magnitude more efficient than other random features and kernel approximation methods under the same requirement of accuracy. We thus propose the first analysis of RB from the perspective of optimization, which by interpreting RB as a Randomized Block Coordinate Descent in the infinite-dimensional space, gives a faster convergence rate compared to that of other random features. In particular, we show that by drawing R random grids with at least \u03ba number of non-empty bins per grid in expectation, RB method achieves a convergence rate of O(1/\u03ba R)), which not only sharpens its O(1/\u221aR) rate from Monte Carlo analysis, but also shows a \u03ba times speedup over other random features under the same analysis framework. In addition, we demonstrate another advantage of RB in the L1-regularized setting, where unlike other random features, a RB-based Coordinate Descent solver can be parallelized with guaranteed speedup proportional to \u03ba. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the RB features over other random features and kernel approximation methods.","author":["Lingfei Wu","Ian E.H.

There have been many hybrid systems proposed in the past that use a mix of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to boost the performance. More recently, some work has focused on recommendations that use external knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement content-based recommendation. In this paper, we investigate three methods for making KG based recommendations using a general-purpose probabilistic logic system called ProPPR. The simplest of the models, EntitySim, uses only the links of the graph. We then extend the model to TypeSim that also uses the types of the entities to boost its generalization capabilities. Next, we develop a graph based latent factor model, GraphLF, which combines the strengths of latent factorization with graphs. We compare our approaches to a recently proposed state-of-the-art graph recommendation method on two large datasets, Yelp and MovieLens-100K. The experiments illustrate that our approaches can give large performance improvements. Additionally, we demonstrate that knowledge graphs give maximum advantage when the dataset is sparse, and gradually become redundant as more training data becomes available, and hence are most useful in cold-start settings.","author":["Rose Catherine","William Cohen"],"issue":["RecSys '16: Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems","September 2016","Pages   325\u2013332","https://doi.org/10.1145/2959100.2959131"],"date":"07 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"A.

Existing EM signoff mainly relies on current density-based assessment using Black's equation and Blech product. This model does not work well for multi-branch interconnect wires as the stresses developed in each wire segment is not independent of one another. In this paper, we present a novel and fast EM Immortality check for general multi-branch interconnect trees. Instead of using current density as the key parameter as in traditional methods, the new method estimates the EM-induced stress in general multi-branch interconnects based on the terminal voltages or potentials. It can be viewed as the Blech product for multi-branch interconnects for fast check of EM immortality of wires. Besides, this voltage-based EM (VBEM) assessment technique can naturally comprehend the impact of the topology of the wire structure on EM-induced stress. As a result, this new VBEM analysis method is very amenable to EM violation fixing as it brings new capabilities to the physical design stage. The VBEM stress estimation method is based on the fundamental steady-state stress equations. This approach eliminates the need for complex look-up tables for different geometries and can be implemented in CAD tools very easily as we demonstrate on real design examples. We show that its solution is consistent with the physics-based dynamic EM stress evaluations from the numerical analysis by COMSOL.","author":["Zeyu Sun","Ertugrul Demircan","Mehul D.

Low-complexity classifiers used in power-constrained and performance-limited scenarios are characterized by operations on small image maps with 2-3 deep layers and few class labels. For these use cases, we consider a range of embedded systems with 5--20 W power budgets such as the Xilinx ZC706 board (with MXP soft vector processor), NVIDIA Jetson TX1 (GPU), TI Keystone II (DSP) as well as the Adapteva Parallella board (custom multi-core with NoC). Deep Learning computations push the capabilities of these platforms to the limit through compute-intensive evaluations of multiple 2D convolution filters per layer, and high communication requirements arising from the movement of intermediate maps across layers. We present CaffePresso, a Caffe-compatible framework for generating optimized mappings of user-supplied ConvNet specifications to target various accelerators such as FPGAs, DSPs, GPUs, RISC-multicores. We use an automated code generation and auto-tuning approach based on knowledge of the ConvNet requirements, as well as platform-specific constraints such as on-chip memory capacity, bandwidth and ALU potential. While one may expect the Jetson TX1 + cuDNN to deliver high performance for ConvNet configurations, (1) we observe a flipped result with slower GPU processing compared to most other systems for smaller embedded-friendly datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR10, and (2) faster and more energy efficient implementation on the older 28nm TI Keystone II DSP over the newer 20nm NVIDIA TX1 SoC in all cases.","author":["Gopalakrishna Hegde","Siddhartha","Nachiappan Ramasamy","Nachiket Kapre"],"issue":["CASES '16: Proceedings of the International Conference on Compilers, Architectures and Synthesis for Embedded Systems","October 2016","Article No.: 14","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2968455.2968511"],"date":"01 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"Z.

However, is it always possible to sense human respiration no matter where the subject stays and faces? What affects human respiration sensing and what's the theory behind? In this paper, we first introduce the Fresnel model in free space, then verify the Fresnel model for WiFi radio propagation in indoor environment. Leveraging the Fresnel model and WiFi radio propagation properties derived, we investigate the impact of human respiration on the receiving RF signals and develop the theory to relate one's breathing depth, location and orientation to the detectability of respiration. With the developed theory, not only when and why human respiration is detectable using WiFi devices become clear, it also sheds lights on understanding the physical limit and foundation of WiFi-based sensing systems. Intensive evaluations validate the developed theory and case studies demonstrate how to apply the theory to the respiration monitoring system design.","author":["Hao Wang","Daqing Zhang","Junyi Ma","Yasha Wang","Yuxiang Wang","Dan Wu","Tao Gu","Bing Xie"],"issue":["UbiComp '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing","September 2016","Pages   25\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/2971648.2971744"],"date":"12 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"Heba Abdelnasser, Khaled A Harras, and Moustafa Youssef. 2015.

However, the extreme sparsity of user-POI matrix and cold-start issue create severe challenges, causing CF-based methods to degrade significantly in their recommendation performance. Moreover, location-based recommendation requires spatiotemporal context awareness and dynamic tracking of the user's latest preferences in a real-time manner. To address these challenges, we stand on recent advances in embedding learning techniques and propose a generic graph-based embedding model, called GE, in this paper. GE jointly captures the sequential effect, geographical influence, temporal cyclic effect and semantic effect in a unified way by embedding the four corresponding relational graphs (POI-POI, POI-Region, POI-Time and POI-Word)into a shared low dimensional space. Then, to support the real-time recommendation, we develop a novel time-decay method to dynamically compute the user's latest preferences based on the embedding of his/her checked-in POIs learnt in the latent space. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our model on two real large-scale datasets, and the experimental results show its superiority over other competitors, especially in recommending cold-start POIs. Besides, we study the contribution of each factor to improve location-based recommendation and find that both sequential effect and temporal cyclic effect play more important roles than geographical influence and semantic effect.","author":["Min Xie","Hongzhi Yin","Hao Wang","Fanjiang Xu","Weitong Chen","Sen Wang"],"issue":["CIKM '16: Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2016","Pages   15\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983711"],"date":"24 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"S.

Using Wikipedia, we derive prerequisite relations among these concepts. A traditional approach for concept map extraction consists of two sub-problems: key concept extraction and concept relationship identification. Previous work for the most part had considered these two sub-problems independently. We propose a framework that jointly optimizes these sub-problems and investigates methods that identify concept relationships. Experiments on concept maps that are manually extracted in six educational areas (computer networks, macroeconomics, precalculus, databases, physics, and geometry) show that our model outperforms supervised learning baselines that solve the two sub-problems separately. Moreover, we observe that incorporating textbook information helps with concept map extraction.","author":["Shuting Wang","Alexander Ororbia","Zhaohui Wu","Kyle Williams","Chen Liang","Bart Pursel","C.

However, performance of multi-FPGA based systems is severely affected by widening logic to I/O gap in FPGAs. In order to address the performance issue, in this work, we propose an exploration and optimization flow for multi-FPGA based prototyping that gives an end-to-end experience starting from benchmark generation to optimized inter-FPGA routing. Using generic tools of the flow, ten large benchmarks are generated. Then, through a generic novel inter-FPGA routing environment, effect of variation of number of FPGAs as well as number of inter-FPGA tracks on the performance of a target design is explored. For performance exploration and optimization, five different FPGA boards are utilized where number of FPGAs on board are varied from two to six. Moreover, for each board four different inter-FPGA track combinations are used. Experimental results reveal that multi-FPGA boards with inter-FPGA tracks corresponding optimally to the cut net requirements of benchmarks under consideration give best frequency results. Furthermore, frequency comparison between different boards shows that FPGA board with six FPGAs gives, on average, best frequency results. Finally, we also perform frequency-price analysis which shows that board with four FPGAs gives better frequency-price tradeoff as compared to other FPGA boards under consideration.","author":["Umer Farooq","Roselyne Chotin-Avot","Moazam Azeem","Maminionja Ravoson","Mariem Turki","Habib Mehrez"],"issue":["RSP '16: Proceedings of the 27th International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping: Shortening the Path from Specification to Prototype","October 2016","Pages   107\u2013113","https://doi.org/10.1145/2990299.2990317"],"date":"01 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"Altera. http://www.altera.com, 2015.","order":1},{"text":"S.

While custom hardware helps the computation, fetching weights from DRAM is two orders of magnitude more expensive than ALU operations, and dominates the required power.Previously proposed 'Deep Compression' makes it possible to fit large DNNs (AlexNet and VGGNet) fully in on-chip SRAM. This compression is achieved by pruning the redundant connections and having multiple connections share the same weight. We propose an energy efficient inference engine (EIE) that performs inference on this compressed network model and accelerates the resulting sparse matrix-vector multiplication with weight sharing. Going from DRAM to SRAM gives EIE 120\u00d7 energy saving; Exploiting sparsity saves 10\u00d7; Weight sharing gives 8\u00d7; Skipping zero activations from ReLU saves another 3\u00d7. Evaluated on nine DNN benchmarks, EIE is 189\u00d7 and 13\u00d7 faster when compared to CPU and GPU implementations of the same DNN without compression. EIE has a processing power of 102 GOPS working directly on a compressed network, corresponding to 3 TOPS on an uncompressed network, and processes FC layers of AlexNet at 1.88\u00d7104 frames/sec with a power dissipation of only 600mW. It is 24,000\u00d7 and 3,400\u00d7 more energy efficient than a CPU and GPU respectively. Compared with DaDianNao, EIE has 2.9\u00d7, 19\u00d7 and 3\u00d7 better throughput, energy efficiency and area efficiency.","author":["Song Han","Xingyu Liu","Huizi Mao","Jing Pu","Ardavan Pedram","Mark A.

The complexity comes from the need to simultaneously process hundreds of filters and channels in the high-dimensional convolutions, which involve a significant amount of data movement. Although highly-parallel compute paradigms, such as SIMD/SIMT, effectively address the computation requirement to achieve high throughput, energy consumption still remains high as data movement can be more expensive than computation. Accordingly, finding a dataflow that supports parallel processing with minimal data movement cost is crucial to achieving energy-efficient CNN processing without compromising accuracy.In this paper, we present a novel dataflow, called row-stationary (RS), that minimizes data movement energy consumption on a spatial architecture. This is realized by exploiting local data reuse of filter weights and feature map pixels, i.e., activations, in the high-dimensional convolutions, and minimizing data movement of partial sum accumulations. Unlike dataflows used in existing designs, which only reduce certain types of data movement, the proposed RS dataflow can adapt to different CNN shape configurations and reduces all types of data movement through maximally utilizing the processing engine (PE) local storage, direct inter-PE communication and spatial parallelism. To evaluate the energy efficiency of the different dataflows, we propose an analysis framework that compares energy cost under the same hardware area and processing parallelism constraints. Experiments using the CNN configurations of AlexNet show that the proposed RS dataflow is more energy efficient than existing dataflows in both convolutional (1.4\u00d7 to 2.5\u00d7) and fully-connected layers (at least 1.3\u00d7 for batch size larger than 16). The RS dataflow has also been demonstrated on a fabricated chip, which verifies our energy analysis.","author":["Yu-Hsin Chen","Joel Emer","Vivienne Sze"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 44","Issue 3","June 2016","pp   367\u2013379","https://doi.org/10.1145/3007787.3001177"],"date":"18 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"Y.

During read operation, it configures the crossbar array into a four-terminal resistance network, which is composed of the selected cell and three other resistors corresponding to unselected cells that contribute to the sneak-path. Two sensing voltages with equal potential are applied to three terminals of the network. One is for sensing the resistance of the selected cell; the other is for creating zero-voltage drop across one of the three resistors, which connects the sneak-path to the selected cell. This effectively suppresses the current injected by the sneak-path to the selected cell-sensing loop. This work also proposes a cost-effective data-encoding circuit that guarantees that at least half of the memory cells are in a high-resistance state, which further minimizes sneak-path current. The impact of key design parameters, such as sensing voltage, switch on-resistance, and the ratio of memory cell resistances in different states, as well as nonideal effects are investigated. Equations for estimating the maximum array size to share a single read circuit are derived. The effectiveness of the proposed design has been validated via circuit simulations. Impacts of the word-/bit-line resistance are also analyzed.","author":["Yao Wang","Liang Rong","Haibo Wang","Guangjun Wen"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 13","Issue 2","March 2017","Article No.: 25","pp   1\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/3012002"],"date":"03 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"P.

These learned representations have been demonstrated to be helpful in many learning tasks such as network clustering and link prediction. While existing algorithms follow an unsupervised manner, nodes in many real-world attributed networks are often associated with abundant label information, which is potentially valuable in seeking more effective joint vector representations. In this paper, we investigate how labels can be modeled and incorporated to improve attributed network embedding. This is a challenging task since label information could be noisy and incomplete. In addition, labels are completely distinct with the geometrical structure and node attributes. The bewildering combination of heterogeneous information makes the joint vector representation learning more difficult. To address these issues, we propose a novel Label informed Attributed Network Embedding (LANE) framework. It can smoothly incorporate label information into the attributed network embedding while preserving their correlations. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly better performance compared with the state-of-the-art embedding algorithms.","author":["Xiao Huang","Jundong Li","Xia Hu"],"issue":["WSDM '17: Proceedings of the Tenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2017","Pages   731\u2013739","https://doi.org/10.1145/3018661.3018667"],"date":"02 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"L.

Hence, accelerators for scientific computing need to be fast and energy efficient. Therefore, partial differential equations (PDEs), as an integral component of many scientific computing tasks, require efficient implementation. In this regard, FPGAs are well suited for data-parallel computations as they occur in PDE solvers. However, including FPGAs in the programming flow is not trivial, as hardware description languages (HDLs) have to be exploited, which requires detailed knowledge of the underlying hardware. This issue is tackled by OpenCL, which allows to write standardized code in a C-like fashion, rendering experience with HDLs unnecessary. Yet, hiding the underlying hardware from the developer makes it challenging to implement solvers that exploit the full FPGA potential. Therefore, we propose in this work a comprehensive set of generic and specific optimization techniques for PDE solvers using OpenCL that improve the FPGA performance and energy efficiency by orders of magnitude. Based on these optimizations, our study shows that, despite the high abstraction level of OpenCL, very energy efficient PDE accelerators on the FPGA fabric can be designed, making the FPGA an ideal solution for power-constrained applications.","author":["Dennis Weller","Fabian Oboril","Dimitar Lukarski","Juergen Becker","Mehdi Tahoori"],"issue":["FPGA '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2017","Pages   247\u2013256","https://doi.org/10.1145/3020078.3021730"],"date":"22 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"D.

The performance of many interactive applications such as real-time ray tracing hinges on the construction and traversal efficiency of kd-trees. In recent years, there is a pressing demand for accelerating the construction process due to the fast-growing need of handling dynamic scenes. Existing construction algorithms typically follow a layer-by-layer scheme, which significantly limits the efficiency on the use of multi-core CPUs and GPUs. In this paper, we propose a concurrent multi-layer kd-tree construction algorithm to unleash the inherent parallelism. For a given scene, the algorithm uses Morton code to split its bounding box and orders primitives by Morton curve. A path compression procedure is then concurrently executed on all essential nodes that contain primitives to generate the hierarchy in the target kd-tree. All redundant nodes that have no primitives along the compression paths are collapsed to fast slip empty space. The fully parallel algorithmic scheme adapts variable primitives space and drastically shortens the construction time. A case study on ray tracing benchmarks demonstrates that our kd-tree construction method outperforms the state of art work by an average factor of over 10 and still enables high performance traversal.","author":["Zonghui Li","Yangdong Deng","Ming Gu"],"issue":["I3D '17: Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games","February 2017","Article No.: 16","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3023368.3023382"],"date":"25 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"Adams, A., Gelfand, N., Dolson, J., and Levoy, M. 2009.

The field of HRI has started to report on how to make effective robots usable in educational contexts. However, many challenges remain. For instance, which interaction strategies aid learning, and which hamper learning? How can we deal with the current technical limitations of robots? Answering these and other questions requires a multidisciplinary effort, including contributions from pedagogy, developmental psychology, (computational) linguistics, artificial intelligence and HRI, among others. This abstract provides a brief overview of the current state-of-the-art in social robots designed for learning and describes the aims of the Robots for Learning (R4L) workshop in bringing together a multidisciplinary audience for furthering the development of market-ready educational robots.","author":["Wafa Johal","Paul Vogt","James Kennedy","Mirjam de Haas","Ana Paiva","Ginevra Castellano","Sandra Okita","Fumihide Tanaka","Tony Belpaeme","Pierre Dillenbourg"],"issue":["HRI '17: Proceedings of the Companion of the 2017 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","March 2017","Pages   423\u2013424","https://doi.org/10.1145/3029798.3029801"],"date":"06 March 2017","ref":[{"text":"G.

We investigate whether having a person \"n the loop\" with a robot---i.e., the mere involvement of a person with a robot---affects human-robot trust. We posited that people who press a button on a robot to permit its plan execution would exhibit greater trust than people who merely observe a robot's autonomous execution of the same plan. We assessed trust both toward the robot that participants interacted with and toward robots in potential future use contexts. We found (a) a marginally significant and medium-sized effect of the button press on people's trust in the observed robot (p = .12, d = .52), and (b) a significant and large-sized effect on people's trust in potential future robots, but only in social use contexts (p = .04, d = .68).","author":["Daniel Ullman","Bertram F.

The key assumption has always been that the latter is much slower than the former. This affects all aspects of a DBMS's runtime architecture. But the arrival of new non-volatile memory (NVM) storage that is almost as fast as DRAM with fine-grained read/writes invalidates these previous design choices. In this tutorial, we provide an outline on how to build a new DBMS given the changes to hardware landscape due to NVM. We survey recent developments in this area, and discuss the lessons learned from prior research on designing NVM database systems. We highlight a set of open research problems, and present ideas for solving some of them.","author":["Joy Arulraj","Andrew Pavlo"],"issue":["SIGMOD '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data","May 2017","Pages   1753\u20131758","https://doi.org/10.1145/3035918.3054780"],"date":"09 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"Direct access for files (DAX). https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/dax.txt.","order":1},{"text":"H-Store. http://hstore.cs.brown.edu.","order":2},{"text":"LIBNVDIMM: Non-volatile devices. https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/nvdimm/nvdimm.txt.","order":3},{"text":"Peloton Database Management System. http://pelotondb.org.","order":4},{"text":"Persistent memory file system (PMFS). https://github.com/linux-pmfs/pmfs.","order":5},{"text":"Persistent memory programming library. http://pmem.io/.","order":6},{"text":"SAP HANA administration guide: Load/unload a column table into/from memory. http://help.sap.com/saphelp_hanaplatform/helpdata/en/c1/33165bbb57101493c5fb19b5b8607f/content.htm.","order":7},{"text":"JEDEC announces support for NVDIMM hybrid memory modules. https://www.jedec.org/news/pressreleases/jedec-announces-support-nvdimm-hybrid-memory-modules, 2015.","order":8},{"text":"Intel Architecture Instruction Set Extensions Programming Reference. https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/b4/3a/319433-024.pdf, 2016.","order":9},{"text":"NVM Express over Fabrics specification. http://www.nvmexpress.org/specifications, 2016.","order":10},{"text":"Oracle In-Memory Database White Paper. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/in-memory/overview/twp-oracle-database-in-memory-2245633.html, 2016.","order":11},{"text":"R.

We present a detailed analysis of the impact of 3D-IC hotspot aggregation on the refresh behavior of the stacked DRAM-based L3 cache. We also present the consequence of the refresh variation on the overall system performance and cache energy consumption. Our analysis demonstrates that memory intensive applications are influenced more strongly by the DRAM refresh variation. We show that there is an optimal operating point where, with a reduced clock frequency, processor cores would actually recover any performance loss induced by DRAM refresh and at the same time the cache energy consumption could be optimized. We propose a low overhead run-time method that can identify the best CPU frequency modulation factor to cool the system to minimize accelerated refresh rates in the DRAM caches. Our system can provide a customizable trade-off between performance of the processor and energy savings of the memory.","author":["Dawei Li","Kaicheng Zhang","Akhil Guliani","Seda Ogrenci-Memik"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 3","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062197"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Hybrid Memory Cube: http://www.hybridmemorycube.org/technology.html.","order":1},{"text":"Tezzaron Semiconductor, \"Octopus 8-port DRAM for die-stack applications\", May 2010.","order":2},{"text":"D.

Whereas Merkle Tree (MT) memory authentication is effective in thwarting data tampering attacks, it drastically increases cell writes and memory accesses, adversely impacting NVM energy, lifetime, and system performance (instructions per cycle (IPC)). We propose ASSURE, a low overhead, high performance Authentication Scheme for SecURE energy efficient (ASSURE) NVMs. ASSURE synergistically integrates (i) smart message authentication codes (SMACs), which eliminate redundant cell writes by enabling MAC computation of only modified words on memory writes, with (ii) multi-root MTs (MMTs), which reduce MT reads/writes by constructing either high performance static MMTs (SMMTs) or low overhead dynamic MMTs (DMMTs) over frequently accessed memory regions. Our full-system simulations of the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks on a triple-level cell (TLC) resistive RAM (RRAM) architecture show that on average, SMMT ASSURE (DMMT ASSURE) reduces NVM energy by 59% (55%), increases memory lifetime by 2.36x (2.11x), and improves IPC by 11% (10%), over state-of-the-art MT memory authentication.","author":["Joydeep Rakshit","Kartik Mohanram"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 11","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062205"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"B.

Such guardbands manifest as reduced efficiency and performance. Existing approaches to reduce guardbands trade off aging impact for increased circuit overhead. By contrast, the goal of this work is to completely remove guardbands through exploring, for the first time, application of approximate computing principles in the context of aging. As a result of naively narrowing or removing guardbands, timing errors start to appear as transistors age. We demonstrate that even in circuits that may tolerate errors, aging can be catastrophic due to unacceptable quality loss. Furthermore, quantifying such aging-induced quality loss necessitates expensive (often infeasible) gate-level simulations of the complete design. We show how nondeterministic aging-induced timing errors can be converted into deterministic and controlled approximations instead. We first translate the required guardband over time into an equivalent reduction in precision for individual RTL components. We then demonstrate how, based on pre-characterization of RTL components, we can quantify aging-induced approximation at the whole microarchitecture level without the need for further gate-level simulations. Results show that a 3 bit reduction in precision is sufficient to sustain 10 years of operation under worst-case aging in the context of an image processing circuit. This corresponds to an acceptable PSNR reduction of merely 8 dB, while at the same time increasing area and energy efficiency by 13%.","author":["Hussam Amrouch","Behnam Khaleghi","Andreas Gerstlauer","J\u00f6rg Henkel"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 41","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062331"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"J.

To unleash the power of FPGA, however, the programmability gap has to be filled so that applications specified in high-level programming languages can be efficiently mapped and scheduled on FPGA. The above problem is even more challenging for irregular applications, in which the execution dependency can only be determined at run time. Thus over-serialized accelerators are generated from existing works that rely on compile time analysis to schedule the computation. In this work, we propose a comprehensive software-hardware co-design framework, which captures parallelism in irregular applications and aggressively schedules pipelined execution on reconfigurable platform. Based on an inherently parallel abstraction packaging parallelism for runtime schedule, our framework significantly differs from existing works that tend to schedule executions at compile time. An irregular application is formulated as a set of tasks with their dependencies specified as rules describing the conditions under which a subset of tasks can be executed concurrently. Then datapaths on FPGA will be generated by transforming applications in the formulation into task pipelines orchestrated by evaluating rules at runtime, which could exploit fine-grained pipeline parallelism as handcrafted accelerators do. An evaluation shows that this framework is able to produce datapath with its quality close to handcrafted designs. Experiments show that generated accelerators are dramatically more efficient than those created by current high-level synthesis tools. Meanwhile, accelerators generated for a set of irregular applications attain 0.5x~1.9x performance compared to equivalent software implementations we selected on a server-grade 10-core processor, with the memory subsystem remaining as the bottleneck.","author":["Zhaoshi Li","Leibo Liu","Yangdong Deng","Shouyi Yin","Yao Wang","Shaojun Wei"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   575\u2013586","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080228"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"2006. 9th DIMACS Implementation Challenge: Shortest Paths.

Hence, black-box optimization has become increasingly important as systems have become more complex. In this paper we describe Google Vizier, a Google-internal service for performing black-box optimization that has become the de facto parameter tuning engine at Google. Google Vizier is used to optimize many of our machine learning models and other systems, and also provides core capabilities to Google's Cloud Machine Learning HyperTune subsystem. We discuss our requirements, infrastructure design, underlying algorithms, and advanced features such as transfer learning and automated early stopping that the service provides.","author":["Daniel Golovin","Benjamin Solnik","Subhodeep Moitra","Greg Kochanski","John Karro","D.

NDN striking features like named-data self-secured contents, name-base-forwarding, in-network caching and mobility support suits the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, which aims to enable communication among smart devices and to combine all Internet-based smart applications under the one roof. With these aims, IoT put many research challenges regarding its network architecture as it should support heterogeneous devices and offer scalability. IoT may depend on the names and addresses of billions of the devices and should smartly manage the bulk of data produced every second. IoT application smart campus has gained a lot of attention in both industry and academia due to many reasons. Therefore, to design NDN for IoT, a sophisticated naming scheme is needed to explore and it is the main motivation for this work. In this paper, we study NDN-IoT smart campus (in terms of connected devices and contents) and find that it lacks in a reasonable naming and addressing mechanism; and thus we propose NDN based Hybrid Naming Scheme (NDN-HNS) for IoT based Smart Campus (IoTSC).","author":["Sobia Arshad","Muhammad Awais Azam","Syed Hassan Ahmed","Jonathan Loo"],"issue":["ICFNDS '17: Proceedings of the International Conference on Future Networks and Distributed Systems","July 2017","Article No.: 41","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3102304.3102345"],"date":"19 July 2017","ref":[{"text":"2012. 50 Sensor Applications for a Smarter World.

But creating, \u201cprogramming,\u201d and integrating this hardware into a hardware/software system is difficult. We address this problem by extending the image processing language Halide so users can specify which portions of their applications should become hardware accelerators, and then we provide a compiler that uses this code to automatically create the accelerator along with the \u201cglue\u201d code needed for the user\u2019s application to access this hardware. Starting with Halide not only provides a very high-level functional description of the hardware but also allows our compiler to generate a complete software application, which accesses the hardware for acceleration when appropriate. Our system also provides high-level semantics to explore different mappings of applications to a heterogeneous system, including the flexibility of being able to change the throughput rate of the generated hardware.We demonstrate our approach by mapping applications to a commercial Xilinx Zynq system. Using its FPGA with two low-power ARM cores, our design achieves up to 6\u00d7 higher performance and 38\u00d7 lower energy compared to the quad-core ARM CPU on an NVIDIA Tegra K1, and 3.5\u00d7 higher performance with 12\u00d7 lower energy compared to the K1\u2019s 192-core GPU.","author":["Jing Pu","Steven Bell","Xuan Yang","Jeff Setter","Stephen Richardson","Jonathan Ragan-Kelley","Mark Horowitz"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 14","Issue 3","September 2017","Article No.: 26","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/3107953"],"date":"16 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

One classical setting is predicting users' personalized sequential behavior (or 'next-item' recommendation), where the challenges mainly lie in modeling 'third-order' interactions between a user, her previously visited item(s), and the next item to consume. Existing methods typically decompose these higher-order interactions into a combination of pairwise relationships, by way of which user preferences (user-item interactions) and sequential patterns (item-item interactions) are captured by separate components. In this paper, we propose a unified method, TransRec, to model such third-order relationships for large-scale sequential prediction. Methodologically, we embed items into a 'transition space' where users are modeled as translation vectors operating on item sequences. Empirically, this approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on a wide spectrum of real-world datasets.

However, many such devices perform similar operations across each new input record, which provides opportunities for mining the potential information in buffered historical data, at potentially lower effort, while processing new data rather than abandoning old inputs due to limited computational energy. We call this approach incidental computing, and highlight synergies between this approach and approximation techniques when deployed on a non-volatile processor platform (NVP). In addition to incidental computations, the backup and restore operations in an incidental NVP provide approximation opportunities and optimizations that are unique to NVPs. We propose a variety of incidental approximation approaches suited to NVPs, with a focus on approximate backup and restore, and approximate recomputation in the face of power interruptions. We perform RTL level evaluation for many frequently used workloads. We show that these incidental techniques provide an average of 4.2X more forward progress than precise NVP execution.","author":["Kaisheng Ma","Xueqing Li","Jinyang Li","Yongpan Liu","Yuan Xie","Jack Sampson","Mahmut Taylan Kandemir","Vijaykrishnan Narayanan"],"issue":["MICRO-50 '17: Proceedings of the 50th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","October 2017","Pages   204\u2013218","https://doi.org/10.1145/3123939.3124533"],"date":"14 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, a conventional DMFB is limited by: (i) the number of electrical connections that can be practically realized, (ii) constraints on droplet size and volume, and (iii) the need for special fabrication processes and the associated reliability/yield concerns. To overcome the above challenges, DMFBs based on a micro-electrode-dot-array (MEDA) architecture have been proposed and fabricated recently. Error recovery is of key interest for MEDA biochips due to the need for system reliability. Errors are likely to occur during droplet manipulation due to defects, chip degradation, and the uncertainty inherent in biochemical experiments. In this paper, we first formalize error-recovery objectives, and then synthesize optimal error-recovery protocols using a model based on Stochastic Multiplayer Games (SMGs). We also present a global error-recovery technique that can update the schedule of fluidic operations in an adaptive manner. Using three representative real-life bioassays, we show that the proposed approach can effectively reduce the bioassay completion time and increase the probability of success for error recovery.","author":["Mahmoud Elfar","Zhanwei Zhong","Zipeng Li","Krishnendu Chakrabarty","Miroslav Pajic"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 16","Issue 5s","October 2017","Article No.: 127","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/3126538"],"date":"27 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"Christel Baier, Joost-Pieter Katoen, and Kim Guldstrand Larsen. 2008.

Our method consists of two steps: First, we learn nonlinear spectral representations from real-world hyperspectral datasets; for this, we build a convolutional autoencoder which allows reconstructing its own input through its encoder and decoder networks. Second, we introduce a novel optimization method, which jointly regularizes the fidelity of the learned nonlinear spectral representations and the sparsity of gradients in the spatial domain, by means of our new fidelity prior. Our technique can be applied to any existing compressive imaging architecture, and has been thoroughly tested both in simulation, and by building a prototype hyperspectral imaging system. It outperforms the state-of-the-art methods from each architecture, both in terms of spectral accuracy and spatial resolution, while its computational complexity is reduced by two orders of magnitude with respect to sparse coding techniques. Moreover, we present two additional applications of our method: hyperspectral interpolation and demosaicing. Last, we have created a new high-resolution hyperspectral dataset containing sharper images of more spectral variety than existing ones, available through our project website.","author":["Inchang Choi","Daniel S.

Existing DL testing depends heavily on manually labeled data and therefore often fails to expose erroneous behaviors for rare inputs. We design, implement, and evaluate DeepXplore, the first whitebox framework for systematically testing real-world DL systems. First, we introduce neuron coverage for systematically measuring the parts of a DL system exercised by test inputs. Next, we leverage multiple DL systems with similar functionality as cross-referencing oracles to avoid manual checking. Finally, we demonstrate how finding inputs for DL systems that both trigger many differential behaviors and achieve high neuron coverage can be represented as a joint optimization problem and solved efficiently using gradient-based search techniques. DeepXplore efficiently finds thousands of incorrect corner case behaviors (e.g., self-driving cars crashing into guard rails and malware masquerading as benign software) in state-of-the-art DL models with thousands of neurons trained on five popular datasets including ImageNet and Udacity self-driving challenge data. For all tested DL models, on average, DeepXplore generated one test input demonstrating incorrect behavior within one second while running only on a commodity laptop. We further show that the test inputs generated by DeepXplore can also be used to retrain the corresponding DL model to improve the model's accuracy by up to 3%.","author":["Kexin Pei","Yinzhi Cao","Junfeng Yang","Suman Jana"],"issue":["SOSP '17: Proceedings of the 26th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","October 2017","Pages   1\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132747.3132785"],"date":"14 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"2010.

In this research, we propose a novel structural-fitting method that utilizes the linguistic ontology into vector space representations. The ontological information is applied in two ways. The fine2coarse approach refines the word vectors from fine-grained to coarse-grained terms (word types), while the coarse2fine approach refines the word vectors from coarse-grained to fine-grained terms. In the experiments, we show that our proposed methods outperform previous approaches in seven publicly available benchmark datasets.","author":["Yang-Yin Lee","Ting-Yu Yen","Hen-Hsen Huang","Hsin-Hsi Chen"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   2151\u20132154","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133152"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"T.

MIMO is an acronym for \"multiple-input multiple-output\". Its main objective is the transmission and reception of signals at the physical layer of the wireless stack. Currently, MIMO have been made commercial, with examples being WiMAX and LTE, as well as WiFi and 802.11n. However, there is significant research to be undertaken with respect to handling interference.. Interference has been neglected in point-to-point MIMO as far as concurrent transmissions are concerned; thus, we are given the facts that MIMO offered the possibility of increased reliability through diversity and combination of gains. A technique to handle concurrent transmissions id cognitive radio, where nodes are separated to primary and secondary users competing for the channel medium. In this paper we provide a recent review on cognitive radio for MIMO.","author":["Evangelos D.

Despite the significant performance gain offered by computational NVMs, previous works have relied on manual mapping of specialized kernels to the memory arrays, making it infeasible to execute more general workloads. We combat this problem by proposing a programmable in-memory processor architecture and data-parallel programming framework. The efficiency of the proposed in-memory processor comes from two sources: massive parallelism and reduction in data movement. A compact instruction set provides generalized computation capabilities for the memory array. The proposed programming framework seeks to leverage the underlying parallelism in the hardware by merging the concepts of data-flow and vector processing. To facilitate in-memory programming, we develop a compilation framework that takes a TensorFlow input and generates code for our in-memory processor. Our results demonstrate 7.5x speedup over a multi-core CPU server for a set of applications from Parsec and 763x speedup over a server-class GPU for a set of Rodinia benchmarks.","author":["Daichi Fujiki","Scott Mahlke","Reetuparna Das"],"issue":["ASPLOS '18: Proceedings of the Twenty-Third International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2018","Pages   1\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/3173162.3173171"],"date":"19 March 2018","ref":[{"text":"Martin Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen, Craig Citro, Greg Corrado, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Ian Goodfellow, Andrew Harp, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, Yangqing Jia, Lukasz Kaiser, Manjunath Kudlur, Josh Levenberg, Dan Man, Rajat Monga, Sherry Moore, Derek Murray, Jon Shlens, Benoit Steiner, Ilya Sutskever, Paul Tucker, Vincent Vanhoucke, Vijay Vasudevan, Oriol Vinyals, Pete Warden, Martin Wicke, Yuan Yu, and Xiaoqiang Zheng. 2015.

State-of-the-art approaches use heuristics or machine learning for resource management, but unfortunately lack formalism in providing robustness against unexpected corner cases. While recent efforts deploy classical control-theoretic approaches with some guarantees and formalism, they lack scalability and autonomy to meet changing runtime goals. We present SPECTR, a new resource management approach for many-core systems that leverages formal supervisory control theory (SCT) to combine the strengths of classical control theory with state-of-the-art heuristic approaches to efficiently meet changing runtime goals. SPECTR is a scalable and robust control architecture and a systematic design flow for hierarchical control of many-core systems. SPECTR leverages SCT techniques such as gain scheduling to allow autonomy for individual controllers. It facilitates automatic synthesis of the high-level supervisory controller and its property verification. We implement SPECTR on an Exynos platform containing ARM\u00bbs big.LITTLE-based heterogeneous multi-processor (HMP) and demonstrate that SPECTR\u00bbs use of SCT is key to managing multiple interacting resources (e.g., chip power and processing cores) in the presence of competing objectives (e.g., satisfying QoS vs. power capping). The principles of SPECTR are easily applicable to any resource type and objective as long as the management problem can be modeled using dynamical systems theory (e.g., difference equations), discrete-event dynamic systems, or fuzzy dynamics.","author":["Amir M.

Traditionally, simulation at the register transfer-level has been the mainstream functional verification approach. Formal verification and various static analysis checkers have been used to complement specific corners of logic simulation. However, as the size of IC designs grow exponentially, all the above approaches fail to scale with the design growth. In recent years, logic emulation have gained popularity in functional verification, partly due to their performance and scalability benefits. There are two main approaches to logic emulation: ASIC and commercial field-programmable gate array (FPGA). In this paper, we focus on commercial FPGA based logic emulation and present various challenging problems in this area for the academic community.","author":["William N.N.

To address the demands in increasing computational capability and memory requirement, in this work, we propose the structured weight matrices (SWM)-based compression technique for both Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementations. In the algorithm part, the SWM-based framework adopts block-circulant matrices to achieve a fine-grained tradeoff between accuracy and compression ratio. The SWM-based technique can reduce computational complexity from O(n2) to O(nlog n) and storage complexity from O(n2) to O(n) for each layer and both training and inference phases. For FPGA implementations on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), we achieve at least 152X and 72X improvement in performance and energy efficiency, respectively using the SWM-based framework, compared with the baseline of IBM TrueNorth processor under same accuracy constraints using the data set of MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10. For FPGA implementations on long short term memory (LSTM) networks, the proposed SWM-based LSTM can achieve up to 21X enhancement in performance and 33.5X gains in energy efficiency compared with the ESE accelerator. For ASIC implementations, the proposed SWM-based ASIC design exhibits impressive advantages in terms of power, throughput, and energy efficiency. Experimental results indicate that this method is greatly suitable for applying DNNs onto both FPGAs and mobile/IoT devices.","author":["Caiwen Ding","Ao Ren","Geng Yuan","Xiaolong Ma","Jiayu Li","Ning Liu","Bo Yuan","Yanzhi Wang"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '18: Proceedings of the 2018 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2018","Pages   353\u2013358","https://doi.org/10.1145/3194554.3194625"],"date":"30 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"Yunji Chen, Tao Luo, Shaoli Liu, Shijin Zhang, Liqiang He, Jia Wang, Ling Li, Tianshi Chen, Zhiwei Xu, Ninghui Sun, et almbox.. 2014.

These decisions are typically made by considering only the user's keyword query, neglecting the larger information need. Users with specific needs, such as \u201cresearch papers\u201d or \u201chomepages,\u201d are not able to express these needs in a way that affects the decisions made by the metasearch engine. In this paper, we describe a metasearch engine architecture that considers the user's information need for each decision. Users with different needs, but the same keyword query, may search different sub-search engines, have different modifications made to their query, and have results ordered differently. Our architecture combines several powerful approaches together in a single general purpose metasearch engine.","author":["Eric J. Glover","Steve Lawrence","William P. Birmingham","C.

Unlike conventional hashing, extendible hashing has a dynamic structure that grows and shrinks gracefully as the database grows and shrinks. This approach simultaneously solves the problem of making hash tables that are extendible and of making radix search trees that are balanced. We study, by analysis and simulation, the performance of extendible hashing. The results indicate that extendible hashing provides an attractive alternative to other access methods, such as balanced trees.","author":["Ronald Fagin","Jurg Nievergelt","Nicholas Pippenger","H.

In contrast to existing real-time scheduling policies that merely ensure a minimal timely throughput, our design goal is to provide guarantees on both the timely throughput and data freshness in terms of age-of-information (AoI), which is a newly proposed metric that captures the \"age\" of the most recently received information at the destination of a link. The main idea is to introduce the AoI as one of the driving factors in making scheduling decisions. We first prove that the proposed scheduling policy is feasibility-optimal, i.e., satisfying the per-traffic timely throughput requirement. Then, we derive an upper bound on a considered data freshness metric in terms of AoI, demonstrating that the network-wide data freshness is guaranteed and can be tuned under the proposed scheduling policy. Interestingly, we reveal that the improvement of network data freshness is at the cost of slowing down the convergence of the timely throughput. Extensive simulations are performed to validate our analytical results. Both analytical and simulation results confirm the capability of the proposed scheduling policy to improve the data freshness without sacrificing the feasibility optimality.","author":["Ning Lu","Bo Ji","Bin Li"],"issue":["Mobihoc '18: Proceedings of the Eighteenth ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing","June 2018","Pages   191\u2013200","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209582.3209602"],"date":"26 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Chen, M., Liew, S.

An atomic swap protocol guarantees (1) if all parties conform to the protocol, then all swaps take place, (2) if some coalition deviates from the protocol, then no conforming party ends up worse off, and (3) no coalition has an incentive to deviate from the protocol. A cross-chain swap is modeled as a directed graph D, whose vertexes are parties and whose arcs are proposed asset transfers. For any pair (D, L), where D = (V,A) is a strongly-connected directed graph and L \u2282 V a feedback vertex set for D, we give an atomic cross-chain swap protocol for D, using a form of hashed timelock contracts, where the vertexes in L generate the hashlocked secrets. We show that no such protocol is possible if D is not strongly connected, or if D is strongly connected but L is not a feedback vertex set.

There are three major challenges facing RS in Taobao: scalability, sparsity and cold start. In this paper, we present our technical solutions to address these three challenges. The methods are based on a well-known graph embedding framework. We first construct an item graph from users' behavior history, and learn the embeddings of all items in the graph. The item embeddings are employed to compute pairwise similarities between all items, which are then used in the recommendation process. To alleviate the sparsity and cold start problems, side information is incorporated into the graph embedding framework. We propose two aggregation methods to integrate the embeddings of items and the corresponding side information. Experimental results from offline experiments show that methods incorporating side information are superior to those that do not. Further, we describe the platform upon which the embedding methods are deployed and the workflow to process the billion-scale data in Taobao. Using A/B test, we show that the online Click-Through-Rates (CTRs) are improved comparing to the previous collaborative filtering based methods widely used in Taobao, further demonstrating the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed methods in Taobao's live production environment.","author":["Jizhe Wang","Pipei Huang","Huan Zhao","Zhibo Zhang","Binqiang Zhao","Dik Lun Lee"],"issue":["KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2018","Pages   839\u2013848","https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3219869"],"date":"19 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"A.

In the meantime, network embedding has emerged as a convenient tool to mine and learn from networked data. As a result, it is of interest to develop HIN embedding methods. However, the heterogeneity in HINs introduces not only rich information but also potentially incompatible semantics, which poses special challenges to embedding learning in HINs. With the intention to preserve the rich yet potentially incompatible information in HIN embedding, we propose to study the problem of comprehensive transcription of heterogeneous information networks. The comprehensive transcription of HINs also provides an easy-to-use approach to unleash the power of HINs, since it requires no additional supervision, expertise, or feature engineering. To cope with the challenges in the comprehensive transcription of HINs, we propose the HEER algorithm, which embeds HINs via edge representations that are further coupled with properly-learned heterogeneous metrics. To corroborate the efficacy of HEER, we conducted experiments on two large-scale real-words datasets with an edge reconstruction task and multiple case studies. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HEER model and the utility of edge representations and heterogeneous metrics.

However, a good understanding of the capabilities of modern mobile devices for deep learning is generally lacking. To address this gap in knowledge, this paper presents a comprehensive study on performing training and inference of deep neural networks (DNNs) on mobile devices. This study is based on TensorFlow+, an extension of the widely used TensorFlow framework that enables it to train DNNs on devices and use the available GPUs to accelerate the learning. The most significant results of our study are: 1) The size of the network is crucial not only to meet the device's memory constraint but also for training performance; 2) Hardware acceleration is important to the learning speed on devices. By accelerating both the forward and backward path with the device's GPU, our extended TensorFlow can cut down the training time by 44.8%; 3) Comparing CPU, memory, and battery usages, memory size is the most serious constraint to training networks on devices.","author":["Yitao Chen","Saman Biookaghazadeh","Ming Zhao"],"issue":["HPDC '18: Proceedings of the 27th International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing","June 2018","Pages   17\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/3220192.3220460"],"date":"11 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, et al. 2016.

Existing methods mainly rely on hand-engineered features from KGs (e.g., meta paths), which requires domain knowledge. This paper presents RKGE, a KG embedding approach that automatically learns semantic representations of both entities and paths between entities for characterizing user preferences towards items. Specifically, RKGE employs a novel recurrent network architecture that contains a batch of recurrent networks to model the semantics of paths linking a same entity pair, which are seamlessly fused into recommendation. It further employs a pooling operator to discriminate the saliency of different paths in characterizing user preferences towards items. Extensive validation on real-world datasets shows the superiority of RKGE against state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that RKGE provides meaningful explanations for recommendation results.","author":["Zhu Sun","Jie Yang","Jie Zhang","Alessandro Bozzon","Long-Kai Huang","Chi Xu"],"issue":["RecSys '18: Proceedings of the 12th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems","September 2018","Pages   297\u2013305","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240323.3240361"],"date":"27 September 2018","ref":[{"text":"Phil Blunsom, Edward Grefenstette, and Nal Kalchbrenner. 2014.

Processing this amount of data poses a challenge for current computing systems. PIM enables in-place computation which reduces data movement, a major latency bottleneck in conventional systems. In this paper, we propose an in-memory implementation of fast and energy-efficient logic (FELIX) which combines the functionality of PIM with memories. To the best of authors' knowledge, FELIX is the first PIM logic to enable the single cycle NOR, NOT, NAND, minority, and OR directly in crossbar memory. We exploit the voltage threshold-based memristors to enable single cycle operations. It is a purely in-memory execution which neither reads out data nor changes sense amplifiers, while preserving data in-memory. We extend these single cycle operations to implement more complex functions like XOR and addition in memory with 2X lower latency than the fastest published PIM technique. We also increase the amount of in-memory parallelism in our design by segmenting bitlines using switches. To evaluate the efficiency of our design at the system level, we design a FELIX-based HyperDimensional (HD) computing accelerator. Our evaluation shows that for all applications tested using HD, FELIX provides on average 128.8X speedup and 5,589.3X lower energy consumption as compared to AMD GPU. FELIX HD also achieves on average 2.21X higher energy efficiency, 1.86X speedup, and 1.68X less memory as compared to the fastest PIM technique.","author":["Saransh Gupta","Mohsen Imani","Tajana Rosing"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 55","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240811"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"C.

CNNs are typically both computing and memory intensive. Emerging resistive random-access memories (RRAMs) and RRAM crossbars have demonstrated great potentials in boosting the performance and energy efficiency of CNNs. Compared with small crossbars, large crossbars show better energy efficiency with less interface overhead. However, conventional workload mapping methods for small crossbars cannot make full use of the computation ability of large crossbars. In this paper, we propose an Overlapped Mapping Method (OMM) and MIxed Size Crossbar based RRAM CNN Accelerator (MISCA) to solve this problem. MISCA with OMM can reduce the energy consumption caused by the interface circuits, and improve the parallelism of computation by leveraging the idle RRAM cells in crossbars. The simulation results show that MISCA with OMM can achieve 2.7x speedup, 30% utilization rate improvement, and 1.2x energy efficiency improvement on average compared with fixed size crossbars based accelerator using the conventional mapping method. In comparison with GPU platform, MISCA with OMM can perform 490.4x higher on average in energy efficiency and 20x higher on average in speedup. Compared with PRIME, an existing RRAM based accelerator, MISCA has 26.4x speedup and 1.65x energy efficiency improvement.","author":["Zhenhua Zhu","Jilan Lin","Ming Cheng","Lixue Xia","Hanbo Sun","Xiaoming Chen","Yu Wang","Huazhong Yang"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 69","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240825"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"M.

That is, adversarial examples, obtained by adding delicately crafted distortions onto original legal inputs, can mislead a DNN to classify them as any target labels. This work provides a solution to hardening DNNs under adversarial attacks through defensive dropout. Besides using dropout during training for the best test accuracy, we propose to use dropout also at test time to achieve strong defense effects. We consider the problem of building robust DNNs as an attacker-defender two-player game, where the attacker and the defender know each others' strategies and try to optimize their own strategies towards an equilibrium. Based on the observations of the effect of test dropout rate on test accuracy and attack success rate, we propose a defensive dropout algorithm to determine an optimal test dropout rate given the neural network model and the attacker's strategy for generating adversarial examples. We also investigate the mechanism behind the outstanding defense effects achieved by the proposed defensive dropout. Comparing with stochastic activation pruning (SAP), another defense method through introducing randomness into the DNN model, we find that our defensive dropout achieves much larger variances of the gradients, which is the key for the improved defense effects (much lower attack success rate). For example, our defensive dropout can reduce the attack success rate from 100% to 13.89% under the currently strongest attack i.e., C&W attack on MNIST dataset.","author":["Siyue Wang","Xiao Wang","Pu Zhao","Wujie Wen","David Kaeli","Peter Chin","Xue Lin"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 71","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3264699"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"Anish Athalye, Nicholas Carlini, and David Wagner. 2018.

These systems usually run multiple applications concurrently and their available resources at runtime are dynamic due to events such as starting new applications, closing existing applications, and application priority changes. In this paper, we present NestDNN, a framework that takes the dynamics of runtime resources into account to enable resource-aware multi-tenant on-device deep learning for mobile vision systems. NestDNN enables each deep learning model to offer flexible resource-accuracy trade-offs. At runtime, it dynamically selects the optimal resource-accuracy trade-off for each deep learning model to fit the model's resource demand to the system's available runtime resources. In doing so, NestDNN efficiently utilizes the limited resources in mobile vision systems to jointly maximize the performance of all the concurrently running applications. Our experiments show that compared to the resource-agnostic status quo approach, NestDNN achieves as much as 4.2% increase in inference accuracy, 2.0\u00d7 increase in video frame processing rate and 1.7\u00d7 reduction on energy consumption.","author":["Biyi Fang","Xiao Zeng","Mi Zhang"],"issue":["MobiCom '18: Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking","October 2018","Pages   115\u2013127","https://doi.org/10.1145/3241539.3241559"],"date":"15 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"2016.

This raises the need for new decomposition approaches that can help reduce problem complexity, in conjunction with new predictive methodologies that can help avoid bottlenecks and loops in the physical implementation flow. Notably, with modern design methodologies it would be very valuable to better predict final placement of the gate-level netlist: this would enable more accurate early assessment of performance, congestion and floorplan viability in the SOC floorplanning/RTL planning stages of design. In this work, we study a new criterion for the classic challenge of VLSI netlist clustering: how well netlist clusters \"stay together\" through final implementation. We propose use of several evaluators of this criterion. We also explore the use of modularity-driven clustering to identify natural clusters in a given graph without the tuning of parameters and size balance constraints typically required by VLSI CAD partitioning methods. We find that the netlist hypergraph-to-graph mapping can significantly affect quality of results, and we experimentally identify an effective recipe for weighting that also comprehends topological proximity to I/Os. Further, we empirically demonstrate that modularity-based clustering achieves better correlation to actual netlist placements than traditional VLSI CAD methods (our method is also 4X faster than use of hMetis for our largest testcases). Finally, we show a potential flow with fast \"blob placement\" of clusters to evaluate netlist and floorplan viability in early design stages; this flow can predict gate-level placement of 370K cells in 200 seconds on a single core.","author":["Mateus Foga\u00e7a","Andrew B.

Physiological signal monitoring, especially with missing data, is a challenging task in health-care monitoring. The reliable and accurate acquisition of many physiological signals can help doctors to identify and detect potential health risks. In general, the missing data problem arises due to patient movement, faulty kits, incorrect observation or interference of the network. Subsequently, this problem leads to poorly diagnosed results. The ability of LSTM model to learn long-term dependencies enables it for efficient missing data prediction. In this paper, we proposed two LSTM model for 5-step and 10-step prediction. The dataset used is MIT-BIH normal person ECG data. The experimental results obtained using the LSTM method outperforms the Linear Regression and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) method.","author":["Hemant Verma","Sudhir Kumar"],"issue":["ICDCN '19: Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Networking","January 2019","Pages   371\u2013376","https://doi.org/10.1145/3288599.3295580"],"date":"04 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Mohammed Saeed, Mauricio Villarroel, Andrew T Reisner, Gari Clifford, Li-Wei Lehman, George Moody, Thomas Heldt, Tin H Kyaw, Benjamin Moody, and Roger G Mark.

Microservices fundamentally change a lot of assumptions current cloud systems are designed with, and present both opportunities and challenges when optimizing for quality of service (QoS) and cloud utilization. In this paper we explore the implications microservices have across the cloud system stack. We first present DeathStarBench, a novel, open-source benchmark suite built with microservices that is representative of large end-to-end services, modular and extensible. DeathStarBench includes a social network, a media service, an e-commerce site, a banking system, and IoT applications for coordination control of UAV swarms. We then use DeathStarBench to study the architectural characteristics of microservices, their implications in networking and operating systems, their challenges with respect to cluster management, and their trade-offs in terms of application design and programming frameworks. Finally, we explore the tail at scale effects of microservices in real deployments with hundreds of users, and highlight the increased pressure they put on performance predictability.","author":["Yu Gan","Yanqi Zhang","Dailun Cheng","Ankitha Shetty","Priyal Rathi","Nayan Katarki","Ariana Bruno","Justin Hu","Brian Ritchken","Brendon Jackson","Kelvin Hu","Meghna Pancholi","Yuan He","Brett Clancy","Chris Colen","Fukang Wen","Catherine Leung","Siyuan Wang","Leon Zaruvinsky","Mateo Espinosa","Rick Lin","Zhongling Liu","Jake Padilla","Christina Delimitrou"],"issue":["ASPLOS '19: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","April 2019","Pages   3\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/3297858.3304013"],"date":"04 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"Luiz Barroso and Urs Hoelzle. 2009.

Instead of treating the computation as a generic data flow graph, Astra exploits domain knowledge about deep learning to adopt a custom approach to compiler optimization. The key insight in Astra is to exploit the unique repetitiveness and predictability of a deep learning job, to perform online exploration of the optimization state space in a work-conserving manner while making progress on the training job. This dynamic state space exploration in Astra uses lightweight profiling and indexing of profile data, coupled with several techniques to prune the exploration state space. Effectively, the execution layer custom-wires the infrastructure end-to-end for each job and hardware, while keeping the compiler simple and maintainable. We have implemented Astra in two popular deep learning frameworks, PyTorch and Tensorflow. On state-of-the-art deep learning models, we show that Astra improves end-to-end performance of deep learning training by up to 3x, while approaching the performance of hand-optimized implementations such as cuDNN where available. Astra also significantly outperforms static compilation frameworks such as Tensorflow XLA both in performance and robustness.","author":["Muthian Sivathanu","Tapan Chugh","Sanjay S.

The implementation of pre-trained ANNs on embedded systems requires representation of data and design parameters in low-precision fixed-point formats; which often requires retraining of the network. For such implementations, the multiply-accumulate operation is the main reason for resultant high resource and energy requirements. To address these challenges, we present Rox-ANN, a design methodology for implementing ANNs using processing elements (PEs) designed with low-precision fixed-point numbers and high performance and reduced-area approximate multipliers on FPGAs. The trained design parameters of the ANN are analyzed and clustered to optimize the total number of approximate multipliers required in the design. With our methodology, we achieve insignificant loss in application accuracy. We evaluated the design using a LeNet based implementation of the MNIST digit recognition application. The results show a 65.6%, 55.1% and 18.9% reduction in area, energy consumption and latency for a PE using 8-bit precision weights and activations and approximate arithmetic units, when compared to 16-bit full precision, accurate arithmetic PEs.","author":["Adarsha Balaji","Salim Ullah","Anup Das","Akash Kumar"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '19: Proceedings of the 2019 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2019","Pages   489\u2013494","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299874.3319490"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Murat Al\u00e7\u0131n, \u0130hsan Pehlivan, and \u0130smail Koyuncu. 2016.

Both rules and embeddings can be used for knowledge graph reasoning and they have their own advantages and difficulties. Rule-based reasoning is accurate and explainable but rule learning with searching over the graph always suffers from efficiency due to huge search space. Embedding-based reasoning is more scalable and efficient as the reasoning is conducted via computation between embeddings, but it has difficulty learning good representations for sparse entities because a good embedding relies heavily on data richness. Based on this observation, in this paper we explore how embedding and rule learning can be combined together and complement each other's difficulties with their advantages. We propose a novel framework IterE iteratively learning embeddings and rules, in which rules are learned from embeddings with proper pruning strategy and embeddings are learned from existing triples and new triples inferred by rules. Evaluations on embedding qualities of IterE show that rules help improve the quality of sparse entity embeddings and their link prediction results. We also evaluate the efficiency of rule learning and quality of rules from IterE compared with AMIE+, showing that IterE is capable of generating high quality rules more efficiently. Experiments show that iteratively learning embeddings and rules benefit each other during learning and prediction.","author":["Wen Zhang","Bibek Paudel","Liang Wang","Jiaoyan Chen","Hai Zhu","Wei Zhang","Abraham Bernstein","Huajun Chen"],"issue":["WWW '19: The World Wide Web Conference","May 2019","Pages   2366\u20132377","https://doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313612"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Molood Barati, Quan Bai, and Qing Liu. 2016.

A common example arises in collecting network data: we often obtain network datasets by recording all of the interactions among a small set of core nodes, so that we end up with a measurement of the network consisting of these core nodes along with a potentially much larger set of fringe nodes that have links to the core. Given the ubiquity of this process for assembling network data, it is crucial to understand the role of such a \u201ccore-fringe\u201d structure.  Here we study how the inclusion of fringe nodes affects the standard task of network link prediction. One might initially think the inclusion of any additional data is useful, and hence that it should be beneficial to include all fringe nodes that are available. However, we find that this is not true; in fact, there is substantial variability in the value of the fringe nodes for prediction. Once an algorithm is selected, in some datasets, including any additional data from the fringe can actually hurt prediction performance; in other datasets, including some amount of fringe information is useful before prediction performance saturates or even declines; and in further cases, including the entire fringe leads to the best performance. While such variety might seem surprising, we show that these behaviors are exhibited by simple random graph models.","author":["Austin Benson","Jon Kleinberg"],"issue":["WWW '19: The World Wide Web Conference","May 2019","Pages   94\u2013104","https://doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313626"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Emmanuel Abbe. 2018.

In order to improve accuracy and robustness of the NPU, device-circuit-algorithm codesign with consideration of underlying device and array characteristics should outperform the optimization of individual device or algorithm. In this work, we provide a joint device-circuit-algorithm analysis and propose the corresponding design guidelines. Key innovations include: 1) An end-to-end simulator for RRAM NPU is developed with an integrated framework from device to algorithm. 2) The complete design of circuit and architecture for RRAM NPU is provided to make the analysis much close to the real prototype. 3) A large-scale neural network as well as other general-purpose networks are processed for the study of device-circuit interaction. 4) Accuracy loss from non-idealities of RRAM, such as I-V nonlinearity, noises of analog resistance levels, voltage-drop for interconnect, ADC/DAC precision, are evaluated for the NPU design.","author":["Wenqiang Zhang","Xiaochen Peng","Huaqiang Wu","Bin Gao","Hu He","Youhui Zhang","Shimeng Yu","He Qian"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 140","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317797"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"Y.

Due to privacy concerns, we may not always have enough real data to use. In our research, we focus on data synthesization for relational databases where the database constraints of the original data must be imposed to the generated data. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted on supporting database constraints in synthetic data generation. We offer solutions by designing extensions to Tabular Generative Adversarial Network algorithm. We implemented a prototype for our approach, and compared the performance of different extensions by experiments. Related work on synthetic data generation includes classical statistical methods and neural network approaches. Synthetic Data Vault is developed using classical statistical methods. It uses Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to select the best statistical distribution to describe columnar data. TableGAN and Tabular GAN use neural networks to minimize cross entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence on marginal distributions. The main challenges to our research problem are: Classical statistical distributions cannot describe complex and mixed distributions in relational databases. Database constraints are non-differentiable. Neural networks require loss functions to be differentiable.","author":["Wanxin Li"],"issue":["SIGMOD '20: Proceedings of the 2020 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","June 2020","Pages   2875\u20132877","https://doi.org/10.1145/3318464.3384414"],"date":"11 June 2020","ref":[{"text":"W.

We confirmed that a multiple-sensor input model combining acceleration and gyro sensors improves the recognition rate. However, there was insufficient training data in the SHL dataset for the target sensor labeled as Hand. To overcome this difficulty, a transfer learning method was applied to the pre-training model from other sensors labeled as Hips and Torso. After evaluation from all combination of sensors, the transfer learning model from Acc_norm and Gyr_x for Hips and Torso had the best recognition rate of 82.1% at Hand in the submission phase.","author":["Chihiro Ito","Masaki Shuzo","Eisaku Maeda"],"issue":["UbiComp/ISWC '19 Adjunct: Adjunct Proceedings of the 2019 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and Proceedings of the 2019 ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers","September 2019","Pages   724\u2013729","https://doi.org/10.1145/3341162.3344868"],"date":"09 September 2019","ref":[{"text":"C.

Current systems use simple, generalized heuristics and ignore workload characteristics, since developing and tuning a scheduling policy for each workload is infeasible. In this paper, we show that modern machine learning techniques can generate highly-efficient policies automatically. Decima uses reinforcement learning (RL) and neural networks to learn workload-specific scheduling algorithms without any human instruction beyond a high-level objective, such as minimizing average job completion time. However, off-the-shelf RL techniques cannot handle the complexity and scale of the scheduling problem. To build Decima, we had to develop new representations for jobs' dependency graphs, design scalable RL models, and invent RL training methods for dealing with continuous stochastic job arrivals. Our prototype integration with Spark on a 25-node cluster shows that Decima improves average job completion time by at least 21% over hand-tuned scheduling heuristics, achieving up to 2x improvement during periods of high cluster load.","author":["Hongzi Mao","Malte Schwarzkopf","Shaileshh Bojja Venkatakrishnan","Zili Meng","Mohammad Alizadeh"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '19: Proceedings of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication","August 2019","Pages   270\u2013288","https://doi.org/10.1145/3341302.3342080"],"date":"19 August 2019","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, Manjunath Kudlur, Josh Levenberg, Rajat Monga, Sherry Moore, Derek G.

Enclaves strengthen the process abstraction to restore isolation guarantees. We propose MI6, an aggressively speculative out-of-order processor capable of providing secure enclaves under a threat model that includes an untrusted OS and an attacker capable of mounting any software attack currently considered practical, including those utilizing control flow mis-speculation. MI6 is inspired by Sanctum [16] and extends its isolation guarantee to more realistic memory hierarchy. It also introduces a purge instruction, which is used only when a secure process is (de)scheduled, and implements it for a complex processor microarchitecture. We model the performance impact of enclaves in MI6 through FPGA emulation on AWS F1 FPGAs by running SPEC CINT2006 benchmarks as enclaves within an untrusted Linux OS. Security comes at the cost of approximately 16.4% average slowdown for protected programs.","author":["Thomas Bourgeat","Ilia Lebedev","Andrew Wright","Sizhuo Zhang","Arvind","Srinivas Devadas"],"issue":["MICRO '52: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","October 2019","Pages   42\u201356","https://doi.org/10.1145/3352460.3358310"],"date":"12 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"[n. d.].

Recently, heterogeneous network has shown to be effective in representing diverse information in data. However, heterogeneous network embedding suffers from the imbalance issue, i.e. the size of relation types (or the number of edges in the network regarding the type) is imbalanced. In this paper, we devise a new heterogeneous network embedding method, called BHIN2vec, which considers the balance among all relation types in a network. We view the heterogeneous network embedding as simultaneously solving multiple tasks in which each task corresponds to each relation type in a network. After splitting the skip-gram loss into multiple losses corresponding to different tasks, we propose a novel random-walk strategy to focus on the tasks with high loss values by considering the relative training ratio. Unlike previous random walk strategies, our proposed random-walk strategy generates training samples according to the relative training ratio among different tasks, which results in a balanced training for the node embedding. Our extensive experiments on node classification and recommendation demonstrate the superiority of BHIN2vec compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Also, based on the relative training ratio, we analyze how much each relation type is represented in the embedding space.","author":["Seonghyeon Lee","Chanyoung Park","Hwanjo Yu"],"issue":["CIKM '19: Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2019","Pages   619\u2013628","https://doi.org/10.1145/3357384.3357893"],"date":"03 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"Rich Caruana. 1997.

One promising candidate is a variation of Resistive Random-Access Memory (ReRAM) which implements the memory bit-cells on Back-End-of-Line (BEOL) layers. This allows for fabrication of the processor logic and ReRAM main-memory to be implemented on the same chip. As the memory cells can be stacked vertically, the density of this memory also scales to 1-4F2. This tight integration allows for a high amount of parallelism between the processor and memory systems and delivers low access granularity without sacrificing density or bandwidth. In this paper, we explore physical integration of a processor with a ReRAM-based main-memory system using the bitcell technology developed by Crossbar, Inc. We present Crossbar's ReRAM technology characteristics, the methodology and assumptions used for our digital implementation, and summarize the results obtained for different array configurations. Our results indicate that, in addition to the overhead for the ReRAM access circuits, the overall integrated area increases by 11% to 19%, based on the configuration at the 45nm process node. Results from architectural simulation comparing DRAM with ReRAM based architecture are presented.","author":["Meenatchi Jagasivamani","Candace Walden","Devesh Singh","Luyi Kang","Shang Li","Mehdi Asnaashari","Sylvain Dubois","Donald Yeung","Bruce Jacob"],"issue":["MEMSYS '19: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Memory Systems","September 2019","Pages   342\u2013350","https://doi.org/10.1145/3357526.3357561"],"date":"30 September 2019","ref":[{"text":"M.

Ubiquitously available Wi-Fi signals have enabled low-cost fingerprinting-based localization solutions. Further, the rapid growth in mobile hardware capability now allows high-accuracy deep learning--based frameworks to be executed locally on mobile devices in an energy-efficient manner. However, existing deep learning--based indoor localization solutions are vulnerable to access point (AP) attacks. This article presents an analysis into the vulnerability of a convolutional neural network--based indoor localization solution to AP security compromises. Based on this analysis, we propose a novel methodology to maintain indoor localization accuracy, even in the presence of AP attacks. The proposed secured neural network framework (S-CNNLOC) is validated across a benchmark suite of paths and is found to deliver up to 10\u00d7 more resiliency to malicious AP attacks compared to its unsecured counterpart.","author":["Saideep Tiku","Sudeep Pasricha"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 18","Issue 6","January 2020","Article No.: 114","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/3362036"],"date":"15 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"The Plane Crash That Gave Americans GPS. 2019.

We summarize the state-of-the-art after two decades of research in recursive bisection placement and implement a new placer, called Capo, to empirically study the achievable limits of the approach. From among recently proposed improvements to recursive bisection, Capo incorporates a leading-edge multilevel min-cut partitioner [7], techniques for partitioning with small tolerance [8], optimal min-cut partitioners and end-case min-wirelength placers [5], previously unpublished partitioning tolerance computations, and block splitting heuristics. On the other hand, our \u201cgood enough\u201d implementation does not use \u201coverlapping\u201d [17], multi-way partitioners [17, 20], analytical placement, or congestion estimation [24, 35]. In order to run on recent industrial placement instances, Capo must take into account fixed macros, power stripes and rows with different allowed cell orientations. Capo reads industry-standard LEF/DEF, as well as formats of the GSRC bookshelf for VLSI CAD algorithms [6], to enable comparisons on available placement instances in the fixed-die regime.Capo clearly demonstrates that despite a potential mismatch of objectives, improved mincut bisection can still lead to improved placement wirelength and congestion. Our experiments on recent industrial benchmarks fail to give a clear answer to the question in the title of this paper. However, they validate a series of improvements to recursive bisection and point out a need for transparent congestion management techniques that do not worsen the wirelength of already routable placements. Our experimental flow, which validates fixed-die placement results by violation-free detailed auto-routability, provides a new norm for comparison of VLSI placement implementations.","author":["Andrew E.

We focus on ray reordering that is fully agnostic to the particular trace kernel. We summarize the existing methods for computing the ray sorting keys and discuss their properties. We propose a novel modification of a previously proposed method using the termination point estimation that is well-suited to tracing secondary rays. We evaluate the ray reordering techniques in the context of the wavefront path tracing using the RTX trace kernels. We show that ray reordering yields significantly higher trace speed on recent GPUs (1.3 \u2212 2.0 \u00d7), but to recover the reordering overhead in the hardware-accelerated trace phase is problematic.","author":["Daniel Meister","Jakub Boksansky","Michael Guthe","Jiri Bittner"],"issue":["I3D '20: Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games","May 2020","Article No.: 13","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/3384382.3384534"],"date":"05 May 2020","ref":[{"text":"Timo Aila and Tero Karras. 2010.

These systems are, however, susceptible to various presentation attacks, including printed faces, artificial masks, and makeup attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to address makeup attacks, which are the hardest to detect in such systems because makeup can substantially alter the facial features of a person, including making them appear older/younger by adding/hiding wrinkles, modifying the shape of eyebrows, beard, and moustache, and changing the color of lips and cheeks. In our solution, we design a generative adversarial network for removing the makeup from face images while retaining their essential facial features and then compare the face images before and after removing makeup. We collect a large dataset of various types of makeup, especially malicious makeup that can be used to break into remote unattended security systems. This dataset is quite different from existing makeup datasets that mostly focus on cosmetic aspects. We conduct an extensive experimental study to evaluate our method and compare it against the state-of-the art using standard objective metrics commonly used in biometric systems as well as subjective metrics collected through a user study. Our results show that the proposed solution produces high accuracy and substantially outperforms the closest works in the literature.","author":["Mohammad Amin Arab","Puria Azadi Moghadam","Mohamed Hussein","Wael Abd-Almageed","Mohamed Hefeeda"],"issue":["MM '20: Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Multimedia","October 2020","Pages   3568\u20133576","https://doi.org/10.1145/3394171.3413606"],"date":"12 October 2020","ref":[{"text":"T.

ReRAM crossbar, as a promising candidate, is widely employed to accelerate neural network owing to its nature of processing MVM. However, ReRAM crossbar suffers high conductance variation due to many non-ideal effects, resulting in great inference accuracy degradation. Recent works use uniform quantization to enhance the tolerance of conductance variation, but these methods still suffer high accuracy loss with large variation. In this paper, firstly, we analyze the impact of the quantization and conductance variation on the accuracy. Then, based on two observation, we propose a quantized training framework to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the neural network running on the accelerator, by introducing a smart non-uniform quantizer. This framework consists of a robust trainable quantizer and a corresponding training method, and needs no extra hardware overhead and compatible with a standard neural network training procedure. Experimental results show that our proposed method can improve inference accuracy by 10% ~ 30% under large variation, compared with uniform quantization method.","author":["Chenguang Zhang","Pingqiang Zhou"],"issue":["ASPDAC '21: Proceedings of the 26th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2021","Pages   43\u201348","https://doi.org/10.1145/3394885.3431528"],"date":"18 January 2021","ref":[{"text":"H..

Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) have shown their superior ability in learning representations for graph structured data, which leads to performance improvements in many graph related tasks such as link prediction, node classification and graph classification. Most of the existing graph neural networks models are designed for static graphs while many real-world graphs are inherently dynamic with new nodes and edges constantly emerging. Existing graph neural network models cannot utilize the dynamic information, which has been shown to enhance the performance of many graph analytic tasks such as community detection. Hence, in this paper, we propose DyGNN, a Dynamic Graph Neural Network model, which can model the dynamic information as the graph evolving. In particular, the proposed framework keeps updating node information by capturing the sequential information of edges (interactions), the time intervals between edges and information propagation coherently. Experimental results on various dynamic graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","author":["Yao Ma","Ziyi Guo","Zhaocun Ren","Jiliang Tang","Dawei Yin"],"issue":["SIGIR '20: Proceedings of the 43rd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","July 2020","Pages   719\u2013728","https://doi.org/10.1145/3397271.3401092"],"date":"25 July 2020","ref":[{"text":"Peter Battaglia, Razvan Pascanu, Matthew Lai, Danilo Jimenez Rezende, et al. 2016.

To solve this problem, non-volatile memory (NVM) is proposed as the alternative to build non-volatile FPGAs (NVFPGAs). Even though the feasibility of NVFPGA has been confirmed, the utilization of multiple level cells (MLCs) has not been fully exploited yet. In this article, we study architecture of MLC-based NVFPGAs, and propose five cluster structures. To give detailed comparisons and extensive discussions, we conduct experiments for area, performance and leakage power evaluation. Based on explorations of the characteristics of MLC-based NVFPGAs, we further present MLC-aware timing-driven packing method to improve delay. In critical paths, our proposed method reduces the overhead of the additional delay in slow MLC cells. Experiments show that, compared to SRAM-based FPGAs, the proposed architecture with the proposed CAD flow can reduce the area, critical path delay and leakage power by 31%, 10%, and 95%, respectively.","author":["Ke Liu","Mengying Zhao","Lei Ju","Zhiping Jia","Jingtong Hu","Chun Jason Xue"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 19","Issue 4","July 2020","Article No.: 27","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/3400885"],"date":"12 July 2020","ref":[{"text":"Vaughn Betz and Jonathan Rose. 1997.

By carefully scheduling the repair of failed data in small-size units across storage nodes in a pipelined manner, repair pipelining reduces the single-block repair time to approximately the same as the normal read time for a single block in homogeneous environments. We further design different extensions of repair pipelining algorithms for heterogeneous environments and multi-block repair operations. We implement a repair pipelining prototype, called ECPipe, and integrate it as a middleware system into two versions of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) (namely, HDFS-RAID and HDFS-3) as well as Quantcast File System. Experiments on a local testbed and Amazon EC2 show that repair pipelining significantly improves the performance of degraded reads and full-node recovery over existing repair techniques.","author":["Xiaolu Li","Zuoru Yang","Jinhong Li","Runhui Li","Patrick P.

However, very few works have studied the impact of combining various obfuscation techniques on the obscurity (difficulty of reverse engineering) and performance (execution time) of obfuscated programs. In this article, we propose a Genetic Algorithm\u00a0(GA)-based framework that not only optimizes obscurity and performance of obfuscated cryptographic programs, but it also ensures very low timing side-channel leakage. Our proposed Timing Side Channel Sensitive Program Obfuscation Optimization Framework (TSC-SPOOF) determines the combination of obfuscation transformation functions that produce optimized obfuscated programs with preferred optimization parameters. In particular, TSC-SPOOF employs normalized compression distance (NCD) and channel capacity to measure obscurity and timing side-channel leakage, respectively. We also use RISC-V rocket core running on a Xilinx Zynq FPGA device as part of our framework to obtain realistic results. The experimental results clearly show that our proposed solution leads to cryptographic programs with lower execution time, higher obscurity, and lower timing side-channel leakage than unguided obfuscation.","author":["Arnab Kumar Biswas"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 18","Issue 2","March 2021","Article No.: 20","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/3443707"],"date":"09 February 2021","ref":[{"text":"Stunix C/C++ Obfuscator. 2020.

The biggest advantage of the systolic array architecture is its simple and efficient design principle. Without complicated control and dataflow, hardware accelerators with the systolic array can calculate traditional convolution very efficiently. However, this advantage also brings new challenges to the systolic array. When computing special types of convolution, such as the small-scale convolution or depthwise convolution, the processing element (PE) utilization rate of the array decreases sharply. The main reason is that the simple architecture design limits the flexibility of the systolic array.In this article, we design a configurable multi-directional systolic array (CMSA) to address these issues. First, we added a data path to the systolic array. It allows users to split the systolic array through configuration to speed up the calculation of small-scale convolution. Second, we redesigned the PE unit so that the array has multiple data transmission modes and dataflow strategies. This allows users to switch the dataflow of the PE array to speed up the calculation of depthwise convolution. In addition, unlike other works, we only make a few changes and modifications to the existing systolic array architecture. It avoids additional hardware overheads and can be easily deployed in application scenarios that require small systolic arrays such as mobile terminals. Based on our evaluation, CMSA can increase the PE utilization rate by up to 1.6 times compared to the typical systolic array when running the last layers of ResNet-18. When running depthwise convolution in MobileNet, CMSA can increase the utilization rate by up to 14.8 times. At the same time, CMSA and the traditional systolic arrays are similar in area and energy consumption.","author":["Rui Xu","Sheng Ma","Yaohua Wang","Xinhai Chen","Yang Guo"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 18","Issue 4","December 2021","Article No.: 42","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/3460776"],"date":"16 July 2021","ref":[{"text":"Tianshi Chen, Zidong Du, Ninghui Sun, Jia Wang, Chengyong Wu, Yunji Chen, and Olivier Temam. 2014.

They manifest various deficiencies in particular for multikey access to highly dynamic files. We study the dynamic aspects of file structures that treat all keys symmetrically, that is, file structures which avoid the distinction between primary and secondary keys. We start from a bitmap approach and treat the problem of file design as one of data compression of a large sparse matrix. This leads to the notions of a grid partition of the search space and of a grid directory, which are the keys to a dynamic file structure called the grid file. This file system adapts gracefully to its contents under insertions and deletions, and thus achieves an upper bound of two disk accesses for single record retrieval; it also handles range queries and partially specified queries efficiently. We discuss in detail the design decisions that led to the grid file, present simulation results of its behavior, and compare it to other multikey access file structures.","author":["J.

Essential objectives sought are improved ease and economy in model generation, economy in execution time and space, and a facility for handling simultaneous activities. The main results obtained are a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioral model description, a reduction of manual tasks in converting Boolean logic into a structural model, the elimination of manual processes in achieving exclusive simulation of activity, an event-scheduling technique which does not deteriorate in economy as the event queue grows in length, and a simulation procedure which deals effectively with any mixture of serial and simultaneous activities. The passage of time is simulated in a precise, quantitative fashion, and systems to be simulated may be combinations of synchronous and asynchronous logic. Certain aspects of the techniques described may be used for the simulation of network structures other than digital networks.","author":["Ernst G.

When text which the program has not seen before is input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large memory. This memory is a \u201csemantic network\u201d representing factual assertions about the world.The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text, adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text. By this means, the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory. In this form it can be added into the memory.Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory's prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed. TLC presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for expressing either of these are provided. Thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language, and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind.The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically. That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future. Thus the addition of a single factual assertion or linguistic capability will often provide a large increment in TLC's effective knowledge of the world and in its overall ability to comprehend text.The program's strategy is presented as a general theory of","author":["M.

Office information systems provide a particularly appropriate context for this type of information sharing and exchange. A federated database architecture is described in which a collection of independent database systems are united into a loosely coupled federation in order to share and exchange information. A federation consists of components (of which there may be any number) and a single federal dictionary. The components represent individual users, applications, workstations, or other components in an office information system. The federal dictionary is a specialized component that maintains the topology of the federation and oversees the entry of new components. Each component in the federation controls its interactions with other components by means of an export schema and an import schema. The export schema specifies the information that a component will share with other components, while the import schema specifies the nonlocal information that a component wishes to manipulate. The federated architecture provides mechanisms for sharing data, for sharing transactions (via message types) for combining information from several components, and for coordinating activities among autonomous components (via negotiation). A prototype implementation of the federated database mechanism is currently operational on an experimental basis.","author":["Dennis Heimbigner","Dennis McLeod"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 3","Issue 3","July 1985","pp   253\u2013278","https://doi.org/10.1145/4229.4233"],"date":"01 July 1985","ref":[{"text":"ARITEBOUL, S., AND HULL, R.

Traditional cache architectures assume that each level in the cache hierarchy has a single, uniform access time. Increases in on-chip communication delays will make the hit time of large on-chip caches a function of a line's physical location within the cache. Consequently, cache access times will become a continuum of latencies rather than a single discrete latency. This non-uniformity can be exploited to provide faster access to cache lines in the portions of the cache that reside closer to the processor. In this paper, we evaluate a series of cache designs that provides fast hits to multi-megabyte cache memories. We first propose physical designs for these Non-Uniform Cache Architectures (NUCAs). We extend these physical designs with logical policies that allow important data to migrate toward the processor within the same level of the cache. We show that, for multi-megabyte level-two caches, an adaptive, dynamic NUCA design achieves 1.5 times the IPC of a Uniform Cache Architecture of any size, outperforms the best static NUCA scheme by 11%, outperforms the best three-level hierarchy--while using less silicon area--by 13%, and comes within 13% of an ideal minimal hit latency solution.","author":["Changkyu Kim","Doug Burger","Stephen W.

Besides their high density, fine granularity, and massive parallelism, FPGAs provide the opportunity for run-time customization of the hardware based on the given SAT instance. In this article, a parallel deduction engine is proposed for backtrack search algorithms. The performance of the deduction engine is critical to the overall performance of the algorithm because, for any moderate SAT instance, millions of implications are derived. We propose a novel approach in which p, the amount of parallelization of the engine, is fine-tuned during problem solving in order to optimize performance. Not only the hardware is initially customized based on the input instance, but it is also dynamically modified in terms of p based on the knowledge gained during solving the SAT instance. Compared with conventional deduction engines that correspond to p = 1, we demonstrate speedups in the range of 2.87 to 5.44 for several SAT instances.","author":["Andreas Dandalis","Viktor K.

Depending on the retrieval\nstrategy, link information can be local or global. Local link\ninformation is derived from the set of documents returned as\nanswers to the current user query. Global link information is\nderived from all the documents in the collection. In this work, we\ninvestigate how the use of local link information compares to the\nuse of global link information. For the comparison, we run a series\nof experiments using a large document collection extracted from the\nWeb. For our reference collection, the results indicate that the\nuse of local link information improves precision by 74&percnt;.\nWhen global link information is used, precision improves by\n35&percnt;. However, when only the first 10 documents in the\nranking are considered, the average gain in precision obtained with\nthe use of global link information is higher than the gain obtained\nwith the use of local link information. This is an interesting\nresult since it provides insight and justification for the use of\nglobal link information in major Web search engines, where users\nare mostly interested in the first 10 answers. Furthermore, global\ninformation can be computed in the background, which allows\nspeeding up query processing.","author":["P\u00e1vel Calado","Berthier Ribeiro-Neto","Nivio Ziviani","Edleno Moura","Ilm\u00e9rio Silva"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 21","Issue 1","January 2003","pp   42\u201363","https://doi.org/10.1145/635484.635486"],"date":"01 January 2003","ref":[{"text":"Anderson, T.

Intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. While previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. This makes them difficult and expensive to apply. The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. Such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. Taking a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. From a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework. Furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. The theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. It shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming Google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples.","author":["Thorsten Joachims"],"issue":["KDD '02: Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","July 2002","Pages   133\u2013142","https://doi.org/10.1145/775047.775067"],"date":"23 July 2002","ref":[{"text":"R.

Among various design implementation schemes, standard cell ASICs offer the best power efficiency for high-performance applications. The flexibility of ASICs allow for the use of multiple voltages and multiple thresholds to match the performance of critical regions to their timing constraints, and minimize the power everywhere else. We explore the trade-off between multiple supply voltages and multiple threshold voltages in the optimization of dynamic and static power. The use of multiple supply voltages presents some unique physical and electrical challenges. Level shifters need to be introduced between the various voltage regions. Several level shifter implementations will be shown. The physical layout needs to be designed to ensure the efficient delivery of the correct voltage to various voltage regions. More flexibility can be gained by using appropriate level shifters. We will discuss optimization techniques such as clock skew scheduling which can be effectively used to push performance in a power neutral way.","author":["Ruchir Puri","Leon Stok","John Cohn","David Kung","David Pan","Dennis Sylvester","Ashish Srivastava","Sarvesh Kulkarni"],"issue":["DAC '03: Proceedings of the 40th annual Design Automation Conference","June 2003","Pages   788\u2013793","https://doi.org/10.1145/775832.776032"],"date":"02 June 2003","ref":[{"text":"K.

By expressing the total static power consumption and the total input-referred noise of the converter as functions of the capacitor values and the resolutions of the converter stages, a simple optimization algorithm is employed to calculate the optimum values of these parameters, which lead to minimum power consumption while a specified noise requirement is satisfied. To determine the bias current values of operational amplifiers, a novel optimal choice for settling and slewing time parameters is proposed applicable to both single-stage and two-stage Miller-compensated opamp structures. Using the proposed methodology, the optimum values for capacitors, the resolutions and the opamp device sizes of all stages are determined in order to minimize the total power consumption. Design examples are presented and compared with conventional approaches to show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.","author":["Reza Lotfi","Mohammad Taherzadeh-Sani","M.

However, there is a challenge of effectively controlling access to the transmitted data. IP multicast by itself does not provide any mechanisms for preventing nongroup members to have access to the group communication. Although encryption can be used to protect messages exchanged among group members, distributing the cryptographic keys becomes an issue. Researchers have proposed several different approaches to group key management. These approaches can be divided into three main classes: centralized group key management protocols, decentralized architectures and distributed key management protocols. The three classes are described here and an insight given to their features and goals. The area of group key management is then surveyed and proposed solutions are classified according to those characteristics.","author":["Sandro Rafaeli","David Hutchison"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 35","Issue 3","September 2003","pp   309\u2013329","https://doi.org/10.1145/937503.937506"],"date":"01 September 2003","ref":[{"text":"Ballardie, A. 1996.

Since Sesame recognizes separate application and architecture models within a single system simulation, it needs an explicit mapping step to relate these models for co-simulation. So far in Sesame, the mapping decision has been assumed to be made by an experienced designer, intuitively. However, this assumption is increasingly becoming inappropriate for the following reasons: already the realistic systems are far too complex for making intuitive decisions at an early design stage where the design space is very large. Likely, these systems will even get more complex in the near future. Besides, there exist multiple criteria to consider, like processing times, power consumption and cost of the architecture, which make the decision problem even harder.In this paper, the mapping decision problem is formulated as a multiobjective combinatorial optimization problem. For a solution approach, an optimization software tool, implementing an evolutionary algorithm from the literature, has been developed to achieve a set of best alternative mapping decisions under multiple criteria. In a case study, we have used our optimization tool to obtain a set of mapping decisions, some of which were further evaluated by the Sesame simulation framework.","author":["Cagkan Erbas","Selin C.

They are not so realistic, however, that they would fool many people into believing they are real. One problem is that the surfaces tend to look artificial due to their extreme smoothness. What is needed is a means of simulating the surface irregularities that are on real surfaces. In 1973 Ed Catmull introduced the idea of using the parameter values of parametrically defined surfaces to index into a texture definition function which scales the intensity of the reflected light. By tying the texture pattern to the parameter values, the texture is guaranteed to rotate and move with the object. This is good for showing patterns painted on the surface, but attempts to simulate rough surfaces in this way are unconvincing. This paper presents a method of using a texturing function to perform a small perturbation on the direction of the surface normal before using it in the intensity calculations. This process yields images with realistic looking surface wrinkles without the need to model each wrinkle as a separate surface element. Several samples of images made with this technique are included.","author":["James F.

Our hash-based implementation achieves more than 100M tuples per second which is 17X faster than the best reported performance on CPUs and 8X faster than that reported for GPUs. Moreover, the performance of our hash join implementation is consistent over a wide range of input data sizes from 64K to 128M tuples and is not affected by data skew. We compare this implementation to our highly optimized sort-based implementation that achieves 47M to 80M tuples per second. We developed analytical models to study how both algorithms would scale with upcoming processor architecture trends. Our analysis projects that current architectural trends of wider SIMD, more cores, and smaller memory bandwidth per core imply better scalability potential for sort-merge join. Consequently, sort-merge join is likely to outperform hash join on upcoming chip multiprocessors. In summary, we offer multicore implementations of hash join and sort-merge join which consistently outperform all previously reported results. We further conclude that the tide that favors the hash join algorithm has not changed yet, but the change is just around the corner.","author":["Changkyu Kim","Tim Kaldewey","Victor W.

Existing solutions, however, differ in the degree of consistency they provide. Our experience using such systems indicates that there is a non-trivial trade-off between cost, consistency and availability. High consistency implies high cost per transaction and, in some situations, reduced availability. Low consistency is cheaper but it might result in higher operational cost because of, e.g., overselling of products in a Web shop.In this paper, we present a new transaction paradigm, that not only allows designers to define the consistency guarantees on the data instead at the transaction level, but also allows to automatically switch consistency guarantees at runtime. We present a number of techniques that let the system dynamically adapt the consistency level by monitoring the data and/or gathering temporal statistics of the data. We demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the ideas through extensive experiments on a first prototype implemented on Amazon's S3 and running the TPC-W benchmark. Our experiments indicate that the adaptive strategies presented in the paper result in a significant reduction in response time and costs including the cost penalties of inconsistencies.","author":["Tim Kraska","Martin Hentschel","Gustavo Alonso","Donald Kossmann"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 2","Issue 1","August 2009","pp   253\u2013264","https://doi.org/10.14778/1687627.1687657"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"28msec, Inc.

Recently, erasure codes have been used to reduce the large storage overhead of three-replicated systems. Reed-Solomon codes are the standard design choice and their high repair cost is often considered an unavoidable price to pay for high storage efficiency and high reliability.This paper shows how to overcome this limitation. We present a novel family of erasure codes that are efficiently repairable and offer higher reliability compared to Reed-Solomon codes. We show analytically that our codes are optimal on a recently identified tradeoff between locality and minimum distance.We implement our new codes in Hadoop HDFS and compare to a currently deployed HDFS module that uses Reed-Solomon codes. Our modified HDFS implementation shows a reduction of approximately 2\u00d7 on the repair disk I/O and repair network traffic. The disadvantage of the new coding scheme is that it requires 14% more storage compared to Reed-Solomon codes, an overhead shown to be information theoretically optimal to obtain locality. Because the new codes repair failures faster, this provides higher reliability, which is orders of magnitude higher compared to replication.","author":["Maheswaran Sathiamoorthy","Megasthenis Asteris","Dimitris Papailiopoulos","Alexandros G.

ER is the problem of clustering records that refer to the same real-world entity and can be an extremely difficult process for computer algorithms alone. For example, figuring out which images refer to the same person can be a hard task for computers, but an easy one for humans. We study the problem of resolving records with crowdsourcing where we ask questions to humans in order to guide ER into producing accurate results. Since human work is costly, our goal is to ask as few questions as possible. We propose a probabilistic framework for ER that can be used to estimate how much ER accuracy we obtain by asking each question and select the best question with the highest expected accuracy. Computing the expected accuracy is #P-hard, so we propose approximation techniques for efficient computation. We evaluate our best question algorithms on real and synthetic datasets and demonstrate how we can obtain high ER accuracy while significantly reducing the number of questions asked to humans.","author":["Steven Euijong Whang","Peter Lofgren","Hector Garcia-Molina"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 6","April 2013","pp   349\u2013360","https://doi.org/10.14778/2536336.2536337"],"date":"01 April 2013","ref":[{"text":"Amazon mechanical turk. https://www.mturk.com.","order":1},{"text":"A.

Our approach carefully chooses a set of queries to evaluate, and then exploits consistency constraints that should hold over the noisy output. In a post-processing phase, we compute the consistent input most likely to have produced the noisy output. The final output is differentially-private and consistent, but in addition, it is often much more accurate. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these techniques can be used for estimating the degree sequence of a graph very precisely, and for computing a histogram that can support arbitrary range queries accurately.","author":["Michael Hay","Vibhor Rastogi","Gerome Miklau","Dan Suciu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   1021\u20131032","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920970"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"B.

Within our framework, we carry out a large number of experiments to understand better and explain why phrase-based models out-perform word-based models. Our empirical results, which hold for all examined language pairs, suggest that the highest levels of performance can be obtained through relatively simple means: heuristic learning of phrase translations from word-based alignments and lexical weighting of phrase translations. Surprisingly, learning phrases longer than three words and learning phrases from high-accuracy word-level alignment models does not have a strong impact on performance. Learning only syntactically motivated phrases degrades the performance of our systems.","author":["Philipp Koehn","Franz Josef Och","Daniel Marcu"],"issue":["NAACL '03: Proceedings of the 2003 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Human Language Technology - Volume 1","May 2003","Pages   48\u201354","https://doi.org/10.3115/1073445.1073462"],"date":"27 May 2003","ref":[{"text":"Brown, P.

This work describes our next step to improve the usability of speech recognizers\u2014the use of vocabulary-independent (VI) models. If successful, VI models are trained once and for all. They will completely eliminate task-specific training, and will enable rapid configuration of speech recognizers for new vocabularies. Our initial results using generalized triphones as VI models show that with more training data and more detailed modeling, the error rate of VI models can be reduced substantially. For example, the error rates for VI models with 5,000, 10,000 and 15,000 training sentences are 23.9%, 15.2% and 13.3% respectively. Moreover, if task-specific training data were available, we can interpolate them with VI models. Our prelimenary results show that this interpolation can lead to an 18% error rate reduction over task-specific models.","author":["Hsiao-Wuen Hon","Kai-Fu Lee","Robert Weide"],"issue":["HLT '89: Proceedings of the workshop on Speech and Natural Language","October 1989","Pages   271\u2013275","https://doi.org/10.3115/1075434.1075479"],"date":"15 October 1989","ref":[{"text":"Lee, K.

The whole problem is decomposed in two levels, with two chained decisions per level. The first level corresponds to parts 1 and 2 presented in the introductory document for the task. The second level corresponds to the part 3, which we decompose in two decisions and a combination procedure.","author":["Xavier Carreras","Llu\u00eds M\u00e0rquez"],"issue":["ConLL '01: Proceedings of the 2001 workshop on Computational Natural Language Learning - Volume 7","July 2001","Article No.: 26","Pages   1\u20133","https://doi.org/10.3115/1117822.1117839"],"date":"06 July 2001","ref":[{"text":"X.

Morphological structures of compound words contain the essential information of knowing their syntactic and semantic characteristics. In particular, morphological analysis is a primary step for predicting the syntactic and semantic categories of out-of-vocabulary (unknown) words. The designed Chinese morphological analyzer contains three major functions, 1) to segment a word into a sequence of morphemes, 2) to tag the part-of-speech of those morphemes, and 3) to identify the morpho-syntactic relation between morphemes. We propose a method of using associative strength among morphemes, morpho-syntactic patterns, and syntactic categories to solve the ambiguities of segmentation and part-of-speech. In our evaluation report, it is found that the accuracy of our analyzer is 81%. 5% errors are caused by the segmentation and 14% errors are due to part-of-speech. Once the internal information of a compound is known, it would be beneficial for the further researches of the prediction of a word meaning and its function.","author":["Huihsin Tseng","Keh-Jiann Chen"],"issue":["SIGHAN '02: Proceedings of the first SIGHAN workshop on Chinese language processing - Volume 18","September 2002","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.3115/1118824.1118835"],"date":"01 September 2002","ref":[{"text":"Bosch, Antal van den, Walter Daelemans and Ton Weijters.

The benefits of NLP componentware and barriers to reuse are outlined, and the dichotomies \"system versus experiment\" and \"toolkit versus framework\" are discussed.It is argued that in order to live up to its name language engineering must not neglect component quality and architectural evaluation when reporting new NLP research.","author":["Jochen L.

The main linguistic knowledge sources used by the system are a word syntax and a morph dictionary. The syntax is written in the formalism of right linear regular grammars and comprises approximately 1, 400 rules describing the set of those sequences of morph classes which underlie syntactically well formed words. The morph dictionary contains almost 11, 000 morphs. Each morph is assigned to up to 6 morph classes. - Statistical evaluations with 6000 text words showed that more than 99% of the segmented words got a correct segmentation.","author":["T.

The automatic construction of VLNNs enables real-size experiments with neural networks for natural language processing, which in turn provides insight into their behaviour and design and can lead to possible improvements.","author":["Jean Veronis","Nancy M.

It demonstrates how the existing ideas, methods, and resources of ontological semantics can be applied to detect deception in NL text (and, eventually, in data and other media as well). After stating the problem, the paper proceeds to a brief introduction to ONSE, followed by an equally brief survey of our 5-year-old effort in \"colonizing\" IAS. The main part of the paper deals with the following issues: \u2022 human deception detection abilities and NLP modeling of it; \u2022 manipulation of fact repositories for this purpose beyond the current state of the art; \u2022 acquisition of scripts for complex ontological concepts; \u2022 degrees of lying complexity and feasibility of their automatic detection. This is not a report on a system implementation but rather an application-establishing proof-of-concept effort based on the algorithmic and machine-tractable recombination and extension of the previously implemented ONSE modules. The strength of the approach is that it emphasizes the use of the existing NLP applications, with very few domain- and goal-specific adjustments, in a most promising and growing new area of IAS. So, while clearly dealing with a new application, the paper addresses theoretical and methodological extensions of ONSE, as defined currently, that will be useful for other applications as well.","author":["Victor Raskin","Christian F.
