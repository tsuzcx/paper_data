Dynamic information flow tracking protects programs against malicious software attacks by identifying spurious information flows from untrusted I/O and restricting the usage of the spurious information.Every security attack to take control of a program needs to transfer the program's control to malevolent code. In our approach, the operating system identifies a set of input channels as spurious, and the processor tracks all information flows from those inputs. A broad range of attacks are effectively defeated by checking the use of the spurious values as instructions and pointers.Our protection is transparent to users or application programmers; the executables can be used without any modification. Also, our scheme only incurs, on average, a memory overhead of 1.4% and a performance overhead of 1.1%.","author":["G. Edward Suh","Jae W.

We demonstrated experimentally, in a previous study, the usefulness of a categorization algorithm and filtering interface. However, the nature of interaction in real settings is not known from an experiment in laboratory settings. To address this problem, we provided our categorizing web search user interface to 16 users for a two month period. The interactions with the system were logged and the users' opinions were elicited with two questionnaires. The results show that categories are successfully used as part of users' search habits. They are helpful when the result ranking of the search engine fails. In those cases, the users are able to access results that locate far in the rank order list with the categories. Users can also formulate simpler queries and find needed results with the help of the categories. In addition, the categories are beneficial when more than one result is needed like in an exploratory or undirected search task.","author":["Mika K\u00e4ki"],"issue":["CHI '05: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","April 2005","Pages   131\u2013140","https://doi.org/10.1145/1054972.1054991"],"date":"02 April 2005","ref":[{"text":"Anick, P.: Using Terminological Feedback for Web Search Refinement - A Log-based Study.

The hierarchy offers a complementary view to the flat-ranked list of results returned by current search engines. Users can navigate through the hierarchy driven by their search needs. This is especially useful for informative, polysemous and poor queries.SnakeT is the first complete and open-source system in the literature that offers both hierarchical clustering and folder labeling with variable-length sentences. We extensively test SnakeT against all available web-snippet clustering engines, and show that it achieves efficiency and efficacy performance close to the best known engine Vivisimo.com.Recently, personalized search engines have been introduced with the aim of improving search results by focusing on the users, rather than on their submitted queries. We show how to plug SnakeT on top of any (un-personalized) search engine in order to obtain a form of personalization that is fully adaptive, privacy preserving, scalable, and non intrusive for underlying search engines.","author":["Paolo Ferragina","Antonio Gulli"],"issue":["WWW '05: Special interest tracks and posters of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web","May 2005","Pages   801\u2013810","https://doi.org/10.1145/1062745.1062760"],"date":"10 May 2005","ref":[{"text":"http://labs.google.com/personalized.","order":1},{"text":"http://mysearch.yahoo.com/.","order":2},{"text":"G.

In this paper we present a study concerning resistive-open defects in the core-cell of SRAM memories. The first target of this work is a comparison of the effect produced by resistive-open defects in the 0.13 \u03bcm and 90 nm core-cell. We show that the 90 nm core-cell is more robust than the 0.13 \u03bcm core-cell in presence of resistive-open defects. On the other hand we show that dynamic faults are most likely to occur in the 90 nm than in 0.13 \u03bcm core-cell. Finally we propose a unique March test solution that ensures the complete coverage of all the extracted fault models for both technologies.","author":["L. Dilillo","P. Girard","S.

[1995]. SI is attractive because it provides an isolation level that avoids many of the common concurrency anomalies, and has been implemented by Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server (with certain minor variations). SI does not guarantee serializability in all cases, but the TPC-C benchmark application [TPC-C], for example, executes under SI without serialization anomalies. All major database system products are delivered with default nonserializable isolation levels, often ones that encounter serialization anomalies more commonly than SI, and we suspect that numerous isolation errors occur each day at many large sites because of this, leading to corrupt data sometimes noted in data warehouse applications. The classical justification for lower isolation levels is that applications can be run under such levels to improve efficiency when they can be shown not to result in serious errors, but little or no guidance has been offered to application programmers and DBAs by vendors as to how to avoid such errors. This article develops a theory that characterizes when nonserializable executions of applications can occur under SI. Near the end of the article, we apply this theory to demonstrate that the TPC-C benchmark application has no serialization anomalies under SI, and then discuss how this demonstration can be generalized to other applications. We also present a discussion on how to modify the program logic of applications that are nonserializable under SI so that serializability will be guaranteed.","author":["Alan Fekete","Dimitrios Liarokapis","Elizabeth O'Neil","Patrick O'Neil","Dennis Shasha"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Database Systems","Volume 30","Issue 2","June 2005","pp   492\u2013528","https://doi.org/10.1145/1071610.1071615"],"date":"01 June 2005","ref":[{"text":"Adya, A., Liskov, B., and O'Neil, P. 2000.

A hierarchical \"beam\" structure serves as a proxy for a collection of rays. It is tested against a kd-tree representing the overall scene in order to discard from consideration the sub-set of the kd-tree (and hence the scene) that is guaranteed not to intersect with any possible ray inside the beam. This allows for all the rays inside the beam to start traversing the tree from some node deep inside thus eliminating unnecessary operations. The original beam can be further sub-divided, and we can either continue looking for new optimal entry points for the sub-beams, or we can decompose the beam into individual rays. This is a hierarchical process that can be adapted to the geometrical complexity of a particular view direction allowing for efficient geometric anti-aliasing. By amortizing the cost of partially traversing the tree for all the rays in a beam, up to an order of magnitude performance improvement can be achieved enabling interactivity for complex scenes on ordinary desktop machines.","author":["Alexander Reshetov","Alexei Soupikov","Jim Hurley"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 24","Issue 3","July 2005","pp   1176\u20131185","https://doi.org/10.1145/1073204.1073329"],"date":"01 July 2005","ref":[{"text":"Amanatides, J. 1984.

The first method, called Linear Method, combines the standard consistent hasing introduced by Karger et al. [9] with a linear weighted distance measure. By using node copies and different partitions of the hash space, the balance of this scheme approximates the fair weight relationship with high probability. The second method, called the Logarithmic Method, uses a logarithmic weighted distance between the peers and the data to find the corresponding node. For distributing one data element it provides perfect weighted balance. To provide this distribution for many data elements we use partitions to achieve a fair balance with high probability. These methods provide small fragmentation, which means that the hash space is divided into at most O (n log n) intervals. Furthermore, there is an efficient data structure that assigns data elements to the nodes in expected time O (log n). If small fragmentation is not an issue one can replace the use of partitions by a method we call double hash functions. This method needs O (n) for assigning elements to a node, yet it can be directly used for Storage Area Networks, where the number of nodes is small compared to participating nodes in Peer-to-Peer networks.","author":["Christian Schindelhauer","Gunnar Schomaker"],"issue":["SPAA '05: Proceedings of the seventeenth annual ACM symposium on Parallelism in algorithms and architectures","July 2005","Pages   218\u2013227","https://doi.org/10.1145/1073970.1074008"],"date":"18 July 2005","ref":[{"text":"P.

A fundamental problem in dyadic data analysis is to find the hidden block structure of the data matrix. In this paper, we present a new co-clustering framework, block value decomposition(BVD), for dyadic data, which factorizes the dyadic data matrix into three components, the row-coefficient matrix R, the block value matrix B, and the column-coefficient matrix C. Under this framework, we focus on a special yet very popular case -- non-negative dyadic data, and propose a specific novel co-clustering algorithm that iteratively computes the three decomposition matrices based on the multiplicative updating rules. Extensive experimental evaluations also demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of this framework as well as the specific algorithms for co-clustering, and in particular, for discovering the hidden block structure in the dyadic data.","author":["Bo Long","Zhongfei (Mark) Zhang","Philip S.

With the trend to develop multi-threaded, multi-core processors, the demands on the memory system will continue to scale. However, determining the optimal memory system configuration is non-trivial. The memory system performance is sensitive to a large number of parameters. Each of these parameters take on a number of values and interact in fashions that make overall trends difficult to discern. A comparison of the memory system architectures becomes even harder when we add the dimensions of power consumption and manufacturing cost. Unfortunately, there is a lack of tools in the public-domain that support such studies. Therefore, we introduce DRAMsim, a detailed and highly-configurable C-based memory system simulator to fill this gap. DRAMsim implements detailed timing models for a variety of existing memories, including SDRAM, DDR, DDR2, DRDRAM and FB-DIMM, with the capability to easily vary their parameters. It also models the power consumption of SDRAM and its derivatives. It can be used as a standalone simulator or as part of a more comprehensive system-level model. We have successfully integrated DRAMsim into a variety of simulators including MASE [15], Sim-alpha [14], BOCHS[2] and GEMS[13].

Microfluidics-based biochips are therefore gaining popularity for clinical diagnostics and other laboratory procedures involving molecular biology. As more bioassays are executed concurrently on a biochip, system integration and design complexity are expected to increase dramatically. This paper presents different actuation mechanisms for microfluidics-based biochips, as well as associated design automation trends and challenges. The underlying physical principles of eletrokinetics, electrohydrodynamics, and thermo-capillarity are discussed. Next, the paper presents an overview of an integrated system-level design methodology that attempts to address key issues in the modeling, simulation, synthesis, testing and reconfiguration of digital microfluidics-based biochips. The top-down design automation will facilitate the integration of fluidic components with microelectronic component in next-generation system-on-chip designs.","author":["Krishnendu Chakrabarty","Jun Zeng"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 1","Issue 3","October 2005","pp   186\u2013223","https://doi.org/10.1145/1116696.1116698"],"date":"01 October 2005","ref":[{"text":"Adamson, A.

Our algorithm uses the data parallelism within a GPU along with task parallelism by scheduling some of the memory-intensive and compute-intensive threads on the GPU. Our new sorting architecture provides multiple memory interfaces on the same PC -- a fast and dedicated memory interface on the GPU along with the main memory interface for CPU computations. As a result, we achieve higher memory bandwidth as compared to CPU-based algorithms running on commodity PCs. Our approach takes into account the limited communication bandwidth between the CPU and the GPU, and reduces the data communication between the two processors. Our algorithm also improves the performance of disk transfers and achieves close to peak I/O performance. We have tested the performance of our algorithm on the SortBenchmark and applied it to large databases composed of a few hundred Gigabytes of data. Our results on a 3 GHz Pentium IV PC with $300 NVIDIA 7800 GT GPU indicate a significant performance improvement over optimized CPU-based algorithms on high-end PCs with 3.6 GHz Dual Xeon processors. Our implementation is able to outperform the current high-end PennySort benchmark and results in a higher performance to price ratio. Overall, our results indicate that using a GPU as a co-processor can significantly improve the performance of sorting algorithms on large databases.","author":["Naga Govindaraju","Jim Gray","Ritesh Kumar","Dinesh Manocha"],"issue":["SIGMOD '06: Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data","June 2006","Pages   325\u2013336","https://doi.org/10.1145/1142473.1142511"],"date":"27 June 2006","ref":[{"text":"Clearspeed technology.

However, the research on general multi-type relational data clustering is still limited and preliminary. The contribution of the paper is three-fold. First, we propose a general model, the collective factorization on related matrices, for multi-type relational data clustering. The model is applicable to relational data with various structures. Second, under this model, we derive a novel algorithm, the spectral relational clustering, to cluster multi-type interrelated data objects simultaneously. The algorithm iteratively embeds each type of data objects into low dimensional spaces and benefits from the interactions among the hidden structures of different types of data objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the promise and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Third, we show that the existing spectral clustering algorithms can be considered as the special cases of the proposed model and algorithm. This demonstrates the good theoretic generality of the proposed model and algorithm.","author":["Bo Long","Zhongfei (Mark) Zhang","Xiaoyun W\u00fa","Philip S.

These Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures are required to not only provide ultra-low latency, but also occupy a small footprint and consume as little energy as possible. Further, reliability is rapidly becoming a major challenge in deep sub-micron technologies due to the increased prominence of permanent faults resulting from accelerated aging effects and manufacturing/testing challenges. Towards the goal of designing low-latency, energy efficient and reliable on-chip communication networks, we propose a novel fine-grained modular router architecture. The proposed architecture employs decoupled parallel arbiters and uses smaller crossbars for row and column connections to reduce output port contention probabilities as compared to existing designs. Furthermore, the router employs a new switch allocation technique known as \"Mirroring Effect\" to reduce arbitration depth and increase concurrency. In addition, the modular design permits graceful degradation of the network in the event of permanent faults and also helps to reduce the dynamic power consumption. Our simulation results indicate that in an 8 \u00d7 8 mesh network, the proposed architecture reduces packet latency by 4-40% and power consumption by 6-20% as compared to two existing router architectures. Evaluation using a combined performance, energy and fault-tolerance metric indicates that the proposed architecture provides 35-50% overall improvement compared to the two earlier routers.","author":["Jongman Kim","Chrysostomos Nicopoulos","Dongkook Park","Vijaykrishnan Narayanan","Mazin S.

The model is formulated in a probabilistic maximum a posteriori framework. Morfessor can handle highly inflecting and compounding languages where words can consist of lengthy sequences of morphemes. A lexicon of word segments, called morphs, is induced from the data. The lexicon stores information about both the usage and form of the morphs. Several instances of the model are evaluated quantitatively in a morpheme segmentation task on different sized sets of Finnish as well as English data. Morfessor is shown to perform very well compared to a widely known benchmark algorithm, in particular on Finnish data.","author":["Mathias Creutz","Krista Lagus"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Speech and Language Processing","Volume 4","Issue 1","January 2007","Article No.: 3","pp   1\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/1187415.1187418"],"date":"02 February 2007","ref":[{"text":"Adda-Decker, M. 2003.

Learning methods are used in Dyna both for compiling planning results and for updating a model of the effects of the agent's actions on the world. Planning is incremental and can use the probabilistic and ofttimes incorrect world models generated by learning processes. Execution is fully reactive in the sense that no planning intervenes between perception and action. Dyna relies on machine learning methods for learning from examples---these are among the basic building blocks making up the architecture---yet is not tied to any particular method.

This paper describes a package for manipulating Boolean functions based on the reduced, ordered, binary decision diagram (ROBDD) representation. The package is based on an efficient implementation of the if-then-else (ITE) operator. A hash table is used to maintain a strong canonical form in the ROBDD, and memory use is improved by merging the hash table and the ROBDD into a hybrid data structure. A memory function for the recursive ITE algorithm is implemented using a hash-based cache to decrease memory use. Memory function efficiency is improved by using rules that detect when equivalent functions are computed. The usefulness of the package is enhanced by an automatic and low-cost scheme for recycling memory. Experimental results are given to demonstrate why various implementation trade-offs were made. These results indicate that the package described here is significantly faster and more memory-efficient than other ROBDD implementations described in the literature.","author":["Karl S.

The library uses advanced object-oriented and data encapsulation techniques to break finite element implementations into smaller blocks that can be arranged to fit users requirements. Through this approach, deal.II supports a large number of different applications covering a wide range of scientific areas, programming methodologies, and application-specific algorithms, without imposing a rigid framework into which they have to fit. A judicious use of programming techniques allows us to avoid the computational costs frequently associated with abstract object-oriented class libraries.The paper presents a detailed description of the abstractions chosen for defining geometric information of meshes and the handling of degrees of freedom associated with finite element spaces, as well as of linear algebra, input/output capabilities and of interfaces to other software, such as visualization tools. Finally, some results obtained with applications built atop deal.II are shown to demonstrate the powerful capabilities of this toolbox.","author":["W. Bangerth","R. Hartmann","G.

Because index structures require intensively fine-grained updates/modifications, block-oriented access over flash memory could introduce a significant number of redundant writes. This might not only severely degrade the overall performance, but also damage the reliability of flash memory. In this paper, we propose a very different approach, which can efficiently handle fine-grained updates/modifications caused by B-tree index access over flash memory. The implementation is done directly over the flash translation layer (FTL); hence, no modifications to existing application systems are needed. We demonstrate that when index structures are adopted over flash memory, the proposed methodology can significantly improve the system performance and, at the same time, reduce both the overhead of flash-memory management and the energy dissipation. The average response time of record insertions and deletions was also significantly reduced.","author":["Chin-Hsien Wu","Tei-Wei Kuo","Li Ping Chang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 6","Issue 3","July 2007","pp   19\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.1145/1275986.1275991"],"date":"01 July 2007","ref":[{"text":"Bayer, R. and McCreight, E.

Our pipeline implements a refined version of EWA splatting, a high quality method for antialiased rendering of point sampled representations. A central feature of our design is the seamless integration of the architecture into conventional, OpenGL-like graphics pipelines so as to complement triangle-based rendering. The specific properties of the EWA algorithm required a variety of novel design concepts including a ternary depth test and using an on-chip pipelined heap data structure for making the memory accesses of splat primitives more coherent. In addition, we developed a computationally stable evaluation scheme for perspectively corrected splats. We implemented our architecture both on reconfigurable FPGA boards and as an ASIC prototype, and we integrated it into an OpenGL-like software implementation. Our evaluation comprises a detailed performance analysis using scenes of varying complexity.","author":["Tim Weyrich","Simon Heinzle","Timo Aila","Daniel B.

Clustering search results is an effective way to organize search results, which allows a user to navigate into relevant documents quickly. However, two deficiencies of this approach make it not always work well: (1) the clusters discovered do not necessarily correspond to the interesting aspects of a topic from the user's perspective; and (2) the cluster labels generated are not informative enough to allow a user to identify the right cluster. In this paper, we propose to address these two deficiencies by (1) learning \"interesting aspects\" of a topic from Web search logs and organizing search results accordingly; and (2) generating more meaningful cluster labels using past query words entered by users. We evaluate our proposed method on a commercial search engine log data. Compared with the traditional methods of clustering search results, our method can give better result organization and more meaningful labels.","author":["Xuanhui Wang","ChengXiang Zhai"],"issue":["SIGIR '07: Proceedings of the 30th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval","July 2007","Pages   87\u201394","https://doi.org/10.1145/1277741.1277759"],"date":"23 July 2007","ref":[{"text":"E.

Reservations on throughput, the standard measure of disk performance, fail to effectively manage disk performance due to the orders of magnitude difference between best-, average-, and worst-case response times, allowing reservation of less than 0.01% of the achievable bandwidth. We show that by reserving disk resources in terms of utilization it is possible to create a disk scheduler that supports reservation of nearly 100% of the disk resources, provides arbitrarily hard or soft guarantees depending upon application needs, and yields efficiency as good or better than best-effort disk schedulers tuned for performance. We present the architecture of our scheduler, prove the correctness of its algorithms, and provide results demonstrating its effectiveness.","author":["Anna Povzner","Tim Kaldewey","Scott Brandt","Richard Golding","Theodore M.

This is for good reason: usability evaluation has a significant role to play when conditions warrant it. Yet evaluation can be ineffective and even harmful if naively done 'by rule' rather than 'by thought'. If done during early stage design, it can mute creative ideas that do not conform to current interface norms. If done to test radical innovations, the many interface issues that would likely arise from an immature technology can quash what could have been an inspired vision. If done to validate an academic prototype, it may incorrectly suggest a design's scientific worthiness rather than offer a meaningful critique of how it would be adopted and used in everyday practice. If done without regard to how cultures adopt technology over time, then today's reluctant reactions by users will forestall tomorrow's eager acceptance. The choice of evaluation methodology - if any - must arise from and be appropriate for the actual problem or research question under consideration.","author":["Saul Greenberg","Bill Buxton"],"issue":["CHI '08: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","April 2008","Pages   111\u2013120","https://doi.org/10.1145/1357054.1357074"],"date":"06 April 2008","ref":[{"text":"Barkhuus, L., Rode, J.

In order to ensure an efficient clinical workflow it is inevitable to meet high performance requirements. Hence, the usage of hardware acceleration is mandatory. The software architecture of the reconstruction system is required to be modular in a sense that different accelerator hardware platforms are supported and it must be possible to implement different parts of the algorithm using different acceleration architectures and techniques. This paper introduces and discusses the design of a software architecture for an image reconstruction system that meets the aforementioned requirements. We implemented a multi-threaded software framework that combines two software design patterns: the pipeline and the master/worker pattern. This enables us to take advantage of the parallelism in off-the-shelf accelerator hardware such as multi-core systems, the Cell processor, and graphics accelerators in a very flexible and reusable way.","author":["Holger Scherl","Stefan Hoppe","Markus Kowarschik","Joachim Hornegger"],"issue":["ICSE '08: Proceedings of the 30th international conference on Software engineering","May 2008","Pages   661\u2013668","https://doi.org/10.1145/1368088.1368181"],"date":"10 May 2008","ref":[{"text":"A.

ROCCC is an optimizing C to HDL compiler. We describe the code generation approach in ROCCC. The smart buffer is a component that reuses input data between adjacent iterations. It significantly improves the performance of the circuit and simplifies loop control. The ROCCC-generated datapath can execute one loop iteration per clock cycle when there is no loop dependency or there is only scalar recurrence variable dependency. ROCCC's approach to supporting while-loops operating on scalars makes the compiler able to move scalar iterative computation into hardware.","author":["Zhi Guo","Walid Najjar","Betul Buyukkurt"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 5","Issue 1","May 2008","Article No.: 6","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/1369396.1369402"],"date":"29 May 2008","ref":[{"text":"Aigner, G., Diwan, A., Heine, D.

Parallel database products, e.g., Teradata, offer a solution, but are usually prohibitively expensive at this scale. Besides, many of the people who analyze this data are entrenched procedural programmers, who find the declarative, SQL style to be unnatural. The success of the more procedural map-reduce programming model, and its associated scalable implementations on commodity hardware, is evidence of the above. However, the map-reduce paradigm is too low-level and rigid, and leads to a great deal of custom user code that is hard to maintain, and reuse. We describe a new language called Pig Latin that we have designed to fit in a sweet spot between the declarative style of SQL, and the low-level, procedural style of map-reduce. The accompanying system, Pig, is fully implemented, and compiles Pig Latin into physical plans that are executed over Hadoop, an open-source, map-reduce implementation. We give a few examples of how engineers at Yahoo! are using Pig to dramatically reduce the time required for the development and execution of their data analysis tasks, compared to using Hadoop directly. We also report on a novel debugging environment that comes integrated with Pig, that can lead to even higher productivity gains. Pig is an open-source, Apache-incubator project, and available for general use.","author":["Christopher Olston","Benjamin Reed","Utkarsh Srivastava","Ravi Kumar","Andrew Tomkins"],"issue":["SIGMOD '08: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data","June 2008","Pages   1099\u20131110","https://doi.org/10.1145/1376616.1376726"],"date":"09 June 2008","ref":[{"text":"G.

The total chip leakage is measured for multiple input vectors in a linear optimization framework where the unknowns are the gate leakage variations. We propose compressive sensing for fast extraction of the unknowns since the leakage tomogram contains correlations and can be sparsely represented. A key advantage of our approach is that it provides leakage variation estimates even for inaccessible gates. Experiments show that the methodology enables fast and accurate noninvasive extraction of leakage power characteristics.","author":["Davood Shamsi","Petros Boufounos","Farinaz Koushanfar"],"issue":["ISLPED '08: Proceedings of the 2008 international symposium on Low Power Electronics & Design","August 2008","Pages   341\u2013346","https://doi.org/10.1145/1393921.1394011"],"date":"11 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"R.

Applications achieve high performance using GRAMPS by expressing advanced rendering algorithms as custom pipelines, then using the pipeline as a rendering engine. We describe the design of GRAMPS, then evaluate it by implementing three pipelines, that is, Direct3D, a ray tracer, and a hybridization of the two, and running them on emulations of two different GRAMPS implementations: a traditional GPU-like architecture and a CPU-like multicore architecture.

We propose to integrate 60 GHz radio with the existing Wi-Fi radio in 2.4/5 GHz band to take advantage of the complementary nature of these different bands. This integration presents an opportunity to provide a unified technology for both gigabit Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) and Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), thus further reinforcing the technology convergence that is already underway with the widespread adoption of Wi-Fi technology. Many open research questions remain to make this unified solution work seamlessly for WPAN and WLAN.","author":["L.

Although DRAM becomes less reliable when it is not refreshed, it is not immediately erased, and its contents persist sufficiently for malicious (or forensic) acquisition of usable full-system memory images. We show that this phenomenon limits the ability of an operating system to protect cryptographic key material from an attacker with physical access to a machine. It poses a particular threat to laptop users who rely on disk encryption: we demonstrate that it could be used to compromise several popular disk encryption products without the need for any special devices or materials. We experimentally characterize the extent and predictability of memory retention and report that remanence times can be increased dramatically with simple cooling techniques. We offer new algorithms for finding cryptographic keys in memory images and for correcting errors caused by bit decay. Though we discuss several strategies for mitigating these risks, we know of no simple remedy that would eliminate them.","author":["J. Alex Halderman","Seth D.

Our solution comes in three steps. First, we provide a general result -- that, to construct an encryption scheme that permits evaluation of arbitrary circuits, it suffices to construct an encryption scheme that can evaluate (slightly augmented versions of) its own decryption circuit; we call a scheme that can evaluate its (augmented) decryption circuit bootstrappable. Next, we describe a public key encryption scheme using ideal lattices that is almost bootstrappable. Lattice-based cryptosystems typically have decryption algorithms with low circuit complexity, often dominated by an inner product computation that is in NC1. Also, ideal lattices provide both additive and multiplicative homomorphisms (modulo a public-key ideal in a polynomial ring that is represented as a lattice), as needed to evaluate general circuits. Unfortunately, our initial scheme is not quite bootstrappable -- i.e., the depth that the scheme can correctly evaluate can be logarithmic in the lattice dimension, just like the depth of the decryption circuit, but the latter is greater than the former. In the final step, we show how to modify the scheme to reduce the depth of the decryption circuit, and thereby obtain a bootstrappable encryption scheme, without reducing the depth that the scheme can evaluate. Abstractly, we accomplish this by enabling the encrypter to start the decryption process, leaving less work for the decrypter, much like the server leaves less work for the decrypter in a server-aided cryptosystem.","author":["Craig Gentry"],"issue":["STOC '09: Proceedings of the forty-first annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing","May 2009","Pages   169\u2013178","https://doi.org/10.1145/1536414.1536440"],"date":"31 May 2009","ref":[{"text":"M.

Orchestrating the diversity of processing functionality is going to be a major challenge in the upcoming years, be it to optimize for performance or for minimal energy consumption. We expect field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs or \"programmable hardware\") to soon play the role of yet another processing unit, found in commodity computers. It is clear that the new resource is going to be too precious to be ignored by database systems, but it is unclear how FPGAs could be integrated into a DBMS. With a focus on database use, this tutorial introduces into the emerging technology, demonstrates its potential, but also pinpoints some challenges that need to be addressed before FPGA-accelerated database systems can go mainstream. Attendees will gain an intuition of an FPGA development cycle, receive guidelines for a \"good\" FPGA design, but also learn the limitations that hardware-implemented database processing faces. Our more high-level ambition is to spur a broader interest in database processing on novel hardware technology.","author":["Rene Mueller","Jens Teubner"],"issue":["SIGMOD '09: Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data","June 2009","Pages   999\u20131004","https://doi.org/10.1145/1559845.1559965"],"date":"29 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"Zachary K.

We use a task-based library to replace the existing linear algebra subroutines such as PBLAS to transparently provide the same interface and computational function as the ScaLAPACK library. Linear algebra programs are written with the task-based library and executed by a dynamic runtime system. We mainly focus our runtime system design on the metric of performance scalability. We propose a distributed algorithm to solve data dependences without process cooperation. We have implemented the runtime system and applied it to three linear algebra algorithms: Cholesky, LU, and QR factorizations. Our experiments on both shared-memory machines (16, 32 cores) and distributed-memory machines (1024 cores) demonstrate that our runtime system is able to achieve good scalability. Furthermore, we provide analytical analysis to show why the tiled algorithms are scalable and the expected execution time.","author":["Fengguang Song","Asim YarKhan","Jack Dongarra"],"issue":["SC '09: Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Computing Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2009","Article No.: 19","Pages   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/1654059.1654079"],"date":"14 November 2009","ref":[{"text":"K.

FPGA provides a highly parallel, low power, and flexible hardware platform for this domain, while the difficulty of programming FPGA greatly limits its prevalence. MapReduce is a parallel programming framework that could easily utilize inherent parallelism in algorithms. In this paper, we describe FPMR, a MapReduce framework on FPGA, which provides programming abstraction, hardware architecture, and basic building blocks to developers. An on-chip processor scheduler is implemented to maximize the utilization of computation resources and achieve better load balancing. An efficient data access scheme is carefully designed to maximize data reuse and throughput. Meanwhile, the FPMR framework hides the task control, synchronization, and communication away from designers so that more attention can be paid to the application itself. A case study of RankBoost acceleration based on FPMR demonstrates that FPMR efficiently helps with the development productivity; and the speedup is 31.8x versus CPU-based implementation. This performance is comparable to a fully manually designed version, which achieves 33.5x speedup. Two other applications: SVM, PageRank are also discussed to show the generalization of the framework.","author":["Yi Shan","Bo Wang","Jing Yan","Yu Wang","Ningyi Xu","Huazhong Yang"],"issue":["FPGA '10: Proceedings of the 18th annual ACM/SIGDA international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2010","Pages   93\u2013102","https://doi.org/10.1145/1723112.1723129"],"date":"21 February 2010","ref":[{"text":"Martin C.

It has been established, through numerous demonstrations for particular conjunctions of application kernel, programming languages, and GPU hardware instance, that it is possible to achieve significant improvements in the price/performance and energy/performance over general purpose processors. But these demonstrations are each the result of significant dedicated programmer labor, which is likely to be duplicated for each new GPU hardware architecture to achieve performance portability. This paper discusses the implementation, in the R-Stream compiler, of a source to source mapping pathway from a high-level, textbook-style algorithm expression method in ANSI C, to multi-GPGPU accelerated computers. The compiler performs hierarchical decomposition and parallelization of the algorithm between and across host, multiple GPGPUs, and within-GPU. The semantic transformations are expressed within the polyhedral model, including optimization of integrated parallelization, locality, and contiguity tradeoffs. Hierarchical tiling is performed. Communication and synchronizations operations at multiple levels are generated automatically. The resulting mapping is currently emitted in the CUDA programming language. The GPU backend adds to the range of hardware and accelerator targets for R-Stream and indicates the potential for performance portability of single sources across multiple hardware targets.","author":["Allen Leung","Nicolas Vasilache","Beno\u00eet Meister","Muthu Baskaran","David Wohlford","C\u00e9dric Bastoul","Richard Lethin"],"issue":["GPGPU-3: Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on General-Purpose Computation on Graphics Processing Units","March 2010","Pages   51\u201361","https://doi.org/10.1145/1735688.1735698"],"date":"14 March 2010","ref":[{"text":"C.

However, there has been little examination of system-level parameters of raw devices, such as mean latency and endurance values. We report the results of such tests on a variety of devices. Read, program, and erase latency were found to align closely with manufacturer's specified \\typical\" values in almost all cases. Program/erase endurance, however, was found to exceed specified minimum values, often by as much as a factor of 100. In addition significant performance changes were found with wear. These changes may be used to track wear, and in addition have significant implications for system performance over the lifespan of a device. Finally, random write patterns which incur performance penalties on current ash-based memory systems were found to incur no overhead on the devices themselves.","author":["Peter Desnoyers"],"issue":["ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","Volume 44","Issue 1","January 2010","pp   50\u201354","https://doi.org/10.1145/1740390.1740402"],"date":"12 March 2010","ref":[{"text":"L.

Synthesis tools have also emerged for the automated design of lab-on-chip from the specifications of laboratory protocols. However, none of these tools consider control flow or address the problem of recovering from fluidic errors that can occur during on-chip bioassay execution. We present a synthesis method that incorporates control paths and an error-recovery mechanism in the design of a digital microfluidic lab-on-chip. Based on error-propagation estimates, we determine the best locations for fluidic checkpoints during biochip synthesis. A microcontroller coordinates the implementation of the control-flow-based bioassay by intercepting the synthesis results that are mapped to the software programs. Real-life bioassay applications are used as case studies to evaluate the proposed design method. For a representative protein assay, compared to a baseline chip design, the biochip with a control path can reduce the completion time by 30% when errors occur during the implementation of the bioassay.","author":["Yang Zhao","Tao Xu","Krishnendu Chakrabarty"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 6","Issue 3","August 2010","Article No.: 11","pp   1\u201328","https://doi.org/10.1145/1777401.1777404"],"date":"13 August 2010","ref":[{"text":"Bohringer, K.

Two key observations drive the design of a new architecture for CNN. First, CNN workloads exhibit a widely varying mix of three types of parallelism: parallelism within a convolution operation, intra-output parallelism where multiple input sources (features) are combined to create a single output, and inter-output parallelism where multiple, independent outputs (features) are computed simultaneously. Workloads differ significantly across different CNN applications, and across different layers of a CNN. Second, the number of processing elements in an architecture continues to scale (as per Moore's law) much faster than off-chip memory bandwidth (or pin-count) of chips. Based on these two observations, we show that for a given number of processing elements and off-chip memory bandwidth, a new CNN hardware architecture that dynamically configures the hardware on-the-fly to match the specific mix of parallelism in a given workload gives the best throughput performance. Our CNN compiler automatically translates high abstraction network specification into a parallel microprogram (a sequence of low-level VLIW instructions) that is mapped, scheduled and executed by the coprocessor. Compared to a 2.3 GHz quad-core, dual socket Intel Xeon, 1.35 GHz C870 GPU, and a 200 MHz FPGA implementation, our 120 MHz dynamically configurable architecture is 4x to 8x faster. This is the first CNN architecture to achieve real-time video stream processing (25 to 30 frames per second) on a wide range of object detection and recognition tasks.","author":["Srimat Chakradhar","Murugan Sankaradas","Venkata Jakkula","Srihari Cadambi"],"issue":["ISCA '10: Proceedings of the 37th annual international symposium on Computer architecture","June 2010","Pages   247\u2013257","https://doi.org/10.1145/1815961.1815993"],"date":"19 June 2010","ref":[{"text":"LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P.

Its concept is very simple, but its application to standard-cell VLSI designs involves many careful considerations. The great complexity of designing a power-gated circuit originates from the side effects of inserting current switches, which have to be resolved by a combination of extra circuitry and customized tools and methodologies. In this tutorial we survey these design considerations and look at the best practice within industry and academia. Topics include output isolation and data retention, current switch design and sizing, and physical design issues such as power networks, increases in area and wirelength, and power grid analysis. Designers can benefit from this tutorial by obtaining a better understanding of implications of power gating during an early stage of VLSI designs. We also review the ways in which power gating has been improved. These include reducing the sizes of switches, cutting transition delays, applying power gating to smaller blocks of circuitry, and reducing the energy dissipated in mode transitions. Power Gating has also been combined with other circuit techniques, and these hybrids are also reviewed. Important open problems are identified as a stimulus to research.","author":["Youngsoo Shin","Jun Seomun","Kyu-Myung Choi","Takayasu Sakurai"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 15","Issue 4","September 2010","Article No.: 28","pp   1\u201337","https://doi.org/10.1145/1835420.1835421"],"date":"07 October 2010","ref":[{"text":"}}Abdollahi, A., Fallah, F., and Pedram, M. 2004.

Recent work has shown that the accuracy of the widely-used random-walk-based proximity measures can be improved by supervised learning - in particular, one especially effective learning technique is based on Path-Constrained Random Walks (PCRW), in which similarity is defined by a learned combination of constrained random walkers, each constrained to follow only a particular sequence of edge labels away from the query nodes. The PCRW based method significantly outperformed unsupervised random walk based queries, and models with learned edge weights. Unfortunately, PCRW query systems are expensive to evaluate. In this study we evaluate the use of approximations to the computation of the PCRW distributions, including fingerprinting, particle filtering, and truncation strategies. In experiments on several recommendation and retrieval problems using two large scientific publications corpora we show speedups of factors of 2 to 100 with little loss in accuracy.","author":["Ni Lao","William W.

In this article, we consider the problem of temporal link prediction: Given link data for times 1 through T, can we predict the links at time T + 1? If our data has underlying periodic structure, can we predict out even further in time, i.e., links at time T + 2, T + 3, etc.? In this article, we consider bipartite graphs that evolve over time and consider matrix- and tensor-based methods for predicting future links. We present a weight-based method for collapsing multiyear data into a single matrix. We show how the well-known Katz method for link prediction can be extended to bipartite graphs and, moreover, approximated in a scalable way using a truncated singular value decomposition. Using a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC tensor decomposition of the data, we illustrate the usefulness of exploiting the natural three-dimensional structure of temporal link data. Through several numerical experiments, we demonstrate that both matrix- and tensor-based techniques are effective for temporal link prediction despite the inherent difficulty of the problem. Additionally, we show that tensor-based techniques are particularly effective for temporal data with varying periodic patterns.","author":["Daniel M. Dunlavy","Tamara G.

These memory devices enable fast user-mode access to persistence, allowing regular in-memory data structures to survive system crashes.In this paper, we present Mnemosyne, a simple interface for programming with persistent memory. Mnemosyne addresses two challenges: how to create and manage such memory, and how to ensure consistency in the presence of failures. Without additional mechanisms, a system failure may leave data structures in SCM in an invalid state, crashing the program the next time it starts.In Mnemosyne, programmers declare global persistent data with the keyword \"pstatic\" or allocate it dynamically. Mnemosyne provides primitives for directly modifying persistent variables and supports consistent updates through a lightweight transaction mechanism. Compared to past work on disk-based persistent memory, Mnemosyne reduces latency to storage by writing data directly to memory at the granularity of an update rather than writing memory pages back to disk through the file system. In tests emulating the performance characteristics of forthcoming SCMs, we show that Mnemosyne can persist data as fast as 3 microseconds. Furthermore, it provides a 35 percent performance increase when applied in the OpenLDAP directory server. In microbenchmark studies we find that Mnemosyne can be up to 1400% faster than alternative persistence strategies, such as Berkeley DB or Boost serialization, that are designed for disks.","author":["Haris Volos","Andres Jaan Tack","Michael M.

We write general matrix multiply (GEMM) kernels for single (SP), double (DP) and double-double (DDP) precision. Our SGEMM and DGEMM kernels show ~ 2 Top/s and ~ 470 Glop/s, respectively. These results for SP and DP correspond to 73% and 87% of the theoretical performance of the GPU, respectively. Currently, our SGEMM and DGEMM kernels are fastest with one GPU chip to our knowledge. Furthermore, the performance of our matrix multiply kernel in DDP is 31 Gop/s. This performance in DDP is more than 200 times faster than the performance results in DDP on single core of a recent CPU (with mpack version 0.6.5). We describe our GEMM kernels with main focus on the SGEMM implementation since all GEMM kernels share common programming and optimization techniques. While a conventional wisdom of GPU programming recommends us to heavily use shared memory on GPUs, we show that texture cache is very effective on the Cypress architecture.","author":["Naohito Nakasato"],"issue":["ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review","Volume 38","Issue 4","March 2011","pp   50\u201355","https://doi.org/10.1145/1964218.1964227"],"date":"29 March 2011","ref":[{"text":"XBLAS - Extra Precise Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines: http://www.netlib.org/xblas/.","order":1},{"text":"Bailey, D.

The model density and complexity of the scenes representing these virtual environments is rising rapidly. This trend suggests that data-mining a 3D scene corpus could be a very powerful tool enabling more efficient scene design. In this paper, we show how to represent scenes as graphs that encode models and their semantic relationships. We then define a kernel between these relationship graphs that compares common virtual substructures in two graphs and captures the similarity between their corresponding scenes. We apply this framework to several scene modeling problems, such as finding similar scenes, relevance feedback, and context-based model search. We show that incorporating structural relationships allows our method to provide a more relevant set of results when compared against previous approaches to model context search.","author":["Matthew Fisher","Manolis Savva","Pat Hanrahan"],"issue":["SIGGRAPH '11: ACM SIGGRAPH 2011 papers","August 2011","Article No.: 34","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/1964921.1964929"],"date":"25 July 2011","ref":[{"text":"Bach, F.

To make the most of this information, researchers have drawn upon the work of the natural language processing community for tools and techniques. One such tool provides part-of-speech information, which finds application in improving the searching of software repositories and extracting domain information found in identifiers. Unfortunately, the natural language found is software differs from that found in standard prose. This difference potentially limits the effectiveness of off-the-shelf tools. An empirical investigation finds that with minimal guidance an existing tagger was correct 88% of the time when tagging the words found in source code identifiers. The investigation then uses the improved part-of-speech information to tag a large corpus of over 145,000 structure-field names. From patterns in the tags several rules emerge that seek to understand past usage and to improve future naming.","author":["Dave Binkley","Matthew Hearn","Dawn Lawrie"],"issue":["MSR '11: Proceedings of the 8th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories","May 2011","Pages   203\u2013206","https://doi.org/10.1145/1985441.1985471"],"date":"21 May 2011","ref":[{"text":"S.

We propose three alternatives that differ mainly in the way that they deal with the dirty pages evicted from the buffer pool. We implemented these alternatives, as well another recently proposed algorithm for this task (TAC), in SQL Server, and ran experiments using a variety of benchmarks (TPC-C, E and H) at multiple scale factors.

This can lead either to slow implementations caused by long wiring paths that avoid congestion or a failure to route all signals. This paper presents PathFinder, a router that balances the goals of performance and routability. PathFinder uses an iterative algorithm that converges to a solution in which all signals are routed while achieving close to the optimal performance allowed by the placement. Routability is achieved by forcing signals to negotiate for a resource and thereby determine which signal needs the resource most. Delay is minimized by allowing the more critical signals a greater say in this negotiation. Because PathFinder requires only a  directed graph to describe the architecture of routing resources, it adapts readily to a wide variety of FPGA architectures such as Triptych, Xilinx 3000 and mesh-connected arrays of FPGAs. The results of routing ISCAS benchmarks on the Triptych FPGA architecture show an average increase of only 4.5% in critical path delay over the optimum delay for a placement. Routes of ISCAS benchmarks on the Xilinx 3000 architecture show a greater completion rate than commercial tools, as well as 11% faster implementations.","author":["Larry McMurchie","Carl Ebeling"],"issue":["FPGA '95: Proceedings of the 1995 ACM third international symposium on Field-programmable gate arrays","February 1995","Pages   111\u2013117","https://doi.org/10.1145/201310.201328"],"date":"15 February 1995","ref":[{"text":"M.

With these challenges in mind, we reconsider the options for designing a rendering system and present Razor, a new software rendering architecture for distribution ray tracing designed to produce high-quality images with high performance on future single-chip many-core hardware. Razor includes two noteworthy capabilities: a set of techniques for quickly building the kd-tree acceleration structure on demand every frame from a scene graph and a system design that allows for crack-free multiresolution geometry with each ray independently choosing its geometry resolution. Razor's per-frame kd-tree build is designed to robustly handle arbitrarily scene animation, while its per-ray multiresolution geometry provides continuous level of detail driven by ray and path differentials. Razor also decouples shading from visibility computations using a two-phase shading scheme inspired by the REYES system, and caches tessellated representations of freeform surfaces at multiple levels of detail.We present experimental results gathered from a prototype system implemented on eight CPU cores, and discuss which aspects of the system are most successful and which would benefit from further investigation.","author":["Peter Djeu","Warren Hunt","Rui Wang","Ikrima Elhassan","Gordon Stoll","William R.

Data redundancy and/or coding are used to enhance data availability, for instance, Row-diagonal parity (RDP) and EVENODD codes, which are widely used in RAID-6 storage systems, provide data availability with up to two disk failures. To reduce the probability of data unavailability, whenever a single disk fails, disk recovery will be carried out. We find that the conventional recovery schemes of RDP and EVENODD codes for a single failed disk only use one parity disk. However, there are two parity disks in the system, and both can be used for single disk failure recovery. In this article, we propose a hybrid recovery approach that uses both parities for single disk failure recovery, and we design efficient recovery schemes for RDP code (RDOR-RDP) and EVENODD code (RDOR-EVENODD). Our recovery scheme has the following attractive properties: (1) \u201cread optimality\u201d in the sense that our scheme issues the smallest number of disk reads to recover a single failed disk and it reduces approximately 1/4 of disk reads compared with conventional schemes; (2) \u201cload balancing property\u201d in that all surviving disks will be subjected to the same (or almost the same) amount of additional workload in rebuilding the failed disk.We carry out performance evaluation to quantify the merits of RDOR-RDP and RDOR-EVENODD on some widely used disks with DiskSim. The offline experimental results show that RDOR-RDP and RDOR-EVENODD outperform the conventional recovery schemes of RDP and EVENODD codes in terms of total recovery time and recovery workload on individual surviving disk. However, the improvements are less than the theoretical value (approximately 25%), as RDOR-RDP and RDOR-EVENODD change the disk access pattern from purely sequential to a more random one compared with their conventional schemes.","author":["Liping Xiang","Yinlong Xu","John C.

Applications of wireless body sensor networks include healthcare, entertainment, and personal assistance, in which sensors collect physiological and activity data from people and their environments. In these body sensor networks, quality of service is needed to provide reliable data communication over prioritized data streams. This article proposes BodyQoS, the first running QoS system demonstrated on an emulated body sensor network. BodyQoS adopts an asymmetric architecture, in which most processing is done on a resource-rich aggregator, minimizing the load on resource-limited sensor nodes. A virtual MAC is developed in BodyQoS to make it radio-agnostic, allowing a BodyQoS to schedule wireless resources without knowing the implementation details of the underlying MAC protocols. Another unique property of BodyQoS is its ability to provide adaptive resource scheduling. When the effective bandwidth of the channel degrades due to RF interference or body fading effect, BodyQoS adaptively schedules remaining bandwidth to meet QoS requirements. We have implemented BodyQoS in NesC on top of TinyOS, and evaluated its performance on MicaZ devices. Our system performance study shows that BodyQoS delivers significantly improved performance over conventional solutions in combating channel impairment.","author":["Gang Zhou","Qiang Li","Jingyuan Li","Yafeng Wu","Shan Lin","Jian Lu","Chieh-Yih Wan","Mark D.

Traversal and intersection operations dominate the computation of ray tracing. To accelerate these two operations, we propose a hardware architecture integrating three novel approaches. First, we present an ordered depth-first layout and a traversal architecture using this layout to reduce the required memory bandwidth. Second, we propose a three-phase ray-triangle intersection architecture that takes advantage of early exit. Third, we propose a latency hiding architecture defined as the ray accumulation unit.

We present a model of computation for approximate computations and an algorithm for optimizing these computations. The algorithm works with two classes of transformations: substitution transformations (which select one of a number of available implementations for a given function, with each implementation offering a different combination of accuracy and resource consumption) and sampling transformations (which randomly discard some of the inputs to a given reduction). The algorithm produces a (1+\u03b5) randomized approximation to the optimal randomized computation (which minimizes resource consumption subject to a probabilistic accuracy specification in the form of a maximum expected error or maximum error variance).","author":["Zeyuan Allen Zhu","Sasa Misailovic","Jonathan A.

The photos, together with their time- and geo-references, become the digital footprints of photo takers and implicitly document their spatiotemporal movements. This study aims to leverage the wealth of these enriched online photos to analyze people\u2019s travel patterns at the local level of a tour destination. Specifically, we focus our analysis on two aspects: (1) tourist movement patterns in relation to the regions of attractions (RoA), and (2) topological characteristics of travel routes by different tourists. To do so, we first build a statistically reliable database of travel paths from a noisy pool of community-contributed geotagged photos on the Internet. We then investigate the tourist traffic flow among different RoAs by exploiting the Markov chain model. Finally, the topological characteristics of travel routes are analyzed by performing a sequence clustering on tour routes. Testings on four major cities demonstrate promising results of the proposed system.","author":["Yan-Tao Zheng","Zheng-Jun Zha","Tat-Seng Chua"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology","Volume 3","Issue 3","May 2012","Article No.: 56","pp   1\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/2168752.2168770"],"date":"01 May 2012","ref":[{"text":"2007.

In order to design a higher-performance flash file system, two issues should be considered carefully. One issue is the design of an efficient index structure that contains the locations of both files and data in the flash memory. For large-capacity storage, the index structure must be stored in the flash memory to realize low memory consumption; however, this may degrade the system performance. The other issue is the design of a novel garbage collection (GC) scheme that reclaims obsolete pages. This scheme can induce considerable additional read and write operations while identifying and migrating valid pages. In this article, we present a novel flash file system that has the following features: (i) a lightweight index structure that introduces the hybrid indexing scheme and intra-inode index logging, and (ii) an efficient GC scheme that adopts a dirty list with an on-demand GC approach as well as fine-grained data separation and erase-unit data allocation. We implemented FlashLight in a Linux OS with kernel version 2.6.21 on an embedded device. The experimental results obtained using several benchmark programs confirm that FlashLight improves the performance by up to 27.4% over UBIFS by alleviating index management and GC overheads by up to 33.8%.","author":["Jaegeuk Kim","Hyotaek Shim","Seon-Yeong Park","Seungryoul Maeng","Jin-Soo Kim"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 11S","Issue 1","June 2012","Article No.: 18","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/2180887.2180895"],"date":"01 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"2007.

Question answering approaches have been proposed as a good compromise between intuitiveness and expressivity. Most question answering systems translate questions into triples which are matched against the RDF data to retrieve an answer, typically relying on some similarity metric. However, in many cases, triples do not represent a faithful representation of the semantic structure of the natural language question, with the result that more expressive queries can not be answered. To circumvent this problem, we present a novel approach that relies on a parse of the question to produce a SPARQL template that directly mirrors the internal structure of the question. This template is then instantiated using statistical entity identification and predicate detection. We show that this approach is competitive and discuss cases of questions that can be answered with our approach but not with competing approaches.","author":["Christina Unger","Lorenz B\u00fchmann","Jens Lehmann","Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo","Daniel Gerber","Philipp Cimiano"],"issue":["WWW '12: Proceedings of the 21st international conference on World Wide Web","April 2012","Pages   639\u2013648","https://doi.org/10.1145/2187836.2187923"],"date":"16 April 2012","ref":[{"text":"H.

High performance, robustness, and energy-efficiency are crucial for the widespread adoption of such platforms. Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) have emerged as communication backbones to enable a high degree of integration in multicore Systems-on-Chip (SoCs). Despite their advantages, an important performance limitation in traditional NoCs arises from planar metal interconnect-based multihop links with high latency and power consumption. This limitation can be addressed by drawing inspiration from the evolution of natural complex networks, which offer great performance-cost trade-offs. Analogous with many natural complex systems, future multicore chips are expected to be hierarchical and heterogeneous in nature as well. In this article we undertake a detailed performance evaluation for hierarchical small-world NoC architectures where the long-range communications links are established through the millimeter-wave wireless communication channels. Through architecture-space exploration in conjunction with novel power-efficient on-chip wireless link design, we demonstrate that it is possible to improve performance of conventional NoC architectures significantly without incurring high area overhead.","author":["Kevin Chang","Sujay Deb","Amlan Ganguly","Xinmin Yu","Suman Prasad Sah","Partha Pratim Pande","Benjamin Belzer","Deukhyoun Heo"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 8","Issue 3","August 2012","Article No.: 23","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2287696.2287706"],"date":"15 August 2012","ref":[{"text":"AGILENT 2012.

We show that the original OpenCL semantics naturally fits to the heterogeneous cluster programming environment, and the framework achieves high performance and ease of programming. The target cluster architecture consists of a designated, single host node and many compute nodes. They are connected by an interconnection network, such as Gigabit Ethernet and InfiniBand switches. Each compute node is equipped with multicore CPUs and multiple GPUs. A set of CPU cores or each GPU becomes an OpenCL compute device. The host node executes the host program in an OpenCL application. SnuCL provides a system image running a single operating system instance for heterogeneous CPU/GPU clusters to the user. It allows the application to utilize compute devices in a compute node as if they were in the host node. No communication API, such as the MPI library, is required in the application source. SnuCL also provides collective communication extensions to OpenCL to facilitate manipulating memory objects. With SnuCL, an OpenCL application becomes portable not only between heterogeneous devices in a single node, but also between compute devices in the cluster environment. We implement SnuCL and evaluate its performance using eleven OpenCL benchmark applications.","author":["Jungwon Kim","Sangmin Seo","Jun Lee","Jeongho Nah","Gangwon Jo","Jaejin Lee"],"issue":["ICS '12: Proceedings of the 26th ACM international conference on Supercomputing","June 2012","Pages   341\u2013352","https://doi.org/10.1145/2304576.2304623"],"date":"25 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"AMD.

Small, fast cache memories are designed to overcome this discrepancy, but they are only effective when programs exhibit data locality. In the this article, we present compiler optimizations to improve data locality based on a simple yet accurate cost model. The model computes both temporal and spatial reuse of cache lines to find desirable loop organizations. The cost model drives the application of compound transformations consisting of loop permutation, loop fusion, loop distribution, and loop reversal. To validate our optimization strategy, we implemented our algorithms and ran experiments on a large collection of scientific programs and kernels. Experiments illustrate that for kernels our model and algorithm can select and achieve the best loop structure for a nest. For over 30 complete applications, we executed the original and transformed versions and simulated cache hit rates. We collected statistics about the inherent characteristics of these programs and our ability to improve their data locality. To our knowledge, these studies are the first of such breadth and depth. We found performance improvements were difficult to achieve bacause benchmark programs typically have high hit rates even for small data caches; however, our optimizations significanty improved several programs.","author":["Kathryn S.

However, when two requests go to the same bank, they have to be served serially, exacerbating the high latency of off-chip memory. Adding more banks to the system to mitigate this problem incurs high system cost. Our goal in this work is to achieve the benefits of increasing the number of banks with a low cost approach. To this end, we propose three new mechanisms that overlap the latencies of different requests that go to the same bank. The key observation exploited by our mechanisms is that a modern DRAM bank is implemented as a collection of subarrays that operate largely independently while sharing few global peripheral structures.Our proposed mechanisms (SALP-1, SALP-2, and MASA) mitigate the negative impact of bank serialization by overlapping different components of the bank access latencies of multiple requests that go to different subarrays within the same bank. SALP-1 requires no changes to the existing DRAM structure and only needs reinterpretation of some DRAM timing parameters. SALP-2 and MASA require only modest changes (< 0.15% area overhead) to the DRAM peripheral structures, which are much less design constrained than the DRAM core. Evaluations show that all our schemes significantly improve performance for both single-core systems and multi-core systems. Our schemes also interact positively with application-aware memory request scheduling in multi-core systems.","author":["Yoongu Kim","Vivek Seshadri","Donghyuk Lee","Jamie Liu","Onur Mutlu"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 40","Issue 3","June 2012","pp   368\u2013379","https://doi.org/10.1145/2366231.2337202"],"date":"09 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"J.

Because memory is viewed as unsafe, systems periodically write data back to disk. The extra disk traffic lowers performance, and the delay period before data is safe lowers reliability. The goal of the Rio (RAM I/O) file cache is to make ordinary main memory safe for persistent storage by enabling memory to survive operating system crashes. Reliable memory enables a system to achieve the best of both worlds: reliability equivalent to a write-through file cache, where every write is instantly safe, and performance equivalent to a pure write-back cache, with no reliability-induced writes to disk. To achieve reliability, we protect memory during a crash and restore it during a reboot (a \"warm\" reboot). Extensive crash tests show that even without protection, warm reboot enables memory to achieve reliability close to that of a write-through file system. Adding protection makes memory even safer than a write-through file system while adding essentially no overhead. By eliminating reliability-induced disk writes, Rio performs 4-22 times as fast as a write-through file system, 2-14 times as fast as a standard Unix file system, and 1-3 times as fast as an optimized system that risks losing 30 seconds of data and metadata.","author":["Peter M.

Even when the initial and final configurations are correct, the update process itself often steps through intermediate configurations that exhibit incorrect behaviors. This paper introduces the notion of consistent network updates---updates that are guaranteed to preserve well-defined behaviors when transitioning mbetween configurations. We identify two distinct consistency levels, per-packet and per-flow, and we present general mechanisms for implementing them in Software-Defined Networks using switch APIs like OpenFlow. We develop a formal model of OpenFlow networks, and prove that consistent updates preserve a large class of properties. We describe our prototype implementation, including several optimizations that reduce the overhead required to perform consistent updates. We present a verification tool that leverages consistent updates to significantly reduce the complexity of checking the correctness of network control software. Finally, we describe the results of some simple experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of these optimizations on example applications.","author":["Mark Reitblatt","Nate Foster","Jennifer Rexford","Cole Schlesinger","David Walker"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 42","Issue 4","October 2012","pp   323\u2013334","https://doi.org/10.1145/2377677.2377748"],"date":"13 August 2012","ref":[{"text":"P.

Evaluation of quantitative issues like performance and dependability of these systems is of paramount importance. In this paper, we propose a generalized methodology to formally reason about probabilistic systems within a theorem prover. We present a formalization of measure theory in the HOL theorem prover and use it to formalize basic concepts from the theory of probability. We also use the Lebesgue integration to formalize statistical properties of random variables. To illustrate the practical effectiveness of our methodology, we formally prove classical results from the theories of probability and information and use them in a data compression application in HOL.","author":["Tarek Mhamdi","Osman Hasan","Sofi\u00e8ne Tahar"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 12","Issue 1","January 2013","Article No.: 13","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/2406336.2406349"],"date":"01 January 2013","ref":[{"text":"Baier, C. and Katoen, J. 2008.","doi":"10.5555/1373322","order":1},{"text":"Baier, C., Haverkort, B., Hermanns, H., and Katoen, J. 2003.

Nevertheless, most existing acquisition approaches either multiplex a low-resolution light field into a single 2D sensor image or require multiple photographs to be taken for acquiring a high-resolution light field. We propose a compressive light field camera architecture that allows for higher-resolution light fields to be recovered than previously possible from a single image. The proposed architecture comprises three key components: light field atoms as a sparse representation of natural light fields, an optical design that allows for capturing optimized 2D light field projections, and robust sparse reconstruction methods to recover a 4D light field from a single coded 2D projection. In addition, we demonstrate a variety of other applications for light field atoms and sparse coding, including 4D light field compression and denoising.","author":["Kshitij Marwah","Gordon Wetzstein","Yosuke Bando","Ramesh Raskar"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 32","Issue 4","July 2013","Article No.: 46","pp   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2461912.2461914"],"date":"21 July 2013","ref":[{"text":"Adelson, E., and Wang, J. 1992.

With an effective exposure time of 1.85 picoseconds (ps) per frame, we reconstruct movies of ultrafast events at an equivalent resolution of about one half trillion frames per second. Because cameras with this shutter speed do not exist, we re-purpose modern imaging hardware to record an ensemble average of repeatable events that are synchronized to a streak sensor, in which the time of arrival of light from the scene is coded in one of the sensor's spatial dimensions. We introduce reconstruction methods that allow us to visualize the propagation of femtosecond light pulses through macroscopic scenes; at such fast resolution, we must consider the notion of time-unwarping between the camera's and the world's space-time coordinate systems to take into account effects associated with the finite speed of light. We apply our femto-photography technique to visualizations of very different scenes, which allow us to observe the rich dynamics of time-resolved light transport effects, including scattering, specular reflections, diffuse interreflections, diffraction, caustics, and subsurface scattering. Our work has potential applications in artistic, educational, and scientific visualizations; industrial imaging to analyze material properties; and medical imaging to reconstruct subsurface elements. In addition, our time-resolved technique may motivate new forms of computational photography.","author":["Andreas Velten","Di Wu","Adrian Jarabo","Belen Masia","Christopher Barsi","Chinmaya Joshi","Everett Lawson","Moungi Bawendi","Diego Gutierrez","Ramesh Raskar"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 32","Issue 4","July 2013","Article No.: 44","pp   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/2461912.2461928"],"date":"21 July 2013","ref":[{"text":"Abramson, N. 1978.

However, manufacturing processes for TSVs have been shown to introduce new failure mechanisms. In particular, thermo-mechanical stress and electromigration introduce reliability threats for TSVs, e.g., voids and interfacial cracks, which can lead to hard-to-predict timing errors on critical paths with TSVs, thereby resulting in accelerated chip failure in the field. Burn-in for screening latent defects during manufacturing is expensive and its effectiveness for new TSV defect types has yet to be thoroughly characterized. We describe a reconfigurable in-field repair solution that is able to effectively tolerate latent TSV defects through the judicious use of spares. The proposed solution includes a reconfigurable repair architecture that enables spare TSV sharing between TSV grids, and the corresponding in-field repair algorithms. The effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed solution is evaluated using 3D benchmark designs.","author":["Li Jiang","Fangming Ye","Qiang Xu","Krishnendu Chakrabarty","Bill Eklow"],"issue":["DAC '13: Proceedings of the 50th Annual Design Automation Conference","May 2013","Article No.: 74","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2463209.2488824"],"date":"29 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS'11), available at http://www.itrs.net/.","order":1},{"text":"D.

The designs surveyed in this article include read before write, wear leveling, write cancellation, write pausing, some encryption schemes, and buffer organizations.

We observe that specialized units achieve most of their efficiency gains by tuning data storage and compute structures and their connectivity to the data-flow and data-locality patterns in the kernels. Hence, by identifying key data-flow patterns used in a domain, we can create efficient engines that can be programmed and reused across a wide range of applications. We present an example, the Convolution Engine (CE), specialized for the convolution-like data-flow that is common in computational photography, image processing, and video processing applications. CE achieves energy efficiency by capturing data reuse patterns, eliminating data transfer overheads, and enabling a large number of operations per memory access. We quantify the tradeoffs in efficiency and flexibility and demonstrate that CE is within a factor of 2-3x of the energy and area efficiency of custom units optimized for a single kernel. CE improves energy and area efficiency by 8-15x over a SIMD engine for most applications.","author":["Wajahat Qadeer","Rehan Hameed","Ofer Shacham","Preethi Venkatesan","Christos Kozyrakis","Mark A.

An effective way of improving performance in the face of bandwidth and power limitations is to rely on associative memory systems. Recent work on a PCM-based, associative TCAM accelerator shows that associative search capability can reduce both off-chip bandwidth demand and overall system energy. Unfortunately, previously proposed resistive TCAM accelerators have limited flexibility: only a restricted (albeit important) class of applications can benefit from a TCAM accelerator, and the implementation is confined to resistive memory technologies with a high dynamic range (RHigh/RLow), such as PCM. This work proposes AC-DIMM, a flexible, high-performance associative compute engine built on a DDR3-compatible memory module. AC-DIMM addresses the limited flexibility of previous resistive TCAM accelerators by combining two powerful capabilities---associative search and processing in memory. Generality is improved by augmenting a TCAM system with a set of integrated, user programmable microcontrollers that operate directly on search results, and by architecting the system such that key-value pairs can be co-located in the same TCAM row. A new, bit-serial TCAM array is proposed, which enables the system to be implemented using STT-MRAM. AC-DIMM achieves a 4.2X speedup and a 6.5X energy reduction over a conventional RAM-based system on a set of 13 evaluated applications.","author":["Qing Guo","Xiaochen Guo","Ravi Patel","Engin Ipek","Eby G.

MapReduce adopts a flexible computation model with a simple interface consisting of map and reduce functions whose implementations can be customized by application developers. Since its introduction, a substantial amount of research effort has been directed toward making it more usable and efficient for supporting database-centric operations. In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of a wide range of proposals and systems that focusing fundamentally on the support of distributed data management and processing using the MapReduce framework.","author":["Feng Li","Beng Chin Ooi","M.

This article reports our experiences with two iterations of the first large online class to use peer and self-assessment. In this class, peer grades correlated highly with staff-assigned grades. The second iteration had 42.9% of students\u2019 grades within 5% of the staff grade, and 65.5% within 10%. On average, students assessed their work 7% higher than staff did. Students also rated peers\u2019 work from their own country 3.6% higher than those from elsewhere. We performed three experiments to improve grading accuracy. We found that giving students feedback about their grading bias increased subsequent accuracy. We introduce short, customizable feedback snippets that cover common issues with assignments, providing students more qualitative peer feedback. Finally, we introduce a data-driven approach that highlights high-variance items for improvement. We find that rubrics that use a parallel sentence structure, unambiguous wording, and well-specified dimensions have lower variance. After revising rubrics, median grading error decreased from 12.4% to 9.9%.","author":["Chinmay Kulkarni","Koh Pang Wei","Huy Le","Daniel Chia","Kathryn Papadopoulos","Justin Cheng","Daphne Koller","Scott R.

Sharp images are depicted by out-of-focus elements by synthesizing light fields corresponding to virtual objects within a viewer's natural accommodation range. We formally assess the capabilities of microlens arrays to achieve practical near-eye light field displays. Building on concepts shared with existing integral imaging displays and light field cameras, we optimize performance in the context of near-eye viewing. We establish fundamental trade-offs between the quantitative parameters of resolution, field of view, and depth of field, as well as the ergonomic parameters of form factor and ranges of allowed eye movement. As with light field cameras, our design supports continuous accommodation of the eye throughout a finite depth of field; as a result, binocular configurations provide a means to address the accommodation-convergence conflict occurring with existing stereoscopic displays. We construct a complete prototype display system, comprising: a custom-fabricated HMD using modified off-the-shelf parts and real-time, GPU-accelerated light field renderers (including a general ray tracing method and a \"backward compatible\" rasterization method supporting existing stereoscopic content). Through simulations and experiments, we motivate near-eye light field displays as thin, lightweight alternatives to conventional near-eye displays.","author":["Douglas Lanman","David Luebke"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 32","Issue 6","November 2013","Article No.: 220","pp   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2508363.2508366"],"date":"01 November 2013","ref":[{"text":"Akeley, K., Watt, S.

Using an array of novel techniques, we demonstrate how to build an optimistic commit protocol that correctly recovers from crashes and delivers high performance. We implement this optimistic approach within a Linux ext4 variant which we call OptFS. We introduce two new file-system primitives, osync() and dsync(), that decouple ordering of writes from their durability. We show through experiments that OptFS improves performance for many workloads, sometimes by an order of magnitude; we confirm its correctness through a series of robustness tests, showing it recovers to a consistent state after crashes. Finally, we show that osync() and dsync() are useful in atomic file system and database update scenarios, both improving performance and meeting application-level consistency demands.","author":["Vijay Chidambaram","Thanumalayan Sankaranarayana Pillai","Andrea C.

This shows that strong enough lower bounds for the size of arithmetic formulas of depth 3 imply super-polynomial lower bounds for the size of general arithmetic formulas.One component of our proof is a new approach for homogenization and multilinearization of arithmetic formulas, that gives the following results:We show that for any n-variate homogeneous polynomial f of degree r, if there exists a (fanin-2) formula of size s and depth d for f then there exists a homogeneous formula of size O((d+r+1 r) \u010b s) for f. In particular, for any r \u2264 O(log n), if there exists a polynomial size formula for f then there exists a polynomial size homogeneous formula for f. This refutes a conjecture of Nisan and Wigderson [1996] and shows that super-polynomial lower bounds for homogeneous formulas for polynomials of small degree imply super-polynomial lower bounds for general formulas.We show that for any n-variate set-multilinear polynomial f of degree r, if there exists a (fanin-2) formula of size s and depth d for f, then there exists a set-multilinear formula of size O((d + 2)r \u010b s) for f.

Previous persistent memory designs use logging or copy-on-write mechanisms to update persistent data, which unfortunately reduces the system performance to roughly half that of a native system with no persistence support. One of the great challenges in this application class is therefore how to efficiently enable atomic, consistent, and durable updates to ensure data persistence that survives application and/or system failures. Our goal is to design a persistent memory system with performance very close to that of a native system. We propose Kiln, a persistent memory design that adopts a nonvolatile cache and a nonvolatile main memory to enable atomic in-place updates without logging or copy-on-write. Our evaluation shows that Kiln can achieve 2\u00d7 performance improvement compared with NVRAM-based persistent memory with write-ahead logging. In addition, our design has numerous practical advantages: a simple and intuitive abstract interface, microarchitecture-level optimizations, fast recovery from failures, and eliminating redundant writes to nonvolatile storage media.","author":["Jishen Zhao","Sheng Li","Doe Hyun Yoon","Yuan Xie","Norman P.

Most of the previous studies in this category only consider a single relationship type, such as friendships in a social network. In many scenarios, the entity recommendation problem exists in a heterogeneous information network environment. Different types of relationships can be potentially used to improve the recommendation quality. In this paper, we study the entity recommendation problem in heterogeneous information networks. Specifically, we propose to combine heterogeneous relationship information for each user differently and aim to provide high-quality personalized recommendation results using user implicit feedback data and personalized recommendation models. In order to take full advantage of the relationship heterogeneity in information networks, we first introduce meta-path-based latent features to represent the connectivity between users and items along different types of paths. We then define recommendation models at both global and personalized levels and use Bayesian ranking optimization techniques to estimate the proposed models. Empirical studies show that our approaches outperform several widely employed or the state-of-the-art entity recommendation techniques.","author":["Xiao Yu","Xiang Ren","Yizhou Sun","Quanquan Gu","Bradley Sturt","Urvashi Khandelwal","Brandon Norick","Jiawei Han"],"issue":["WSDM '14: Proceedings of the 7th ACM international conference on Web search and data mining","February 2014","Pages   283\u2013292","https://doi.org/10.1145/2556195.2556259"],"date":"24 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"J.

However, LDPC incurs read performance overhead because of its complex decoding procedure. To mitigate such overhead, we propose the error-correcting cache (EC-Cache) that exploits the \"error locality\" of NAND flash. Error locality means that the majority of errors in reads to the same NAND flash page appear in the same positions until the page is erased. By caching detected errors, EC-Cache can correct a significant portion of errors present in a requested flash page before the associated LDPC decoding process begins. EC-Cache can greatly speed up LDPC decoding because LDPC's latency is directly correlated to the number of errors present in the input data. Experimental results show that EC-Cache achieves up to 2.6\u00d7 SSD read performance gain.","author":["Ren-Shuo Liu","Meng-Yen Chuang","Chia-Lin Yang","Cheng-Hsuan Li","Kin-Chu Ho","Hsiang-Pang Li"],"issue":["DAC '14: Proceedings of the 51st Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2014","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2593069.2593130"],"date":"01 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"N.

An MIG is a directed acyclic graph consisting of three-input majority nodes and regular/complemented edges. We show that MIGs include any AND/OR/Inverter Graphs (AOIGs), containing also the well-known AIGs. In order to support the natural manipulation of MIGs, we introduce a new Boolean algebra, based exclusively on majority and inverter operations, with a complete axiomatic system. Theoretical results show that it is possible to explore the entire MIG representation space by using only five primitive transformation rules. Such feature opens up a great opportunity for logic optimization and synthesis. We showcase the MIG potential by proposing a delay-oriented optimization technique. Experimental results over MCNC benchmarks show that MIG optimization reduces the number of logic levels by 18%, on average, with respect to AIG optimization performed by ABC academic tool. Employed in a traditional optimization-mapping circuit synthesis flow, MIG optimization enables an average reduction of {22%, 14%, 11%} in the estimated {delay, area, power} metrics, before physical design, as compared to academic/commercial synthesis flows.","author":["Luca Amar\u00fa","Pierre-Emmanuel Gaillardon","Giovanni De Micheli"],"issue":["DAC '14: Proceedings of the 51st Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2014","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2593069.2593158"],"date":"01 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"G.

Our key insight is to exploit the close interplay between (1) dynamically executing a program on some test inputs and (2) statically compiling the program to work on all possible inputs. Indeed, the test inputs induce a natural collection of the original program's EMI variants, which can help differentially test any compiler and specifically target the difficult-to-find miscompilations. To create a practical implementation of EMI for validating C compilers, we profile a program's test executions and stochastically prune its unexecuted code. Our extensive testing in eleven months has led to 147 confirmed, unique bug reports for GCC and LLVM alone. The majority of those bugs are miscompilations, and more than 100 have already been fixed. Beyond testing compilers, EMI can be adapted to validate program transformation and analysis systems in general. This work opens up this exciting, new direction.","author":["Vu Le","Mehrdad Afshari","Zhendong Su"],"issue":["PLDI '14: Proceedings of the 35th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation","June 2014","Pages   216\u2013226","https://doi.org/10.1145/2594291.2594334"],"date":"09 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"ACE.

Meanwhile, users nowadays are usually involved in multiple online social networks simultaneously to enjoy specific services provided by different networks. Formally, social networks that share some common users are named as partially aligned networks. In this paper, we want to predict the formation of social links in multiple partially aligned social networks at the same time, which is formally defined as the multi-network link (formation) prediction problem. In multiple partially aligned social networks, users can be extensively correlated with each other by various connections. To categorize these diverse connections among users, 7 \"intra-network social meta paths\" and 4 categories of \"inter-network social meta paths\" are proposed in this paper. These \"social meta paths\" can cover a wide variety of connection information in the network, some of which can be helpful for solving the multi-network link prediction problem but some can be not. To utilize useful connection, a subset of the most informative \"social meta paths\" are picked, the process of which is formally defined as \"social meta path selection\" in this paper. An effective general link formation prediction framework, Mli (Multi-network Link Identifier), is proposed in this paper to solve the multi-network link (formation) prediction problem. Built with heterogenous topological features extracted based on the selected \"social meta paths\" in the multiple partially aligned social networks, Mli can help refine and disambiguate the prediction results reciprocally in all aligned networks. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world partially aligned heterogeneous networks, Foursquare and Twitter, demonstrate that Mli can solve the multi-network link prediction problem very well.","author":["Jiawei Zhang","Philip S.

Traditional approaches involve wearable sensors and specialized hardware installations. This paper presents device-free location-oriented activity identification at home through the use of existing WiFi access points and WiFi devices (e.g., desktops, thermostats, refrigerators, smartTVs, laptops). Our low-cost system takes advantage of the ever more complex web of WiFi links between such devices and the increasingly fine-grained channel state information that can be extracted from such links. It examines channel features and can uniquely identify both in-place activities and walking movements across a home by comparing them against signal profiles. Signal profiles construction can be semi-supervised and the profiles can be adaptively updated to accommodate the movement of the mobile devices and day-to-day signal calibration. Our experimental evaluation in two apartments of different size demonstrates that our approach can achieve over 96% average true positive rate and less than 1% average false positive rate to distinguish a set of in-place and walking activities with only a single WiFi access point. Our prototype also shows that our system can work with wider signal band (802.11ac) with even higher accuracy.","author":["Yan Wang","Jian Liu","Yingying Chen","Marco Gruteser","Jie Yang","Hongbo Liu"],"issue":["MobiCom '14: Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking","September 2014","Pages   617\u2013628","https://doi.org/10.1145/2639108.2639143"],"date":"07 September 2014","ref":[{"text":"Familylink. http://www.familylink.net/.","order":1},{"text":"Leap motion. https://www.leapmotion.com.","order":2},{"text":"IEEE Std. 802.11n-2009: Enhancements for higher throughput, 2009.

P4 works in conjunction with SDN control protocols like OpenFlow. In its current form, OpenFlow explicitly specifies protocol headers on which it operates. This set has grown from 12 to 41 fields in a few years, increasing the complexity of the specification while still not providing the flexibility to add new headers. In this paper we propose P4 as a strawman proposal for how OpenFlow should evolve in the future. We have three goals: (1) Reconfigurability in the field: Programmers should be able to change the way switches process packets once they are deployed. (2) Protocol independence: Switches should not be tied to any specific network protocols. (3) Target independence: Programmers should be able to describe packet-processing functionality independently of the specifics of the underlying hardware. As an example, we describe how to use P4 to configure a switch to add a new hierarchical label.","author":["Pat Bosshart","Dan Daly","Glen Gibb","Martin Izzard","Nick McKeown","Jennifer Rexford","Cole Schlesinger","Dan Talayco","Amin Vahdat","George Varghese","David Walker"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 44","Issue 3","July 2014","pp   87\u201395","https://doi.org/10.1145/2656877.2656890"],"date":"28 July 2014","ref":[{"text":"C.

The real-world applications related to digital signal processing and the like demand high-performance computation with greater accuracy. In general, digital signals are represented as a sequence of signed/unsigned fixed/floating point numbers. The final result of a MAC operation can be computed by feeding the mantissa of the previous MAC result as one of the partial products to a Wallace tree multiplier or Braun multiplier. Thus, the separate accumulation circuit can be avoided by keeping the circuit depth still within the bounds of the Wallace tree multiplier, namely O(log2 n), or Braun multiplier, namely O(n). In this article, three kinds of floating point MACs are proposed. The experimental results show 48.54% of improvement in worst path delay achieved by the proposed floating point MAC using a radix-2 Wallace structure compared with a conventional floating point MAC without a pipeline using a 45nm technology library. The same proposed design gives 39.92% of improvement in worst path delay without a pipeline using a radix-4 Braun structure as compared with a conventional design. In this article, a radix-32 Q32.32-format-based floating point MAC is proposed using a Wallace tree/Braun multiplier. Also this article discusses the msb prediction problem and its solution in floating point arithmetic that is not available in modern fused multiply-add designs. The performance results show comparisons between the proposed floating point MAC with various floating point MAC designs for radix-2,-4,-8, and -16. The proposed design has lesser depth than a conventional floating point MAC as well as a lower area requirement than other ways of floating point MAC implementation, both with/without a pipeline.","author":["Mohamed Asan Basiri M","Noor Mahammad Sk"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 20","Issue 1","November 2014","Article No.: 15","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2667224"],"date":"18 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"L.

While caching today improves read workloads, writes are either network or disk bound, as replication is used for fault-tolerance. Tachyon eliminates this bottleneck by pushing lineage, a well-known technique, into the storage layer. The key challenge in making a long-running lineage-based storage system is timely data recovery in case of failures. Tachyon addresses this issue by introducing a checkpointing algorithm that guarantees bounded recovery cost and resource allocation strategies for recomputation under commonly used resource schedulers. Our evaluation shows that Tachyon outperforms in-memory HDFS by 110x for writes. It also improves the end-to-end latency of a realistic workflow by 4x. Tachyon is open source and is deployed at multiple companies.","author":["Haoyuan Li","Ali Ghodsi","Matei Zaharia","Scott Shenker","Ion Stoica"],"issue":["SOCC '14: Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing","November 2014","Pages   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/2670979.2670985"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"Apache Cassandra. http://cassandra.apache.org/.","order":1},{"text":"Apache Hadoop. http://hadoop.apache.org/.","order":2},{"text":"Apache HBase. http://hbase.apache.org/.","order":3},{"text":"Apache Oozie. http://incubator.apache.org/oozie/.","order":4},{"text":"Apache Crunch. http://crunch.apache.org/.","order":5},{"text":"Dell. http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/servers.","order":6},{"text":"Luigi. https://github.com/spotify/luigi.","order":7},{"text":"Apache Mahout. http://mahout.apache.org/.","order":8},{"text":"L.

One method that has not yet seen widespread use is the educational campaign: large-scale, short-term events focused on a specific educational topic, such as the Hour of Code campaign. These are designed to generate media coverage and lend themselves nicely to collaborative or competitive goals, thus potentially leveraging social effects and community excitement to increase engagement and reach students who otherwise would not participate. In this article, we present a case study of three such campaigns that we ran to encourage students to play an algebra game\u2014DragonBox Adaptive: the Washington, Norway, and Minnesota Algebra Challenges. We provide several design recommendations for future campaigns based on our experience, including the effects of different incentive schemes, the insertion of \u201ctests\u201d to fast-forward students to levels of appropriate difficulty, and the strengths and weaknesses of campaigns as a method of collecting experimental data.","author":["Yun-En Liu","Christy Ballweber","Eleanor O'rourke","Eric Butler","Phonraphee Thummaphan","Zoran Popovi\u0107"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction","Volume 22","Issue 2","April 2015","Article No.: 8","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/2699760"],"date":"10 March 2015","ref":[{"text":"Erik Andersen, Yun-En Liu, Richard Snider, Roy Szeto, and Zoran Popovi\u0107. 2011.

The schema combines relational storage for adjacency information with JSON storage for vertex and edge attributes. We demonstrate that this particular schema design has benefits compared to a purely relational or purely JSON solution. The query translation mechanism translates Gremlin queries with no side effects into SQL queries so that one can leverage relational query optimizers. We also conduct an empirical evaluation of our schema design and query translation mechanism with two existing popular property graph stores. We show that our system is 2-8 times better on query performance, and 10-30 times better in throughput on 4.3 billion edge graphs compared to existing stores.","author":["Wen Sun","Achille Fokoue","Kavitha Srinivas","Anastasios Kementsietsidis","Gang Hu","Guotong Xie"],"issue":["SIGMOD '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","May 2015","Pages   1887\u20131901","https://doi.org/10.1145/2723372.2723732"],"date":"27 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"D.

The open-source implementation of MapReduce is being slowly replaced by a collection of engines dedicated to specific verticals. This has led to growing fragmentation and repeated efforts with each new vertical engine re-implementing fundamental features (e.g. fault-tolerance, security, stragglers mitigation, etc.) from scratch. In this paper, we introduce Apache Tez, an open-source framework designed to build data-flow driven processing runtimes. Tez provides a scaffolding and library components that can be used to quickly build scalable and efficient data-flow centric engines. Central to our design is fostering component re-use, without hindering customizability of the performance-critical data plane. This is in fact the key differentiator with respect to the previous generation of systems (e.g. Dryad, MapReduce) and even emerging ones (e.g. Spark), that provided and mandated a fixed data plane implementation. Furthermore, Tez provides native support to build runtime optimizations, such as dynamic partition pruning for Hive. Tez is deployed at Yahoo!, Microsoft Azure, LinkedIn and numerous Hortonworks customer sites, and a growing number of engines are being integrated with it. This confirms our intuition that most of the popular vertical engines can leverage a core set of building blocks. We complement qualitative accounts of real-world adoption with quantitative experimental evidence that Tez-based implementations of Hive, Pig, Spark, and Cascading on YARN outperform their original YARN implementation on popular benchmarks (TPC-DS, TPC-H) and production workloads.","author":["Bikas Saha","Hitesh Shah","Siddharth Seth","Gopal Vijayaraghavan","Arun Murthy","Carlo Curino"],"issue":["SIGMOD '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","May 2015","Pages   1357\u20131369","https://doi.org/10.1145/2723372.2742790"],"date":"27 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"Understanding just-in-time compilation and optimization. https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E15289_01/doc.40/e15058/underst_jit.htm.","order":1},{"text":"Apache tez project website, 2014. http://tez.apache.org.","order":2},{"text":"Cascading integration with tez project, 2014. http://www.cascading.org/2014/09/17/cascading-3-0-wip-now-supports-apache-tez.","order":3},{"text":"Cascading: Project website, 2014. http://www.cascading.org.","order":4},{"text":"Flink: apache incubator project (formerly stratosphere), 2014. http://flink.incubator.apache.org/.","order":5},{"text":"Flink integration with tez project jira, 2014. http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-972.","order":6},{"text":"Hive integration with tez project jira, 2014. http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4660.","order":7},{"text":"Pig integration with tez project jira, 2014. http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-3446.","order":8},{"text":"Presto: Distributed sql query engine for big data, 2014. http:/prestodb.io.","order":9},{"text":"What's new in the hadoop cluster versions provided by hdinsight?, 2014. http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/hdinsight-component-versioning/.","order":10},{"text":"New syncsort big data software removes major barriers to mainstream apache hadoop adoption, 2015. http://www.syncsort.com/en/About/News-Center/Press-Release/New-Syncsort-Big-Data-Software.","order":11},{"text":"A.

As typified by emerging hardware such as UC Berkeley's Firebox project and by Intel's Rack-Scale Architecture (RSA), next generation servers will have thousands of cores, large DRAM, and huge NVRAM. We analyze the characteristics of these machines and find that no existing database is appropriate. Hence, we are developing FOEDUS, an open-source, from-scratch database engine whose architecture is drastically different from traditional databases. It extends in-memory database technologies to further scale up and also allows transactions to efficiently manipulate data pages in both DRAM and NVRAM. We evaluate the performance of FOEDUS in a large NUMA machine (16 sockets and 240 physical cores) and find that FOEDUS achieves multiple orders of magnitude higher TPC-C throughput compared to H-Store with anti-caching.","author":["Hideaki Kimura"],"issue":["SIGMOD '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","May 2015","Pages   691\u2013706","https://doi.org/10.1145/2723372.2746480"],"date":"27 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"http://www8.hp.com/hpnext/posts/discover-day-two-future-now-machine-hp.","order":1},{"text":"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/performance-enhancements-7.html.","order":2},{"text":"Process integration, devices, and structures.

These new NVM devices are almost as fast as DRAM, but all writes to it are potentially persistent even after power loss. Existing DBMSs are unable to take full advantage of this technology because their internal architectures are predicated on the assumption that memory is volatile. With NVM, many of the components of legacy DBMSs are unnecessary and will degrade the performance of data intensive applications. To better understand these issues, we implemented three engines in a modular DBMS testbed that are based on different storage management architectures: (1) in-place updates, (2) copy-on-write updates, and (3) log-structured updates. We then present NVM-aware variants of these architectures that leverage the persistence and byte-addressability properties of NVM in their storage and recovery methods. Our experimental evaluation on an NVM hardware emulator shows that these engines achieve up to 5.5X higher throughput than their traditional counterparts while reducing the amount of wear due to write operations by up to 2X. We also demonstrate that our NVM-aware recovery protocols allow these engines to recover almost instantaneously after the DBMS restarts.","author":["Joy Arulraj","Andrew Pavlo","Subramanya R.

We propose to use a rich feature set to represent users, according to their web browsing history and search queries. We use a Deep Learning approach to map users and items to a latent space where the similarity between users and their preferred items is maximized. We extend the model to jointly learn from features of items from different domains and user features by introducing a multi-view Deep Learning model. We show how to make this rich-feature based user representation scalable by reducing the dimension of the inputs and the amount of training data. The rich user feature representation allows the model to learn relevant user behavior patterns and give useful recommendations for users who do not have any interaction with the service, given that they have adequate search and browsing history. The combination of different domains into a single model for learning helps improve the recommendation quality across all the domains, as well as having a more compact and a semantically richer user latent feature vector. We experiment with our approach on three real-world recommendation systems acquired from different sources of Microsoft products: Windows Apps recommendation, News recommendation, and Movie/TV recommendation. Results indicate that our approach is significantly better than the state-of-the-art algorithms (up to 49% enhancement on existing users and 115% enhancement on new users). In addition, experiments on a publicly open data set also indicate the superiority of our method in comparison with transitional generative topic models, for modeling cross-domain recommender systems. Scalability analysis show that our multi-view DNN model can easily scale to encompass millions of users and billions of item entries. Experimental results also confirm that combining features from all domains produces much better performance than building separate models for each domain.","author":["Ali Mamdouh Elkahky","Yang Song","Xiaodong He"],"issue":["WWW '15: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web","May 2015","Pages   278\u2013288","https://doi.org/10.1145/2736277.2741667"],"date":"18 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"Fabian Abel, Qi Gao, Geert-Jan Houben, and Ke Tao.

Time encoding efficiently maps a signal's amplitude information into a spike time sequence that represents the input data and offers perfect recovery for band-limited stimuli. In this article, we pattern the neural activities across multiple timescales and encode the sensory information using time-dependent temporal scales. The spike encoding methodologies for autonomous classification of time-series signatures are explored using near-chaotic reservoir computing. The proposed spiking neuron is compact, low power, and robust. A hardware implementation of these results is expected to produce an agile hardware implementation of time encoding as a signal conditioner for dynamical neural processor designs.","author":["Chenyuan Zhao","Bryant T.

While emerging memories have been considered for many architectural components such as caches, the asymmetric access properties and relatively small size of network-FIFOs compared to the required peripheral circuitry has led to few such replacements proposed for NoCs. In this paper, we propose control schemes that leverage the\\shift-register\" nature of spintronic domain-wall memory (DWM) to replace conventional memory buffers for the NoC. Our results indicate that the best shift-based scheme utilizes a dual-nanowire approach to ensure that reads and writes can be more effectively aligned with access ports for simultaneous access in the same cycle. Our approach provides a 2.93X speedup over a DWM buffer using a traditional FIFO memory control scheme with a 1.16X savings in energy. Compared to a SRAM-FIFO it exhibits an 8% message latency degradation versus a 56% energy reduction. The resulting approach achieves a 53% reduction in energy delay product compared to SRAM and a 42% reduction in energy delay product versus STT-MRAM.","author":["Donald Kline","Haifeng Xu","Rami Melhem","Alex K.

In this paper, we exploit the tolerable imprecision of such applications by designing an energy-efficient fault-mitigation scheme for unreliable data memories to meet target yield. The proposed approach uses a bit-shuffling mechanism to isolate faults into bit locations with lower significance. This skews the bit-error distribution towards the low order bits, substantially limiting the output error magnitude. By controlling the granularity of the shuffling, the proposed technique enables trading-off quality for power, area, and timing overhead. Compared to error-correction codes, this can reduce the overhead by as much as 83% in read power, 77% in read access time, and 89% in area, when applied to various data mining applications in 28nm process technology.","author":["Shrikanth Ganapathy","Georgios Karakonstantis","Adam Teman","Andreas Burg"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 102","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744871"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"\"ITRS - 2013 edition,\" 2013. {Online}.

In this paper, we introduce a valve-role-changing concept to avoid always using the same valves for peristalsis. Based on this, we generate dynamic devices from a valve-centered architecture to distribute the valve actuation activities evenly and reduce the largest number of valve actuations with even fewer valves. In addition, we propose in situ on-chip storages, which can overlap with other devices, so that less area is needed compared with dedicated storages on traditional chips. Moreover, our method provides good support for assays requiring different volumes and ratios of samples. Experiments show that compared with traditional designs, the largest number of valve actuations can be reduced by 72.97% averagely, while the number of valves is reduced by 10.62%.","author":["Tsun-Ming Tseng","Bing Li","Tsung-Yi Ho","Ulf Schlichtmann"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 141","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744899"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"P.

Necessarily, the paper also studies properties of evaluations of multi-variate GF(2) polynomials on random sets of inputs. For erasures, we prove that RM codes achieve capacity both for very high rate and very low rate regimes. For errors, we prove that RM codes achieve capacity for very low rate regimes, and for very high rates, we show that they can uniquely decode at about square root of the number of errors at capacity. The proofs of these four results are based on different techniques, which we find interesting in their own right. In particular, we study the following questions about E(m,r), the matrix whose rows are truth tables of all monomials of degree \u2264 r in m variables. What is the most (resp. least) number of random columns in E(m,r) that define a submatrix having full column rank (resp. full row rank) with high probability? We obtain tight bounds for very small (resp. very large) degrees r, which we use to show that RM codes achieve capacity for erasures in these regimes. Our decoding from random errors follows from the following novel reduction. For every linear code C of sufficiently high rate we construct a new code C' obtained by tensoring C, such that for every subset S of coordinates, if $C$ can recover from erasures in $S$, then C' can recover from errors in S. Specializing this to RM codes and using our results for erasures imply our result on unique decoding of RM codes at high rate. Finally, two of our capacity achieving results require tight bounds on the weight distribution of RM codes. We obtain such bounds extending the recent [27] bounds from constant degree to linear degree polynomials.","author":["Emmanuel Abbe","Amir Shpilka","Avi Wigderson"],"issue":["STOC '15: Proceedings of the forty-seventh annual ACM symposium on Theory of Computing","June 2015","Pages   297\u2013306","https://doi.org/10.1145/2746539.2746575"],"date":"14 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"E.

There are many domains, such as genomics, geological data and daily twitter feeds where the datasets of interest are 5TB to 20 TB. For such a dataset, one would need a cluster with 100 servers, each with 128GB to 256GBs of DRAM, to accommodate all the data in DRAM. On the other hand, such datasets could be stored easily in the flash memory of a rack-sized cluster. Flash storage has much better random access performance than hard disks, which makes it desirable for analytics workloads. In this paper we present BlueDBM, a new system architecture which has flash-based storage with in-store processing capability and a low-latency high-throughput inter-controller network. We show that BlueDBM outperforms a flash-based system without these features by a factor of 10 for some important applications. While the performance of a ram-cloud system falls sharply even if only 5%~10% of the references are to the secondary storage, this sharp performance degradation is not an issue in BlueDBM. BlueDBM presents an attractive point in the cost-performance trade-off for Big Data analytics.","author":["Sang-Woo Jun","Ming Liu","Sungjin Lee","Jamey Hicks","John Ankcorn","Myron King","Shuotao Xu","Arvind"],"issue":["ISCA '15: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2015","Pages   1\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/2749469.2750412"],"date":"13 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"N.

Proper term weighting can greatly improve retrieval accuracies, which essentially involves two types of query understanding: interpreting the query and judging the relative contribution of the terms to the query. These two steps are often dealt with separately, and complicated yet not so effective weighting strategies are proposed. In this paper, we propose to address query interpretation and term weighting in a unified framework built upon distributed representations of words from recent advances in neural network language modeling. Specifically, we represent term and query as vectors in the same latent space, construct features for terms using their word vectors and learn a model to map the features onto the defined target term weights. The proposed method is simple yet effective. Experiments using four collections and two retrieval models demonstrates significantly higher retrieval accuracies than baseline models.","author":["Guoqing Zheng","Jamie Callan"],"issue":["SIGIR '15: Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2015","Pages   575\u2013584","https://doi.org/10.1145/2766462.2767700"],"date":"09 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"M.

In particular, advances of high-resolution micro displays, low-latency orientation trackers, and modern GPUs facilitate immersive experiences at low cost. One of the remaining challenges to further improve visual comfort in VR experiences is the vergence-accommodation conflict inherent to all stereoscopic displays. Accurate reproduction of all depth cues is crucial for visual comfort. By combining well-known stereoscopic display principles with emerging factored light field technology, we present the first wearable VR display supporting high image resolution as well as focus cues. A light field is presented to each eye, which provides more natural viewing experiences than conventional near-eye displays. Since the eye box is just slightly larger than the pupil size, rank-1 light field factorizations are sufficient to produce correct or nearly-correct focus cues; no time-multiplexed image display or gaze tracking is required. We analyze lens distortions in 4D light field space and correct them using the afforded high-dimensional image formation. We also demonstrate significant improvements in resolution and retinal blur quality over related near-eye displays. Finally, we analyze diffraction limits of these types of displays.","author":["Fu-Chung Huang","Kevin Chen","Gordon Wetzstein"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 34","Issue 4","August 2015","Article No.: 60","pp   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2766922"],"date":"27 July 2015","ref":[{"text":"Akeley, K., Watt, S.

It has been shown to be a promising technique for eliminating performance bottlenecks imposed by control flow in hardware and software implementations alike. In this paper, we present techniques to incorporate speculative execution in a fine-grained manner into scheduling of control-flow intensive behavioral descriptions. We demonstrate that failing to take into account information such as resource constraints and branch probabilities can lead to significantly sub-optimal performance. We also demonstrate that it may be necessary to speculate simultaneously along multiple paths, subject to resource constraints, in order to minimize the delay overheads incurred when prediction errors occur. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that our speculative scheduling algorithm can result in significant (upto seven-fold) improvements in performance (measured in terms of the average number of clock cycles) as compared to scheduling without speculative execution. Also, the best and worst case execution times for the speculatively performed schedules are the same as or better than the corresponding values for the schedules obtained without speculative execution.","author":["Ganesh Lakshminarayana","Anand Raghunathan","Niraj K.

For example, while a user is browsing mobile phones, it might make sense to recommend other phones, but once they buy a phone, we might instead want to recommend batteries, cases, or chargers. In economics, these two types of recommendations are referred to as substitutes and complements: substitutes are products that can be purchased instead of each other, while complements are products that can be purchased in addition to each other. Such relationships are essential as they help us to identify items that are relevant to a user's search. Our goal in this paper is to learn the semantics of substitutes and complements from the text of online reviews. We treat this as a supervised learning problem, trained using networks of products derived from browsing and co-purchasing logs. Methodologically, we build topic models that are trained to automatically discover topics from product reviews that are successful at predicting and explaining such relationships. Experimentally, we evaluate our system on the Amazon product catalog, a large dataset consisting of 9 million products, 237 million links, and 144 million reviews.","author":["Julian McAuley","Rahul Pandey","Jure Leskovec"],"issue":["KDD '15: Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2015","Pages   785\u2013794","https://doi.org/10.1145/2783258.2783381"],"date":"10 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"R.

Some of the most promising techniques analyze the time-of-arrival of incoming signals, but the limited bandwidth available to most wireless transmissions fundamentally constrains their resolution. Frequency-agile wireless networks utilize bandwidths of varying sizes and locations in a wireless band to efficiently share the wireless medium between users. ToneTrack is an indoor location system that achieves sub-meter accuracy with minimal hardware and antennas, by leveraging frequency-agile wireless networks to increase the effective bandwidth. Our novel signal combination algorithm combines time-of-arrival data from different transmissions as a mobile device hops across different channels, approaching time resolutions previously not possible with a single narrowband channel. ToneTrack's novel channel combination and spectrum identification algorithms together with the triangle inequality scheme yield superior results even in non-line-of-sight scenarios with one to two walls separating client and APs and also in the case where the direct path from mobile client to an AP is completely blocked. We implement ToneTrack on the WARP hardware radio platform and use six of them served as APs to localize Wi-Fi clients in an indoor testbed over one floor of an office building. Experimental results show that ToneTrack can achieve a median 90 cm accuracy when 20 MHz bandwidth APs overhear three packets from adjacent channels.","author":["Jie Xiong","Karthikeyan Sundaresan","Kyle Jamieson"],"issue":["MobiCom '15: Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking","September 2015","Pages   537\u2013549","https://doi.org/10.1145/2789168.2790125"],"date":"07 September 2015","ref":[{"text":"A.

In this research, new attack techniques are provided, for the first time, (1) to help to discriminate between values of secret intermediate variables within HMAC and (2) to reduce the large word size complexity. Preaveraging and carry propagate techniques are proposed using chosen plaintexts and shown to significantly reduce the complexity and runtimes for side-channel analysis of an Altera FPGA platform. This research is important for advancing side channel analysis of complex embedded ASICs and ensuring secure implementations in future embedded ubiquitous devices.","author":["Catherine H.

Cloud users rely on both the provider\u2019s staff and its globally distributed software/hardware platform not to expose any of their private data.We introduce the notion of shielded execution, which protects the confidentiality and integrity of a program and its data from the platform on which it runs (i.e., the cloud operator\u2019s OS, VM, and firmware). Our prototype, Haven, is the first system to achieve shielded execution of unmodified legacy applications, including SQL Server and Apache, on a commodity OS (Windows) and commodity hardware. Haven leverages the hardware protection of Intel SGX to defend against privileged code and physical attacks such as memory probes, and also addresses the dual challenges of executing unmodified legacy binaries and protecting them from a malicious host. This work motivated recent changes in the SGX specification.","author":["Andrew Baumann","Marcus Peinado","Galen Hunt"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Computer Systems","Volume 33","Issue 3","September 2015","Article No.: 8","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/2799647"],"date":"31 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"Amazon Web Services. 2013.

Learning effective latent factors plays the most important role in collaborative filtering. Traditional CF methods based upon matrix factorization techniques learn the latent factors from the user-item ratings and suffer from the cold start problem as well as the sparsity problem. Some improved CF methods enrich the priors on the latent factors by incorporating side information as regularization. However, the learned latent factors may not be very effective due to the sparse nature of the ratings and the side information. To tackle this problem, we learn effective latent representations via deep learning. Deep learning models have emerged as very appealing in learning effective representations in many applications. In particular, we propose a general deep architecture for CF by integrating matrix factorization with deep feature learning. We provide a natural instantiations of our architecture by combining probabilistic matrix factorization with marginalized denoising stacked auto-encoders. The combined framework leads to a parsimonious fit over the latent features as indicated by its improved performance in comparison to prior state-of-art models over four large datasets for the tasks of movie/book recommendation and response prediction.","author":["Sheng Li","Jaya Kawale","Yun Fu"],"issue":["CIKM '15: Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2015","Pages   811\u2013820","https://doi.org/10.1145/2806416.2806527"],"date":"17 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"Xiaoyuan Su and Taghi M.

However, it has several well-known issues, most importantly that it does not provide forward secrecy, and that it is prone to side channel attacks that may enable an attacker to learn the session key used for a TLS session. A long history of attacks shows that RSA-PKCS#1 v1.5 is extremely difficult to implement securely. The current draft of TLS version 1.3 dispenses with this encrypted key transport method. But is this sufficient to protect against weaknesses in RSA-PKCS#1 v1.5? We describe attacks which transfer the potential weakness of prior TLS versions to two recently proposed protocols that do not even support PKCS#1 v1.5 encryption, namely Google's QUIC protocol and TLS~1.3. These attacks enable an attacker to impersonate a server by using a vulnerable TLS-RSA server implementation as a \"signing oracle\" to compute valid signatures for messages chosen by the attacker. The first attack (on TLS 1.3) requires a very fast \"Bleichenbacher-oracle\" to create the TLS CertificateVerify message before the client drops the connection. Even though this limits the practical impact of this attack, it demonstrates that simply removing a legacy algorithm from a standard is not necessarily sufficient to protect against its weaknesses. The second attack on Google's QUIC protocol is much more practical. It can also be applied in settings where forging a signature with the help of a \"Bleichenbacher-oracle\" may take an extremely long time. This is because signed values in QUIC are independent of the client's connection request. Therefore the attacker is able to pre-compute the signature long before the client starts a connection. This makes the attack practical. Moreover, the impact on QUIC is much more dramatic, because creating a single forged signature is essentially equivalent to retrieving the long-term secret key of the server.","author":["Tibor Jager","J\u00f6rg Schwenk","Juraj Somorovsky"],"issue":["CCS '15: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2015","Pages   1185\u20131196","https://doi.org/10.1145/2810103.2813657"],"date":"12 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"SSL Pulse.

Persistent memory has emerged as a promising approach to accessing emerging byte-addressable non-volatile memory through processor load/store instructions. Due to lack of commercially available NVM, system software researchers have mainly relied on emulation to model persistent memory performance. However, existing emulation approaches are either too simplistic, or too slow to emulate large-scale workloads, or require special hardware. To fill this gap and encourage wider adoption of persistent memory, we developed a performance emulator for persistent memory, called Quartz. Quartz enables an efficient emulation of a wide range of NVM latencies and bandwidth characteristics for performance evaluation of emerging byte-addressable NVMs and their impact on applications performance (without modifying or instrumenting their source code) by leveraging features available in commodity hardware. Our emulator is implemented on three latest Intel Xeon-based processor architectures: Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, and Haswell. To assist researchers and engineers in evaluating design decisions with emerging NVMs, we extend Quartz for emulating the application execution on future systems with two types of memory: fast, regular volatile DRAM and slower persistent memory. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by using a set of specially designed memory-intensive benchmarks and real applications. The accuracy of the proposed approach is validated by running these programs both on our emulation platform and a multisocket (NUMA) machine that can support a range of memory latencies. We show that Quartz can emulate a range of performance characteristics with low overhead and good accuracy (with emulation errors 0.2% - 9%).","author":["Haris Volos","Guilherme Magalhaes","Ludmila Cherkasova","Jun Li"],"issue":["Middleware '15: Proceedings of the 16th Annual Middleware Conference","November 2015","Pages   37\u201349","https://doi.org/10.1145/2814576.2814806"],"date":"24 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"Graph500. http://www.graph500.org/.","order":1},{"text":"Intel 64 and ia-32 architectures optimization reference manual. http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf.","order":2},{"text":"Intel Architecture Instruction Set Extensions Programming Reference. https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/0d/53/319433-022.pdf.","order":3},{"text":"Intel Memory Latency Checker. https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intelr-memory-latency-checker.","order":4},{"text":"Intel Memory Latency Checker v2.0 released. https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/topic/517571.","order":5},{"text":"Intel xeon e5-product family. http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/xeon-e5-1600-2600-vol-2-datasheet.pdf.","order":6},{"text":"Intel Xeon Processor E5-1600/2400/2600/4600 (E5-Product Family.) http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/xeon-e5-1600-2600-vol-2-datasheet.pdf.","order":7},{"text":"numactl - Control NUMA policy for processes or shared memory. http://linux.die.net/man/8/numactl/.","order":8},{"text":"PAPI: Performance application programming interface. http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/.","order":9},{"text":"PCMSIM: A simple PCM block device simulator for linux. https://code.google.com/p/pcmsim/.","order":10},{"text":"perf: Linux profiling with performance counters. https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page.","order":11},{"text":"pmem.io: Persistent memory programming. http://pmem.io/.","order":12},{"text":"SNIA NVM programming technical work group. http://www.snia.org/forums/sssi/nvmp.","order":13},{"text":"STREAM benchmark: http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/.","order":14},{"text":"Why Intel Added the CLWB and PCOMMIT Instructions. http://danluu.com/clwb-pcommit/.","order":15},{"text":"With The Machine, HP May Have Invented a New Kind of Computer. http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-06-11/with-the-machine-hp-may-have-invented-a-new-kind-of-computer.","order":16},{"text":"K.

However, previous implementations performed poorly. This forced system designers to avoid transactions completely, to weaken consistency guarantees, or to provide single-machine transactions that require programmers to partition their data. In this paper, we show that there is no need to compromise in modern data centers. We show that a main memory distributed computing platform called FaRM can provide distributed transactions with strict serializability, high performance, durability, and high availability. FaRM achieves a peak throughput of 140 million TATP transactions per second on 90 machines with a 4.9 TB database, and it recovers from a failure in less than 50 ms. Key to achieving these results was the design of new transaction, replication, and recovery protocols from first principles to leverage commodity networks with RDMA and a new, inexpensive approach to providing non-volatile DRAM.","author":["Aleksandar Dragojevi\u0107","Dushyanth Narayanan","Edmund B.

However, personalization of search results has led to worries about the Filter Bubble Effect, where the personalization algorithm decides that some useful information is irrelevant to the user, and thus prevents them from locating it. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to explore the impact of location-based personalization on Google Search results. Assessing the relationship between location and personalization is crucial, since users' geolocation can be used as a proxy for other demographic traits, like race, income, educational attainment, and political affiliation. In other words, does location-based personalization trap users in geolocal Filter Bubbles? Using our methodology, we collected 30 days of search results from Google Search in response to 240 different queries. By comparing search results gathered from 59 GPS coordinates around the US at three different granularities (county, state, and national), we are able to observe that differences in search results due to personalization grow as physical distance increases. However these differences are highly dependent on what a user searches for: queries for local establishments receive 4-5 different results per page, while more general terms exhibit essentially no personalization.","author":["Chloe Kliman-Silver","Aniko Hannak","David Lazer","Christo Wilson","Alan Mislove"],"issue":["IMC '15: Proceedings of the 2015 Internet Measurement Conference","October 2015","Pages   121\u2013127","https://doi.org/10.1145/2815675.2815714"],"date":"28 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"Alexa Top 500 Global Sites. http://www.alexa.com/topsites.","order":1},{"text":"J.

These accesses have little temporal or spatial locality, and thus incur long memory stalls and large bandwidth requirements. A traditional streaming or striding prefetcher cannot capture these irregular access patterns. A majority of these irregular accesses come from indirect patterns of the form A[B[i]]. We propose an efficient hardware indirect memory prefetcher (IMP) to capture this access pattern and hide latency. We also propose a partial cacheline accessing mechanism for these prefetches to reduce the network and DRAM bandwidth pressure from the lack of spatial locality. Evaluated on 7 applications, IMP shows 56% speedup on average (up to 2.3\u00d7) compared to a baseline 64 core system with streaming prefetchers. This is within 23% of an idealized system. With partial cacheline accessing, we see another 9.4% speedup on average (up to 46.6%).","author":["Xiangyao Yu","Christopher J.

However, it is an NP-hard problem that requires unacceptably long runtimes when using sequential CPU-based heuristics. We show how to parallelize the key steps of bitwidth optimization on the GPU by performing a fast brute-force search over a carefully constrained search space. We develop a high-level synthesis methodology suitable for rapid prototyping of bitwidth-annotated RTL code generation using gcc's GIMPLE backend. For range analysis, we perform parallel evaluation of sub-intervals to provide tighter bounds compared to ordinary interval arithmetic. For bitwidth allocation, we enumerate the different bitwidth combinations in parallel by assigning each combination to a GPU thread. We demonstrate up to 10?1000x speedups for range analysis and 50?200x speedups for bitwidth allocation when comparing NVIDIA K20 GPU implementation to an Intel Core i5-4570 CPU while maintaining identical solution quality across various benchmarks. This allows us to generate tailor-made RTL with minimum bitwidths in hundreds of milliseconds instead of hundreds of minutes when starting from high-level C descriptions of dataflow computations.","author":["Nachiket Kapre","Deheng Ye"],"issue":["FPGA '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2016","Pages   185\u2013194","https://doi.org/10.1145/2847263.2847266"],"date":"21 February 2016","ref":[{"text":"D.

However, the large register file introduces high power consumption, flowing to high leakage power SRAM cells. Emerging non-volatile STT-RAM memory has recently been studied as a potential replacement to alleviate the leakage challenge when constructing register files on GPUs. Unfortunately, due to the long write latency and high energy consumption associated with write operations in STT-RAM, simply replacing SRAM with STTRAM for register files would incur non-trivial performance overhead and only bring marginal energy benefits. In this paper, we propose to optimize STT-RAM based GPU register files for better energy-efficiency and performance via two techniques. First, we employ a light-weight compression framework with awareness of register value similarity. It is coupled with a group-based write driver control to mitigate the high energy overhead caused by STT-RAM writes. Second, to address the long write latency overhead of STT-RAM, we propose a centralized SRAM-based write buffer design to efficiently absorb STT-RAM writes with better buffer utilization, rather than the conventional design with distributed per-bank based write buffers. The experimental results show that our STT-RAM based register file design consumes only 37.4% energy over the SRAM baseline, while incurring only negligible performance degradation.","author":["Hang Zhang","Xuhao Chen","Nong Xiao","Fang Liu"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 119","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2897989"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"\"Top500 Supercomputers List,\" 2015. {Online}.

To run at line rate, these data-plane algorithms must be implemented in hardware. With today's switch hardware, algorithms cannot be changed, nor new algorithms installed, after a switch has been built. This paper shows how to program data-plane algorithms in a high-level language and compile those programs into low-level microcode that can run on emerging programmable line-rate switching chips. The key challenge is that many data-plane algorithms create and modify algorithmic state. To achieve line-rate programmability for stateful algorithms, we introduce the notion of a packet transaction: a sequential packet-processing code block that is atomic and isolated from other such code blocks. We have developed this idea in Domino, a C-like imperative language to express data-plane algorithms. We show with many examples that Domino provides a convenient way to express sophisticated data-plane algorithms, and show that these algorithms can be run at line rate with modest estimated chip-area overhead.","author":["Anirudh Sivaraman","Alvin Cheung","Mihai Budiu","Changhoon Kim","Mohammad Alizadeh","Hari Balakrishnan","George Varghese","Nick McKeown","Steve Licking"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGCOMM Conference","August 2016","Pages   15\u201328","https://doi.org/10.1145/2934872.2934900"],"date":"22 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"100G Data Planes, DP 6440, DP 6430 | Corsa Technology. http://www.corsa.com/products/dp6440/.","order":1},{"text":"Arista - Arista 7050 Series. https://www.arista.com/en/products/7050-series.","order":2},{"text":"Barefoot: The World's Fastest and Most Programmable Networks. https://barefootnetworks.com/media/white_papers/Barefoot-Worlds-Fastest-Most-Programmable-Networks.pdf.","order":3},{"text":"Cisco Nexus Family. http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/cisco_nexus_family.html.","order":4},{"text":"Components of Linux Traffic Control. http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Traffic-Control-HOWTO/components.html.","order":5},{"text":"Dell Force10. http://www.force10networks.com/.","order":6},{"text":"Design Compiler - Synopsys. http://www.synopsys.com/Tools/Implementation/RTLSynthesis/DesignCompiler/Pages/default.aspx.","order":7},{"text":"DPDK: Data Plane Development Kit. http://dpdk.org/.","order":8},{"text":"Flowlet Switching in P4. https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials/tree/master/SIGCOMM_2015/flowlet_switching.","order":9},{"text":"High Capacity StrataXGSTrident II Ethernet Switch Series. http://www.broadcom.com/products/Switching/Data-Center/BCM56850-Series.","order":10},{"text":"High-Density 25/100 Gigabit Ethernet StrataXGS Tomahawk Ethernet Switch Series. http://www.broadcom.com/products/Switching/Data-Center/BCM56960-Series.","order":11},{"text":"Intel Enhances Network Processor Family with New Software Tools and Expanded Performance. http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2001/20010220net.htm.","order":12},{"text":"Intel FlexPipe. http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-briefs/ethernet-switch-fm6000-series-brief.pdf.","order":13},{"text":"IXP4XX Product Line of Network Processors. http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/intelligent-systems/previous-generation/intel-ixp4xx-intel-network-processor-product-line.html.","order":14},{"text":"LLVM Language Reference Manual - LLVM 3.8 documentation. http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#abstract.","order":15},{"text":"Mellanox Products: SwitchX-2 Ethernet Optimized for SDN. http://www.mellanox.com/page/products_dyn?product_family=146&mtag=switchx_2_en.","order":16},{"text":"Sampled NetFlow. http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/12_0s/feature/guide/12s_sanf.html.","order":17},{"text":"Three-address code. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-address_code.","order":18},{"text":"XPliant Ethernet Switch Product Family. http://www.cavium.com/XPliant-Ethernet-Switch-Product-Family.html.","order":19},{"text":"A.

This imposes challenges when panorama clips are consumed in virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMD). The reason is that the HMDs typically require high spatial and temporal fidelity contents and strict low-latency in order to guarantee the user's sense of presence while using them. In order to alleviate the problem, we propose to store two versions of the same video content at different resolutions, each divided into multiple tiles using the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard. According to the user's present viewport, a set of tiles is transmitted in the highest captured resolution, while the remaining parts are transmitted from the low-resolution version of the same content. In order to enable randomly choosing different combinations, the tile sets are encoded to be independently decodable. We further study the trade-off in the choice of tiling scheme and its impact on compression and streaming bitrate performances. The results indicate streaming bitrate saving from 30% to 40%, depending on the selected tiling scheme, when compared to streaming the entire video content.","author":["Alireza Zare","Alireza Aminlou","Miska M.

We use a combination of deep and shallow, fully convolutional networks to predict the density map for a given crowd image. Such a combination is used for effectively capturing both the high-level semantic information (face/body detectors) and the low-level features (blob detectors), that are necessary for crowd counting under large scale variations. As most crowd datasets have limited training samples (<100 images) and deep learning based approaches require large amounts of training data, we perform multi-scale data augmentation. Augmenting the training samples in such a manner helps in guiding the CNN to learn scale invariant representations. Our method is tested on the challenging UCF_CC_50 dataset, and shown to outperform the state of the art methods.","author":["Lokesh Boominathan","Srinivas S S Kruthiventi","R.

In this work, we propose a hardware acceleration methodology based on the polyhedral model and implement the related framework to automatically accelerate ISLs on a multi-FPGA system. The experimental evaluation shows that the throughput obtained by our solution scales linearly with the amount of resources used on the FPGAs, the power efficiency increases proportionally to the amount of instantiated computation, and outperforms the power efficiency figure of state of the art ISL implementations running on an Intel Xeon CPU by at most 10x. A key aspect of this approach is also that no knowledge of the underlying architecture is requested to the application designer, as no code refactoring is needed to make the application suitable to be processed by our framework.","author":["Giuseppe Natale","Giulio Stramondo","Pietro Bressana","Riccardo Cattaneo","Donatella Sciuto","Marco D.

The protocol has very minimal computation and communication; for Boolean circuits, each party sends only a single bit for every AND gate (and nothing is sent for XOR gates). Our protocol is (simulation-based) secure in the presence of semi-honest adversaries, and achieves privacy in the client/server model in the presence of malicious adversaries. On a cluster of three 20-core servers with a 10Gbps connection, the implementation of our protocol carries out over 1.3 million AES computations per second, which involves processing over 7 billion gates per second. In addition, we developed a Kerberos extension that replaces the ticket-granting-ticket encryption on the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT-Kerberos with our protocol, using keys/ passwords that are shared between the servers. This enables the use of Kerberos while protecting passwords. Our implementation is able to support a login storm of over 35,000 logins per second, which suffices even for very large organizations. Our work demonstrates that high-throughput secure computation is possible on standard hardware.","author":["Toshinori Araki","Jun Furukawa","Yehuda Lindell","Ariel Nof","Kazuma Ohara"],"issue":["CCS '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2016","Pages   805\u2013817","https://doi.org/10.1145/2976749.2978331"],"date":"24 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"G.

Recently a serious eavesdropping attack, which exploits the CSI feedback of the FDD system, is discovered in MU-MIMO networks. In this paper, we firstly show a similar eavesdropping attack for the TDD system is also possible by proposing a novel, feasible attack approach. Following it, a malicious user can eavesdrop on other users' downloads by transforming training sequences. To prevent this attack, we propose a secure CSI estimation scheme for instantaneous CSI. Furthermore, we extend this scheme to achieve adaptive security when CSI is relatively statistical. We have implemented our scheme for both uplink and downlink of MU-MIMO and performed a series of experiments. Results show that our secure CSI estimation scheme is highly effective in preventing downlink leakage against malicious users.","author":["Yunlong Mao","Yuan Zhang","Sheng Zhong"],"issue":["CCS '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2016","Pages   1580\u20131590","https://doi.org/10.1145/2976749.2978412"],"date":"24 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"Gnu radio. http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki, 2016.","order":1},{"text":"Usrp. https://www.ettus.com/, 2016.","order":2},{"text":"R.

Therefore, word segmentation (WS) is usually the first process that is implemented in the machine translation process. WS in the source and target languages is based on different training corpora, and WS approaches may not be the same. Therefore, the WS that results in these two languages are not often homologous, and thus word alignment results in many 1-n and n-1 alignment pairs in statistical machine translation, which degrades the performance of machine translation. In this article, we will adjust the WS for both Chinese and Vietnamese in particular and for isolated language pairs in general and make the word boundary of the two languages more symmetric in order to strengthen 1-1 alignments and enhance machine translation performance. We have tested this method on the Computational Linguistics Center\u2019s corpus, which consists of 35,623 sentence pairs. The experimental results show that our method has significantly improved the performance of machine translation compared to the baseline translation system, WS translation system, and anchor language-based WS translation systems.","author":["Phuoc Tran","Dien Dinh","Long H.

Convolution in CNNs involves three-dimensional multiply and accumulate (MAC) operations with four levels of loops, which results in a large design space. Prior works either employ limited loop optimization techniques, e.g. loop unrolling, tiling and interchange, or only tune some of the design variables after the accelerator architecture and dataflow are already fixed. Without fully studying the convolution loop optimization before the hardware design phase, the resulting accelerator can hardly exploit the data reuse and manage data movement efficiently. This work overcomes these barriers by quantitatively analyzing and optimizing the design objectives (e.g. required memory access) of the CNN accelerator based on multiple design variables. We systematically explore the trade-offs of hardware cost by searching the design variable configurations, and propose a specific dataflow of hardware CNN acceleration to minimize the memory access and data movement while maximizing the resource utilization to achieve high performance. The proposed CNN acceleration scheme and architecture are demonstrated on a standalone Altera Arria 10 GX 1150 FPGA by implementing end-to-end VGG-16 CNN model and achieved 645.25 GOPS of throughput and 47.97 ms of latency, which is a >3.2\u00d7 enhancement compared to state-of-the-art FPGA implementations of VGG model.","author":["Yufei Ma","Yu Cao","Sarma Vrudhula","Jae-sun Seo"],"issue":["FPGA '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2017","Pages   45\u201354","https://doi.org/10.1145/3020078.3021736"],"date":"22 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"O.

However, graphs are not the primary representation choice for storing most data today, and in order to have access to these analyses, users are forced to manually extract data from their data stores, construct the requisite graphs, and then load them into some graph engine in order to execute their graph analysis task. Moreover, in many cases (especially when the graphs are dense), these graphs can be significantly larger than the initial input stored in the database, making it infeasible to construct or analyze such graphs in memory. In this paper we address both of these challenges by building a system that enables users to declaratively specify graph extraction tasks over a relational database schema and then execute graph algorithms on the extracted graphs. We propose a declarative domain specific language for this purpose, and pair it up with a novel condensed, in-memory representation that significantly reduces the memory footprint of these graphs, permitting analysis of larger-than-memory graphs. We present a general algorithm for creating such a condensed representation for a large class of graph extraction queries against arbitrary schemas. We observe that the condensed representation suffers from a duplication issue, that results in inaccuracies for most graph algorithms. We then present a suite of in-memory representations that handle this duplication in different ways and allow trading off the memory required and the computational cost for executing different graph algorithms. We also introduce several novel deduplication algorithms for removing this duplication in the graph, which are of independent interest for graph compression, and provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation over several real-world and synthetic datasets illustrating these trade-offs.","author":["Konstantinos Xirogiannopoulos","Amol Deshpande"],"issue":["SIGMOD '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data","May 2017","Pages   897\u2013912","https://doi.org/10.1145/3035918.3035949"],"date":"09 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"C.

However, scaling these accelerators for higher performance with increasingly larger NNs exacerbates the cost and energy overheads of their memory systems, including the on-chip SRAM buffers and the off-chip DRAM channels. This paper presents the hardware architecture and software scheduling and partitioning techniques for TETRIS, a scalable NN accelerator using 3D memory. First, we show that the high throughput and low energy characteristics of 3D memory allow us to rebalance the NN accelerator design, using more area for processing elements and less area for SRAM buffers. Second, we move portions of the NN computations close to the DRAM banks to decrease bandwidth pressure and increase performance and energy efficiency. Third, we show that despite the use of small SRAM buffers, the presence of 3D memory simplifies dataflow scheduling for NN computations. We present an analytical scheduling scheme that matches the efficiency of schedules derived through exhaustive search. Finally, we develop a hybrid partitioning scheme that parallelizes the NN computations over multiple accelerators. Overall, we show that TETRIS improves mthe performance by 4.1x and reduces the energy by 1.5x over NN accelerators with conventional, low-power DRAM memory systems.","author":["Mingyu Gao","Jing Pu","Xuan Yang","Mark Horowitz","Christos Kozyrakis"],"issue":["ASPLOS '17: Proceedings of the Twenty-Second International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","April 2017","Pages   751\u2013764","https://doi.org/10.1145/3037697.3037702"],"date":"04 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"M.

Stochastic Computing (SC), as an alternate to the conventional binary computing paradigm, has the potential to enable massively parallel and highly scalable hardware implementations of DCNNs. In this paper, we design and optimize the SC based Softmax Regression function. Experiment results show that compared with a binary SR, the proposed SC-SR under longer bit stream can reach the same level of accuracy with the improvement of 295X, 62X, 2617X in terms of power, area and energy, respectively. Binary SR is suggested for future DCNNs with short bit stream length input whereas SC-SR is recommended for longer bit stream.","author":["Zihao Yuan","Ji Li","Zhe Li","Caiwen Ding","Ao Ren","Bo Yuan","Qinru Qiu","Jeffrey Draper","Yanzhi Wang"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '17: Proceedings of the on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI 2017","May 2017","Pages   467\u2013470","https://doi.org/10.1145/3060403.3060467"],"date":"10 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"Y.

However, the limited size of crossbars and heavy routing congestion impede the NCS implementation of large neural networks. In this paper, we propose a two-step framework (namely, group scissor) to scale NCS designs to large neural networks. The first step rank clipping integrates low-rank approximation into the training to reduce total crossbar area. The second step is group connection deletion, which structurally prunes connections to reduce routing congestion between crossbars. Tested on convolutional neural networks of LeNet on MNIST database and ConvNet on CIFAR-10 database, our experiments show significant reduction of crossbar and routing area in NCS designs. Without accuracy loss, rank clipping reduces the total crossbar area to 13.62% or 51.81% in the NCS design of LeNet or ConvNet, respectively. The following group connection deletion further decreases the routing area of LeNet or ConvNet to 8.1% or 52.06%, respectively.","author":["Yandan Wang","Wei Wen","Beiye Liu","Donald Chiarulli","Hai (Helen) Li"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 85","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062256"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

This network of billions of devices generates and exchanges huge amount of data. The limited cache capacity and memory bandwidth make transferring and processing such data on traditional CPUs and GPUs highly inefficient, both in terms of energy consumption and delay. However, many IoT applications are statistical at heart and can accept a part of inaccuracy in their computation. This enables the designers to reduce complexity of processing by approximating the results for a desired accuracy. In this paper, we propose an ultra-efficient approximate processing in-memory architecture, called APIM, which exploits the analog characteristics of non-volatile memories to support addition and multiplication inside the crossbar memory, while storing the data. The proposed design eliminates the overhead involved in transferring data to processor by virtually bringing the processor inside memory. APIM dynamically configures the precision of computation for each application in order to tune the level of accuracy during runtime. Our experimental evaluation running six general OpenCL applications shows that the proposed design achieves up to 20x performance improvement and provides 480x improvement in energy-delay product, ensuring acceptable quality of service. In exact mode, it achieves 28x energy savings and 4.8x speed up compared to the state-of-the-art GPU cores.","author":["Mohsen Imani","Saransh Gupta","Tajana Rosing"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 6","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062337"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"J.

The variability of input power in energy-harvesting systems limits the effectiveness of static optimizations aimed at maximizing the input-energy-to-computation ratio. We show that the resultant gap between available and exploitable energy is significant, and that energy storage optimizations alone do not significantly close the gap. We characterize these effects on a real, fabricated energy-harvesting system based on a nonvolatile processor. We introduce a unified energy-oriented approach to first optimize the number of backups, by more aggressively using the stored energy available when power failure occurs, and then optimize forward progress via improving the rate of input energy to computation via dynamic voltage and frequency scaling and self-learning techniques. We evaluate combining these schemes and show capture of up to 75.5% of all input energy toward processor computation, an average of 1.54 \u00d7 increase over the best static \u201cForward Progress\u201d baseline system. Notably, our energy-optimizing policy combinations simultaneously improve both the rate of forward progress and the rate of backup events (by up to 60.7% and 79.2% for RF power, respectively, and up to 231.2% and reduced to zero, respectively, for solar power). This contrasts with static frequency optimization approaches in which these two metrics are antagonistic.","author":["Kaisheng Ma","Xueqing Li","Huichu Liu","Xiao Sheng","Yiqun Wang","Karthik Swaminathan","Yongpan Liu","Yuan Xie","John Sampson","Vijaykrishnan Narayanan"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 16","Issue 4","September 2017","Article No.: 107","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077575"],"date":"11 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"S.

Prior work has studied and exploited several forms of variation, such as manufacturing-process- or temperature-induced variation. We empirically demonstrate a new form of variation that exists within a real DRAM chip, induced by the design and placement of different components in the DRAM chip: different regions in DRAM, based on their relative distances from the peripheral structures, require different minimum access latencies for reliable operation. In particular, we show that in most real DRAM chips, cells closer to the peripheral structures can be accessed much faster than cells that are farther. We call this phenomenon design-induced variation in DRAM. Our goals are to i) understand design-induced variation that exists in real, state-of-the-art DRAM chips, ii) exploit it to develop low-cost mechanisms that can dynamically find and use the lowest latency at which to operate a DRAM chip reliably, and, thus, iii) improve overall system performance while ensuring reliable system operation. To this end, we first experimentally demonstrate and analyze designed-induced variation in modern DRAM devices by testing and characterizing 96 DIMMs (768 DRAM chips). Our experimental study shows that i) modern DRAM chips exhibit design-induced latency variation in both row and column directions, ii) access latency gradually increases in the row direction within a DRAM cell array (mat) and this pattern repeats in every mat, and iii) some columns require higher latency than others due to the internal hierarchical organization of the DRAM chip. Our characterization identifies DRAM regions that are vulnerable to errors, if operated at lower latency, and finds consistency in their locations across a given DRAM chip generation, due to design-induced variation. Variations in the vertical and horizontal dimensions, together, divide the cell array into heterogeneous-latency regions, where cells in some regions require longer access latencies for reliable operation. Reducing the latency uniformly across all regions in DRAM would improve performance, but can introduce failures in the inherently slower regions that require longer access latencies for correct operation. We refer to these inherently slower regions of DRAM as design-induced vulnerable regions. Based on our extensive experimental analysis, we develop two mechanisms that reliably reduce DRAM latency. First, DIVI Profiling uses runtime profiling to dynamically identify the lowest DRAM latency that does not introduce failures. DIVA Profiling exploits design-induced variation and periodically profiles only the vulnerable regions to determine the lowest DRAM latency at low cost. It is the first mechanism to dynamically determine the lowest latency that can be used to operate DRAM reliably. DIVA Profiling reduces the latency of read/write requests by 35.1%/57.8%, respectively, at 55C. Our second mechanism, DIVA Shuffling, shuffles data such that values stored in vulnerable regions are mapped to multiple error-correcting code (ECC) codewords. As a result, DIVA Shuffling can correct 26% more multi-bit errors than conventional ECC. Combined together, our two mechanisms reduce read/write latency by 40.0%/60.5%, which translates to an overall system performance improvement of 14.7%/13.7%/13.8% (in 2-/4-/8-core systems) over a variety of workloads, while ensuring reliable operation.","author":["Donghyuk Lee","Samira Khan","Lavanya Subramanian","Saugata Ghose","Rachata Ausavarungnirun","Gennady Pekhimenko","Vivek Seshadri","Onur Mutlu"],"issue":["SIGMETRICS '17 Abstracts: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGMETRICS / International Conference on Measurement and Modeling of Computer Systems","June 2017","Pages   54","https://doi.org/10.1145/3078505.3078533"],"date":"05 June 2017"},{"_id":"10.1145/3089801.3089805","title":"RSTensorFlow: GPU Enabled TensorFlow for Deep Learning on Commodity Android Devices","abstract":"Mobile devices have become an essential part of our daily lives. By virtue of both their increasing computing power and the recent progress made in AI, mobile devices evolved to act as intelligent assistants in many tasks rather than a mere way of making phone calls. However, popular and commonly used tools and frameworks for machine intelligence are still lacking the ability to make proper use of the available heterogeneous computing resources on mobile devices. In this paper, we study the benefits of utilizing the heterogeneous (CPU and GPU) computing resources available on commodity android devices while running deep learning models. We leveraged the heterogeneous computing framework RenderScript to accelerate the execution of deep learning models on commodity Android devices. Our system is implemented as an extension to the popular open source framework TensorFlow. By integrating our acceleration framework tightly into TensorFlow, machine learning engineers can now easily make benefit of the heterogeneous computing resources on mobile devices without the need of any extra tools. We evaluate our system on different android phones models to study the trade-offs of running different neural network operations on the GPU. We also compare the performance of running different models architectures such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks on CPU only vs using heterogeneous computing resources. Our result shows that although GPUs on the phones are capable of offering substantial performance gain in matrix multiplication on mobile devices. Therefore, models that involve multiplication of large matrices can run much faster (approx. 3 times faster in our experiments) due to GPU support.","author":["Moustafa Alzantot","Yingnan Wang","Zhengshuang Ren","Mani B.

Currently, executing the software-based DCNNs requires high-performance servers, restricting the widespread deployment on embedded and mobile IoT devices. To overcome this obstacle, considerable research efforts have been made to develop highly-parallel and specialized DCNN accelerators using GPGPUs, FPGAs or ASICs.Stochastic Computing (SC), which uses a bit-stream to represent a number within [-1, 1] by counting the number of ones in the bit-stream, has high potential for implementing DCNNs with high scalability and ultra-low hardware footprint. Since multiplications and additions can be calculated using AND gates and multiplexers in SC, significant reductions in power (energy) and hardware footprint can be achieved compared to the conventional binary arithmetic implementations. The tremendous savings in power (energy) and hardware resources allow immense design space for enhancing scalability and robustness for hardware DCNNs.This paper presents SC-DCNN, the first comprehensive design and optimization framework of SC-based DCNNs, using a bottom-up approach. We first present the designs of function blocks that perform the basic operations in DCNN, including inner product, pooling, and activation function. Then we propose four designs of feature extraction blocks, which are in charge of extracting features from input feature maps, by connecting different basic function blocks with joint optimization. Moreover, the efficient weight storage methods are proposed to reduce the area and power (energy) consumption. Putting all together, with feature extraction blocks carefully selected, SC-DCNN is holistically optimized to minimize area and power (energy) consumption while maintaining high network accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the LeNet5 implemented in SC-DCNN consumes only 17 mm2 area and 1.53 W power, achieves throughput of 781250 images/s, area efficiency of 45946 images/s/mm2, and energy efficiency of 510734 images/J.","author":["Ao Ren","Zhe Li","Caiwen Ding","Qinru Qiu","Yanzhi Wang","Ji Li","Xuehai Qian","Bo Yuan"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 52","Issue 4","April 2017","pp   405\u2013418","https://doi.org/10.1145/3093336.3037746"],"date":"04 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"Stanford cs class, cs231n: Convolutional neural networks for visual recognition, 2016.

This becomes particularly challenging when data changes over time and fresh models need to be produced continuously. Unfortunately, such orchestration is often done ad hoc using glue code and custom scripts developed by individual teams for specific use cases, leading to duplicated effort and fragile systems with high technical debt. We present TensorFlow Extended (TFX), a TensorFlow-based general-purpose machine learning platform implemented at Google. By integrating the aforementioned components into one platform, we were able to standardize the components, simplify the platform configuration, and reduce the time to production from the order of months to weeks, while providing platform stability that minimizes disruptions. We present the case study of one deployment of TFX in the Google Play app store, where the machine learning models are refreshed continuously as new data arrive. Deploying TFX led to reduced custom code, faster experiment cycles, and a 2% increase in app installs resulting from improved data and model analysis.","author":["Denis Baylor","Eric Breck","Heng-Tze Cheng","Noah Fiedel","Chuan Yu Foo","Zakaria Haque","Salem Haykal","Mustafa Ispir","Vihan Jain","Levent Koc","Chiu Yuen Koo","Lukasz Lew","Clemens Mewald","Akshay Naresh Modi","Neoklis Polyzotis","Sukriti Ramesh","Sudip Roy","Steven Euijong Whang","Martin Wicke","Jarek Wilkiewicz","Xin Zhang","Martin Zinkevich"],"issue":["KDD '17: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2017","Pages   1387\u20131395","https://doi.org/10.1145/3097983.3098021"],"date":"13 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, Manjunath Kudlur, Josh Levenberg, Rajat Monga, Sherry Moore, Derek Gordon Murray, Benoit Steiner, Paul A.

Among them, POI (point of interest) recommendation is extremely practical but challenging: it greatly benefits both users and businesses in real-world life, but it is hard due to data scarcity and various context. While a number of algorithms attempt to tackle the problem w.r.t. specific data and problem settings, they often fail when the scenarios change. In this work, we propose to devise a general and principled SSL (semi-supervised learning) framework, to alleviate data scarcity via smoothing among neighboring users and POIs, and treat various context by regularizing user preference based on context graphs. To enable such a framework, we develop PACE (Preference And Context Embedding), a deep neural architecture that jointly learns the embeddings of users and POIs to predict both user preference over POIs and various context associated with users and POIs. We show that PACE successfully bridges CF (collaborative filtering) and SSL by generalizing the de facto methods matrix factorization of CF and graph Laplacian regularization of SSL. Extensive experiments on two real location-based social network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PACE.","author":["Carl Yang","Lanxiao Bai","Chao Zhang","Quan Yuan","Jiawei Han"],"issue":["KDD '17: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2017","Pages   1245\u20131254","https://doi.org/10.1145/3097983.3098094"],"date":"04 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Mikhail Belkin, Partha Niyogi, and Vikas Sindhwani 2006.

Translating embedding methods regard relations as the translation from head entities to tail entities, which achieve the state-of-the-art results among knowledge graph embedding methods. However, a major limitation of these methods is the time consuming training process, which may take several days or even weeks for large knowledge graphs, and result in great difficulty in practical applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient parallel framework for translating embedding methods, called ParTrans-X, which enables the methods to be paralleled without locks by utilizing the distinguished structures of knowledge graphs. Experiments on two datasets with three typical translating embedding methods, i.e., TransE [3], TransH [19], and a more efficient variant TransE- AdaGrad [11] validate that ParTrans-X can speed up the training process by more than an order of magnitude.","author":["Denghui Zhang","Manling Li","Yantao Jia","Yuanzhuo Wang","Xueqi Cheng"],"issue":["WI '17: Proceedings of the International Conference on Web Intelligence","August 2017","Pages   460\u2013468","https://doi.org/10.1145/3106426.3106447"],"date":"23 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen, Craig Citro, Greg S Corrado, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, and others. 2016.

The work includes three parts. First, a block grouping approach is proposed to classify the flash blocks based on their reliability. Second, based on the grouping approach, a read data placement scheme is proposed, which is designed to place read-hot data on flash blocks with high reliability. However, simply placing read-hot data to high reliable blocks conflicts with recent PV-aware wear leveling schemes. In the third part of the work, a grouping partition scheme is proposed to limit the number of high reliable blocks for read-hot data. In this case, read performance can be well improved with little impact on the lifetime improvement.","author":["Qiao Li","Liang Shi","Yejia Di","Yajuan Du","Kaijie Wu","Chun Jason Xue","Qingfeng Zhuge","Edwin H.-M.

Instead, to make better decisions, one must understand the power consumed by each module in the system. In this work, we combine measurements of register-level switching activity and system-level power to build an adaptive online model that produces live breakdowns of power consumption within the design. Online model refinement avoids time-consuming characterization while also allowing the model to track long-term operating condition changes. Central to our method is an automated flow that selects signals predicted to be indicative of high power consumption, instrumenting them for monitoring. We named this technique KAPow, for \u2018K\u2019ounting Activity for Power estimation, which we show to be accurate and to have low overheads across a range of representative benchmarks. We also propose a strategy allowing for the identification and subsequent elimination of counters found to be of low significance at runtime, reducing algorithmic complexity without sacrificing significant accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate an application example in which a module-level power breakdown can be used to determine an efficient mapping of tasks to modules and reduce system-wide power consumption by up to 7%.","author":["James J.

Generated focus cues are valid over a large depth range since laser beams are shaped for a large depth of field (DOF). Pupil-tracked light field generation significantly reduces the needed information/computation load. Also, it provides \"dynamic eye-box\" which can be a break-through that overcome the drawbacks of retinal projection-type displays. For implementation, we utilized a holographic optical element (HOE) as an image combiner, which allowed high transparency with a thin structure. Compared with current augmented reality displays, the proposed system shows competitive performances of a large field of view (FOV), high transparency, high contrast, high resolution, as well as focus cues in a large depth range. Two prototypes are presented along with experimental results and assessments. Analysis on the DOF of light rays and validity of focus cue generation are presented as well. Combination of pupil tracking and advanced near-eye display technique opens new possibilities of the future augmented reality.","author":["Changwon Jang","Kiseung Bang","Seokil Moon","Jonghyun Kim","Seungjae Lee","Byoungho Lee"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 36","Issue 6","November 2017","Article No.: 190","pp   1\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/3130800.3130889"],"date":"20 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"Richard A.

On the downside, containers offer weaker isolation than VMs, to the point where people run containers in virtual machines to achieve proper isolation. In this paper, we examine whether there is indeed a strict tradeoff between isolation (VMs) and efficiency (containers). We find that VMs can be as nimble as containers, as long as they are small and the toolstack is fast enough. We achieve lightweight VMs by using unikernels for specialized applications and with Tinyx, a tool that enables creating tailor-made, trimmed-down Linux virtual machines. By themselves, lightweight virtual machines are not enough to ensure good performance since the virtualization control plane (the toolstack) becomes the performance bottleneck. We present LightVM, a new virtualization solution based on Xen that is optimized to offer fast boot-times regardless of the number of active VMs. LightVM features a complete redesign of Xen's control plane, transforming its centralized operation to a distributed one where interactions with the hypervisor are reduced to a minimum. LightVM can boot a VM in 2.3ms, comparable to fork/exec on Linux (1ms), and two orders of magnitude faster than Docker. LightVM can pack thousands of LightVM guests on modest hardware with memory and CPU usage comparable to that of processes.","author":["Filipe Manco","Costin Lupu","Florian Schmidt","Jose Mendes","Simon Kuenzer","Sumit Sati","Kenichi Yasukata","Costin Raiciu","Felipe Huici"],"issue":["SOSP '17: Proceedings of the 26th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","October 2017","Pages   218\u2013233","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132747.3132763"],"date":"14 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Amazon Web Services {n. d.}.

In this paper we point out two main shortcomings of current proposals for ZKCP, and propose ways to address them. First we show an attack that allows a buyer to learn partial information about the digital good being sold, without paying for it. This break in the zero-knowledge condition of ZKCP is due to the fact that in the protocols we attack, the buyer is allowed to choose common parameters that normally should be selected by a trusted third party. We implemented and tested this attack: we present code that learns, without paying, the value of a Sudoku cell in the \"Pay-to-Sudoku\" ZKCP implementation. We also present ways to fix this attack that do not require a trusted third party. Second, we show that ZKCP are not suited for the purchase of digital services} rather than goods. Current constructions of ZKCP do not allow a seller to receive payments after proving that a certain service has been rendered, but only for the sale of a specific digital good. We define the notion of Zero-Knowledge Contingent Service Payment (ZKCSP) protocols and construct two new protocols, for either public or private verification. We implemented our ZKCSP protocols for Proofs of Retrievability, where a client pays the server for providing a proof that the client's data is correctly stored by the server.We also implement a secure ZKCP protocol for \"Pay-to-Sudoku\" via our ZKCSP protocol, which does not require a trusted third party. A side product of our implementation effort is a new optimized circuit for SHA256 with less than a quarter than the number of AND gates of the best previously publicly available one. Our new SHA256 circuit may be of independent use for circuit-based MPC and FHE protocols that require SHA256 circuits.","author":["Matteo Campanelli","Rosario Gennaro","Steven Goldfeder","Luca Nizzardo"],"issue":["CCS '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2017","Pages   229\u2013243","https://doi.org/10.1145/3133956.3134060"],"date":"30 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"B.

The demographics survey is ongoing (as of November 2017), and the results are available at http://demographics.mturk-tracker.com: we provide an API for researchers to download the survey data. We use techniques from the field of ecology, in particular, the capture-recapture technique, to understand the size and dynamics of the underlying population. We also demonstrate how to model and account for the inherent selection biases in such surveys. Our results indicate that there are more than 100K workers available in Amazon\u00bbs crowdsourcing platform, the participation of the workers in the platform follows a heavy-tailed distribution, and at any given time there are more than 2K active workers. We also show that the half-life of a worker on the platform is around 12-18 months and that the rate of arrival of new workers balances the rate of departures, keeping the overall worker population relatively stable. Finally, we demonstrate how we can estimate the biases of different demographics to participate in the survey tasks, and show how to correct such biases. Our methodology is generic and can be applied to any platform where we are interested in understanding the dynamics and demographics of the underlying user population.","author":["Djellel Difallah","Elena Filatova","Panos Ipeirotis"],"issue":["WSDM '18: Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2018","Pages   135\u2013143","https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159661"],"date":"02 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Steven C.

For this class of devices, energy efficiency is a first-class concern due to the limited battery capacity and thermal power budget. We find that data movement is a major contributor to the total system energy and execution time in consumer devices. The energy and performance costs of moving data between the memory system and the compute units are significantly higher than the costs of computation. As a result, addressing data movement is crucial for consumer devices. In this work, we comprehensively analyze the energy and performance impact of data movement for several widely-used Google consumer workloads: (1) the Chrome web browser; (2) TensorFlow Mobile, Google's machine learning framework; (3) video playback, and (4) video capture, both of which are used in many video services such as YouTube and Google Hangouts. We find that processing-in-memory (PIM) can significantly reduce data movement for all of these workloads, by performing part of the computation close to memory. Each workload contains simple primitives and functions that contribute to a significant amount of the overall data movement. We investigate whether these primitives and functions are feasible to implement using PIM, given the limited area and power constraints of consumer devices. Our analysis shows that offloading these primitives to PIM logic, consisting of either simple cores or specialized accelerators, eliminates a large amount of data movement, and significantly reduces total system energy (by an average of 55.4% across the workloads) and execution time (by an average of 54.2%).","author":["Amirali Boroumand","Saugata Ghose","Youngsok Kim","Rachata Ausavarungnirun","Eric Shiu","Rahul Thakur","Daehyun Kim","Aki Kuusela","Allan Knies","Parthasarathy Ranganathan","Onur Mutlu"],"issue":["ASPLOS '18: Proceedings of the Twenty-Third International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2018","Pages   316\u2013331","https://doi.org/10.1145/3173162.3173177"],"date":"19 March 2018","ref":[{"text":"D.

Our framework consists of multiple algorithmic optimizations for computation complexity and communication volume reduction, a mapping methodology for efficient resource utilization, and a tool for automatic \\textttVerilog  generation. The algorithmic optimizations improve throughput of frequency domain convolution so as to satisfy a given set of hardware constraints. While the Overlap-and-Add (OaA) technique has been known, it performs \"wasted\" computation at the edges. We propose a novel Concatenate-and-Pad (CaP) technique, which improves OaA significantly by reducing the \"wasted\" computation on the padded pixels. The proposed CaP used in conjunction with OaA enables us to choose a fixed FFT size at design time, and achieve low computation complexity for layers with various image sizes and kernel window sizes. We also develop a novel frequency domain loop tiling technique to further boost throughput by improving data reuse. Our mapping methodology optimizes the architecture for the target device by fast design space exploration. We quantitatively categorize FPGAs by capturing their DSP resources, on-chip memory size and external memory bandwidth into a device coefficient. We identify the optimal architectural parameters based on the tradeoff between computation and communication cost. Our framework includes a tool to automatically generate fully synthesizable  \\textttVerilog. We demonstrate the framework by generating high throughput accelerators for state-of-the-art CNN models on Intel HARP heterogeneous platform. Using our framework, we achieve throughput of $780.6$ $GOPS$, $669.1$ $GOPS$ and $552.1$ $GOPS$ for AlexNet, VGG16 and FCN-16s respectively. These correspond to $6.8\\times$ (AlexNet) and $4.9\\times$ (VGG16) improvement compared with the state-of-the-art implementations.","author":["Hanqing Zeng","Ren Chen","Chi Zhang","Viktor Prasanna"],"issue":["FPGA '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2018","Pages   117\u2013126","https://doi.org/10.1145/3174243.3174265"],"date":"15 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"2015.

However, sensor nodes have limited energy in their primary power storage unit, and this energy may be quickly drained if the sensor node remains operational over long periods of time. Therefore, the idea of harvesting ambient energy from the immediate surroundings of the deployed sensors, to recharge the batteries and to directly power the sensor nodes, has recently been proposed. The deployment of energy harvesting in environmental field systems eliminates the dependency of sensor nodes on battery power, drastically reducing the maintenance costs required to replace batteries. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art in energy-harvesting WSNs for environmental monitoring applications, including Animal Tracking, Air Quality Monitoring, Water Quality Monitoring, and Disaster Monitoring to improve the ecosystem and human life. In addition to presenting the technologies for harvesting energy from ambient sources and the protocols that can take advantage of the harvested energy, we present challenges that must be addressed to further advance energy-harvesting-based WSNs, along with some future work directions to address these challenges.","author":["Kofi Sarpong Adu-Manu","Nadir Adam","Cristiano Tapparello","Hoda Ayatollahi","Wendi Heinzelman"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks","Volume 14","Issue 2","July 2018","Article No.: 10","pp   1\u201350","https://doi.org/10.1145/3183338"],"date":"27 April 2018","ref":[{"text":"A.

The Buzz Word Tree avoids locks by appending delta record to tree nodes and using an indirection layer that allows it to atomically update physical pointers using compare-and-swap (CaS). Correctly implementing this techniques requires careful attention to detail. Unfortunately, the Bw-Tree papers from Microsoft are missing important details and the source code has not been released. This paper has two contributions: First, it is the missing guide for how to build a lock-free Bw-Tree. We clarify missing points in Microsoft's original design documents and then present techniques to improve the index's performance. Although our focus here is on the Bw-Tree, many of our methods apply more broadly to designing and implementing future lock-free in-memory data structures. Our experimental evaluation shows that our optimized variant achieves 1.1--2.5\u00d7 better performance than the original Microsoft proposal for highly concurrent workloads. Second, our evaluation shows that despite our improvements, the Bw-Tree still does not perform as well as other concurrent data structures that use locks.","author":["Ziqi Wang","Andrew Pavlo","Hyeontaek Lim","Viktor Leis","Huanchen Zhang","Michael Kaminsky","David G.

In the context of knowledge graphs such models often serve as additional evidence supporting various tasks related to the knowledge base population: e.g., information extraction or link prediction to expand the original dataset. However, the embedding models themselves are often not used directly alongside structured data: they merely serve as additional evidence for structured knowledge extraction. In the metaphactory knowledge graph management platform, we use federated hybrid SPARQL queries for combining explicit information stated in the graph, implicit information from the associated embedding models, and information extracted using vector embeddings in a transparent way for the end user. In this paper we show how we integrated RDF data with vector space models to construct an augmented knowledge graph to be used in customer applications.","author":["Andriy Nikolov","Peter Haase","Daniel M.

Efficient computational methods for condensing and simplifying data are thus becoming vital for extracting actionable insights. In particular, while data summarization techniques have been studied extensively, only recently has summarizing interconnected data, or graphs, become popular. This survey is a structured, comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art methods for summarizing graph data. We first broach the motivation behind and the challenges of graph summarization. We then categorize summarization approaches by the type of graphs taken as input and further organize each category by core methodology. Finally, we discuss applications of summarization on real-world graphs and conclude by describing some open problems in the field.","author":["Yike Liu","Tara Safavi","Abhilash Dighe","Danai Koutra"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 51","Issue 3","July 2018","Article No.: 62","pp   1\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/3186727"],"date":"22 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Bijaya Adhikari, Yao Zhang, Aditya Bharadwaj, and B.

These accelerators exploit the inherent parallelism of tasks and are often tolerant to inaccuracies in their outputs, e.g. image and digital signal processing applications. At the same time, permanent faults are escalating due to process scaling and power restrictions, leading to erroneous outputs. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a low-cost, universal fault-recovery/repair method that utilizes supervised machine learning techniques to ameliorate the effect of permanent fault(s) in hardware accelerators that can tolerate inexact outputs. The proposed compensation model does not require any information about the accelerator and is highly scalable with low area overhead. Experimental results show, the proposed method improves the accuracy by 50% and decreases the overall mean error rate by 90% with an area overhead of 5% compared to execution without fault compensation.","author":["Farah Naz Taher","Joseph Callenes-Sloan","Benjamin Carrion Schafer"],"issue":["DAC '18: Proceedings of the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2018","Article No.: 80","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3195974"],"date":"24 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"M.-L.

Inspired by local binary pattern feature extraction method combined with depthwise separable convolution, we first modify the existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm by replacing the computationally-intensive multiplications in convolution layers with more efficient and less complex comparison and addition. Then, we propose a CMP-PIM that employs parallel computational memory sub-array as a fundamental processing unit based on SOT-MRAM. We compare CMP-PIM accelerator performance on different data-sets with recent CNN accelerator designs. With the close inference accuracy on SVHN data-set, CMP-PIM can get \u223c 94\u00d7 and 3\u00d7 better energy efficiency compared to CNN and Local Binary CNN (LBCNN), respectively. Besides, it achieves 4.3\u00d7 speed-up compared to CNN-baseline with identical network configuration.","author":["Shaahin Angizi","Zhezhi He","Adnan Siraj Rakin","Deliang Fan"],"issue":["DAC '18: Proceedings of the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2018","Article No.: 105","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3196009"],"date":"24 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"L.

The intent is to capture (in a more or less formal way) more of the meaning of the data so that database design can become more systematic and the database system itself can behave more intelligently. Two major thrusts are clear.(1) the search for meaningful units that are as small as possible\u2014atomic semantics;(2) the search for meaningful units that are larger than the usual n-ary relation\u2014molecular semantics.In this paper we propose extensions to the relational model to support certain atomic and molecular semantics.

Word vectors represent words in a distributional space such that syntactically or semantically similar words are close to each other in this space. Multilingual word embeddings are constructed in such a way that similar words across languages have similar vector representations. We explore the effective use of bilingual and multilingual word embeddings learned from comparable corpora of Indic languages to the task of CLIR.We propose a clustering method based on the multilingual word vectors to group similar words across languages. For this we construct a graph with words from multiple languages as nodes and with edges connecting words with similar vectors. We use the Louvain method for community detection to find communities in this graph. We show that choosing target language words as query translations from the clusters or communities containing the query terms helps in improving CLIR. We also find that better-quality query translations are obtained when words from more languages are used to do the clustering even when the additional languages are neither the source nor the target languages. This is probably because having more similar words across multiple languages helps define well-defined dense subclusters that help us obtain precise query translations.In this article, we demonstrate the use of multilingual word embeddings and word clusters for CLIR involving Indic languages. We also make available a tool for obtaining related words and the visualizations of the multilingual word vectors for English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, and Tamil.","author":["Paheli Bhattacharya","Pawan Goyal","Sudeshna Sarkar"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing","Volume 18","Issue 1","January 2019","Article No.: 1","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/3208358"],"date":"17 December 2018","ref":[{"text":"Waleed Ammar, George Mulcaire, Yulia Tsvetkov, Guillaume Lample, Chris Dyer, and Noah A.

Non-adaptive applications built with TCP or UDP suffer from increased latency or degraded accuracy. State-of-the-art approaches that adapt to network changes require developer writing sub-optimal manual policies or are limited to application-specific optimizations. We present AWStream, a stream processing system that simultaneously achieves low latency and high accuracy in the wide area, requiring minimal developer efforts. To realize this, AWStream uses three ideas: (i) it integrates application adaptation as a first-class programming abstraction in the stream processing model; (ii) with a combination of offline and online profiling, it automatically learns an accurate profile that models accuracy and bandwidth trade-off; and (iii) at runtime, it carefully adjusts the application data rate to match the available bandwidth while maximizing the achievable accuracy. We evaluate AWStream with three real-world applications: augmented reality, pedestrian detection, and monitoring log analysis. Our experiments show that AWStream achieves sub-second latency with only nominal accuracy drop (2-6%).","author":["Ben Zhang","Xin Jin","Sylvia Ratnasamy","John Wawrzynek","Edward A.

CNNs require large amounts of processing capacity and memory bandwidth. Hardware accelerators have been proposed for CNNs that typically contain large numbers of multiply-accumulate (MAC) units, the multipliers of which are large in integrated circuit (IC) gate count and power consumption. \u201cWeight-sharing\u201d accelerators have been proposed where the full range of weight values in a trained CNN are compressed and put into bins, and the bin index is used to access the weight-shared value. We reduce power and area of the CNN by implementing parallel accumulate shared MAC (PASM) in a weight-shared CNN. PASM re-architects the MAC to instead count the frequency of each weight and place it in a bin. The accumulated value is computed in a subsequent multiply phase, significantly reducing gate count and power consumption of the CNN. In this article, we implement PASM in a weight-shared CNN convolution hardware accelerator and analyze its effectiveness. Experiments show that for a clock speed 1GHz implemented on a 45nm ASIC process our approach results in fewer gates, smaller logic, and reduced power with only a slight increase in latency. We also show that the same weight-shared-with-PASM CNN accelerator can be implemented in resource-constrained FPGAs, where the FPGA has limited numbers of digital signal processor (DSP) units to accelerate the MAC operations.","author":["James Garland","David Gregg"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 15","Issue 3","October 2018","Article No.: 31","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/3233300"],"date":"04 September 2018","ref":[{"text":"Tianshi Chen, Zidong Du, Ninghui Sun, Jia Wang, Chengyong Wu, Yunji Chen, and Olivier Temam. 2014.

Our approach provides competitive performance across hardware architectures and can be generalized to deliver the same benefits for algebraic path problems.

In Boolean logic approximation, the number of terms and literals of a logic function can be reduced by allowing to produce erroneous outputs for some input combinations. This paper proposes a novel methodology for the approximation of multi-output logic functions. Related work on multi-output logic approximation minimizes each output function separately. In this paper, we show that thereby a huge optimization potential is lost. As a remedy, our methodology considers the effect on all output functions when introducing errors thus exploiting the cross-function minimization potential. Moreover, our approach is integrated into a design space exploration technique to obtain not only a single solution but a Pareto-set of designs with different trade-offs between hardware costs (terms and literals) and error (number of minterms that have been falsified). Experimental results show our technique is very efficient in exploring Pareto-optimal fronts. For some benchmarks, the number of terms could be reduced from an accurate function implementation by up to 15% and literals by up to 19% with degrees of inaccuracy around 0.1% w.r.t. accurate designs. Moreover, we show that the Pareto-fronts obtained by our methodology dominate the results obtained when applying related work.","author":["Jorge Echavarria","Stefan Wildermann","J\u00fcrgen Teich"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 52","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240795"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"Jie Han and Michael Orshansky. \"Approximate computing: An emerging paradigm for energy-efficient design\".

In order to save memory requirements and reduce energy consumption we propose the use of dedicated accelerators with novel arithmetic processing elements which use bit shifts instead of multipliers. While a regular power-of-2 quantization scheme allows for multiplierless computation of multiply-accumulate-operations, it suffers from high accuracy losses in neural networks. Therefore, we evaluate the use of powers-of-arbitrary-log-bases and confirmed their suitability for quantization of pre-trained neural networks. The presented method works without retraining of the neural network and therefore is suitable for applications in which no labeled training data is available. In order to verify our proposed method, we implement the log-based processing elements into a neural network accelerator on an FPGA. The hardware efficiency is evaluated in terms of FPGA utilization and energy requirements in comparison to regular 8-bit-fixed-point multiplier based acceleration. Using this approach hardware resources are minimized and power consumption is reduced by 22.3%.","author":["Sebastian Vogel","Mengyu Liang","Andre Guntoro","Walter Stechele","Gerd Ascheid"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 9","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240803"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"R.

The increasingly wide deployment, sharing and potential commercialization of DNN models create a compelling need for intellectual property (IP) protection. Recently, DNN watermarking emerges as a plausible IP protection method. Enabling DNN watermarking on embedded devices in a practical setting requires a black-box approach. Existing DNN watermarking frameworks either fail to meet the black-box requirement or are susceptible to several forms of attacks. We propose a watermarking framework by incorporating the author's signature in the process of training DNNs. While functioning normally in regular cases, the resulting watermarked DNN behaves in a different, predefined pattern when given any signed inputs, thus proving the authorship. We demonstrate an example implementation of the framework on popular image classification datasets and show that strong watermarks can be embedded in the models.","author":["Jia Guo","Miodrag Potkonjak"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 133","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240862"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"Y.

Previous implementations have relied on FFT IP cores for performing the computation due to the complexity of manually developing and maintaining/upgrading efficient pipelines in HDL. These IP cores, however, are bulky and cannot be fully tuned for specific FFT sizes due to use of generic architectures. HLS tools, such as OpenCL, offer a more customizable alternative but have suffered from worse performance than HDL in previous work. In this paper we show that, using a set of code structure optimizations, OpenCL designs can be compiled to Radix-2 FFT pipelines which outperform IP core based designs for the same throughput. We further show that the HDL generated by the OpenCL compiler can be isolated and seamlessly integrated into existing 3D FFT shells to reduce implementation effort. Our single device design, tested on the Altera Arria10X115 FPGA, achieves an average speedup of 29x vs CPU-MKL, 4.1x vs GPU cuFFT and 1.1x vs IP Core FFT implementations for 163, 323 and 643 FFTs. Moreover, OpenCL generated compute pipelines for 83, 163, 323 and 643 FFTs use an average of 7.5x fewer ALMs and 1.6x fewer DSPs than corresponding IP core versions.","author":["Ahmed Sanaullah","Martin C.

However, the intensive multiply-accumulate computations (MACs) executed at the crossbars during the inference phase are still the bottleneck for the further improvement of energy efficiency and throughput. In this work, we explore several methods to reduce the computations for the RRAM-based CNN accelerators. First, the output sparsity resulting from the widely employed Rectified Linear Unit is exploited, and a significant portion of computations are bypassed through an early detection of the negative output activations. Second, an adaptive approximation is proposed to terminate the MAC early when the sum of the partial results of the remaining computations is considered to be within a certain range of the intermediate accumulated result and thus has an insignificant contribution to the inference. In order to determine these redundant computations, a novel runtime estimation on the maximum and minimum values of each output activation is developed and used during the MAC operation. Experimental results show that around 70% of the computations can be reduced during the inference with a negligible accuracy loss smaller than 0.2%. As a result, the energy efficiency and the throughput are improved by over 2.9 and 2.8 times, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art RRAM-based accelerators.","author":["Xizi Chen","Jingyang Zhu","Jingbo Jiang","Chi-Ying Tsui"],"issue":["ASPDAC '19: Proceedings of the 24th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2019","Pages   133\u2013139","https://doi.org/10.1145/3287624.3287640"],"date":"21 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Vahideh Akhlaghi, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Kambiz Samadi, Rajesh K.

In this paper, we propose an approximate divider design that facilitates dynamic energy-quality scaling. Conventional approximate dividers lack runtime energy-quality scalability, which is the key to maximizing the energy efficiency while meeting dynamically varying accuracy requirements. Our divider design, named SAADI, makes an approximation to the reciprocal of the divisor in an incremental manner, thus the division speed and energy efficiency can be dynamically traded for accuracy by controlling the number of iterations. For the approximate 8-bit division of 32-bit/16-bit division, the average accuracy of SAADI can be adjusted in between 92.5% and 99.0% by varying latency up to 7x. We evaluate the accuracy and energy consumption of SAADI for various design parameters and demonstrate its efficacy for low-power signal processing applications.","author":["Setareh Behroozi","Jingjie Li","Jackson Melchert","Younghyun Kim"],"issue":["ASPDAC '19: Proceedings of the 24th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2019","Pages   481\u2013486","https://doi.org/10.1145/3287624.3287668"],"date":"21 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). 2011.","order":1},{"text":"Altera. 2016.","order":2},{"text":"V.

Here we introduce the cell division technique, which is a variant of function-preserving transformations. With this technique, it is guaranteed that CNNs that have weights quantized to fixed-point format of arbitrary bit-widths, can be transformed to CNNs with less bit-widths of weights without any accuracy drop (or any accuracy change). As a result, CNN hardware accelerators are released from the weight bit-width constraint, which has been preventing them from having narrower datapaths. In addition, CNNs that have wider weight bit-widths than those assumed by a CNN hardware accelerator can be executed on the accelerator. Experimental results on LeNet-300-100, LeNet-5, AlexNet, and VGG-16 show that weights can be reduced down to 2--5 bits with 2.5X--5.2X decrease in weight storage requirement and of course without any accuracy drop.","author":["Hanmin Park","Kiyoung Choi"],"issue":["ASPDAC '19: Proceedings of the 24th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2019","Pages   286\u2013291","https://doi.org/10.1145/3287624.3287721"],"date":"21 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Sajid Anwar, Kyuyeon Hwang, and Wonyong Sung. 2015.

There have been proposals to employ RRAM in architecting chips for neuromorphic computing and artificial neural networks where matrix-vector multiplication can be computed in the analog domain in a single timestep. However, it is challenging to employ RRAM devices in neuromorphic chips owing to the non-ideal behavior of RRAM. In this article, we propose a cycle-accurate and scalable system-level simulator that can be used to study the effects of using RRAM devices in neuromorphic computing chips. The simulator models a spatial neuromorphic chip architecture containing many neural cores with RRAM crossbars connected via a Network-on-Chip (NoC). We focus on system-level simulation and demonstrate the effectiveness of our simulator in understanding how non-linear RRAM effects such as stuck-at-faults (SAFs), write variability, and random telegraph noise (RTN) can impact an application\u2019s behavior. By using our simulator, we show that RTN and write variability can have adverse effects on an application. Nevertheless, we show that these effects can be mitigated through proper design choices and the implementation of a write-verify scheme.","author":["Matthew Kay Fei Lee","Yingnan Cui","Thannirmalai Somu","Tao Luo","Jun Zhou","Wai Teng Tang","Weng-Fai Wong","Rick Siow Mong Goh"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 15","Issue 4","January 2019","Article No.: 64","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/3291054"],"date":"08 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Filipp Akopyan, Jun Sawada, Andrew Cassidy, Rodrigo Alvarez-Icaza, John Arthur, Paul Merolla, Nabil Imam, Yutaka Nakamura, Pallab Datta, Gi-Joon Nam, et al. 2015.

The most representative is the emergence of various deep learning accelerators. Among the proposed solutions, resistive random access memory (ReRAM) based process-in-memory (PIM) architecture is anticipated as a promising candidate because ReRAM has the capability of both data storage and in-situ computation. However, we found that existing solutions are unable to efficiently support the computational needs required by the training of unsupervised generative adversarial networks (GANs), due to the lack of the following two features: 1) Computation efficiency: GAN utilizes a new operator, called transposed convolution. It inserts massive zeros in its input before a convolution operation, resulting in significant resource under-utilization; 2) Data traffic: The data intensive training process of GANs often incurs structural heavy data traffic as well as frequent massive data swaps. Our research follows the PIM strategy by leveraging the energy-efficiency of ReRAM arrays for vector-matrix multiplication to enhance the performance and energy efficiency. Specifically, we propose a novel computation deformation technique that can skip zero-insertions in transposed convolution for computation efficiency improvement. Moreover, we explore an efficient pipelined training procedure to reduce on-chip memory access. The implementation of related circuits and architecture is also discussed. At the end, we present our perspective on the future trend and opportunities of deep learning accelerators.","author":["Fan Chen","Linghao Song","Hai 'Helen' Li"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '19: Proceedings of the 2019 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2019","Pages   423\u2013428","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299874.3319482"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Stefano Ambrogio, Simone Balatti, A.

There has been significant progress in accelerating both their training and inference using high-performance GPUs, FPGAs, and custom ASICs for datacenter-scale environments. The recent proliferation of mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) devices have necessitated real-time, energy-efficient deep neural network inference on embedded-class, resource-constrained platforms. In this context, we present Synergy, an automated, hardware-software co-designed, pipelined, high-throughput CNN inference framework on embedded heterogeneous system-on-chip (SoC) architectures (Xilinx Zynq). Synergy leverages, through multi-threading, all the available on-chip resources, which includes the dual-core ARM processor along with the FPGA and the NEON Single-Instruction Multiple-Data (SIMD) engines as accelerators. Moreover, Synergy provides a unified abstraction of the heterogeneous accelerators (FPGA and NEON) and can adapt to different network configurations at runtime without changing the underlying hardware accelerator architecture by balancing workload across accelerators through work-stealing. Synergy achieves 7.3X speedup, averaged across seven CNN models, over a well-optimized software-only solution. Synergy demonstrates substantially better throughput and energy-efficiency compared to the contemporary CNN implementations on the same SoC architecture.","author":["Guanwen Zhong","Akshat Dubey","Cheng Tan","Tulika Mitra"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 18","Issue 2","April 2019","Article No.: 13","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3301278"],"date":"18 March 2019","ref":[{"text":"ARM Infocenter. 2018.

In contrast to traditional long-running applications on dedicated, virtualized, or container-based platforms, serverless applications are intended to be instantiated when called, execute a single function, and shut down when finished. State-of-the-art serverless platforms achieve these goals by creating a new container instance to host a function when it is called and destroying the container when it completes. This design allows for cost and resource savings when hosting simple applications, such as those supporting IoT devices at the edge of the network. However, the use of containers introduces some overhead which may be unsuitable for applications requiring low-latency response or hardware platforms with limited resources, such as those served by edge computing environments. In this paper, we present a nomenclature for characterizing server-less function access patterns which allows us to derive the basic requirements of a serverless computing runtime. We then propose the use of WebAssembly as an alternative method for running serverless applications while meeting these requirements. Finally, we demonstrate how a WebAssembly-based serverless platform provides many of the same isolation and performance guarantees of container-based platforms while reducing average application start times and the resources needed to host them.","author":["Adam Hall","Umakishore Ramachandran"],"issue":["IoTDI '19: Proceedings of the International Conference on Internet of Things Design and Implementation","April 2019","Pages   225\u2013236","https://doi.org/10.1145/3302505.3310084"],"date":"15 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"Istemi Ekin Akkus, Ruichuan Chen, Ivica Rimac, Manuel Stein, Klaus Satzke, Andre Beck, Paarijaat Aditya, and Volker Hilt. 2018.

However, most of these models have two common drawbacks, including (i) current methods are not sensitive enough to abrupt changes of stock trend, and (ii) forecasting results are not interpretable for humans. To address these two problems, we propose a novel Knowledge-Driven Temporal Convolutional Network (KDTCN) for stock trend prediction and explanation. Firstly, we extract structured events from financial news, and utilize external knowledge from knowledge graph to obtain event embeddings. Then, we combine event embeddings and price values together to forecast stock trend. We evaluate the prediction accuracy to show how knowledge-driven events work on abrupt changes. We also visualize the effect of events and linkage among events based on knowledge graph, to explain why knowledge-driven events are common sources of abrupt changes. Experiments demonstrate that KDTCN can (i) react to abrupt changes much faster and outperform state-of-the-art methods on stock datasets, as well as (ii) facilitate the explanation of prediction particularly with abrupt changes.","author":["Shumin Deng","Ningyu Zhang","Wen Zhang","Jiaoyan Chen","Jeff Z.

Our main result is an algorithm that, given an m \u00d7 n matrix in a data structure supporting certain \u21132-norm sampling operations, outputs an \u21132-norm sample from a rank-k approximation of that matrix in time O(poly(k)log(mn)), only polynomially slower than the quantum algorithm. As a consequence, Kerenidis and Prakash\u2019s algorithm does not in fact give an exponential speedup over classical algorithms. Further, under strong input assumptions, the classical recommendation system resulting from our algorithm produces recommendations exponentially faster than previous classical systems, which run in time linear in m and n.  The main insight of this work is the use of simple routines to manipulate \u21132-norm sampling distributions, which play the role of quantum superpositions in the classical setting.

The queue number of a graph is the minimum number of queues required by any of its queue layouts. A long-standing conjecture by Heath, Leighton and Rosenberg states that the queue number of planar graphs is bounded.This conjecture has been partially settled in the positive for several sub- families of planar graphs (most of which have bounded treewidth).   In this paper, we make a further important step towards settling this conjecture. We prove that planar graphs of bounded degree (which may have unbounded treewidth) have bounded queue number. A notable implication of this result is that every planar graph of bounded degree admits a three-dimensional straight-line grid drawing in linear volume. Further implications are that every planar graph of bounded degree has bounded track number, and that every k-planar graph (i.e., every graph that can be drawn in the plane with at most k crossings per edge) of bounded degree as bounded queue number.","author":["Michael Bekos","Henry F\u00f6rster","Martin Gronemann","Tamara Mchedlidze","Fabrizio Montecchiani","Chrysanthi Raftopoulou","Torsten Ueckerdt"],"issue":["STOC 2019: Proceedings of the 51st Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing","June 2019","Pages   176\u2013184","https://doi.org/10.1145/3313276.3316324"],"date":"23 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"Jawaherul Md.

ReRAM-based in-memory search is a powerful operation which efficiently finds required data in a large data set. However, such operations result in a large amount of current which may create serious thermal issues, especially in state-of-the-art 3D stacking chips. Therefore, designing PIM accelerators based on in-memory searches requires a careful consideration of temperature. In this work, we propose static and dynamic techniques to optimize the thermal behavior of PIM architectures running intensive in-memory search operations. Our experiments show the proposed design significantly reduces the peak chip temperature and dynamic management overhead. We test our proposed design in two important categories of applications which benefit from the search-based PIM acceleration - hyper-dimensional computing and database query. Validated experiments show that the proposed method can reduce the steady-state temperature by at least 15.3 \u00b0C which extends the lifetime of the ReRAM device by 57.2% on average. Furthermore, the proposed fine-grained dynamic thermal management provides 17.6% performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods.","author":["Minxuan Zhou","Mohsen Imani","Saransh Gupta","Tajana Rosing"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 174","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317923"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, conducting spatio-temporal analysis often requires certain levels of domain knowledge and experience: on one hand, sophisticated and domain-specific software design makes the analysis difficult for public users; on the other hand, conveying findings from the analysis could result in ineffectiveness and inefficiencies. In this work, we present a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-enabled Question Answering (QA) framework for spatio-temporal analysis and visualization. It allows users to conduct spatio-temporal analysis by speaking or typing questions. Interactive visualization component in the framework creates better communication between insights and users. We use a dataset from the domain of climate science as a case study to demonstrate the framework. The case study is evaluated through a mid-size software company, and great feedback was received. With the microservice architecture in it, the framework is general enough to be applied in a variety of applications and domains.","author":["Zhengcong Yin","Chong Zhang","Daniel W.

The Internet of Things (IoT) security will be directly affected because it is largely dependent on theses cryptographic techniques. Systems of Multivariate Quadratic Equations (MQ) will become more relevant in cryptography due to the resistance against attacks from these computers. The Rainbow signature scheme is a well known post-quantum algorithm based on MQ.

This problem is most pronounced when answers can be found only by joining evidence from multiple documents. Curated knowledge graphs (KGs) may yield good answers, but are limited by their inherent incompleteness and potential staleness. This paper presents QUEST, a method that can answer complex questions directly from textual sources on-the-fly, by computing similarity joins over partial results from different documents. Our method is completely unsupervised, avoiding training-data bottlenecks and being able to cope with rapidly evolving ad hoc topics and formulation style in user questions. QUEST builds a noisy quasi KG with node and edge weights, consisting of dynamically retrieved entity names and relational phrases. It augments this graph with types and semantic alignments, and computes the best answers by an algorithm for Group Steiner Trees. We evaluate QUEST on benchmarks of complex questions, and show that it substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.","author":["Xiaolu Lu","Soumajit Pramanik","Rishiraj Saha Roy","Abdalghani Abujabal","Yafang Wang","Gerhard Weikum"],"issue":["SIGIR'19: Proceedings of the 42nd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","July 2019","Pages   105\u2013114","https://doi.org/10.1145/3331184.3331252"],"date":"18 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"A.

While this kind of bottom-up learning works well for tasks such as image classification or object detection, it is not as effective when it comes to natural language processing. Communication is much more than learning a sequence of letters and words: it requires a basic understanding of the world and social norms, cultural awareness, commonsense knowledge, etc.; all things that we mostly learn in a top-down manner. In this work, we integrate top-down and bottom-up learning via an ensemble of symbolic and subsymbolic AI tools, which we apply to the interesting problem of polarity detection from text. In particular, we integrate logical reasoning within deep learning architectures to build a new version of SenticNet, a commonsense knowledge base for sentiment analysis.","author":["Erik Cambria","Yang Li","Frank Z.

Specifically, we address the following question. Since the primary task in data mining is the development of models about aggregated data, can we develop accurate models without access to precise information in individual data records? We consider the concrete case of building a decision-tree classifier from training data in which the values of individual records have been perturbed. The resulting data records look very different from the original records and the distribution of data values is also very different from the original distribution. While it is not possible to accurately estimate original values in individual data records, we propose a novel reconstruction procedure to accurately estimate the distribution of original data values. By using these reconstructed distributions, we are able to build classifiers whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of classifiers built with the original data.","author":["Rakesh Agrawal","Ramakrishnan Srikant"],"issue":["ACM SIGMOD Record","Volume 29","Issue 2","June 2000","pp   439\u2013450","https://doi.org/10.1145/335191.335438"],"date":"16 May 2000","ref":[{"text":"M.S.

Due to the increasing memory intensity of most DNN workloads, main memory can dominate the system's energy consumption and stall time. One effective way to reduce the energy consumption and increase the performance of DNN inference systems is by using approximate memory, which operates with reduced supply voltage and reduced access latency parameters that violate standard specifications. Using approximate memory reduces reliability, leading to higher bit error rates. Fortunately, neural networks have an intrinsic capacity to tolerate increased bit errors. This can enable energy-efficient and high-performance neural network inference using approximate DRAM devices. Based on this observation, we propose EDEN, the first general framework that reduces DNN energy consumption and DNN evaluation latency by using approximate DRAM devices, while strictly meeting a user-specified target DNN accuracy. EDEN relies on two key ideas: 1) retraining the DNN for a target approximate DRAM device to increase the DNN's error tolerance, and 2) efficient mapping of the error tolerance of each individual DNN data type to a corresponding approximate DRAM partition in a way that meets the user-specified DNN accuracy requirements. We evaluate EDEN on multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and DNN accelerators with error models obtained from real approximate DRAM devices. We show that EDEN's DNN retraining technique reliably improves the error resiliency of the DNN by an order of magnitude. For a target accuracy within 1% of the original DNN, our results show that EDEN enables 1) an average DRAM energy reduction of 21%, 37%, 31%, and 32% in CPU, GPU, and two different DNN accelerator architectures, respectively, across a variety of state-of-the-art networks, and 2) an average (maximum) speedup of 8% (17%) and 2.7% (5.5%) in CPU and GPU architectures, respectively, when evaluating latency-bound neural networks.","author":["Skanda Koppula","Lois Orosa","A.

Compared to a large monolithic die, an MCM combines many smaller chiplets into a larger system, substantially reducing fabrication and design costs. Current MCMs typically only contain a handful of coarse-grained large chiplets due to the high area, performance, and energy overheads associated with inter-chiplet communication. This work investigates and quantifies the costs and benefits of using MCMs with fine-grained chiplets for deep learning inference, an application area with large compute and on-chip storage requirements. To evaluate the approach, we architected, implemented, fabricated, and tested Simba, a 36-chiplet prototype MCM system for deep-learning inference. Each chiplet achieves 4 TOPS peak performance, and the 36-chiplet MCM package achieves up to 128 TOPS and up to 6.1 TOPS/W. The MCM is configurable to support a flexible mapping of DNN layers to the distributed compute and storage units. To mitigate inter-chiplet communication overheads, we introduce three tiling optimizations that improve data locality. These optimizations achieve up to 16% speedup compared to the baseline layer mapping. Our evaluation shows that Simba can process 1988 images/s running ResNet-50 with batch size of one, delivering inference latency of 0.50 ms.","author":["Yakun Sophia Shao","Jason Clemons","Rangharajan Venkatesan","Brian Zimmer","Matthew Fojtik","Nan Jiang","Ben Keller","Alicia Klinefelter","Nathaniel Pinckney","Priyanka Raina","Stephen G.

While many current KBs are quite large, they are widely acknowledged as incomplete, especially lacking facts of long-tail entities, e.g., less famous persons. Existing approaches enrich KBs mainly on completing missing links or filling missing values. However, they only tackle a part of the enrichment problem and lack specific considerations regarding long-tail entities. In this paper, we propose a full-fledged approach to knowledge enrichment, which predicts missing properties and infers true facts of long-tail entities from the open Web. Prior knowledge from popular entities is leveraged to improve every enrichment step. Our experiments on the synthetic and real-world datasets and comparison with related work demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the approach.","author":["Ermei Cao","Difeng Wang","Jiacheng Huang","Wei Hu"],"issue":["WWW '20: Proceedings of The Web Conference 2020","April 2020","Pages   384\u2013394","https://doi.org/10.1145/3366423.3380123"],"date":"20 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"Hannah Bast, Florian B\u00e4urle, Bj\u00f6rn Buchhold, and Elmar Hau\u00dfmann. 2014.

BD-Net is designed to use binarized depthwise separable convolution block as the drop-in replacement of conventional spatial-convolution in deep convolution neural network (DNN). In BD-Net, the computation-expensive convolution operations (i.e., Multiplication and Accumulation) are converted into energy-efficient Addition/Subtraction operations. For further compressing the model size while maintaining the dominant computation in addition/subtraction, we propose a brand-new sparse binarization method with a hardware-oriented structured sparsity pattern. To successfully train such sparse BD-Net, we propose and leverage two techniques: (1) a modified group-lasso regularization whose group size is identical to the capacity of basic computing core in accelerator and (2) a weight penalty clipping technique to solve the disharmony issue between weight binarization and lasso regularization. The experiment results show that the proposed sparse BD-Net can achieve comparable or even better inference accuracy, in comparison to the full precision CNN baseline. Beyond that, a BD-Net customized process-in-memory accelerator is designed using SOT-MRAM, which owns characteristics of high channel expansion flexibility and computation parallelism. Through the detailed analysis from both software and hardware perspectives, we provide an intuitive design guidance for software/hardware co-design of DNN acceleration on mobile embedded systems.

Many of these satellite systems operate under a \"bent-pipe\" architecture, in which ground stations send commands to orbit and satellites reply with raw data. In this work, we observe that a bent-pipe architecture for Earth-observing satellites breaks down as constellation population increases. Communication is limited by the physical configuration and constraints of the system over time, such as ground station location, nanosatellite antenna size, and energy harvested on orbit. We show quantitatively that nanosatellite constellation capabilities are determined by physical system constraints. We propose an Orbital Edge Computing (OEC) architecture to address the limitations of a bent-pipe architecture. OEC supports edge computing at each camera-equipped nanosatellite so that sensed data may be processed locally when downlinking is not possible. In order to address edge processing latencies, OEC systems organize satellite constellations into computational pipelines. These pipelines parallelize both data collection and data processing based on geographic location and without the need for cross-link coordination. OEC satellites explicitly model constraints of the physical environment via a runtime service. This service uses orbit parameters, physical models, and ground station positions to trigger data collection, predict energy availability, and prepare for communication. We show that an OEC architecture can reduce ground infrastructure over 24x compared to a bent-pipe architecture, and we show that pipelines can reduce system edge processing latency over 617x.","author":["Bradley Denby","Brandon Lucia"],"issue":["ASPLOS '20: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2020","Pages   939\u2013954","https://doi.org/10.1145/3373376.3378473"],"date":"09 March 2020","ref":[{"text":"Adcole Maryland Aerospace.

Tagging this mixed text is essential for making progress on two seminal software engineering problems --- traceability, and reuse via precise extraction of code snippets from mixed text. In this paper, we borrow code-switching techniques from Natural Language Processing and adapt them to apply to mixed text to solve two problems: language identification and token tagging. Our technique, POSIT, simultaneously provides abstract syntax tree tags for source code tokens, part-of-speech tags for natural language words, and predicts the source language of a token in mixed text. To realize POSIT, we trained a biLSTM network with a Conditional Random Field output layer using abstract syntax tree tags from the CLANG compiler and part-of-speech tags from the Standard Stanford part-of-speech tagger. POSIT improves the state-of-the-art on language identification by 10.6% and PoS/AST tagging by 23.7% in accuracy.","author":["Profir-Petru P\u00e2rtachi","Santanu Kumar Dash","Christoph Treude","Earl T.

Our analysis considers both static and reconfigurable approximation techniques as well as operation-specific approximate components (e.g., multipliers) and generalized approximate highlevel synthesis approaches. As our application target, we discuss the improvements that such techniques bring on machine learning and neural networks. In addition to the conventionally analyzed performance and energy gains, we also evaluate the improvements that approximate computing brings in the operating temperature.","author":["Georgios Zervakis","Hassaan Saadat","Hussam Amrouch","Andreas Gerstlauer","Sri Parameswaran","J\u00f6rg Henkel"],"issue":["ASPDAC '21: Proceedings of the 26th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2021","Pages   189\u2013196","https://doi.org/10.1145/3394885.3431632"],"date":"18 January 2021","ref":[{"text":"N.

We present, for the first time, a synthesis of research results on computing systems that only make as many errors as their end-to-end applications can tolerate. The results span the disciplines of computer-aided design of circuits, digital system design, computer architecture, programming languages, operating systems, and information theory. Rather than over-provisioning the resources controlled by each of these layers of abstraction to avoid errors, it can be more efficient to exploit the masking of errors occurring at one layer and thereby prevent those errors from propagating to a higher layer.We demonstrate the potential benefits of end-to-end approaches using two illustrative examples. We introduce a formalization of terminology that allows us to present a coherent view across the techniques traditionally used by different research communities in their individual layer of focus. Using this formalization, we survey tradeoffs for individual layers of computing systems at the circuit, architecture, operating system, and programming language levels as well as fundamental information-theoretic limits to tradeoffs between resource usage and correctness.","author":["Phillip Stanley-Marbell","Armin Alaghi","Michael Carbin","Eva Darulova","Lara Dolecek","Andreas Gerstlauer","Ghayoor Gillani","Djordje Jevdjic","Thierry Moreau","Mattia Cacciotti","Alexandros Daglis","Natalie Enright Jerger","Babak Falsafi","Sasa Misailovic","Adrian Sampson","Damien Zufferey"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 53","Issue 3","June 2020","Article No.: 51","pp   1\u201339","https://doi.org/10.1145/3394898"],"date":"12 June 2020","ref":[{"text":"Sara Achour and Martin C.

In particular, such circuits can use all arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7), optimization operations (min and max), conditional branching (if-then-else), and many more. We show that probabilistic circuits using any of these operations as gates can be simulated by deterministic circuits with only about a quadratical blowup in size. A slightly larger blowup in circuit size is also shown when derandomizing approximating circuits. The algorithmic consequence, motivating the title, is that randomness cannot substantially speed up dynamic programming algorithms.","author":["Stasys Jukna"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Computation Theory","Volume 12","Issue 3","July 2020","Article No.: 17","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/3397476"],"date":"01 June 2020","ref":[{"text":"L.

By isolating such notions as quantum parallelism and interference within a model-theoretic setting, quite divorced from their customary physical trappings, we seek to lay bare their logical underpinnings and possible computational ramifications.In the first part of the paper, a brief account of the relevant model  theory is given, and some new results are derived. In the second part, we model the simplest classical gate, namely the N-gate, propose a quantization scheme (which translates between classical and quantum models, and from which emerges a logical interpretation of the notion of quantum  parallelism), and apply it to the classical N-gate model. A class of physical instantiations of the resulting quantum N-gate model is also briefly discussed.","author":["J. P. Rawling","S. A.

Based upon the theorem, a theoretical test for k-distributivity is proposed and performed in a reasonable amount of computer time, even for k = 16 and a high degree of resolution (for which statistical tests are impossible because of the astronomical amount of computer time required). For the special class of GFSR generators considered by Arvillias and Maritsas based on the primitive trinomial Dp + Dq + 1 with q = an integral power of 2, it is shown that the sequence is k-distributed if and only if the lengths of all subregisters are at least k. The theorem also leads to a simple and efficient method of initializing the GFSR generator so that the sequence to be generated is k-distributed.","author":["M. Fushimi","S.

This paper shows that it is possible to select a key over open communications channels in such a fashion that communications security can be maintained. A method is described which forces any enemy to expend an amount of work which increases as the square of the work required of the two communicants to select the key. The method provides a logically new kind of protection against the passive eavesdropper. It suggests that further research on this topic will be highly rewarding, both in a theoretical and a practical sense.","author":["Ralph C.

In these applications, the advantages FPGA-based systems have over software simulation are diminished by the long run-times of current CAD software used to map the circuit onto FPGAs. To improve the run-time advantage of FPGA systems, users may be willing to trade some mapping quality for a reduction in CAD tool runtimes. In this paper, we seek to establish how much quality degradation is necessary to achieve a given runtime improvement. For this purpose, we implemented and investigated numerous placement and routing algorithms for FPGAs. We also developed new tradeoff-oriented algorithms, where a tuning parameter can be used to control this quality vs. runtime tradeoff. We show how different algorithms can achieve different points within this tradeoff spectrum, as well as how a single algorithm can be tuned to form a curve in the spectrum. We demonstrate that the algorithms vary widely in their tradeoffs, with the fastest algorithm being 8x faster than the slowest, and the highest quality algorithm being 5x better than the least quality algorithm. Compared to the commercial Xilinx CAD tools, we can achieve a 3x speed-up by allowing 1.27x degradation in quality, and a factor of 1.6x quality improvement with 2x slowdown.","author":["Chandra Mulpuri","Scott Hauck"],"issue":["FPGA '01: Proceedings of the 2001 ACM/SIGDA ninth international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2001","Pages   29\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/360276.360294"],"date":"01 February 2001","ref":[{"text":"Peixin Zhong, Margaret Martonosi, Pranav Ashar, and Sharad Malik. \"Accelerating Boolean Satisfiability with Configurable Hardware.

The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes.

We present a clustering algorithm called CBC (Clustering By Committee) that is shown to produce higher quality clusters in document clustering tasks as compared to several well known clustering algorithms. It initially discovers a set of tight clusters (high intra-group similarity), called committees, that are well scattered in the similarity space (low inter-group similarity). The union of the committees is but a subset of all elements. The algorithm proceeds by assigning elements to their most similar committee. Evaluating cluster quality has always been a difficult task. We present a new evaluation methodology that is based on the editing distance between output clusters and manually constructed classes (the answer key). This evaluation measure is more intuitive and easier to interpret than previous evaluation measures.","author":["Patrick Pantel","Dekang Lin"],"issue":["SIGIR '02: Proceedings of the 25th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval","August 2002","Pages   199\u2013206","https://doi.org/10.1145/564376.564412"],"date":"11 August 2002","ref":[{"text":"Buckley, C. and Lewit, A.

The MDM enabled us to perform large scale MD simulations without truncating the Coulomb force. It is composed of MDGRAPE-2, WINE-2 and a host computer. MDGRAPE-2 accelerates the calculation for real-space part of the Coulomb and van der Waals forces. WINE-2 accelerates the calculation for wavenumber-space part of the Coulomb force. The host computer performs other calculations. With the completed MDM system we performed an MD simulation similar to what was the basis of our SC2000 submission for a Gordon Bell prize.

We present a general technique for the efficient implementation of such operations based on an encoding method. The effect of the encoding is to plunge the given ordering into a boolean lattice of binary words, leading to an almost constant time complexity of the lattice operations. A first method is described based on a transitive closure approach. Then a more space-efficient method minimizing code-word length is described. Finally a powerful grouping technique called modulation is presented, which drastically reduces code space while keeping all three lattice operations highly efficient. This technique takes into account idiosyncrasies of the topology of the poset being encoded that are quite likely to occur in practice. All methods are formally justified. We see this work as an original contribution towards using semantic (vz., in this case, taxonomic) information in the engineering pragmatics of storage and retrieval of (vz., partially or quasi-ordered) information.","author":["Hassan A\u00eft-Kaci","Robert Boyer","Patrick Lincoln","Roger Nasr"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems","Volume 11","Issue 1","Jan. 1989","pp   115\u2013146","https://doi.org/10.1145/59287.59293"],"date":"01 January 1989","ref":[{"text":"AHO, V.

We have presented efficient code compression/decompression techniques and architectures in the past. For the commercialization phase, we designed a novel hardware/software code compression/decompression platform (CoCo). It consists of a software platform that prepares, optimizes, compresses and compiles instruction code and a generic, parameterizable FPGA-based hardware architecture in form of a hardware platform that allows to rapidly evaluate prototypes of diverse compression/decompression technologies. We show the flexibility of CoCo, its ability to achieve code compression ratios (parameterizable) of up to 50% with a slight system performance gain and its ability to apply compression on real-world compiled code without any limitations where others have made implicit software-restrictive assumptions.","author":["Haris Lekatsas","J\u00f6rg Henkel","Srimat Chakradhar","Venkata Jakkula","Murugan Sankaradass"],"issue":["DAC '03: Proceedings of the 40th annual Design Automation Conference","June 2003","Pages   306\u2013311","https://doi.org/10.1145/775832.775912"],"date":"02 June 2003","ref":[{"text":"L.

The interrelation among different types of data objects is either not considered, or represented by a static feature space and treated in the same ways as other attributes of the objects. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering approach for clustering multi-type interrelated data objects, ReCoM (Reinforcement Clustering of Multi-type Interrelated data objects). Under this approach, relationships among data objects are used to improve the cluster quality of interrelated data objects through an iterative reinforcement clustering process. At the same time, the link structure derived from relationships of the interrelated data objects is used to differentiate the importance of objects and the learned importance is also used in the clustering process to further improve the clustering results. Experimental results show that the proposed approach not only effectively overcomes the problem of data sparseness caused by the high dimensional relationship space but also significantly improves the clustering accuracy.","author":["Jidong Wang","Huajun Zeng","Zheng Chen","Hongjun Lu","Li Tao","Wei-Ying Ma"],"issue":["SIGIR '03: Proceedings of the 26th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in informaion retrieval","July 2003","Pages   274\u2013281","https://doi.org/10.1145/860435.860486"],"date":"28 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"P.

In our approach, patch regions from a sample image or video are transformed and copied to the output and then stitched together along optimal seams to generate a new (and typically larger) output. In contrast to other techniques, the size of the patch is not chosen a-priori, but instead a graph cut technique is used to determine the optimal patch region for any given offset between the input and output texture. Unlike dynamic programming, our graph cut technique for seam optimization is applicable in any dimension. We specifically explore it in 2D and 3D to perform video texture synthesis in addition to regular image synthesis. We present approximative offset search techniques that work well in conjunction with the presented patch size optimization. We show results for synthesizing regular, random, and natural images and videos. We also demonstrate how this method can be used to interactively merge different images to generate new scenes.","author":["Vivek Kwatra","Arno Sch\u00f6dl","Irfan Essa","Greg Turk","Aaron Bobick"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 22","Issue 3","July 2003","pp   277\u2013286","https://doi.org/10.1145/882262.882264"],"date":"01 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"ASHIKHMIN, M. 2001.

In this paper we study how the storage layer of a database system can benefit from the presence of both kinds of disk. We propose using the flash and the magnetic disk at the same level of the memory hierarchy and placing a data page to only one of these disks according to the workload of the page. Pages with a read-intensive workload are placed on the flash disk, while pages with a write-intensive workload are placed on the magnetic disk. We present a family of on-line algorithms to decide the optimal placement of a page and study their theoretical properties. Our system is self-tuning, i.e., our algorithms adapt page placement to changing workloads. We also present a buffer replacement policy that takes advantage of the asymmetric I/O properties of the two types of storage media to reduce the total I/O cost. Our experimental evaluation shows remarkable I/O performance improvement over both flash-only and magnetic-only systems. These results, we believe, exhibit both the potential and necessity of such algorithms in future database systems.","author":["Ioannis Koltsidas","Stratis D.

The \"pay-as-you-go\" nature of RDF and the flexible pattern-matching capabilities of its query language SPARQL entail efficiency and scalability challenges for complex queries including long join paths. This paper presents the RDF-3X engine, an implementation of SPARQL that achieves excellent performance by pursuing a RISC-style architecture with a streamlined architecture and carefully designed, puristic data structures and operations. The salient points of RDF-3X are: 1) a generic solution for storing and indexing RDF triples that completely eliminates the need for physical-design tuning, 2) a powerful yet simple query processor that leverages fast merge joins to the largest possible extent, and 3) a query optimizer for choosing optimal join orders using a cost model based on statistical synopses for entire join paths. The performance of RDF-3X, in comparison to the previously best state-of-the-art systems, has been measured on several large-scale datasets with more than 50 million RDF triples and benchmark queries that include pattern matching and long join paths in the underlying data graphs.","author":["Thomas Neumann","Gerhard Weikum"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 1","Issue 1","August 2008","pp   647\u2013659","https://doi.org/10.14778/1453856.1453927"],"date":"01 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"D.

One class of techniques to reduce the energy consumption of clusters is to selectively power down nodes during periods of low utilization to increase energy efficiency. One can think of a number of ways of selectively powering down nodes, each with varying impact on the workload response time and overall energy consumption. Since the MapReduce framework is becoming \"ubiquitous\", the focus of this paper is on developing a framework for systematically considering various MapReduce node power down strategies, and their impact on the overall energy consumption and workload response time.We closely examine two extreme techniques that can be accommodated in this framework. The first is based on a recently proposed technique called \"Covering Set\" (CS) that keeps only a small fraction of the nodes powered up during periods of low utilization. At the other extreme is a technique that we propose in this paper, called the All-In Strategy (AIS). AIS uses all the nodes in the cluster to run a workload and then powers down the entire cluster. Using both actual evaluation and analytical modeling we bring out the differences between these two extreme techniques and show that AIS is often the right energy saving strategy.","author":["Willis Lang","Jignesh M.

In this paper, we study string similarity joins with edit-distance constraints, which find similar string pairs from two large sets of strings whose edit distance is within a given threshold. Existing algorithms are efficient either for short strings or for long strings, and there is no algorithm that can efficiently and adaptively support both short strings and long strings. To address this problem, we propose a partition-based method called Pass-Join. Pass-Join partitions a string into a set of segments and creates inverted indices for the segments. Then for each string, Pass-Join selects some of its substrings and uses the selected substrings to find candidate pairs using the inverted indices. We devise efficient techniques to select the substrings and prove that our method can minimize the number of selected substrings. We develop novel pruning techniques to efficiently verify the candidate pairs. Experimental results show that our algorithms are efficient for both short strings and long strings, and outperform state-of-the-art methods on real datasets.","author":["Guoliang Li","Dong Deng","Jiannan Wang","Jianhua Feng"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 5","Issue 3","November 2011","pp   253\u2013264","https://doi.org/10.14778/2078331.2078340"],"date":"01 November 2011","ref":[{"text":"S.

Numerous methods have been proposed to enforce \u03b5-differential privacy in various analytical tasks, e.g., regression analysis. Existing solutions for regression analysis, however, are either limited to non-standard types of regression or unable to produce accurate regression results. Motivated by this, we propose the Functional Mechanism, a differentially private method designed for a large class of optimization-based analyses. The main idea is to enforce \u03b5-differential privacy by perturbing the objective function of the optimization problem, rather than its results. As case studies, we apply the functional mechanism to address two most widely used regression models, namely, linear regression and logistic regression. Both theoretical analysis and thorough experimental evaluations show that the functional mechanism is highly effective and efficient, and it significantly outperforms existing solutions.","author":["Jun Zhang","Zhenjie Zhang","Xiaokui Xiao","Yin Yang","Marianne Winslett"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 5","Issue 11","July 2012","pp   1364\u20131375","https://doi.org/10.14778/2350229.2350253"],"date":"01 July 2012","ref":[{"text":"T.

A number of matching algorithms have been developed that, given a graph pattern Q and a graph G, compute the set M(Q,G) of matches of Q in G. However, these algorithms often return an excessive number of matches, and are expensive on large real-life social graphs. Moreover, in practice many social queries are to find matches of a specific pattern node, rather than the entire M(Q,G).This paper studies top-k graph pattern matching. (1) We revise graph pattern matching defined in terms of simulation, by supporting a designated output node uo. Given G and Q, it is to find those nodes in M(Q,G) that match uo, instead of the large set M(Q,G). (2) We study two classes of functions for ranking the matches: relevance functions \u03b4r() based on, e.g., social impact, and distance functions \u03b4d() to cover diverse elements. (3) We develop two algorithms for computing top-k matches of uo based on \u03b4r(), with the early termination property, i.e., they find top-k matches without computing the entire M(Q,G). (4) We also study diversified top-k matching, a bi-criteria optimization problem based on both \u03b4r() and \u03b4d(). We show that its decision problem is NP-complete. Nonetheless, we provide an approximation algorithm with performance guarantees and a heuristic one with the early termination property. (5) Using real-life and synthetic data, we experimentally verify that our (diversified) top-k matching algorithms are effective, and outperform traditional matching algorithms in efficiency.","author":["Wenfei Fan","Xin Wang","Yinghui Wu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 13","August 2013","pp   1510\u20131521","https://doi.org/10.14778/2536258.2536263"],"date":"01 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"Full version. http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0944873/topk.pdf.","order":1},{"text":"O.

Nevertheless, Hadoop, an open-source equivalent of MapReduce, has been noted to have sub-optimal performance in the database context since it is initially designed to operate on raw data without utilizing any type of indexes. To alleviate the problem, we present ScalaGiST - scalable generalized search tree that can be seamlessly integrated with Hadoop, together with a cost-based data access optimizer for efficient query processing at run-time. ScalaGiST provides extensibility in terms of data and query types, hence is able to support unconventional queries (e.g., multi-dimensional range and k-NN queries) in MapReduce systems, and can be dynamically deployed in large cluster environments for handling big users and data.We have built ScalaGiST and demonstrated that it can be easily instantiated to common B+-tree and R-tree indexes yet for dynamic distributed environments. Our extensive performance study shows that ScalaGiST can provide efficient write and read performance, elastic scaling property, as well as effective support for MapReduce execution of ad-hoc analytic queries. Performance comparisions with recent proposals of specialized distributed index structures, such as SpatialHadoop, Data Mapping, and RT-CAN further confirm its efficiency.","author":["Peng Lu","Gang Chen","Beng Chin Ooi","Hoang Tam Vo","Sai Wu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 14","October 2014","pp   1797\u20131808","https://doi.org/10.14778/2733085.2733087"],"date":"01 October 2014","ref":[{"text":"TPC-H benchmark. {Online} http://www.tpc.org/tpch.","order":1},{"text":"A.

Recently, multiway mergesort implemented with SIMD instructions has been used as a high-performance in-memory sorting algorithm for sorting integer values. For sorting an array of structures with SIMD instructions, a frequently used approach is to first pack the key and index for each record into an integer value, sort the key-index pairs using SIMD instructions, then rearrange the records based on the sorted key-index pairs. This approach can efficiently exploit SIMD instructions because it sorts the key-index pairs while packed into integer values; hence, it can use existing high-performance sorting implementations of the SIMD-based multiway mergesort for integers. However, this approach has frequent cache misses in the final rearranging phase due to its random and scattered memory accesses so that this phase limits both single-thread performance and scalability with multiple cores. Our approach is also based on multiway mergesort, but it can avoid costly random accesses for rearranging the records while still efficiently exploiting the SIMD instructions. Our results showed that our approach exhibited up to 2.1x better single-thread performance than the key-index approach implemented with SIMD instructions when sorting 512M 16-byte records on one core. Our approach also yielded better performance when we used multiple cores. Compared to an optimized radix sort, our vectorized multiway mergesort achieved better performance when the each record is large. Our vectorized multiway mergesort also yielded higher scalability with multiple cores than the radix sort.","author":["Hiroshi Inoue","Kenjiro Taura"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 11","July 2015","pp   1274\u20131285","https://doi.org/10.14778/2809974.2809988"],"date":"01 July 2015","ref":[{"text":"H.

We will demonstrate the following aspects of the DataHub platform: (a) flexible data storage, sharing, and native versioning capabilities: multiple conference attendees can concurrently update the database and browse the different versions and inspect conflicts; (b) an app ecosystem that hosts apps for various data-processing activities: conference attendees will be able to effortlessly ingest, query, and visualize data using our existing apps; (c) thrift-based data serialization permits data analysis in any combination of 20+ languages, with DataHub as the common data store: conference attendees will be able to analyze datasets in R, Python, and Matlab, while the inputs and the results are still stored in DataHub. In particular, conference attendees will be able to use the DataHub notebook---an IPython-based notebook for analyzing data and storing the results of data analysis.","author":["Anant Bhardwaj","Amol Deshpande","Aaron J.

Unlike web search, QA over a knowledge base gives out accurate and concise results, provided that natural language questions can be understood and mapped precisely to structured queries over the knowledge base. The challenge, however, is that a human can ask one question in many different ways. Previous approaches have natural limits due to their representations: rule based approaches only understand a small set of \"canned\" questions, while keyword based or synonym based approaches cannot fully understand the questions. In this paper, we design a new kind of question representation: templates, over a billion scale knowledge base and a million scale QA corpora. For example, for questions about a city's population, we learn templates such as What's the population of $city?, How many people are there in $city?. We learned 27 million templates for 2782 intents. Based on these templates, our QA system KBQA effectively supports binary factoid questions, as well as complex questions which are composed of a series of binary factoid questions. Furthermore, we expand predicates in RDF knowledge base, which boosts the coverage of knowledge base by 57 times. Our QA system beats all other state-of-art works on both effectiveness and efficiency over QALD benchmarks.","author":["Wanyun Cui","Yanghua Xiao","Haixun Wang","Yangqiu Song","Seung-won Hwang","Wei Wang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 5","January 2017","pp   565\u2013576","https://doi.org/10.14778/3055540.3055549"],"date":"01 January 2017","ref":[{"text":"E.

Although a lot of algorithms have been proposed for IM, most of them only work under the non-adaptive setting, i.e., when all k seed nodes are selected before we observe how they influence other users. In this paper, we study the adaptive IM problem, where we select the k seed nodes in batches of equal size b, such that the choice of the i-th batch can be made after the influence results of the first i - 1 batches are observed. We propose the first practical algorithms for adaptive IM with an approximation guarantee of 1 \u2212 exp(\u03be \u2212 1) for b = 1 and 1 \u2212 exp(\u03be \u2212 1 + 1/e) for b > 1, where \u03be is any number in (0, 1). Our approach is based on a novel AdaptGreedy framework instantiated by non-adaptive IM algorithms, and its performance can be substantially improved if the non-adaptive IM algorithm has a small expected approximation error. However, no current non-adaptive IM algorithms provide such a desired property. Therefore, we further propose a non-adaptive IM algorithm called EPIC, which not only has the same worst-case performance bounds with that of the state-of-the-art non-adaptive IM algorithms, but also has a reduced expected approximation error. We also provide a theoretical analysis to quantify the performance gain brought by instantiating AdaptGreedy using EPIC, compared with a naive approach using the existing IM algorithms. Finally, we use real social networks to evaluate the performance of our approach through extensive experiments, and the experimental experiments strongly corroborate the superiorities of our approach.","author":["Kai Han","Keke Huang","Xiaokui Xiao","Jing Tang","Aixin Sun","Xueyan Tang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 9","May 2018","pp   1029\u20131040","https://doi.org/10.14778/3213880.3213883"],"date":"01 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"https://bit.ly/2I3A99p.","order":1},{"text":"http://snap.stanford.edu.","order":2},{"text":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/im-imm/.","order":3},{"text":"A.

To address this, we propose the ACCelerated Operators for Raw Data Analysis (ACCORDA) architecture. By extending the operator interface (subtype with encoding) and employing a uniform runtime worker model, ACCORDA integrates data transformation acceleration seamlessly, enabling a new class of encoding optimizations and robust high-performance raw data processing. Together, these key features preserve the software system architecture, empowering state-of-art heuristic optimizations to drive flexible data encoding for performance. ACCORDA derives performance from its software architecture, but depends critically on the acceleration of the Unstructured Data Processor (UDP) that is integrated into the memory-hierarchy, and accelerates data transformation tasks by 16x-21x (parsing, decompression) to as much as 160x (deserialization) compared to an x86 core.We evaluate ACCORDA using TPC-H queries on tabular data formats, exercising raw data properties such as parsing and data conversion. The ACCORDA system achieves 2.9x-13.2x speedups when compared to SparkSQL, reducing raw data processing overhead to a geomean of 1.2x (20%). In doing so, ACCORDA robustly matches or outperforms prior systems that depend on caching loaded data, while computing on raw, unloaded data.

To demonstrate the effectiveness and language independence of our approach, we present experimental results on Greek, English, and Chinese data. We show that our approach achieves state of the art performance in each of these cases. In particular, we obtain a 18% accuracy improvement over the best published results for a Greek data set, while using a far simpler technique than previous investigations.","author":["Fuchun Peng","Dale Schuurmans","Shaojun Wang","Vlado Keselj"],"issue":["EACL '03: Proceedings of the tenth conference on European chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics - Volume 1","April 2003","Pages   267\u2013274","https://doi.org/10.3115/1067807.1067843"],"date":"12 April 2003","ref":[{"text":"A.

As a result, identifying words is difficult, because of segmentation ambiguities and occurrences of unknown words. Conventionally unknown words were extracted by statistical methods because statistical methods are simple and efficient. However the statistical methods without using linguistic knowledge suffer the drawbacks of low precision and low recall, since character strings with statistical significance might be phrases or partial phrases instead of words and low frequency new words are hardly identifiable by statistical methods. In addition to statistical information, we try to use as much information as possible, such as morphology, syntax, semantics, and world knowledge. The identification system fully utilizes the context and content information of unknown words in the steps of detection process, extraction process, and verification process. A practical unknown word extraction system was implemented which online identifies new words, including low frequency new words, with high precision and high recall rates.","author":["Keh-Jiann Chen","Wei-Yun Ma"],"issue":["COLING '02: Proceedings of the 19th international conference on Computational linguistics - Volume 1","August 2002","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.3115/1072228.1072277"],"date":"24 August 2002","ref":[{"text":"Chang J.

An HMM-based, connected-speech, 38-word vocabulary (alphabet, digits, 'space', 'period'), talker-independent speech recognition system is used for testing performance. Normal performance, with no language model, i.e., raw word-level performance, is currently about 81% for a set of talkers not in the training set and about 91% for training set data. The system has been trained and tested using a close-talking head-mounted microphone. Since a meaningful comparison requires using the same speech, the existing speech database was appropriately pre-filtered, played out through a transducer (speaker) in the room environment, picked-up by the microphone array, and re-stored as a digital file. The resulting file was post-processed and used as input to the recognizer; the recognition performance indicates the effect of the input device. The baseline experiment showed that both a single remote microphone and the beamformed signal reduced performance by 12% in a room with no other talkers. For the array tested, the error is generally attributable to reverberation off the floor and ceiling.","author":["Harvey F. Silverman","Stuart E. Kirtman","John E. Adcock","Paul C.

But search engines often limit the number of available queries. As a result, query-intensive NLP applications such as Information Extraction (IE) distribute their query load over several days, making IE a slow, offline process.This paper introduces a novel architecture for IE that obviates queries to commercial search engines. The architecture is embodied in a system called KnowItNow that performs high-precision IE in minutes instead of days. We compare KnowItNow experimentally with the previously-published KnowItAll system, and quantify the tradeoff between recall and speed. KnowItNow's extraction rate is two to three orders of magnitude higher than KnowItAll's.","author":["Michael J.

The preliminary open tests show that the segmentation precision of CSeg&Tag1.0 is about 98.0% - 99.3%, POS tagging precision about 91.0% - 97.1%, and the recall and precision for unknown words are ranging from 95.0% to 99.0% and from 87.6% to 95.3% respectively.

This paper proposes a method for correcting errors using the statistical features of character co-occurrence, and evaluates the method.The proposed method comprises two successive correcting processes. The first process uses pairs of strings: the first string is an erroneous substring of the utterance predicted by speech recognition, the second string is the corresponding section of the actual utterance. Errors are detected and corrected according to the database learned from erroneous-correct utterance pairs. The remaining errors are passed to the posterior process which uses a string in the corpus that is similar to the string including recognition errors.The results of our evaluation show that the use of our proposed method as a post-processor for speech recognition is likely to make a significant contribution to the performance of speech translation systems.","author":["Satoshi Kaki","Eiichiro Sumita","Hitoshi Iida"],"issue":["ACL '98/COLING '98: Proceedings of the 36th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and 17th International Conference on Computational Linguistics - Volume 1","August 1998","Pages   653\u2013657","https://doi.org/10.3115/980845.980954"],"date":"10 August 1998","ref":[{"text":"T.

This paper introduces several novel ESX Server mechanisms and policies for managing memory. A ballooning technique reclaims the pages considered least valuable by the operating system running in a virtual machine. An idle memory tax achieves efficient memory utilization while maintaining performance isolation guarantees. Content-based page sharing and hot I/O page remapping exploit transparent page remapping to eliminate redundancy and reduce copying overheads. These techniques are combined to efficiently support virtual machine workloads that overcommit memory.","author":["Carl A.

When applied to multiple domains for the same task, it is similar to domain adaptation, but symmetric, rather than limited to improving performance on a target domain. We present a more principled, better performing model for this problem, based on the use of a hierarchical Bayesian prior. Each domain has its own domain-specific parameter for each feature but, rather than a constant prior over these parameters, the model instead links them via a hierarchical Bayesian global prior. This prior encourages the features to have similar weights across domains, unless there is good evidence to the contrary. We show that the method of (Daum\u00e9 III, 2007), which was presented as a simple \"preprocessing step,\" is actually equivalent, except our representation explicitly separates hyperparameters which were tied in his work. We demonstrate that allowing different values for these hyperparameters significantly improves performance over both a strong baseline and (Daum\u00e9 III, 2007) within both a conditional random field sequence model for named entity recognition and a discriminatively trained dependency parser.","author":["Jenny Rose Finkel","Christopher D.
