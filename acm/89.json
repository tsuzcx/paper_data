CC and OR are one-sided metrics while IG and CHI are two-sided. Feature selection using one-sided metrics selects the features most indicative of membership only, while feature selection using two-sided metrics implicitly combines the features most indicative of membership (e.g. positive features) and non-membership (e.g. negative features) by ignoring the signs of features. The former never consider the negative features, which are quite valuable, while the latter cannot ensure the optimal combination of the two kinds of features especially on imbalanced data. In this work, we investigate the usefulness of explicit control of that combination within a proposed feature selection framework. Using multinomial na\u00efve Bayes and regularized logistic regression as classifiers, our experiments show both great potential and actual merits of explicitly combining positive and negative features in a nearly optimal fashion according to the imbalanced data.","author":["Zhaohui Zheng","Xiaoyun Wu","Rohini Srihari"],"issue":["ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter","Volume 6","Issue 1","June 2004","pp   80\u201389","https://doi.org/10.1145/1007730.1007741"],"date":"01 June 2004","ref":[{"text":"S.

This form of resource control makes it possible to share a server among multiple request flows with probabilistic assurance that each flow receives a specified minimum share of a server's capacity to serve requests. This assurance is important for safe outsourcing of services to shared utilities such as Storage Service Providers.Our approach interposes share-based request dispatching on the network path between the server and its clients. Two new scheduling algorithms are designed to run within an intermediary (e.g., a network switch), where they enforce fair sharing by throttling request flows and reordering requests; these algorithms are adaptations of Start-time Fair Queuing (SFQ) for servers with a configurable degree of internal concurrency. A third algorithm, Request Windows (RW), bounds the outstanding requests for each flow independently; it is amenable to a decentralized implementation, but may restrict concurrency under light load. The analysis and experimental results show that these new algorithms can enforce shares effectively when the shares are not saturated, and that they provide acceptable performance isolation under saturation. Although the evaluation uses a storage service as an example, interposed request scheduling is non-intrusive and views the server as a black box, so it is useful for complex services with no internal support for differentiated service quality.","author":["Wei Jin","Jeffrey S.

Architecting voltage islands involves island partition creation, voltage level assignment and floorplanning. The task of island partition creation and level assignment have to be done simultaneously in a floorplanning context due to the physical constraints involved in the design process. This leads to a floorplanning problem formulation that is very different from the traditional floorplanning for ASIC-style design.In this paper, we define the problem of architecting voltage islands in core-based designs and present a new algorithm for simultaneous voltage island partitioning, voltage level assignment and physical-level floorplanning. Application of the proposed algorithm to a few benchmark and industrial examples is demonstrated using a prototype tool. Results show power savings of 14%--28%, depending on the constraints imposed on the number of voltage islands and other physical-level parameters.","author":["Jingcao Hu","Youngsoo Shin","Nagu Dhanwada","Radu Marculescu"],"issue":["ISLPED '04: Proceedings of the 2004 international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2004","Pages   180\u2013185","https://doi.org/10.1145/1013235.1013283"],"date":"09 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"R.

Also central to the framework is a suite of interactive tools that allow the user to specify a variety of high-level image objectives, either globally across the image, or locally through a painting-style interface. Image objectives are applied independently at each pixel location and generally involve a function of the pixel values (such as \"maximum contrast\") drawn from that same location in the set of source images. Typically, a user applies a series of image objectives iteratively in order to create a finished composite. The power of this framework lies in its generality; we show how it can be used for a wide variety of applications, including \"selective composites\" (for instance, group photos in which everyone looks their best), relighting, extended depth of field, panoramic stitching, clean-plate production, stroboscopic visualization of movement, and time-lapse mosaics.","author":["Aseem Agarwala","Mira Dontcheva","Maneesh Agrawala","Steven Drucker","Alex Colburn","Brian Curless","David Salesin","Michael Cohen"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 23","Issue 3","August 2004","pp   294\u2013302","https://doi.org/10.1145/1015706.1015718"],"date":"01 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"AKERS, D., LOSASSO, F., KLINGNER, J., AGRAWALA, M., RICK, J., AND HANRAHAN, P. 2003.

We present a variety of applications that analyze and combine the strengths of such flash/no-flash image pairs. Our applications include denoising and detail transfer (to merge the ambient qualities of the no-flash image with the high-frequency flash detail), white-balancing (to change the color tone of the ambient image), continuous flash (to interactively adjust flash intensity), and red-eye removal (to repair artifacts in the flash image). We demonstrate how these applications can synthesize new images that are of higher quality than either of the originals.","author":["Georg Petschnigg","Richard Szeliski","Maneesh Agrawala","Michael Cohen","Hugues Hoppe","Kentaro Toyama"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 23","Issue 3","August 2004","pp   664\u2013672","https://doi.org/10.1145/1015706.1015777"],"date":"01 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"ADAMS, J., PARULSKI, K.

This area has arisen from the needs of biologists to utilize and help interpret the vast amounts of data that are constantly being gathered in genomic research---and its more recent counterparts, proteomics and functional genomics. The ultimate goal of bioinformatics is to develop in silico models that will complement in vitro and in vivo biological experiments. The article provides a bird's eye view of the basic concepts in molecular cell biology, outlines the nature of the existing data, and describes the kind of computer algorithms and techniques that are necessary to understand cell behavior. The underlying motivation for many of the bioinformatics approaches is the evolution of organisms and the complexity of working with incomplete and noisy data. The topics covered include: descriptions of the current software especially developed for biologists, computer and mathematical cell models, and areas of computer science that play an important role in bioinformatics.","author":["Jacques Cohen"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 36","Issue 2","June 2004","pp   122\u2013158","https://doi.org/10.1145/1031120.1031122"],"date":"01 June 2004","ref":[{"text":"For interesting graphical gallery of biology consult (downloadable drawings) sponsored by the National Health Museum http://www.accessexcellence.org/AB/GG/.","order":1},{"text":"A recommended glossary of genetic terms http://www.ornl.gov/TechResources/Human_Genome/publicat/primer2001/glossary.html.","order":2},{"text":"NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.","order":3},{"text":"A summary of interesting sites in bioinformatics is given by the URLs.","order":4},{"text":"On line lectures in bioinformatics---Heidelberg http://www.dkfz-heidelberg.de/tbi/bioinfo/Biol/Intro/.","order":5},{"text":"A special interest group with news and pointers http://www.bioinformatrix.com.","order":6},{"text":"Bioinformatics Bulletin Board http://bioinformatics.org/faq/&num;education.","order":7},{"text":"Bioinformatics resources http://www.brc.dcs.gla.ac.uk/&sim;actan/resources.html.","order":8},{"text":"Interesting and useful URL's on existing courses.","order":9},{"text":"Jackson's Laboratory Web Page with educational links http://www.jax.org/courses.","order":10},{"text":"Course in bioinformatics (recommended set of slides by R.

We propose a new method, called the minimum spanning tree write, by which a processor in the network should multicast a write of a logical data-item, to all the processors that store replicas of the items. Then we show that the minimum spanning tree write is optimal from the communication cost point of view. We also demonstate that the method by which a write is multicast to all the replicas of a data-item affects the optimal replication scheme of the item, i.e., at which processors in the network the replicas should be located. Therefore, next we consider the problem of determining an optimal replicaiton scheme for a data item,   assuming that each processor employs the minimum spanning tree write at run-time. The problem for general networks is shown NP-Complete, but we provide efficient algorithms to obtain an optimal allocation scheme for three common types of network topologies. They are completely-connected, tree, and ring networks. For these topologies, efficient algorithms are also provided for the case in which reliability considerations dictate a minimum number of replicas.","author":["Ouri Wolfson","Amir Milo"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Database Systems","Volume 16","Issue 1","March 1991","pp   181\u2013205","https://doi.org/10.1145/103140.103146"],"date":"01 March 1991","ref":[{"text":"CASEY, R.G.

Efficiently programming these devices is increasing in difficulty. However, FPGAs continue to be utilized for algorithms traditionally targeted to embedded DSP microprocessors such as signal and image processing applications.This paper presents an architecture that combines VLIW (Very Large Instruction Word) processing with the capability to introduce application specific customized instructions and complex hardware functions. To support this architecture, a compilation and design automation flow are described for programs written in C.Several design tradeoffs for the architecture were examined including number of VLIW functional units and register file size. The architecture was implemented on an Altera Stratix II FPGA. The Stratix II device was selected because it offers a large number of high-speed DSP (digital signal processing) blocks that execute multiply accumulate operations.We show that our combined VLIW with hardware functions exhibit as much as 230X speedup and 63X on average for computational kernels for a set of benchmarks. This allows for an overall speedup of 30X and 12X on average for signal processing benchmarks from the MediaBench.","author":["Alex K.

We collect Web information for objects relevant for a specific application domain and rank these objects in terms of their relevance and popularity to answer user queries. Traditional PageRank model is no longer valid for object popularity calculation because of the existence of heterogeneous relationships between objects. This paper introduces PopRank, a domain-independent object-level link analysis model to rank the objects within a specific domain. Specifically we assign a popularity propagation factor to each type of object relationship, study how different popularity propagation factors for these heterogeneous relationships could affect the popularity ranking, and propose efficient approaches to automatically decide these factors. Our experiments are done using 1 million CS papers, and the experimental results show that PopRank can achieve significantly better ranking results than naively applying PageRank on the object graph.","author":["Zaiqing Nie","Yuanzhi Zhang","Ji-Rong Wen","Wei-Ying Ma"],"issue":["WWW '05: Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web","May 2005","Pages   567\u2013574","https://doi.org/10.1145/1060745.1060828"],"date":"10 May 2005","ref":[{"text":"Citeseer.

There appears to be a general understanding that this is not the right approach. We provide specific arguments that a pure library approach, in which the compiler is designed independently of threading issues, cannot guarantee correctness of the resulting code.We first review why the approach almost works, and then examine some of the surprising behavior it may entail. We further illustrate that there are very simple cases in which a pure library-based approach seems incapable of expressing an efficient parallel algorithm.Our discussion takes place in the context of C with Pthreads, since it is commonly used, reasonably well specified, and does not attempt to ensure type-safety, which would entail even stronger constraints.

Moreover, Unmanned or Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (UUVs, AUVs), equipped with sensors, will find application in exploration of natural undersea resources and gathering of scientific data in collaborative monitoring missions. Underwater acoustic networking is the enabling technology for these applications. Underwater Networks consist of a variable number of sensors and vehicles that are deployed to perform collaborative monitoring tasks over a given area.In this paper, several fundamental key aspects of underwater acoustic communications are investigated. Different architectures for two-dimensional and three-dimensional underwater sensor networks are discussed, and the underwater channel is characterized. The main challenges for the development of efficient networking solutions posed by the underwater environment are detailed at all layers of the protocol stack. Furthermore, open research issues are discussed and possible solution approaches are outlined.","author":["Ian F.

One major source of difficulty is protecting concurrent accesses to shared data with an appropriate synchronization mechanism. Locks are the most common mechanism but they have a number of disadvantages, including possibly unnecessary serialization, and possible deadlock. Transactional memory is an alternative mechanism that makes parallel programming easier. With transactional memory, a transaction provides atomic and serializable operations on an arbitrary set of memory locations. When a transaction commits, all operations within the transaction become visible to other threads. When it aborts, all operations in the transaction are rolled back.Transactional memory can be implemented in either hardware or software. A straightforward hardware approach can have high performance, but imposes strict limits on the amount of data updated in each transaction. A software approach removes these limits, but incurs high overhead. We propose a novel hybrid hardware-software transactional memory scheme that approaches the performance of a hardware scheme when resources are not exhausted and gracefully falls back to a software scheme otherwise.","author":["Sanjeev Kumar","Michael Chu","Christopher J.

By increasing their competence and confidence, and helping them establish a working relationship with their peers, we sought to improve their persistence and performance in the program. We thus focus on student performance and retention through the follow-up class (CS2) as taught at Sam Houston State University. The results are encouraging. We observed that 70% of those students that had the Active Learning experience in CS1 end up getting a passing grade in CS2, with only 10% withdrawing (dropping or resigning), in contrast to a 44% passing rate and 25% withdrawal rate among those that took a regular CS1 class.","author":["Graciela Gonzalez"],"issue":["ACM SIGCSE Bulletin","Volume 38","Issue 1","March 2006","pp   133\u2013137","https://doi.org/10.1145/1124706.1121386"],"date":"03 March 2006","ref":[{"text":"Ben-Ari, Mordechai, \"Constructivism in Computer Science Education\", Journal of Computers in Mathematics and Science Teaching, ACM 2001.","doi":"10.5555/543025.543028","order":1},{"text":"Bloom, B.

By incrementally computing the overlap of the frustum with a slice of grid cells, we accelerate grid traversal by more than a factor of 10, and achieve ray tracing performance competitive with the fastest known packet-based kd-tree ray tracers. The ability to efficiently rebuild the grid on every frame enables this performance even for fully dynamic scenes that typically challenge interactive ray tracing systems.","author":["Ingo Wald","Thiago Ize","Andrew Kensler","Aaron Knoll","Steven G.

A dual instruction set processor, which supports a reduced instruction set (16 bits/instruction), in addition to a full instruction set (32 bits/instruction), allows an opportunity for a tradeoff between these two design criteria. Specifically, while the reduced instruction set can be used to reduce code size by providing smaller instructions, a program compiled into the reduced instruction set typically runs slower than the same program compiled into the full instruction set. Motivated by this observation, we propose a code generation technique that exploits this tradeoff relationship by selectively using the two instruction sets for different sections in the program. The proposed technique, called selective code transformation, not only provides a mechanism to enable a flexible tradeoff between a program's code size and its execution time, but also facilitates program optimization toward enhancing its worst case performance. The results from our experiments show that our proposed technique can be effectively used to fine-tune an application program on a spectrum of code size and execution performance, which, in turn, enables a system-wide optimization on memory space and execution speed involving multiple applications.","author":["Sheayun Lee","Jaejin Lee","Chang Yun Park","Sang Lyul Min"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 6","Issue 2","May 2007","pp   10\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.1145/1234675.1234677"],"date":"01 May 2007","ref":[{"text":"Advanced RISC Machines Ltd. 1995.

The celebrated equivalence of this theorem and inapproximability of certain optimization problems, due to Feige et al. [1996], has placed the PCP theorem at the heart of the area of inapproximability.In this work, we present a new proof of the PCP theorem that draws on this equivalence. We give a combinatorial proof for the NP-hardness of approximating a certain constraint satisfaction problem, which can then be reinterpreted to yield the PCP theorem.Our approach is to consider the unsat value of a constraint system, which is the smallest fraction of unsatisfied constraints, ranging over all possible assignments for the underlying variables. We describe a new combinatorial amplification transformation that doubles the unsat-value of a constraint-system, with only a linear blowup in the size of the system. The amplification step causes an increase in alphabet-size that is corrected by a (standard) PCP composition step. Iterative application of these two steps yields a proof for the PCP theorem.The amplification lemma relies on a new notion of \u201cgraph powering\u201d that can be applied to systems of binary constraints. This powering amplifies the unsat-value of a constraint system provided that the underlying graph structure is an expander.We also extend our amplification lemma towards construction of assignment testers (alternatively, PCPs of Proximity) which are slightly stronger objects than PCPs. We then construct PCPs and locally-testable codes whose length is linear up to a polylog factor, and whose correctness can be probabilistically verified by making a constant number of queries. Namely, we prove SAT \u2208 PCP 1/2,1[log2(n\u22c5poly log n), O(1)].","author":["Irit Dinur"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 54","Issue 3","June 2007","pp   12\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.1145/1236457.1236459"],"date":"01 June 2007","ref":[{"text":"Arora, S. 1994.

Typed proximity search of the form <B>type=personNEAR company~\"IBM\", paper~\"XML\"</B> is an increasingly usefulsearch paradigm in ER graphs. Proximity search implementations either perform a Pagerank-like computation at query time, which is slow, or precompute, store and combine per-word Pageranks, which can be very expensive in terms of preprocessing time and space. We present HubRank, a new system for fast, dynamic, space-efficient proximity searches in ER graphs. During preprocessing, HubRank computesand indexes certain \"sketchy\" random walk fingerprints for a small fraction of nodes, carefully chosen using query log statistics. At query time, a small \"active\" subgraph is identified, bordered bynodes with indexed fingerprints. These fingerprints are adaptively loaded to various resolutions to form approximate personalized Pagerank vectors (PPVs). PPVs at remaining active nodes are now computed iteratively. We report on experiments with CiteSeer's ER graph and millions of real Cite Seer queries. Some representative numbers follow. On our testbed, HubRank preprocesses and indexes 52 times faster than whole-vocabulary PPV computation. A text index occupies 56 MB. Whole-vocabulary PPVs would consume 102GB. If PPVs are truncated to 56 MB, precision compared to true Pagerank drops to 0.55; incontrast, HubRank has precision 0.91 at 63MB.

However, for wide-area network (WAN) migration it is crucial to not just transfer the VMs image but also transfer its local persistent state (its file system) and its on-going network connections. In this paper we address both: by combining a block-level solution with pre-copying and write throttling we show that we can transfer an entire running web server, including its local persistent state, with minimal disruption --- three seconds in the LAN and 68 seconds in the WAN); by combining dynDNS with tunneling, existing connections can continue transparently while new ones are redirected to the new network location. Thus we show experimentally that by combining well-known techniques in a novel manner we can provide system support for migrating virtual execution environments in the wide area.","author":["Robert Bradford","Evangelos Kotsovinos","Anja Feldmann","Harald Schi\u00f6berg"],"issue":["VEE '07: Proceedings of the 3rd international conference on Virtual execution environments","June 2007","Pages   169\u2013179","https://doi.org/10.1145/1254810.1254834"],"date":"13 June 2007","ref":[{"text":"A.

A common approach is to use \"packets\" of rays to amortize cost across sets of rays. Whether \"packets\" can be used to speed up the cost of reflection and refraction rays is unclear. The issue is complicated since such rays do not share common origins and often have less directional coherence than viewing and shadow rays. Since the primary advantage of ray tracing over rasterization is the computation of global effects, such as accurate reflection and refraction, this lack of knowledge should be corrected. We are also interested in exploring whether distribution ray tracing, due to its stochastic properties, further erodes the effectiveness of techniques used to accelerate ray casting. This paper addresses the question of whether packet-based ray tracing algorithms can be effectively used for more than visibility computation. We show that by choosing an appropriate data structure and a suitable packet assembly algorithm we can extend the idea of \"packets\" from ray casting to Whitted-style and distribution ray tracing, while maintaining efficiency.","author":["Solomon Boulos","Dave Edwards","J.

These miniature instruments appear to offer the rare combination of faster, cheaper, and higher-precision analyses in comparison to conventional bench-scale methods. LoCs have been applied to diverse domains such as proteomics, genomics, biochemistry, virology, cell biology, and chemical synthesis. However, to date LoCs have been designed as application-specific chips which incurs significant design effort, turn-around time, and cost, and degrades designer and user productivity. To address these limitations, we envision a programmable LoC (PLoC) and propose a comprehensive fluidic instruction set, called AquaCore Instruction Set (AIS), and a fluidic microarchitecture, called AquaCore, to implement AIS. We present four key design aspects in which the AIS and AquaCore differ from their computer counterparts, and our design decisions made on the basis of the implications of these differences. We demonstrate the use of the PLoC in a range of domains by hand-compiling real-world microfluidic assays in AIS, and show a detailed breakdown of the execution times for the assays and an estimate of the chip area.","author":["Ahmed M.

Therefore, the owner of a sensitive design need not expose the design to possible theft and tampering during its manufacture, dramatically simplifying the process of assuring trust in that design. Modern FPGAs include bitstream security features that turn the fielded design trust problem into an information security problem, with well-known cryptographic information security solutions. The generic nature of the FPGA base array allows the validation expense to be amortized over all designs targeted to that base array. Even the task of checking design tools is simplified by using non-destructive checks of the FPGA design.","author":["Steve Trimberger"],"issue":["DAC '07: Proceedings of the 44th annual Design Automation Conference","June 2007","Pages   5\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/1278480.1278483"],"date":"04 June 2007","ref":[{"text":"Jones, L., \"Single Event Upset (SEU) Detection and Correction Using Virtex-4 Devices\", Xilinx Application Note #714, 2007, http://www.xilinx.com/bvdocs/appnotes/xapp714.pdf","order":1},{"text":"Xilinx Virtex-4 Configuration Users Guide, v1.5, UG 071 2007, http://www.xilinx.com/bvdocs/userguides/ug071.pdf","order":2},{"text":"Thompson, K., \"Reflections on Trusting Trust\",","doi":"10.1145/358198.358210","order":3},{"text":"Bennett, D., Private communication.","order":4},{"text":"Wollinger, T. and Parr, C. \"How Secure are FPGAs in Cryptographic Applications\",","order":5},{"text":"Feng, J. and Seely, J.

Each block of NAND flash memory has a limited number of program/erase cycles, usually 10,000-100,000, and data in a block become unreliable after the limit. For this reason, distributing erase operations evenly across the whole flash memory media is an important concern in designing flash memory storage systems.In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient group-based wear-leveling algorithm. Our group-based algorithm achieves a small memory footprint by grouping several logically sequential blocks and managing only the summary information for each group. We also propose an effective group summary structure and a method to reduce unnecessary wear-leveling operations in order to enhance the wear-leveling performance. The evaluation results show that our group-based algorithm consumes only 8.75% of memory space compared to the previous scheme that manages per-block information, while showing roughly the same wear-leveling performance.","author":["Dawoon Jung","Yoon-Hee Chae","Heeseung Jo","Jin-Soo Kim","Joonwon Lee"],"issue":["CASES '07: Proceedings of the 2007 international conference on Compilers, architecture, and synthesis for embedded systems","September 2007","Pages   160\u2013164","https://doi.org/10.1145/1289881.1289911"],"date":"30 September 2007","ref":[{"text":"A.

While the last decade laid foundation to such promise, it also paved the way for a large number of new techniques and systems, got many new people involved, and triggered stronger association of weakly related fields. In this article, we survey almost 300 key theoretical and empirical contributions in the current decade related to image retrieval and automatic image annotation, and in the process discuss the spawning of related subfields. We also discuss significant challenges involved in the adaptation of existing image retrieval techniques to build systems that can be useful in the real world.

Advances in modern processors, memories, and networks mean that today's computers are vastly different from those of 30 years ago, such that many OLTP databases will now fit in main memory, and most OLTP transactions can be processed in milliseconds or less. Yet database architecture has changed little. Based on this observation, we look at some interesting variants of conventional database systems that one might build that exploit recent hardware trends, and speculate on their performance through a detailed instruction-level breakdown of the major components involved in a transaction processing database system (Shore) running a subset of TPC-C. Rather than simply profiling Shore, we progressively modified it so that after every feature removal or optimization, we had a (faster) working system that fully ran our workload. Overall, we identify overheads and optimizations that explain a total difference of about a factor of 20x in raw performance. We also show that there is no single \"high pole in the tent\" in modern (memory resident) database systems, but that substantial time is spent in logging, latching, locking, B-tree, and buffer management operations.","author":["Stavros Harizopoulos","Daniel J.

We show that with the continued trend of raising array supply to counter process variations, it is more effective to use a per-element selectable virtual power-supply scenario as opposed to single array supply with traditional redundancy schemes. The element can be a bank, a sub-array, or an independent row/column, and the element's virtual supply value is determined based on fail bitmaps. The technique can also be used in conjunction with traditional redundancy schemes to further improve the efficiency. The supply and redundancy assignments can be obtained by relying on memory reconfiguration algorithms. For this, we propose a greedy yet accurate algorithm that runs in O(nlogn) as opposed to average case O(n2) traditional algorithms. The methodology leads to significant power savings ranging from 20% to 50% for 65nm technology. We expect the savings to increase in future technologies as leakage powers dominate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a methodology is applied to SRAM designs.","author":["Rouwaida Kanj","Rajiv Joshi","Zhuo Li","JB Kuang","Hung Ngo","Ying Zhou","Weiping Shi","Sani Nassif"],"issue":["ISLPED '08: Proceedings of the 2008 international symposium on Low Power Electronics & Design","August 2008","Pages   87\u201392","https://doi.org/10.1145/1393921.1393946"],"date":"11 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"S.

An example of relational learning is movie rating prediction, where entities could include users, movies, genres, and actors. Relations encode users' ratings of movies, movies' genres, and actors' roles in movies. A common prediction technique given one pairwise relation, for example a #users x #movies ratings matrix, is low-rank matrix factorization. In domains with multiple relations, represented as multiple matrices, we may improve predictive accuracy by exploiting information from one relation while predicting another. To this end, we propose a collective matrix factorization model: we simultaneously factor several matrices, sharing parameters among factors when an entity participates in multiple relations. Each relation can have a different value type and error distribution; so, we allow nonlinear relationships between the parameters and outputs, using Bregman divergences to measure error. We extend standard alternating projection algorithms to our model, and derive an efficient Newton update for the projection. Furthermore, we propose stochastic optimization methods to deal with large, sparse matrices. Our model generalizes several existing matrix factorization methods, and therefore yields new large-scale optimization algorithms for these problems. Our model can handle any pairwise relational schema and a wide variety of error models. We demonstrate its efficiency, as well as the benefit of sharing parameters among relations.","author":["Ajit P. Singh","Geoffrey J.

Enhancing their performance can significantly improve the quality of arithmetic designs. This is the reason why the theoretical lower bounds on the delay and area of an adder have been analysed, and circuits with performance close to these bounds have been designed. In this paper, we present a novel adder design that is exponentially faster than traditional adders; however, it produces incorrect results, deterministically, for a very small fraction of input combinations. We have also constructed a reliable version of this adder that can detect and correct mistakes when they occur. This creates the possibility of a variable-latency adder that produces a correct result very fast with extremely high probability; however, in some rare cases when an error is detected, the correction term must be applied and the correct result is produced after some time. Since errors occur with extremely low probability, this new type of adder is significantly faster than state-of-the-art adders when the overall latency is averaged over many additions.","author":["Ajay K.

MapReduce is a distributed programming framework originally proposed by Google for the ease of development of web search applications on a large number of commodity CPUs. Compared with CPUs, GPUs have an order of magnitude higher computation power and memory bandwidth, but are harder to program since their architectures are designed as a special-purpose co-processor and their programming interfaces are typically for graphics applications. As the first attempt to harness GPU's power for MapReduce, we developed Mars on an NVIDIA G80 GPU, which contains over one hundred processors, and evaluated it in comparison with Phoenix, the state-of-the-art MapReduce framework on multi-core CPUs. Mars hides the programming complexity of the GPU behind the simple and familiar MapReduce interface. It is up to 16 times faster than its CPU-based counterpart for six common web applications on a quad-core machine.","author":["Bingsheng He","Wenbin Fang","Qiong Luo","Naga K.

Many existing approaches to recommender systems can neither handle very large datasets nor easily deal with users who have made very few ratings or even none at all. Moreover, traditional recommender systems assume that all the users are independent and identically distributed; this assumption ignores the social interactions or connections among users. In view of the exponential growth of information generated by online social networks, social network analysis is becoming important for many Web applications. Following the intuition that a person's social network will affect personal behaviors on the Web, this paper proposes a factor analysis approach based on probabilistic matrix factorization to solve the data sparsity and poor prediction accuracy problems by employing both users' social network information and rating records. The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets since it scales linearly with the number of observations, while the experimental results shows that our method performs much better than the state-of-the-art approaches, especially in the circumstance that users have made few or no ratings.","author":["Hao Ma","Haixuan Yang","Michael R.

It is important to limit such overheads as processor resources become constrained and error propensity increases. The continuing decrease in SRAM cell size and the growing capacity of caches increases the likelihood of errors in SRAM arrays. To address this, redundant information can be used to correct a value after an error occurs. Information redundancy is typically provided through error-correcting codes (ECC), which append bits to every SRAM row and increase the array's area and energy consumption. We make three observations regarding error protection and utilize them in our architecture: (1) much of the data in a cache is replicated throughout the hierarchy and is inherently redundant; (2) error-detection is necessary for every cache access and is cheaper than error correction, which is very infrequent; (3) redundant information for correction need not be stored in high-cost SRAM. Our unique architecture only dedicates SRAM for error detection while the ECC bits are stored within the memory hierarchy as data. We associate a physical memory address with each cache line for ECC storage and rely on locality to minimize the impact. The cache is dynamically and transparently partitioned between data and ECC with the fraction of ECC growing with the number of dirty cache lines. We show that this has little impact on both performance (1.3% average and < 4%) and memory traffic (3%) across a range of memory-intensive applications.","author":["Doe Hyun Yoon","Mattan Erez"],"issue":["ISCA '09: Proceedings of the 36th annual international symposium on Computer architecture","June 2009","Pages   116\u2013127","https://doi.org/10.1145/1555754.1555771"],"date":"20 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"H.

Here we investigate the effect of compensation on performance in the context of two experiments, conducted on Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT). We find that increased financial incentives increase the quantity, but not the quality, of work performed by participants, where the difference appears to be due to an \"anchoring\" effect: workers who were paid more also perceived the value of their work to be greater, and thus were no more motivated than workers paid less. In contrast with compensation levels, we find the details of the compensation scheme do matter---specifically, a \"quota\" system results in better work for less pay than an equivalent \"piece rate\" system. Although counterintuitive, these findings are consistent with previous laboratory studies, and may have real-world analogs as well.","author":["Winter Mason","Duncan J.

However, current methods for the synthesis of reversible logic are limited, i.e. they are applicable to relatively small functions only. In this paper, we propose a synthesis approach, that can cope with Boolean functions containing more than a hundred of variables. We present a technique to derive reversible circuits for a function given by a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD). The circuit is obtained using an algorithm with linear worst case behavior regarding run-time and space requirements. Furthermore, the size of the resulting circuit is bounded by the BDD size. This allows to transfer theoretical results known from BDDs to reversible circuits. Experiments show better results (with respect to the circuit cost) and a significantly better scalability in comparison to previous synthesis approaches.","author":["Robert Wille","Rolf Drechsler"],"issue":["DAC '09: Proceedings of the 46th Annual Design Automation Conference","July 2009","Pages   270\u2013275","https://doi.org/10.1145/1629911.1629984"],"date":"26 July 2009","ref":[{"text":"R.

Oceans of data generated by social media like Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and YouTube present opportunities and challenges to studying collective behavior in a large scale. In this work, we aim to learn to predict collective behavior in social media. In particular, given information about some individuals, how can we infer the behavior of unobserved individuals in the same network? A social-dimension based approach is adopted to address the heterogeneity of connections presented in social media. However, the networks in social media are normally of colossal size, involving hundreds of thousands or even millions of actors. The scale of networks entails scalable learning of models for collective behavior prediction. To address the scalability issue, we propose an edge-centric clustering scheme to extract sparse social dimensions. With sparse social dimensions, the social-dimension based approach can efficiently handle networks of millions of actors while demonstrating comparable prediction performance as other non-scalable methods.","author":["Lei Tang","Huan Liu"],"issue":["CIKM '09: Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management","November 2009","Pages   1107\u20131116","https://doi.org/10.1145/1645953.1646094"],"date":"02 November 2009","ref":[{"text":"J.

Redundancy solutions such as RAID can potentially be used to protect against the high Bit Error Rate (BER) of aging SSDs. Unfortunately, such solutions wear out redundant devices at similar rates, inducing correlated failures as arrays age in unison. We present Diff-RAID, a new RAID variant that distributes parity unevenly across SSDs to create age disparities within arrays. By doing so, Diff-RAID balances the high BER of old SSDs against the low BER of young SSDs. Diff-RAID provides much greater reliability for SSDs compared to RAID-4 and RAID-5 for the same space overhead, and offers a trade-off curve between throughput and reliability.","author":["Asim Kadav","Mahesh Balakrishnan","Vijayan Prabhakaran","Dahlia Malkhi"],"issue":["ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","Volume 44","Issue 1","January 2010","pp   55\u201359","https://doi.org/10.1145/1740390.1740403"],"date":"12 March 2010","ref":[{"text":"Intel Corporation.

Our basic idea is to prevent a primary block with many free pages from being erased in a merge operation. The preserved primary blocks are further reused as replacement blocks. In such a way, the space utilization and the number of erase counts for each block in NAND flash can be enhanced. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ a reuse-aware strategy in FTL for improving the space utilization and endurance of NAND flash. We conduct experiments on a set of traces that collected from real workload in daily life. The experimental results show that our technique has significant improvement on space utilization, block lifetime and wear-leveling compared with the previous work.","author":["Yi Wang","Duo Liu","Meng Wang","Zhiwei Qin","Zili Shao","Yong Guan"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 45","Issue 4","April 2010","pp   163\u2013172","https://doi.org/10.1145/1755951.1755912"],"date":"13 April 2010","ref":[{"text":"DiskMon for Windows v2.01. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896646.aspx, 2010.","order":1},{"text":"Intel Corporation.

Apart from ad hoc analysis of data and creation of business intelligence dashboards by analysts across the company, a number of Facebook's site features are also based on analyzing large data sets. These features range from simple reporting applications like Insights for the Facebook Advertisers, to more advanced kinds such as friend recommendations. In order to support this diversity of use cases on the ever increasing amount of data, a flexible infrastructure that scales up in a cost effective manner, is critical. We have leveraged, authored and contributed to a number of open source technologies in order to address these requirements at Facebook. These include Scribe, Hadoop and Hive which together form the cornerstones of the log collection, storage and analytics infrastructure at Facebook. In this paper we will present how these systems have come together and enabled us to implement a data warehouse that stores more than 15PB of data (2.5PB after compression) and loads more than 60TB of new data (10TB after compression) every day. We discuss the motivations behind our design choices, the capabilities of this solution, the challenges that we face in day today operations and future capabilities and improvements that we are working on.","author":["Ashish Thusoo","Zheng Shao","Suresh Anthony","Dhruba Borthakur","Namit Jain","Joydeep Sen Sarma","Raghotham Murthy","Hao Liu"],"issue":["SIGMOD '10: Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data","June 2010","Pages   1013\u20131020","https://doi.org/10.1145/1807167.1807278"],"date":"06 June 2010","ref":[{"text":"Apache Hadoop wiki.

In this paper, we ask the question: can we perform indoor localization with no pre-deployment effort? Our setting is an indoor space, such as an office building or a mall, with WiFi coverage but where we do not assume knowledge of the physical layout, including the placement of the APs. Users carrying WiFi-enabled devices such as smartphones traverse this space in normal course. The mobile devices record Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements corresponding to APs in their view at various (unknown) locations and report these to a localization server. Occasionally, a mobile device will also obtain and report a location fix, say by obtaining a GPS lock at the entrance or near a window. The centerpiece of our work is the EZ Localization algorithm, which runs on the localization server. The key intuition is that all of the observations reported to the server, even the many from unknown locations, are constrained by the physics of wireless propagation. EZ models these constraints and then uses a genetic algorithm to solve them. The results from our deployment in two different buildings are promising. Despite the absence of any explicit pre-deployment calibration, EZ yields a median localization error of 2m and 7m, respectively, in a small building and a large building, which is only somewhat worse than the 0.7m and 4m yielded by the best-performing but calibration-intensive Horus scheme [29] from prior work.","author":["Krishna Chintalapudi","Anand Padmanabha Iyer","Venkata N.

This paper proposes a novel Demand-based block-level Address mapping scheme with two-level Caching mechanism (DAC) for large-scale NAND flash storage systems. The objective is to reduce RAM footprint without sacrificing too much system response time. In our technique, the block-level address mapping table is stored in fixed pages (called translation pages) in the flash memory. Considering temporal locality that workloads exhibit, we maintain one cache in RAM to store the on-demand block-level address mapping information. Meanwhile, by exploring both spatial locality and access frequency of workloads with another two caches, the second-level cache is designed to cache selected translation pages into RAM. In such a way, address mapping information for both sequential accesses and most-frequently-accessed translation pages can be found in the cache, and therefore, the system response time can be improved. We conduct experiments on a mixture of real-world and synthetic traces. The experimental results show that our technique can significantly reduce the RAM footprint while the average response time is kept well under control. Moreover, our technique shows big improvement on wear-leveling compared with the previous work.","author":["Zhiwei Qin","Yi Wang","Duo Liu","Zili Shao"],"issue":["CODES/ISSS '10: Proceedings of the eighth IEEE/ACM/IFIP international conference on Hardware/software codesign and system synthesis","October 2010","Pages   173\u2013182","https://doi.org/10.1145/1878961.1878991"],"date":"24 October 2010","ref":[{"text":"DiskMon for Windows. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896646.aspx.","order":1},{"text":"Intel Corporation.

Even with sophisticated branch prediction techniques, many frequently executed branches remain difficult to predict. An architecture supporting predicated execution may allow the compiler to remove many of these hard-to-predict branches, reducing the number of branch mispredictions and thereby improving performance. We present an in-depth analysis of the characteristics of those branches which are frequently mispredicted and examine the effectiveness of an advanced compiler to eliminate these branches. Over the benchmarks studied, an average of 27% of the dynamic branches and 56% of the dynamic branch mispredictions are eliminated with predicated execution support.","author":["Scott A.

The rationale behind vertical partitioning is to produce fragments, groups of attribute columns, that \u201cclosely match\u201d the requirements of transactions.Vertical partitioning is applied in three contexts: a database stored on devices of a single type, a database stored in different memory levels, and a distributed database. In a two-level memory hierarchy, most transactions should be processed using the fragments in primary memory. In distributed databases, fragment allocation should maximize the amount of local transaction processing.Fragments may be nonoverlapping or overlapping. A two-phase approach for the determination of fragments is proposed; in the first phase, the design is driven by empirical objective functions which do not require specific cost information. The second phase performs cost optimization by incorporating the knowledge of a specific application environment. The algorithms presented in this paper have been implemented, and examples of their actual use are shown.","author":["Shamkant Navathe","Stefano Ceri","Gio Wiederhold","Jinglie Dou"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Database Systems","Volume 9","Issue 4","Dec. 1984","pp   680\u2013710","https://doi.org/10.1145/1994.2209"],"date":"05 December 1984","ref":[{"text":"BABAD, M.J.

By classifying I/O, a computer system can request that different classes of data be handled with different storage system policies. Specifically, when a storage system is first initialized, we assign performance policies to predefined classes, such as the filesystem journal. Then, online, we include a classifier with each I/O command (e.g., SCSI), thereby allowing the storage system to enforce the associated policy for each I/O that it receives. Our immediate application is caching. We present filesystem prototypes and a database proof-of-concept that classify all disk I/O --- with very little modification to the filesystem, database, and operating system. We associate caching policies with various classes (e.g., large files shall be evicted before metadata and small files), and we show that end-to-end file system performance can be improved by over a factor of two, relative to conventional caches like LRU. And caching is simply one of many possible applications. As part of our ongoing work, we are exploring other classes, policies and storage system mechanisms that can be used to improve end-to-end performance, reliability and security.","author":["Michael Mesnier","Feng Chen","Tian Luo","Jason B.

In spite of this, their success has been limited by the distortions that plague the simulated shapes. This article presents a novel algorithm for wildfire simulation through Cellular Automata (CA), which is able to effectively mitigate the problem of distorted fire shapes. Such a result is obtained allowing spread directions that are not constrained to the few angles imposed by the lattice of cells and the neighborhood size. The characteristics of the proposed algorithm are empirically investigated under homogeneous conditions through some comparisons with the outcomes of a typical CA-based simulator. Also, using two significant heterogeneous landscapes, a comparison with the vector-based simulator FARSITE is discussed. According to the results of this study, the proposed approach performs significantly better, in terms of accuracy, than the CA taken as reference.

However, most of the existing training methods are designed by assuming that data can be stored in the computer memory. These methods cannot be easily applied to data larger than the memory capacity due to the random access to the disk. We propose and analyze a block minimization framework for data larger than the memory size. At each step a block of data is loaded from the disk and handled by certain learning methods. We investigate two implementations of the proposed framework for primal and dual SVMs, respectively. Because data cannot fit in memory, many design considerations are very different from those for traditional algorithms. We discuss and compare with existing approaches that are able to handle data larger than memory. Experiments using data sets 20 times larger than the memory demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","author":["Hsiang-Fu Yu","Cho-Jui Hsieh","Kai-Wei Chang","Chih-Jen Lin"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data","Volume 5","Issue 4","February 2012","Article No.: 23","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/2086737.2086743"],"date":"01 February 2012","ref":[{"text":"1999.","order":1},{"text":"2007.

However, current standard DDRx DIMM memory interfaces are not well tailored to achieve high energy efficiency and performance in modern chip-multiprocessor-based computer systems. Their suboptimal performance and energy inefficiency can have a significant impact on system-wide efficiency since much of the system power dissipation is due to memory power. New memory interfaces, better suited for future many-core systems, are needed. In response, there are recent proposals to enhance the energy efficiency of main-memory systems by dividing a memory rank into subsets, and making a subset rather than a whole rank serve a memory request.We holistically assess the effectiveness of rank subsetting from system-wide performance, energy-efficiency, and reliability perspectives. We identify the impact of rank subsetting on memory power and processor performance analytically, compare two promising rank-subsetting proposals, Multicore DIMM and mini-rank, and verify our analysis by simulating a chip-multiprocessor system using multithreaded and consolidated workloads. We extend the design of Multicore DIMM for high-reliability systems and show that compared with conventional chipkill approaches, rank subsetting can lead to much higher system-level energy efficiency and performance at the cost of additional DRAM devices. This holistic assessment shows that rank subsetting offers compelling alternatives to existing processor-memory interfaces for future DDR systems.","author":["Jung Ho Ahn","Norman P.

However, applying factorization approaches to a new prediction problem is a nontrivial task and requires a lot of expert knowledge. Typically, a new model is developed, a learning algorithm is derived, and the approach has to be implemented.Factorization machines (FM) are a generic approach since they can mimic most factorization models just by feature engineering. This way, factorization machines combine the generality of feature engineering with the superiority of factorization models in estimating interactions between categorical variables of large domain. libFM is a software implementation for factorization machines that features stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and alternating least-squares (ALS) optimization, as well as Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monto Carlo (MCMC).

However, with the increasing maturity of digital microfluidic research, online synthesis is becoming a realistic possibility that can bring new benefits in the areas of dynamic scheduling, control-flow, fault-tolerance and live-feedback. This paper contributes to the digital microfluidic synthesis process by introducing a fast, novel path-based scheduling algorithm that produces better schedules than list scheduler for assays with high fan-out; path scheduler computes schedules in milliseconds, making it suitable for both offline and online synthesis.","author":["Daniel Grissom","Philip Brisk"],"issue":["DAC '12: Proceedings of the 49th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2012","Pages   26\u201335","https://doi.org/10.1145/2228360.2228367"],"date":"03 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"K.

Traditionally, the BSB model was realized at software level and carried out on high-performance computing clusters. To improve computation efficiency and reduce resources requirement, we propose a hardware realization by utilizing memristor crossbar arrays. In this work, we explore the potential of a memristor crossbar array as an auto-associative memory. More specificly, the recall function of a multi-answer character recognition based on BSB model was realized. The robustness of the proposed BSB circuit was analyzed and evaluated based on massive Monte-Carlo simulations, considering input defects, process variations, and electrical fluctuations. The physical constrains when implementing a neural network with memristor crossbar array have also been discussed. Our results show that the BSB circuit has a high tolerance to random noise. Comparably, the correlations between memristor arrays introduces directional noise and hence dominates the quality of circuits.","author":["Miao Hu","Hai Li","Qing Wu","Garrett S.

The Achilles' heel in such devices that limits performance is the storage. Low-end flash memory is the storage technology of choice in such devices due to energy, size, and cost considerations. In this paper, we take a critical look at the performance of flash on smartphones for mobile applications. Specifically, we ask the question whether the state-of-the-art buffer cache replacement schemes proposed thus far (both flash-agnostic and flash-aware ones) are the right ones for mobile flash storage. To answer this question, we first expose the limitations of current buffer cache performance evaluation methods, and propose a novel evaluation framework that is a hybrid between trace-driven simulation and real implementation of such schemes inside an operating system. Such an evaluation reveals some unexpected and surprising insights on the performance of buffer management schemes that contradicts conventional wisdom. Armed with this knowledge, we propose a new buffer cache replacement scheme called SpatialClock.Using our evaluation framework, we show the superior performance of SpatialClock relative to the state-of-the-art for mobile flash storage.","author":["Hyojun Kim","Moonkyung Ryu","Umakishore Ramachandran"],"issue":["ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review","Volume 40","Issue 1","June 2012","pp   235\u2013246","https://doi.org/10.1145/2318857.2254786"],"date":"11 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"Android Open Source Project. http://source.android.com/index.html.","order":1},{"text":"Google Nexus One. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_One.","order":2},{"text":"G.

The explosion of textual information on the Read/Write Web coupled with the increasing demand for ontologies to power the Semantic Web have made (semi-)automatic ontology learning from text a very promising research area. This together with the advanced state in related areas, such as natural language processing, have fueled research into ontology learning over the past decade. This survey looks at how far we have come since the turn of the millennium and discusses the remaining challenges that will define the research directions in this area in the near future.","author":["Wilson Wong","Wei Liu","Mohammed Bennamoun"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 44","Issue 4","August 2012","Article No.: 20","pp   1\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/2333112.2333115"],"date":"07 September 2012","ref":[{"text":"Abou-Assali, A., Lenne, D., and Debray, B. 2007.

A standard approach distributes the graph over a cluster of nodes, but performing computations on a distributed graph is expensive if large amount of data have to be moved. Without partitioning the graph, communication quickly becomes a limiting factor in scaling the system up. Existing graph partitioning heuristics incur high computation and communication cost on large graphs, sometimes as high as the future computation itself. Observing that the graph has to be loaded into the cluster, we ask if the partitioning can be done at the same time with a lightweight streaming algorithm. We propose natural, simple heuristics and compare their performance to hashing and METIS, a fast, offline heuristic. We show on a large collection of graph datasets that our heuristics are a significant improvement, with the best obtaining an average gain of 76%. The heuristics are scalable in the size of the graphs and the number of partitions. Using our streaming partitioning methods, we are able to speed up PageRank computations on Spark, a distributed computation system, by 18% to 39% for large social networks.","author":["Isabelle Stanton","Gabriel Kliot"],"issue":["KDD '12: Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2012","Pages   1222\u20131230","https://doi.org/10.1145/2339530.2339722"],"date":"12 August 2012","ref":[{"text":"http://facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics, Jan 2012.","order":1},{"text":"http://pywebgraph.sourceforge.net.","order":2},{"text":"http://research.microsoft.com/ldg, Jan 2012.","order":3},{"text":"http://research.microsoft.com/trinity, Jan 2012.","order":4},{"text":"http://staffweb.cms.gre.ac.uk/ wc06/partition.","order":5},{"text":"K.

It is a program optimization technique, perhaps better called program specialization, closely related to but different from J\u00f8rring and Scherlis' staging transformations [1986]. It emphasizes, in comparison with Burstall and Darlington [1977] and J\u00f8rring and Scherlis [1986] and other program transformation work, full automation and the generation of program generators as well as transforming single programs. Much partial evaluation work to date has concerned automatic compiler generation from an interpretive definition of programming language, but it also has important applications to scientific computing, logic programming, metaprogramming, and expert systems; some pointers are given later.","author":["Neil D.

We analyze its throughput, single server delay, and end-to-end delay guarantee for variable rate Fluctuation Constrained (FC) and Exponentially Bounded Fluctuation (EBF) servers. We show that SFQ is better suited than Weighted Fair Queuing for integrated services networks and it is strictly better than Self Clocked Fair Queuing. To support heterogeneous services and multiple protocol families in integrated services networks, we present a hierarchical SFQ scheduler and derive its performance bounds. Our analysis demonstrates that SFQ is suitable for integrated services networks since it: (1) achieves low average as well as maximum delay for low-throughput applications (e.g., interactive audio, telnet, etc.); (2) provides fairness which is desirable for VBR video; (3) provides fairness, regardless of variation in a server capacity, for throughput-intensive, flow-controlled data applications; (4) enables hierarchical link sharing which is desirable for managing heterogeneity; and (5) is computationally efficient.","author":["Pawan Goyal","Harrick M.

Current deployments use commodity servers with high-end processors. However, given the cost-sensitivity of internet services and the recent proliferation of volume low-power System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, we see an opportunity for alternative architectures. We undertake a detailed characterization of memcached to reveal performance and power inefficiencies. Our study considers both high-performance and low-power CPUs and NICs across a variety of carefully-designed benchmarks that exercise the range of memcached behavior. We discover that, regardless of CPU microarchitecture, memcached execution is remarkably inefficient, saturating neither network links nor available memory bandwidth. Instead, we find performance is typically limited by the per-packet processing overheads in the NIC and OS kernel---long code paths limit CPU performance due to poor branch predictability and instruction fetch bottlenecks. Our insights suggest that neither high-performance nor low-power cores provide a satisfactory power-performance trade-off, and point to a need for tighter integration of the network interface. Hence, we argue for an alternate architecture---Thin Servers with Smart Pipes (TSSP)---for cost-effective high-performance memcached deployment. TSSP couples an embedded-class low-power core to a memcached accelerator that can process GET requests entirely in hardware, offloading both network handling and data look up. We demonstrate the potential benefits of our TSSP architecture through an FPGA prototyping platform, and show the potential for a 6X-16X power-performance improvement over conventional server baselines.","author":["Kevin Lim","David Meisner","Ali G.

However, in the context of the resilience ecosystem, ABFT is completely opaque to any underlying hardware resilience mechanisms. As a result, some data structures are over-protected by ABFT and hardware, which leads to redundant costs in terms of performance and energy. In this paper, we rethink ABFT using an integrated view including both software and hardware with the goal of improving performance and energy efficiency of ABFT-enabled applications. In particular, we study how to coordinate ABFT and error-correcting code (ECC) for main memory, and investigate the impact of this coordination on performance, energy, and resilience for ABFT-enabled applications. Scaling tests and analysis indicate that our approach saves up to 25% for system energy (and up to 40% for dynamic memory energy) with up to 18% performance improvement over traditional approaches of ABFT with ECC.","author":["Dong Li","Zizhong Chen","Panruo Wu","Jeffrey S.

Silo was designed from the ground up to use system memory and caches efficiently. For instance, it avoids all centralized contention points, including that of centralized transaction ID assignment. Silo's key contribution is a commit protocol based on optimistic concurrency control that provides serializability while avoiding all shared-memory writes for records that were only read. Though this might seem to complicate the enforcement of a serial order, correct logging and recovery is provided by linking periodically-updated epochs with the commit protocol. Silo provides the same guarantees as any serializable database without unnecessary scalability bottlenecks or much additional latency. Silo achieves almost 700,000 transactions per second on a standard TPC-C workload mix on a 32-core machine, as well as near-linear scalability. Considered per core, this is several times higher than previously reported results.","author":["Stephen Tu","Wenting Zheng","Eddie Kohler","Barbara Liskov","Samuel Madden"],"issue":["SOSP '13: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","November 2013","Pages   18\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/2517349.2522713"],"date":"03 November 2013","ref":[{"text":"D.

The byte-addressability and high density of NVM enable computer architects to build large-scale main memory systems. NVM has also been shown to be a promising alternative to conventional persistent store. With NVM, programmers can persistently retain in-memory data structures without writing them to disk. Therefore, one can envision that in the future, NVM will play the role of both working memory and persistent store at the same time. Persistent store demands consistency and durability guarantees, thereby imposing new design constraints on the memory system. Consistency is achieved at the expense of serializing multiple write operations. Durability requires memory cells to guarantee non-volatility and thus reduces the write speed. Therefore, a unified architecture oblivious to these two use cases would lead to suboptimal design. In this paper, we propose a novel unified working memory and persistent store architecture, NVM Duet, which provides the required consistency and durability guarantees for persistent store while relaxing these constraints if accesses to NVM are for working memory. A cross-layer design approach is adopted to achieve the design goal. Overall, simulation results demonstrate that NVM Duet achieves up to 1.68x (1.32x on average) speedup compared with the baseline design.","author":["Ren-Shuo Liu","De-Yu Shen","Chia-Lin Yang","Shun-Chih Yu","Cheng-Yuan Michael Wang"],"issue":["ASPLOS '14: Proceedings of the 19th international conference on Architectural support for programming languages and operating systems","February 2014","Pages   455\u2013470","https://doi.org/10.1145/2541940.2541957"],"date":"24 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"SNIA non volatile memory (NVM) programming technical work group (TWG). http://snia.org/forums/sssi/nvmp.","order":1},{"text":"JESD218A: Solid-state drive (SSD) requirements and endurance test method, Feb. 2011.","order":2},{"text":"Process integration, devices, and structures (PIDS).

In this paper we study the page reference behavior of a collection of memory-intensive applications, and propose a new virtual memory page replacement algorithm, SEQ. SEQ detects long sequences of page faults and applies most-recently-used replacement to those sequences. Simulations show that for a large class of applications, SEQ performs close to the optimal replacement algorithm, and significantly better than Least-Recently-Used (LRU). In addition, SEQ performs similarly to LRU for applications that do not exhibit sequential faulting.","author":["Gideon Glass","Pei Cao"],"issue":["SIGMETRICS '97: Proceedings of the 1997 ACM SIGMETRICS international conference on Measurement and modeling of computer systems","June 1997","Pages   115\u2013126","https://doi.org/10.1145/258612.258681"],"date":"01 June 1997","ref":[{"text":"A.V.

Meanwhile, the usage of FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) for computation acceleration has made significant inroads into multiple application domains due to their ability to achieve high throughput and predictable latency, while providing programmability, low power consumption and time-to-value. Many types of workloads, e.g. databases, big data analytics, and high performance computing, can be and have been accelerated by FPGAs. As more and more workloads are being deployed in the cloud, it is appropriate to consider how to make FPGAs and their capabilities available in the cloud. However, such integration is non-trivial due to issues related to FPGA resource abstraction and sharing, compatibility with applications and accelerator logics, and security, among others. In this paper, a general framework for integrating FPGAs into the cloud is proposed and a prototype of the framework is implemented based on OpenStack, Linux-KVM and Xilinx FPGAs. The prototype enables isolation between multiple processes in multiple VMs, precise quantitative acceleration resource allocation, and priority-based workload scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this prototype, an acceptable overhead, and good scalability when hosting multiple VMs and processes.","author":["Fei Chen","Yi Shan","Yu Zhang","Yu Wang","Hubertus Franke","Xiaotao Chang","Kun Wang"],"issue":["CF '14: Proceedings of the 11th ACM Conference on Computing Frontiers","May 2014","Article No.: 3","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2597917.2597929"],"date":"20 May 2014","ref":[{"text":"Kernel Based Virtual Machine.

The coupled analysis of IVR and digital logic considering variations in the integrated passives, power train FETs and controller transistors shows, compared to an off-chip VR, variations in IVR induce much larger shifts in the operating frequency of the logic and total system power. Variations in the output filter passives cause most prominent variations in the system power and performance, particularly pronounced at low voltage operation of the core. We also show that the mean performance of the system can be traded-off to reduce the variability by modifying IVR parameters, such as controller zeroes or output capacitors.","author":["Monodeep Kar","Sergio Carlo","Harish K.

Several directory-based schemes have been proposed, but dynamic, non-uniform sharing make efficient directory storage challenging, with each giving up storage space, performance or energy. We introduce SpongeDirectory, a sparse directory structure that exploits multi-level memristory technology. SpongeDirectory expands directory storage in-place when needed by increasing the number of bits stored on a single memristor device, trading latency and energy for storage.  We explore several SpongeDirectory configurations, finding that a provisioning rate of 0.5x with memristors optimized for low energy consumption is the most competitive. This optimal SpongeDirectory configuration has performance comparable to a conventional sparse directory, requires 18\u00d7 less storage space, and consumes 8\u00d7 less energy.","author":["Lunkai Zhang","Dmitri Strukov","Hebatallah Saadeldeen","Dongrui Fan","Mingzhe Zhang","Diana Franklin"],"issue":["PACT '14: Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on Parallel architectures and compilation","August 2014","Pages   61\u201374","https://doi.org/10.1145/2628071.2628081"],"date":"24 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"M.

Urban computing aims to tackle these issues by using the data that has been generated in cities (e.g., traffic flow, human mobility, and geographical data). Urban computing connects urban sensing, data management, data analytics, and service providing into a recurrent process for an unobtrusive and continuous improvement of people's lives, city operation systems, and the environment. Urban computing is an interdisciplinary field where computer sciences meet conventional city-related fields, like transportation, civil engineering, environment, economy, ecology, and sociology in the context of urban spaces. This article first introduces the concept of urban computing, discussing its general framework and key challenges from the perspective of computer sciences. Second, we classify the applications of urban computing into seven categories, consisting of urban planning, transportation, the environment, energy, social, economy, and public safety and security, presenting representative scenarios in each category. Third, we summarize the typical technologies that are needed in urban computing into four folds, which are about urban sensing, urban data management, knowledge fusion across heterogeneous data, and urban data visualization. Finally, we give an outlook on the future of urban computing, suggesting a few research topics that are somehow missing in the community.","author":["Yu Zheng","Licia Capra","Ouri Wolfson","Hai Yang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology","Volume 5","Issue 3","September 2014","Article No.: 38","pp   1\u201355","https://doi.org/10.1145/2629592"],"date":"18 September 2014","ref":[{"text":"C.

Interrupt-driven systems can provide low overhead and good latency at low offered load, but degrade significantly at higher arrival rates unless care is taken to prevent several pathologies. These are various forms ofreceive livelock, in which the system spends all of its time processing interrupts, to the exclusion of other necessary tasks. Under extreme conditions, no packets are delivered to the user application or the output of the system. To avoid livelock and related problems, an operating system must schedule network interrupt handling as carefully as it schedules process execution. We modified an interrupt-driven networking implementation to do so; this modification eliminates receive  livelock without degrading other aspects of system performance. Our modifications include the use of polling when the system is heavily loaded, while retaining the use of interrupts ur.Jer lighter load. We present measurements demonstrating the success of our approach.","author":["Jeffrey C. Mogul","K. K.

It shows that mobile phones can be charged remotely, while in the user's pocket by applying the concept of MIMO beamforming. However, unlike MIMO beamforming in communication systems which targets the radiated field, we transfer power by beamforming the non-radiated magnetic field and steering it toward the phone. We design MagMIMO, a new system for wireless charging of cell phones and portable devices. MagMIMO consumes as much power as existing solutions, yet it can charge a phone remotely without being removed from the user's pocket. Furthermore, the phone need not face the charging pad, and can charge independently of its orientation. We have built MagMIMO and demonstrated its ability to charge the iPhone and other smart phones, while in the user's pocket.","author":["Jouya Jadidian","Dina Katabi"],"issue":["MobiCom '14: Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking","September 2014","Pages   495\u2013506","https://doi.org/10.1145/2639108.2639130"],"date":"07 September 2014","ref":[{"text":"Analog Devices Inc. datasheet for AD8302 LF-2.7 GHz gain and phase detector.","order":1},{"text":"Apple Inc.

Unfortunately, representing this uncertain data with discrete types (floats, integers, and booleans) encourages developers to pretend it is not probabilistic, which causes three types of uncertainty bugs. (1) Using estimates as facts ignores random error in estimates. (2) Computation compounds that error. (3) Boolean questions on probabilistic data induce false positives and negatives. This paper introduces Uncertain<T>, a new programming language abstraction for uncertain data. We implement a Bayesian network semantics for computation and conditionals that improves program correctness. The runtime uses sampling and hypothesis tests to evaluate computation and conditionals lazily and efficiently. We illustrate with sensor and machine learning applications that Uncertain<T> improves expressiveness and accuracy.Whereas previous probabilistic programming languages focus on experts, Uncertain<T> serves a wide range of developers. Experts still identify error distributions. However, both experts and application writers compute with distributions, improve estimates with domain knowledge, and ask questions with conditionals. The Uncertain<T> type system and operators encourage developers to expose and reason about uncertainty explicitly, controlling false positives and false negatives. These benefits make Uncertain<T> a compelling programming model for modern applications facing the challenge of uncertainty.","author":["James Bornholt","Todd Mytkowicz","Kathryn S.

However, such great significance comes with the support of a great infrastructure that includes large data centers comprising thousands of server units and other supporting equipment. Their share in power consumption generates between 1.1% and 1.5% of the total electricity use worldwide and is projected to rise even more. Such alarming numbers demand rethinking the energy efficiency of such infrastructures. However, before making any changes to infrastructure, an analysis of the current status is required. In this article, we perform a comprehensive analysis of an infrastructure supporting the cloud computing paradigm with regards to energy efficiency. First, we define a systematic approach for analyzing the energy efficiency of most important data center domains, including server and network equipment, as well as cloud management systems and appliances consisting of a software utilized by end users. Second, we utilize this approach for analyzing available scientific and industrial literature on state-of-the-art practices in data centers and their equipment. Finally, we extract existing challenges and highlight future research directions.","author":["Toni Mastelic","Ariel Oleksiak","Holger Claussen","Ivona Brandic","Jean-Marc Pierson","Athanasios V.

Most previous automatic pipelining methods have focused on Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)-based designs and the main goal of such methods generally has been maximizing performance as measured in terms of instructions per clock (IPC). By contrast, we focus on datapath-oriented designs (e.g., DSP filters for image or communication processing applications) in ASIC design flows. The goal of the proposed pipelining approach is to find the optimally pipelined design that not only meets the user-specified target clock frequency, but also seeks to minimize area cost of a given design. Unlike most previous approaches, the proposed methods incorporate the use of accurate area and timing information (iteratively achieved by synthesizing every interim pipelined design) to achieve higher accuracy during design exploration. When compared with exhaustive design exploration that considers all possible pipeline patterns, the two heuristic pipelining methods presented here involve only a small area penalty (typically under 5%) while offering dramatically reduced computational complexity. Experimental validation is performed with commercial ASIC design tools and described for applications including polynomial function evaluation, FIR filters, matrix multiplication, and discrete wavelet transform filter designs with a 90nm standard cell library.","author":["Lok-Won Kim","Dong-U Lee","John Villasenor"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 20","Issue 2","February 2015","Article No.: 28","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/2660768"],"date":"02 March 2015","ref":[{"text":"J.

A central sensor among these is the microphone which enables, for instance, the detection of valence in speech, or the identification of speakers. Deploying multiple of these applications on a mobile device to continuously monitor the audio environment allows for the acquisition of a diverse range of sound-related contextual inferences. However, the cumulative processing burden critically impacts the phone battery. To address this problem, we propose DSP.Ear -- an integrated sensing system that takes advantage of the latest low-power DSP co-processor technology in commodity mobile devices to enable the continuous and simultaneous operation of multiple established algorithms that perform complex audio inferences. The system extracts emotions from voice, estimates the number of people in a room, identifies the speakers, and detects commonly found ambient sounds, while critically incurring little overhead to the device battery. This is achieved through a series of pipeline optimizations that allow the computation to remain largely on the DSP. Through detailed evaluation of our prototype implementation we show that, by exploiting a smartphone's co-processor, DSP.Ear achieves a 3 to 7 times increase in the battery lifetime compared to a solution that uses only the phone's main processor. In addition, DSP.Ear is 2 to 3 times more power efficient than a na\u00efve DSP solution without optimizations. We further analyze a large-scale dataset from 1320 Android users to show that in about 80-90% of the daily usage instances DSP.Ear is able to sustain a full day of operation (even in the presence of other smartphone workloads) with a single battery charge.","author":["Petko Georgiev","Nicholas D.

Current stemming techniques do not, however, reflect the language use in specific corpora, and this can lead to occasional serious retrieval failures. We propose a technique for using corpus-based word variant cooccurrence statistics to modify or create a stemmer.

However, the existing heterogeneous programming models (e.g., OpenCL) abstract details of GPU devices at the per-device level and require programmers to explicitly schedule their kernel tasks on a system equipped with multiple GPU devices. Unfortunately, multiple applications running on a multi-GPU system may compete for some of the GPU devices while leaving other GPU devices unused. Moreover, the distributed memory model defined in OpenCL, where each device has its own memory space, increases the complexity of managing the memory among multiple GPU devices. In this article we propose a framework (called VirtCL) that reduces the programming burden by acting as a layer between the programmer and the native OpenCL run-time system for abstracting multiple devices into a single virtual device and for scheduling computations and communications among the multiple devices. VirtCL comprises two main components: (1) a front-end library, which exposes primary OpenCL APIs and the virtual device, and (2) a back-end run-time system (called CLDaemon) for scheduling and dispatching kernel tasks based on a history-based scheduler. The front-end library forwards computation requests to the back-end CLDaemon, which then schedules and dispatches the requests. We also propose a history-based scheduler that is able to schedule kernel tasks in a contention- and communication-aware manner. Experiments demonstrated that the VirtCL framework introduced a small overhead (mean of 6%) but outperformed the native OpenCL run-time system for most benchmarks in the Rodinia benchmark suite, which was due to the abstraction layer eliminating the time-consuming initialization of OpenCL contexts. We also evaluated different scheduling policies in VirtCL with a real-world application (clsurf) and various synthetic workload traces. The results indicated that the VirtCL framework provides scalability for multiple kernel tasks running on multi-GPU systems.","author":["Yi-Ping You","Hen-Jung Wu","Yeh-Ning Tsai","Yen-Ting Chao"],"issue":["PPoPP 2015: Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming","January 2015","Pages   161\u2013172","https://doi.org/10.1145/2688500.2688505"],"date":"24 January 2015","ref":[{"text":"Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

However, previous studies have been based mostly on generative models, including a hidden Markov model (HMM), without utilizing discriminative models such as a conditional random field (CRF). We present a two-stage discriminative approach based on CRFs for Korean morphological analysis. Similar to methods used for Chinese, we perform two disambiguation procedures based on CRFs: (1) morpheme segmentation and (2) POS tagging. In morpheme segmentation, an input sentence is segmented into sequences of morphemes, where a morpheme unit is either atomic or compound. In the POS tagging procedure, each morpheme (atomic or compound) is assigned a POS tag. Once POS tagging is complete, we carry out a post-processing of the compound morphemes, where each compound morpheme is further decomposed into atomic morphemes, which is based on pre-analyzed patterns and generalized HMMs obtained from the given tagged corpus. Experimental results show the promise of our proposed method.","author":["Seung-Hoon Na"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing","Volume 14","Issue 3","June 2015","Article No.: 10","pp   1\u201316","https://doi.org/10.1145/2700051"],"date":"12 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"Jae-Hyeok Choi and Sang-Jo Lee. 1993.

Unfortunately, performance of current network protocols can vary significantly because of various interferences and environmental changes. Current protocols estimate link quality based on the reception of probe packets over a short time period. This method is neither efficient nor accurate enough to capture the dramatic variations of link quality. Therefore, we propose a link metric called competence that characterizes links over a longer period of time. We combine competence with current short-term estimations in routing algorithm designs. To further improve network performance, we have designed a distributed route maintenance framework based on feedback control solutions. This framework allows every link along an end-to-end (E2E) path to adjust its link protocol parameters, such as transmission power and number of retransmissions, to ensure specified E2E reliability and latency under dynamic link qualities. Our solutions are evaluated in both extensive simulations and real system experiments. In real system evaluations with 48 T-Motes, our overall solution improves E2E packet delivery ratio over existing solutions by up to 40% while reducing transmission energy consumption by up to 22%. Importantly, our solution also achieves more stable and better transient performance than current approaches.","author":["Shan Lin","Gang Zhou","Mo\u2019taz Al-Hami","Kamin Whitehouse","Yafeng Wu","John A.

With fast technology scaling, STT-MRAM read operations will become destructive such that post-read restores are inevitable to ensure data reliability. However, frequent restores introduce large energy overheads. In this paper, we propose Selective Restore (SR), an energy efficient scheme to mitigate the restore overheads. Given a L2 cacheline disturbed from a read operation, SR postpones its restore till the cacheline being evicted from the upper level cache L1. Based on the status of the line at the eviction time, SR selectively restores the disturbed cells to achieve energy efficiency. Our experimental results show that SR improves system performance by 5% and reduces dynamic energy consumption by 62%.","author":["Rujia Wang","Lei Jiang","Youtao Zhang","Linzhang Wang","Jun Yang"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 21","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744908"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"C.-T.

Because existing PRE implementations are based on code motion, they fail to completely remove the redundancies. In fact, we observed that 73% of loop-invariant statements cannot be eliminated from loops by code motion alone. In dynamic terms, traditional PRE eliminates only half of redundancies that are strictly partial. To achieve a complete PRE, control flow restructuring must be applied. However, the resulting code duplication may cause code size explosion.This paper focuses on achieving a complete PRE while incurring an acceptable code growth. First, we present an algorithm for complete removal of partial redundancies, based on the integration of code motion and control flow restructuring. In contrast to existing complete techniques, we resort to restructuring merely to remove obstacles to code motion, rather than to carry out the actual optimization.Guiding the optimization with a profile enables additional code growth reduction through selecting those duplications whose cost is justified by sufficient execution-time gains. The paper develops two methods for determining the optimization benefit of restructuring a program region, one based on path-profiles and the other on data-flow frequency analysis. Furthermore, the abstraction underlying the new PRE algorithm enables a simple formulation of speculative code motion guaranteed to have positive dynamic improvements. Finally, we show how to balance the three transformations (code motion, restructuring, and speculation) to achieve a near-complete PRE with very little code growth.We also present algorithms for efficiently computing dynamic benefits. In particular, using an elimination-style data-flow framework, we derive a demand-driven frequency analyzer whose cost can be controlled by permitting a bounded degree of conservative imprecision in the solution.","author":["Rastislav Bod\u00edk","Rajiv Gupta","Mary Lou Soffa"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 33","Issue 5","May 1998","pp   1\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/277652.277653"],"date":"01 May 1998","ref":[{"text":"Alfred V.

Our key insight is that although Wi-Fi wireless physical layer operations are complex, they are deterministic. This enables us to rehearse physical-layer operations on packet bits before they are transmitted. Based on this rehearsal, we calculate a hidden parameter in the decoding process, called error event probability (EVP). EVP captures fine-grained information about the receiver's convolutional or LDPC decoder, allowing Recitation to derive precise information about the likely fate of every bit in subsequent packets, without any wireless channel training. Recitation is the first system of its kind that is both software-implementable and compatible with the existing 802.11 architecture for both SISO and MIMO settings. We experiment with commodity Atheros 9580 Wi-Fi NICs to demonstrate Recitation's utility with three representative applications in static, mobile, and interference-dominated scenarios. We show that Recitation achieves 33.8% and 16% average throughput gains for bit-rate adaptation and partial packet recovery, respectively, and 6 dB PSNR quality improvement for unequal error protection-based video.","author":["Zhenjiang Li","Yaxiong Xie","Mo Li","Kyle Jamieson"],"issue":["MobiCom '15: Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking","September 2015","Pages   291\u2013303","https://doi.org/10.1145/2789168.2790126"],"date":"07 September 2015","ref":[{"text":"S.

As an important data mining task, recommender system includes a lot of object types (e.g., users, movies, actors, and interest groups in movie recommendation) and the rich relations among object types, which naturally constitute a HIN. The comprehensive information integration and rich semantic information of HIN make it promising to generate better recommendations. However, conventional HINs do not consider the attribute values on links, and the widely used meta path in HIN may fail to accurately capture semantic relations among objects, due to the existence of rating scores (usually ranging from 1 to 5) between users and items in recommender system. In this paper, we are the first to propose the weighted HIN and weighted meta path concepts to subtly depict the path semantics through distinguishing different link attribute values. Furthermore, we propose a semantic path based personalized recommendation method SemRec to predict the rating scores of users on items. Through setting meta paths, SemRec not only flexibly integrates heterogeneous information but also obtains prioritized and personalized weights representing user preferences on paths. Experiments on two real datasets illustrate that SemRec achieves better recommendation performance through flexibly integrating information with the help of weighted meta paths.","author":["Chuan Shi","Zhiqiang Zhang","Ping Luo","Philip S.

Measuring the power of a supercomputer can be a daunting proposition, and as a result, many published measurements are extrapolated. This paper explores the validity of these extrapolations in the context of inter-node power variability and power variations over time within a run. We characterize power variability across nodes in systems at eight supercomputer centers across the globe. This characterization shows that the current requirement for measurements submitted to the Green500 and others is insufficient, allowing variations of up to 20% due to measurement timing and a further 10--15% due to insufficient sample sizes. This paper proposes new power and energy measurement requirements for supercomputers, some of which have been accepted for use by the Green500 and Top500, to ensure consistent accuracy.","author":["Thomas Scogland","Jonathan Azose","David Rohr","Suzanne Rivoire","Natalie Bates","Daniel Hackenberg"],"issue":["SC '15: Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2015","Article No.: 74","Pages   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/2807591.2807653"],"date":"15 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"B.

Mining these reactions through online social sensors offers a fast and low cost way to understand what is happening in the physical world. In some cases, however, further study of the affected population's emotional state can improve this understanding. In our study we analyzed how car commuters react on Twitter while stuck in heavy traffic. We discovered that the online social footprint does not necessarily follow a strict linear correlation with the volume of a traffic jam. Through our analysis we offer a potential explanation: people's mood could be an additional factor, apart from traffic severity itself, that leads in fluctuations of the observed reaction in social media. This finding can be important for social sensing applications where external factors, like sentiment, also contribute on how humans react. We propose a novel traffic-congestion estimation model that utilizes the volume of messages and complaints in online social media, based on when they happen. We show through experimental evaluation that the proposed model can estimate, with higher accuracy, traffic jam severity and compare the results with several baselines. The model achieves at least 38% improvement of absolute error and more than 45% improvement of relative error, when compared with a baseline that assumes linear correlation between traffic and social volume. To support our findings we combined data from the California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS) and Twitter, for a total of 6 months, and focused on a major traffic-heavy freeway in Los Angeles, California.","author":["Theodore Georgiou","Amr El Abbadi","Xifeng Yan","Jemin George"],"issue":["ASONAM '15: Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining 2015","August 2015","Pages   330\u2013335","https://doi.org/10.1145/2808797.2809404"],"date":"25 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"D.

However, CORDIC is constrained by the excessive number of iterations, angle data path, and scaling factor compensation. In this article, an enhanced adaptive recoding CORDIC (EARC) is proposed. It uses the enhanced adaptive recoding method to reduce the required iterations and adopts the trigonometric transformation scheme to scale up the rotation angles. Computing sine and cosine is used first to compare the core functionality of EARC with basic CORDIC; then a 16-bit DDS and a 1,024-point FFT based on EARC are evaluated to demonstrate the benefits of EARC in larger applications. All the proposed architectures are validated on a Virtex 5 FPGA development platform. Compared with a commercial implementation of CORDIC, EARC requires 33.3% less hardware resources, provides a twofold speedup, dissipates 70.4% less power, and improves accuracy in terms of the Bit Error Position (BEP). Compared to the state-of-the-art Hybrid CORDIC, EARC reduces latency by 11.1% and consumes 17% less power. Compared with a commercial implementation of DDS, the dissipated power of the proposed DDS is reduced by 27.2%. The proposed DDS improves Spurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) by nearly 7 dBc and dissipates 21.8% less power when compared with a recently published DDS circuit. The FFT based on EARC dissipates a factor of 2.05 less power than the commercial FFT even when choosing the 100% toggle rate for the FFT based on EARC and the 12.5% toggle rate for the commercial FFT. Compared with a recently published FFT, the FFT based on EARC improves Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) by 8.9 dB and consumes 7.78% less power.","author":["Jianfeng Zhang","Paul Chow","Hengzhu Liu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 9","Issue 1","November 2015","Article No.: 4","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2812813"],"date":"02 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"S.

Once the interposer has been paid for, there are new opportunities to exploit the interposer. Recent work considers using the routing resources of the interposer to improve the network-on-chip's (NoC) capabilities. In this work, we exploit the interposer to \"disintegrate\" a multi-core CPU chip into smaller chips that individually and collectively cost less to manufacture than a single large chip. However, this fragments the overall NoC, which decreases performance as core-to-core messages between chips must now route through the interposer. We study the performance-cost trade-offs of interposer based, multi-chip, multi-core systems and propose new interposer NoC organizations to mitigate the performance challenges while preserving the cost benefits.","author":["Ajaykumar Kannan","Natalie Enright Jerger","Gabriel H.

By connecting TOF measurements with theory from array signal processing, we conclude that performance depends on two primary factors: camera modulation frequency and the width of the specular lobe (\u201cshininess\u201d) of the wall. For purely Lambertian walls, commodity TOF sensors achieve resolution on the order of meters between targets. For seemingly diffuse walls, such as posterboard, the resolution is drastically reduced, to the order of 10cm. In particular, we find that the relationship between reflectance and resolution is nonlinear\u2014a slight amount of shininess can lead to a dramatic improvement in resolution. Since many realistic scenes exhibit a slight amount of shininess, we believe that off-the-shelf TOF cameras can look around corners.","author":["Achuta Kadambi","Hang Zhao","Boxin Shi","Ramesh Raskar"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 35","Issue 2","May 2016","Article No.: 15","pp   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2836164"],"date":"15 March 2016","ref":[{"text":"Fadel Adib, Zach Kabelac, Dina Katabi, and Robert C.

Various developments continue to take place in the process of efficient evacuation of crowds in mass gatherings. This article is intended to provide a review of intelligent evacuation management systems covering the aspects of crowd monitoring, crowd disaster prediction, evacuation modelling, and evacuation path guidelines. Soft computing approaches play a vital role in the design and deployment of intelligent evacuation applications pertaining to crowd control management. While the review deals with video and nonvideo based aspects of crowd monitoring and crowd disaster prediction, evacuation techniques are reviewed via the theme of soft computing, along with a brief review on the evacuation navigation path. We believe that this review will assist researchers in developing reliable automated evacuation systems that will help in ensuring the safety of the evacuees especially during emergency evacuation scenarios.","author":["Azhar Mohd Ibrahim","Ibrahim Venkat","K.

FPGA architecture, fabricated in the Intel 14nm FinFET process. Stratix 10 includes ubiquitous flip-flops in the routing to enable a high degree of pipelining. In contrast to the earlier architectural exploration of pipelining in pass-transistor based architectures, the direct drive routing fabric in Stratix-style FPGAs enables an extremely low-cost pipeline register. The presence of ubiquitous flip-flops simplifies circuit retiming and improves performance. The availability of predictable retiming affects all stages of the cluster, place and route flow. Ubiquitous flip-flops require a low-cost clock network with sufficient flexibility to enable pipelining of dozens of clock domains. Different cost/performance tradeoffs in a pipelined fabric and use of a 14nm process, lead to other modifications to the routing fabric and the logic element. User modification of the design enables even higher performance, averaging 2.3X faster in a small set of designs.","author":["David Lewis","Gordon Chiu","Jeffrey Chromczak","David Galloway","Ben Gamsa","Valavan Manohararajah","Ian Milton","Tim Vanderhoek","John Van Dyken"],"issue":["FPGA '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2016","Pages   159\u2013168","https://doi.org/10.1145/2847263.2847267"],"date":"21 February 2016","ref":[{"text":"V.

We present Empath, a tool that can generate and validate new lexical categories on demand from a small set of seed terms (like \"bleed\" and \"punch\" to generate the category violence). Empath draws connotations between words and phrases by deep learning a neural embedding across more than 1.8 billion words of modern fiction. Given a small set of seed words that characterize a category, Empath uses its neural embedding to discover new related terms, then validates the category with a crowd-powered filter. Empath also analyzes text across 200 built-in, pre-validated categories we have generated from common topics in our web dataset, like neglect, government, and social media. We show that Empath's data-driven, human validated categories are highly correlated (r=0.906) with similar categories in LIWC.","author":["Ethan Fast","Binbin Chen","Michael S.

Central is a discussion of imperatives of a layout design system suitable for VLSI. Of course, such a system has to take account of the embedding into an integrated design system. However, layout design faces two major problems. One results from industry's ability to pack over 10000 gate equivalents into a single chip. Beside this increase in complexity today's micro-electronics technology made a variety of processes - each with its own set of design rules - available for integration. This diversity has been existing for a long time, but complexity raised the problem, since development of efficient systems for designing complex systems is costly and time-consuming.","author":["Ralph Otten"],"issue":["ISPD '16: Proceedings of the 2016 on International Symposium on Physical Design","April 2016","Pages   115","https://doi.org/10.1145/2872334.2872348"],"date":"03 April 2016"},{"_id":"10.1145/2872362.2872397","title":"A DNA-Based Archival Storage System","abstract":"Demand for data storage is growing exponentially, but the capacity of existing storage media is not keeping up. Using DNA to archive data is an attractive possibility because it is extremely dense, with a raw limit of 1 exabyte/mm3 (109 GB/mm3), and long-lasting, with observed half-life of over 500 years. This paper presents an architecture for a DNA-based archival storage system. It is structured as a key-value store, and leverages common biochemical techniques to provide random access. We also propose a new encoding scheme that offers controllable redundancy, trading off reliability for density. We demonstrate feasibility, random access, and robustness of the proposed encoding with wet lab experiments involving 151 kB of synthesized DNA and a 42 kB random-access subset, and simulation experiments of larger sets calibrated to the wet lab experiments. Finally, we highlight trends in biotechnology that indicate the impending practicality of DNA storage for much larger datasets.","author":["James Bornholt","Randolph Lopez","Douglas M.

In certain domains, such as fashion, modeling such preferences can be incredibly difficult, due to the need to simultaneously model the visual appearance of products as well as their evolution over time. The subtle semantics and non-linear dynamics of fashion evolution raise unique challenges especially considering the sparsity and large scale of the underlying datasets. In this paper we build novel models for the One-Class Collaborative Filtering setting, where our goal is to estimate users' fashion-aware personalized ranking functions based on their past feedback. To uncover the complex and evolving visual factors that people consider when evaluating products, our method combines high-level visual features extracted from a deep convolutional neural network, users' past feedback, as well as evolving trends within the community. Experimentally we evaluate our method on two large real-world datasets from Amazon.com, where we show it to outperform state-of-the-art personalized ranking measures, and also use it to visualize the high-level fashion trends across the 11-year span of our dataset.","author":["Ruining He","Julian McAuley"],"issue":["WWW '16: Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web","April 2016","Pages   507\u2013517","https://doi.org/10.1145/2872427.2883037"],"date":"11 April 2016","ref":[{"text":"D.

Existing knowledge graph embedding based predictive methods represent entities and relations in knowledge graphs as elements of a vector space, and employ the structural information for link prediction. However, knowledge graphs contain many hierarchical relations, which existing methods have pay little attention to. In this paper, we propose a hierarchy-constrained locally adaptive knowledge graph embedding based link prediction method, called hTransA, by integrating hierarchical structures into the predictive work.

Our key observation is that joins entail a high degree of redundancy in both computation and data representation, which is not required for the end-to-end solution to learning over joins. We propose a new paradigm for computing batch gradient descent that exploits the factorized computation and representation of the training datasets, a rewriting of the regression objective function that decouples the computation of cofactors of model parameters from their convergence, and the commutativity of cofactor computation with relational union and projection. We introduce three flavors of this approach: F/FDB computes the cofactors in one pass over the materialized factorized join; Favoids this materialization and intermixes cofactor and join computation; F/SQL expresses this mixture as one SQL query. Our approach has the complexity of join factorization, which can be exponentially lower than of standard joins. Experiments with commercial, public, and synthetic datasets show that it outperforms MADlib, Python StatsModels, and R, by up to three orders of magnitude.","author":["Maximilian Schleich","Dan Olteanu","Radu Ciucanu"],"issue":["SIGMOD '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data","June 2016","Pages   3\u201318","https://doi.org/10.1145/2882903.2882939"],"date":"14 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"Apache.

We present an approach to automatically augment API documentation with \"insight sentences\" from Stack Overflow---sentences that are related to a particular API type and that provide insight not contained in the API documentation of that type. Based on a development set of 1,574 sentences, we compare the performance of two state-of-the-art summarization techniques as well as a pattern-based approach for insight sentence extraction. We then present SISE, a novel machine learning based approach that uses as features the sentences themselves, their formatting, their question, their answer, and their authors as well as part-of-speech tags and the similarity of a sentence to the corresponding API documentation. With SISE, we were able to achieve a precision of 0.64 and a coverage of 0.7 on the development set. In a comparative study with eight software developers, we found that SISE resulted in the highest number of sentences that were considered to add useful information not found in the API documentation. These results indicate that taking into account the meta data available on Stack Overflow as well as part-of-speech tags can significantly improve unsupervised extraction approaches when applied to Stack Overflow data.","author":["Christoph Treude","Martin P.

Rather than relying on the precise structure of the codes, our method exploits code symmetry. In particular, the technique applies to any sequence of linear codes where the block lengths are strictly increasing, the code rates converge, and the permutation group of each code is doubly transitive. In a nutshell, we show that symmetry alone implies near-optimal performance.   An important consequence of this result is that a sequence of Reed-Muller codes with increasing block length and converging rate achieves capacity. This possibility has been suggested previously in the literature, but it has only been proven for cases where the limiting code rate is 0 or 1. Moreover, these results extend naturally to affine-invariant codes and, thus, to all extended primitive narrow-sense BCH codes. This is used to resolve, in the affirmative, the existence question for capacity-achieving sequences of binary cyclic codes. The primary tools used in the proofs are the sharp threshold property for symmetric monotone boolean functions and the area theorem for extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) functions.","author":["Shrinivas Kudekar","Santhosh Kumar","Marco Mondelli","Henry D.

Therefore, it is imperative to devise fast and accurate soft error rate (SER) estimation methods. Previous works mainly focus on improving the accuracy of the SER results, whereas the speed improvement is limited to partitioning and parallel processing. This paper presents an efficient SER estimation framework for combinational logic circuits in the presence of single-event transients (SETs). A novel top-down memoization algorithm is proposed to accelerate the propagation of SETs. Experimental results of a variety of benchmark circuits demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves up to 560.2X times speedup with less than 3% difference in terms of SER results compared with the baseline algorithm.","author":["Ji Li","Jeffrey Draper"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 55","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2897976"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"S.

Many solutions have been investigated to increase processing speed and memory capacity, however I/O bottleneck is still a critical issue. To tackle this issue we adopt Sketching technique to reduce data communications. Reconstruction of the sketched matrix is performed using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). Additionally we propose Gradient Descent OMP (GD-OMP) algorithm to reduce hardware complexity. Big data processing at real-time imposes rigid constraints on sketching kernel, hence to further reduce hardware overhead both algorithms are implemented on a low power domain specific many-core platform called Power Efficient Nano Clusters (PENC). GD-OMP algorithm is evaluated for image reconstruction accuracy and the PENC many-core architecture. Implementation results show that for large matrix sizes GD-OMP algorithm is 1.3x faster and consumes 1.4x less energy than OMP algorithm implementations. Compared to GPU and Quad-Core CPU implementations the PENC many-core reconstructs 5.4x and 9.8x faster respectively for large signal sizes with higher sparsity.","author":["Amey Kulkarni","Tahmid Abtahi","Emily Smith","Tinoosh Mohsenin"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '16: Proceedings of the 26th edition on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2016","Pages   57\u201362","https://doi.org/10.1145/2902961.2902984"],"date":"18 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"M.

We present a quantitative analysis for SNM limited SRAM yield using Design of Experiments (DOE) method. The proposed framework for yield based design can also utilize recovery techniques like Error Correcting Codes (ECC) and redundancy and quantifies yield, area, and VDDMIN improvements.

When? and Why?","abstract":"Despite the growing popularity of Solid State Disks (SSDs) in the datacenter, little is known about their reliability characteristics in the field. The little knowledge is mainly vendor supplied, and such information cannot really help understand how SSD failures can manifest and impact the operation of production systems, in order to take appropriate remedial measures. Besides actual failure data and the symptoms exhibited by SSDs before failing, a detailed characterization effort requires wide set of data about factors influencing SSD failures, right from provisioning factors to the operational ones. This paper presents an extensive SSD failure characterization by analyzing a wide spectrum of data from over half a million SSDs that span multiple generations spread across several datacenters which host a wide spectrum of workloads over nearly 3 years. By studying the diverse set of design, provisioning and operational factors on failures, and their symptoms, our work provides the first comprehensive analysis of the what, when and why characteristics of SSD failures in production datacenters.","author":["Iyswarya Narayanan","Di Wang","Myeongjae Jeon","Bikash Sharma","Laura Caulfield","Anand Sivasubramaniam","Ben Cutler","Jie Liu","Badriddine Khessib","Kushagra Vaid"],"issue":["SYSTOR '16: Proceedings of the 9th ACM International on Systems and Storage Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 7","Pages   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/2928275.2928278"],"date":"06 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"Enhanced Content Distribution Network with Intel Solid-State Drives. http://www.intel.fr/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/case-studies/cloud-computing-ssd-beijing-fastwebcase-study.pdf.","order":1},{"text":"American National Standards Institute.

However, researchers have to spend a considerable amount of time and effort to debug, analyze, and extract meaningful information from the simulator reports. In this work, we propose a full-system visualization framework, called VisualNoC, that support both network simulation and task mapping. VisualNoC operates in a cycle-accurate mode and is based on an event-based trace model which can record the behaviors of routers, processing elements and packets. The visualization interface can provide efficient debugging and analysis platform by representing the simulation process and results in a variety of ways. One of the main features of VisualNoC is providing an intuitive way of analyzing the efficiency of different mapping algorithms that helps in finding bottlenecks and optimizing the design.","author":["Junshi Wang","Yang Huang","Masoumeh Ebrahimi","Letian Huang","Qiang Li","Axel Jantsch","Guangjun Li"],"issue":["MES '16: Proceedings of the Third ACM International Workshop on Many-core Embedded Systems","June 2016","Pages   18\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2934495.2949544"],"date":"19 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"H.

The difficulty lies in the fact that in order to extract the weak backscattered signal, the system needs to deal with self-interference from the wireless carrier (WiFi or Bluetooth) without relying on built-in capability to cancel or reject the carrier interference. Frequency-shifted backscatter (or FS-Backscatter) is based on a novel idea --- the backscatter tag shifts the carrier signal to an adjacent non-overlapping frequency band (i.e. adjacent WiFi or Bluetooth band) and isolates the spectrum of the backscattered signal from the spectrum of the primary signal to enable more robust decoding. We show that this enables communication of up to 4.8 meters using commercial WiFi and Bluetooth radios as the carrier generator and receiver. We also show that we can support a range of bitrates using packet-level and bit-level decoding methods. We build on this idea and show that we can also leverage multiple radios typically present on mobile and wearable devices to construct multi-carrier or multi-receiver scenarios to improve robustness. Finally, we also address the problem of designing an ultra-low power tag that can frequency shift by 20MHz while consuming tens of micro-watts. Our results show that FS-Backscatter is practical in typical mobile and static on-body sensing scenarios while only using commodity radios and antennas.","author":["PENGYU ZHANG","Mohammad Rostami","Pan Hu","Deepak Ganesan"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGCOMM Conference","August 2016","Pages   370\u2013383","https://doi.org/10.1145/2934872.2934901"],"date":"22 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"Adxl362 mems accelerometer.","order":1},{"text":"Ettus research vert2450 antenna.","order":2},{"text":"Nxp 74hc1g00 nand gate.","order":3},{"text":"Ti cc2541.","order":4},{"text":"Tp-link tl-ant2409a antenna.","order":5},{"text":"Zephyr bioharness.","order":6},{"text":"A.

Recent studies have shown serious security concerns due to \"rowhammer\" attacks, where repeated accesses to a row of memory cause bit flips in adjacent rows. Recent work by Google's Project Zero has shown how to leverage rowhammer-induced bit-flips as the basis for security exploits that include malicious code injection and memory privilege escalation. Being an important security concern, industry has attempted to defend against rowhammer attacks. Deployed defenses employ two strategies: (1) doubling the system DRAM refresh rate and (2) restricting access to the CLFLUSH instruction that attackers use to bypass the cache to increase memory access frequency (i.e., the rate of rowhammering). We demonstrate that such defenses are inadequte: we implement rowhammer attacks that both avoid using the CLFLUSH instruction and cause bit flips with a doubled refresh rate. Our next-generation CLFLUSH-free rowhammer attack bypasses the cache by manipulating cache replacement state to allow frequent misses out of the last-level cache to DRAM rows of our choosing.To protect existing systems from more advanced rowhammer attacks, we develop a software-based defense, ANVIL, which thwarts all known rowhammer attacks on existing systems. ANVIL detects rowhammer attacks by tracking the locality of DRAM accesses using existing hardware performance counters. Our detector identifies the rows being frequently accessed (i.e., the aggressors), then selectively refreshes the nearby victim rows to prevent hammering. Experiments running on real hardware with the SPEC2006 benchmarks show that ANVIL has less than a 1% false positive rate and an average slowdown of 1%. ANVIL is low-cost and robust, and our experiments indicate that it is an effective approach for protecting existing and future systems from even advanced rowhammer attacks.","author":["Zelalem Birhanu Aweke","Salessawi Ferede Yitbarek","Rui Qiao","Reetuparna Das","Matthew Hicks","Yossi Oren","Todd Austin"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 51","Issue 4","April 2016","pp   743\u2013755","https://doi.org/10.1145/2954679.2872390"],"date":"25 March 2016","ref":[{"text":"https://twitter.com/lavados/status/685618703413698562.

The accuracy of the results in approximation circuits is evaluated based on several error metrics such as worst-case error, bit-flip error, or error-rate. Several applications have varied requirements in error metrics, i.e., all the error criteria have to be met together at a time, or in combinations. Nevertheless, all applications benefit from improved delay and area. An automated synthesis approach with formal guarantees on error metrics is very helpful in generating circuits that meet these criteria. Furthermore, each of these metrics are independent quantities (value of one metric does not correlate with the other), and automated synthesis can discover opportunities to trade off one or more of the relaxed metrics with a strict requirement on the other, resulting in better performance. In this paper, we present an automatic synthesis approach using And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs) based rewriting that not only improves the performance but also guarantees the bounds of approximation errors introduced. Our synthesis approach is evaluated on a wide range of designs and standard benchmark circuits to show the usefulness and applicability. In particular, we show that our synthesis results are even comparable with the optimization achieved with hand crafted adhoc approximation circuits such as approximation adders in a case study on image compression.","author":["Arun Chandrasekharan","Mathias Soeken","Daniel Gro\u00dfe","Rolf Drechsler"],"issue":["ICCAD '16: Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2016","Article No.: 83","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967003"],"date":"07 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"Aoki Laboratory - Graduate School of Information Sciences.

Although this issue has been addressed in several works and received much attention over the years, the most recent advances pointed out that the energy harvesting and wireless charging techniques may offer means to overcome such a limitation. Consequently, an issue that had been put in second place now emerges: the low availability of spectrum resources. Because of it, the incorporation of the WSNs into the Internet of Things and the exponential growth of the latter may be hindered if no control over the data generation is taken. Alternatively, part of the sensed data can be predicted without triggering transmissions that could congest the wireless medium. In this work, we analyze and categorize existing prediction-based data reduction mechanisms that have been designed for WSNs. Our main contribution is a systematic procedure for selecting a scheme to make predictions in WSNs, based on WSNs\u2019 constraints, characteristics of prediction methods, and monitored data. Finally, we conclude the article with a discussion about future challenges and open research directions in the use of prediction methods to support the WSNs\u2019 growth.","author":["Gabriel Martins Dias","Boris Bellalta","Simon Oechsner"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 49","Issue 3","September 2017","Article No.: 58","pp   1\u201335","https://doi.org/10.1145/2996356"],"date":"15 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"Ameer Ahmed Abbasi and Mohamed Younis. 2007.

Mainstream compilers typically treat parallel linguistic constructs as syntactic sugar for function calls into a parallel runtime. These calls prevent the compiler from performing optimizations across parallel control constructs. Remedying this situation is generally thought to require an extensive reworking of compiler analyses and code transformations to handle parallel semantics. Tapir is a compiler IR that represents logically parallel tasks asymmetrically in the program's control flow graph. Tapir allows the compiler to optimize across parallel control constructs with only minor changes to its existing analyses and code transformations. To prototype Tapir in the LLVM compiler, for example, we added or modified about 6000 lines of LLVM's 4-million-line codebase. Tapir enables LLVM's existing compiler optimizations for serial code -- including loop-invariant-code motion, common-subexpression elimination, and tail-recursion elimination -- to work with parallel control constructs such as spawning and parallel loops. Tapir also supports parallel optimizations such as loop scheduling.","author":["Tao B. Schardl","William S. Moses","Charles E.

Large real-world graphs, however, are inherently difficult to process efficiently, not only due to their large memory footprint, but also that most graph algorithms entail memory access patterns with poor locality and a low compute-to-memory access ratio. In this work, we leverage the exceptional random access performance of emerging Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) technology that stacks multiple DRAM dies on top of a logic layer, combined with the flexibility and efficiency of FPGA to address these challenges. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that implements a graph processing system on a FPGA-HMC platform based on software/hardware co-design and co-optimization. We first present the modifications of algorithm and a platform-aware graph processing architecture to perform level-synchronized breadth first search (BFS) on FPGA-HMC platform. To gain better insights into the potential bottlenecks of proposed implementation, we develop an analytical performance model to quantitatively evaluate the HMC access latency and corresponding BFS performance. Based on the analysis, we propose a two-level bitmap scheme to further reduce memory access and perform optimization on key design parameters (e.g. memory access granularity). Finally, we evaluate the performance of our BFS implementation using the AC-510 development kit from Micron. We achieved 166 million edges traversed per second (MTEPS) using GRAPH500 benchmark on a random graph with a scale of 25 and an edge factor of 16, which significantly outperforms CPU and other FPGA-based large graph processors.","author":["Jialiang Zhang","Soroosh Khoram","Jing Li"],"issue":["FPGA '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2017","Pages   207\u2013216","https://doi.org/10.1145/3020078.3021737"],"date":"22 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"R.

This paper realizes a binarized CNN which treats only binary 2-values (+1/-1) for the inputs and the weights. In this case, the multiplier is replaced into an XNOR circuit instead of a dedicated DSP block. For hardware implementation, using binarized inputs and weights is more suitable. However, the binarized CNN requires the batch normalization techniques to retain the classification accuracy. In that case, the additional multiplication and addition require extra hardware, also, the memory access for its parameters reduces system performance. In this paper, we propose the batch normalization free CNN which is mathematically equivalent to the CNN using batch normalization. The proposed CNN treats the binarized inputs and weights with the integer bias. We implemented the VGG-16 benchmark CNN on the NetFPGA-SUME FPGA board, which has the Xilinx Inc. Virtex7 FPGA and three off-chip QDR II+ Synchronous SRAMs. Compared with the conventional FPGA realizations, although the classification error rate is 6.5% decayed, the performance is 2.82 times faster, the power efficiency is 1.76 times lower, and the area efficiency is 11.03 times smaller. Thus, our method is suitable for the embedded computer system.","author":["Hiroki Nakahara","Haruyoshi Yonekawa","Hisashi Iwamoto","Masato Motomura"],"issue":["FPGA '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2017","Pages   290","https://doi.org/10.1145/3020078.3021782"],"date":"22 February 2017"},{"_id":"10.1145/3038912.3052692","title":"PhLeGrA: Graph Analytics in Pharmacology over the Web of Life Sciences Linked Open Data","abstract":"Integrated approaches for pharmacology are required for the mechanism-based predictions of adverse drug reactions that manifest due to concomitant intake of multiple drugs. These approaches require the integration and analysis of biomedical data and knowledge from multiple, heterogeneous sources with varying schemas, entity notations, and formats. To tackle these integrative challenges, the Semantic Web community has published and linked several datasets in the Life Sciences Linked Open Data (LSLOD) cloud using established W3C standards. We present the PhLeGrA platform for Linked Graph Analytics in Pharmacology in this paper. Through query federation, we integrate four sources from the LSLOD cloud and extract a drug-reaction network, composed of distinct entities. We represent this graph as a hidden conditional random field (HCRF), a discriminative latent variable model that is used for structured output predictions. We calculate the underlying probability distributions in the drug-reaction HCRF using the datasets from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System. We predict the occurrence of 146 adverse reactions due to multiple drug intake with an AUROC statistic greater than 0.75.

Approximate computing provides a new approach for low power design. Logarithmic multiplier (LM) is a kind of approximate multipliers in nature. In this paper, the design of both non-iterative and iterative approximate LMs (IALM) are studied to further reduce the power consumption and improve the performance. Non-iterative approximate LMs (ALM) that use three inexact mantissa adders are presented. The proposed IALMs use set-one adder in both mantissa adders during the iteration and they also use lower-part-or adders and approximate mirror adders for the final addition. The error analysis and simulation results are also provided. It is found that the proposed approximate LMs with appropriate number of inexact bits has achieved even higher accuracy and lower power consumption compared with the conventional LMs using exact units. To be exact, compared with conventional LMs with exact units, the normalized mean error distance (NMED) of 16-bit approximate LMs is decreased by up to 18% and the power-delay product (PDP) has a reduction of up to 37%. The proposed approximate LMs are also compared with previous approximate Booth multipliers. It is found that approximate LMs are more suitable for applications allowing large errors but require less power consumption, while approximate Booth multipliers fit for applications allowing larger power but require less errors.","author":["Weiqiang Liu","Jiahua Xu","Danye Wang","Fabrizio Lombardi"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '17: Proceedings of the on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI 2017","May 2017","Pages   47\u201352","https://doi.org/10.1145/3060403.3060409"],"date":"10 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"Han, J. and Orshansky, M. 2013.

As memristors continue to mature and achieve higher density, bit failures within crossbar arrays can become a critical issue. These can degrade the computation accuracy significantly. In this work, we propose a defect rescuing design to restore the computation accuracy. In our proposed design, significant weights in a specified network are first identified and retraining and remapping algorithms are described. For a two layer neural network with 92.64% classification accuracy on MNIST digit recognition, our evaluation based on real device testing shows that our design can recover almost its full performance when 20% random defects are present.","author":["Chenchen Liu","Miao Hu","John Paul Strachan","Hai (Helen) Li"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 87","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062310"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"P.

Our method combines a new convolutional neural network (CNN) based pose regressor with kinematic skeleton fitting. Our novel fully-convolutional pose formulation regresses 2D and 3D joint positions jointly in real time and does not require tightly cropped input frames. A real-time kinematic skeleton fitting method uses the CNN output to yield temporally stable 3D global pose reconstructions on the basis of a coherent kinematic skeleton. This makes our approach the first monocular RGB method usable in real-time applications such as 3D character control---thus far, the only monocular methods for such applications employed specialized RGB-D cameras. Our method's accuracy is quantitatively on par with the best offline 3D monocular RGB pose estimation methods. Our results are qualitatively comparable to, and sometimes better than, results from monocular RGB-D approaches, such as the Kinect. However, we show that our approach is more broadly applicable than RGB-D solutions, i.e., it works for outdoor scenes, community videos, and low quality commodity RGB cameras.","author":["Dushyant Mehta","Srinath Sridhar","Oleksandr Sotnychenko","Helge Rhodin","Mohammad Shafiei","Hans-Peter Seidel","Weipeng Xu","Dan Casas","Christian Theobalt"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 36","Issue 4","August 2017","Article No.: 44","pp   1\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/3072959.3073596"],"date":"20 July 2017","ref":[{"text":"Ankur Agarwal and Bill Triggs. 2006.

Sharing trained models of deep neural networks has been a very important in the rapid progress of research and development of these systems. At the same time, it is necessary to protect the rights to shared trained models. To this end, we propose to use digital watermarking technology to protect intellectual property and detect intellectual property infringement in the use of trained models. First, we formulate a new problem: embedding watermarks into deep neural networks. Second, we propose a general framework for embedding a watermark in model parameters, using a parameter regularizer. Our approach does not impair the performance of networks into which a watermark is placed because the watermark is embedded while training the host network. Finally, we perform comprehensive experiments to reveal the potential of watermarking deep neural networks as the basis of this new research effort. We show that our framework can embed a watermark during the training of a deep neural network from scratch, and during fine-tuning and distilling, without impairing its performance. The embedded watermark does not disappear even after fine-tuning or parameter pruning; the watermark remains complete even after 65% of parameters are pruned.","author":["Yusuke Uchida","Yuki Nagai","Shigeyuki Sakazawa","Shin'ichi Satoh"],"issue":["ICMR '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval","June 2017","Pages   269\u2013277","https://doi.org/10.1145/3078971.3078974"],"date":"06 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"X.

The accelerated simulation of coupled ODE/PDE is critical for analysis of physical systems as well as computing with dynamical systems. This paper presents a fast and programmable accelerator for simulating dynamical systems. The computing model of the proposed platform is based on multilayer cellular nonlinear network (CeNN) augmented with nonlinear function evaluation engines. The platform can be programmed to accelerate wide classes of ODEs/PDEs by modulating the connectivity within the multilayer CeNN engine. An innovative hardware architecture including data reuse, memory hierarchy, and near-memory processing is designed to accelerate the augmented multilayer CeNN. A dataflow model is presented which is supported by optimized memory hierarchy for efficient function evaluation. The proposed solver is designed and synthesized in 15nm technology for the hardware analysis. The performance is evaluated and compared to GPU nodes when solving wide classes of differential equations and the power consumption is analyzed to show orders of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency.","author":["Jaeha Kung","Yun Long","Duckhwan Kim","Saibal Mukhopadhyay"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   403\u2013415","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080252"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Stefania Bandini, Giancarlo Mauri, Giulio Pavesi, and Carla Simone. 2004.

Widely used as they may be, those applications provide little flexibility to cater to the diversified needs of different groups of users. For users facing a classification problem, it is natural that some classes are more important to them, while the rest are not. We thus propose a lightweight method that allows users to prune the unneeded classes together with associated filters from convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Such customization can result in substantial reduction in computational costs at test time. Early results have shown that after pruning the Network-in-Network (NIN) model on CIFAR-10 dataset\\cite{lim2013network} down to a 5-class classifier, we can trade a 3\\% loss in accuracy for a 1.63$\\times$ gain in energy consumption and a 1.24$\\times$ improvement in latency when experimenting on an off-the-shelf smartphone, while the procedure incurs with very little overhead. After pruning, the custom-tailored model can still achieve a higher classification accuracy than the unmodified classifier because of a smaller problem space that more accurately reflects users' needs.","author":["Jia Guo","Miodrag Potkonjak"],"issue":["EMDL '17: Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Deep Learning for Mobile Systems and Applications","June 2017","Pages   13\u201317","https://doi.org/10.1145/3089801.3089806"],"date":"23 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"M.

This is in lieu of hand-written CUDA or OpenCL code for the algorithms that have to be separately maintained and tuned to available hardware. Specifically, we compare the performance of using OpenACC-2.5 for Fortran with the commercial PGI compiler suite and OpenCL code running on the Nvidia Kepler series (K20, K40) GPU accelerators. Our results show that the (double precision) GPU accelerated code for both approaches is 2 ~ 3 times faster than the optimized counterpart on the CPU (running with an OpenMP model). We find that sparse matrix vector multiplication with OpenCL is faster than using OpenACC with CuBLAS. While it is in general possible to write an optimized code using OpenCL (or CUDA) that outperforms OpenACC, we find that the directive based approach offered by OpenACC results in a flexible, unified and hence smaller code-base that is easier to maintain, is readily portable and promotes algorithm development.","author":["Kunal Puri","Vikram Singh","Steven Frankel"],"issue":["PASC '17: Proceedings of the Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing Conference","June 2017","Article No.: 4","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/3093172.3093229"],"date":"26 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"AMD. 2016.

Its unique challenges come from the existence of multiple types of nodes and links, which limit the feasibility of the conventional network embedding techniques. We develop two scalable representation learning models, namely metapath2vec and metapath2vec++. The metapath2vec model formalizes meta-path-based random walks to construct the heterogeneous neighborhood of a node and then leverages a heterogeneous skip-gram model to perform node embeddings. The metapath2vec++ model further enables the simultaneous modeling of structural and semantic correlations in heterogeneous networks. Extensive experiments show that metapath2vec and metapath2vec++ are able to not only outperform state-of-the-art embedding models in various heterogeneous network mining tasks, such as node classification, clustering, and similarity search, but also discern the structural and semantic correlations between diverse network objects.","author":["Yuxiao Dong","Nitesh V.

However, these patterns are often elusive as they are affected by many uncertain political-economic factors in the real world, such as corporate performances, government policies, and even breaking news circulated across markets. Moreover, time series of stock prices are non-stationary and non-linear, making the prediction of future price trends much challenging. To address them, we propose a novel State Frequency Memory (SFM) recurrent network to capture the multi-frequency trading patterns from past market data to make long and short term predictions over time. Inspired by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), the SFM decomposes the hidden states of memory cells into multiple frequency components, each of which models a particular frequency of latent trading pattern underlying the fluctuation of stock price. Then the future stock prices are predicted as a nonlinear mapping of the combination of these components in an Inverse Fourier Transform (IFT) fashion. Modeling multi-frequency trading patterns can enable more accurate predictions for various time ranges: while a short-term prediction usually depends on high frequency trading patterns, a long-term prediction should focus more on the low frequency trading patterns targeting at long-term return. Unfortunately, no existing model explicitly distinguishes between various frequencies of trading patterns to make dynamic predictions in literature. The experiments on the real market data also demonstrate more competitive performance by the SFM as compared with the state-of-the-art methods.","author":["Liheng Zhang","Charu Aggarwal","Guo-Jun Qi"],"issue":["KDD '17: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2017","Pages   2141\u20132149","https://doi.org/10.1145/3097983.3098117"],"date":"13 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Klaus Adam, Albert Marcet, and Juan Pablo Nicolini. 2016.

These functionalities require increased capacity along with rapid reconfiguration of network resources. Recent advances in optical hardware can enable a dramatic reduction in wavelength provisioning times in optical circuit switched networks. To support such operations, it is imperative to reconfigure the network without causing a drop in service quality to existing users. Therefore, we present a system that uses neural networks to predict the dynamic response of an optically circuit-switched 90-channel multi-hop Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) network. The neural network is able to recommend wavelength assignments that contain the power excursion to less than 0.5 dB with a precision of over 99%.","author":["Craig L.

Leveraging this wealth of heterogeneous information for top-N item recommendation is a challenging task, as it requires the ability of effectively encoding a diversity of semantic relations and connectivity patterns. In this work, we propose entity2rec, a novel approach to learning user-item relatedness from knowledge graphs for top-N item recommendation. We start from a knowledge graph modeling user-item and item-item relations and we learn property-specific vector representations of users and items applying neural language models on the network. These representations are used to create property-specific user-item relatedness features, which are in turn fed into learning to rank algorithms to learn a global relatedness model that optimizes top-N item recommendations. We evaluate the proposed approach in terms of ranking quality on the MovieLens 1M dataset, outperforming a number of state-of-the-art recommender systems, and we assess the importance of property-specific relatedness scores on the overall ranking quality.","author":["Enrico Palumbo","Giuseppe Rizzo","Rapha\u00ebl Troncy"],"issue":["RecSys '17: Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM Conference on Recommender Systems","August 2017","Pages   32\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/3109859.3109889"],"date":"27 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"S\u00f6ren Auer, Christian Bizer, Georgi Kobilarov, Jens Lehmann, Richard Cyganiak, and Zachary Ives. 2007.

However, data-parallel architectures often accept inefficiency in individual computations for the sake of overall efficiency. We show that on average, activation values of convolutional layers during inference in modern Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) contain 92% zero bits. Processing these zero bits entails ineffectual computations that could be skipped. We propose Pragmatic (PRA), a massively data-parallel architecture that eliminates most of the ineffectual computations on-the-fly, improving performance and energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art high-performance accelerators [5]. The idea behind PRA is deceptively simple: use serial-parallel shift-and-add multiplication while skipping the zero bits of the serial input. However, a straightforward implementation based on shift-and-add multiplication yields unacceptable area, power and memory access overheads compared to a conventional bit-parallel design. PRA incorporates a set of design decisions to yield a practical, area and energy efficient design. Measurements demonstrate that for convolutional layers, PRA is 4.31X faster than DaDianNao [5] (DaDN) using a 16-bit fixed-point representation. While PRA requires 1.68X more area than DaDN, the performance gains yield a 1.70X increase in energy efficiency in a 65nm technology. With 8-bit quantized activations, PRA is 2.25X faster and 1.31X more energy efficient than an 8-bit version of DaDN.","author":["Jorge Albericio","Alberto Delm\u00e1s","Patrick Judd","Sayeh Sharify","Gerard O'Leary","Roman Genov","Andreas Moshovos"],"issue":["MICRO-50 '17: Proceedings of the 50th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","October 2017","Pages   382\u2013394","https://doi.org/10.1145/3123939.3123982"],"date":"14 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"\"How to Quantize Neural Networks with TensorFlow.\" {Online}.

Compared to the existing random puncturing schemes, our improved random puncturing scheme can achieve 0.2-1dB decoding performance improvement. Then, an optimized rate-compatible hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) transmission scheme is proposed based on parallel concatenated punctured (PCP) polar codes. By analyzing the overhead of the previous successful decoded coding block in our rate-compatible HARQ scheme, two methods of determining the optimal initial code-rate of each new PCP polar coding block are proposed over a time-varying channel. Simulation results show that the average number of retransmissions is about 1.5 times in our proposed rate-compatible HARQ schemes with a 2-level PCP polar encoding construct, which reduces half of the average number of retransmissions than the existing rate-compatible polar coding scheme.","author":["Bowen Feng","Jian Jiao","Sha Wang","Shaohua Wu","Shushi Gu","Qinyu Zhang"],"issue":["MSWiM '17: Proceedings of the 20th ACM International Conference on Modelling, Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems","November 2017","Pages   207\u2013214","https://doi.org/10.1145/3127540.3127562"],"date":"21 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"E.

NetCache provides high aggregate throughput and low latency even under highly-skewed and rapidly-changing workloads. The core of NetCache is a packet-processing pipeline that exploits the capabilities of modern programmable switch ASICs to efficiently detect, index, cache and serve hot key-value items in the switch data plane. Additionally, our solution guarantees cache coherence with minimal overhead. We implement a NetCache prototype on Barefoot Tofino switches and commodity servers and demonstrate that a single switch can process 2+ billion queries per second for 64K items with 16-byte keys and 128-byte values, while only consuming a small portion of its hardware resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a sophisticated application-level functionality, such as in-network caching, has been shown to run at line rate on programmable switches. Furthermore, we show that NetCache improves the throughput by 3-10x and reduces the latency of up to 40% of queries by 50%, for high-performance, in-memory key-value stores.","author":["Xin Jin","Xiaozhou Li","Haoyu Zhang","Robert Soul\u00e9","Jeongkeun Lee","Nate Foster","Changhoon Kim","Ion Stoica"],"issue":["SOSP '17: Proceedings of the 26th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","October 2017","Pages   121\u2013136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132747.3132764"],"date":"14 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"David G.

We find that community embedding is not only useful for community-level applications such as graph visualization, but also beneficial to both community detection and node classification. To learn such embedding, our insight hinges upon a closed loop among community embedding, community detection and node embedding. On the one hand, node embedding can help improve community detection, which outputs good communities for fitting better community embedding. On the other hand, community embedding can be used to optimize the node embedding by introducing a community-aware high-order proximity. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel community embedding framework that jointly solves the three tasks together. We evaluate such a framework on multiple real-world datasets, and show that it improves graph visualization and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various application tasks, e.g., community detection and node classification.","author":["Sandro Cavallari","Vincent W.

However, we find that the loss function cannot ensure the fact that the scoring of correct triplets must be low enough to fulfill the translation. In this paper, we present a limit-based scoring loss to provide lower scoring of a golden triplet, and then to extend two basic translation models TransE and TransH, separately to TransE-RS and TransH-RS by combining limit-based scoring loss with margin-based ranking loss. Both the presented models have low complexities of parameters benefiting for application on large scale graphs. In experiments, we evaluate our models on two typical tasks including triplet classification and link prediction, and also analyze the scoring distributions of positive and negative triplets by different models. Experimental results show that the introduced limit-based scoring loss is effective to improve the capacities of knowledge graph embedding.","author":["Xiaofei Zhou","Qiannan Zhu","Ping Liu","Li Guo"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   1009\u20131018","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132939"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"M.

Existing methods mainly assume that all time steps in user-item interaction history are equally relevant to recommendation, which however does not apply in real-world scenarios where user-item interactions can often happen accidentally. More importantly, they learn user and item dynamics separately, thus failing to capture their joint effects on user-item interactions. To better model user and item dynamics, we present the Interacting Attention-gated Recurrent Network (IARN) which adopts the attention model to measure the relevance of each time step. In particular, we propose a novel attention scheme to learn the attention scores of user and item history in an interacting way, thus to account for the dependencies between user and item dynamics in shaping user-item interactions. By doing so, IARN can selectively memorize different time steps of a user's history when predicting her preferences over different items. Our model can therefore provide meaningful interpretations for recommendation results, which could be further enhanced by auxiliary features. Extensive validation on real-world datasets shows that IARN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","author":["Wenjie Pei","Jie Yang","Zhu Sun","Jie Zhang","Alessandro Bozzon","David M.J.

Most existing co-clustering algorithms are designed to find pairwise disjoint and exhaustive co-clusters. However, many real-world datasets might contain not only a large overlap between co-clusters but also outliers which should not belong to any co-cluster. We formulate the problem of Non-Exhaustive, Overlapping Co-Clustering where both of the row and column clusters are allowed to overlap with each other and the outliers for each dimension of the data matrix are not assigned to any cluster. To solve this problem, we propose an intuitive objective function, and develop an efficient iterative algorithm which we call the NEO-CC algorithm. We theoretically show that the NEO-CC algorithm monotonically decreases the proposed objective function. Experimental results show that the NEO-CC algorithm is able to effectively capture the underlying co-clustering structure of real-world data, and thus outperforms state-of-the-art clustering and co-clustering methods.","author":["Joyce Jiyoung Whang","Inderjit S.

Prior work has studied and exploited several forms of variation, such as manufacturing-process- or temperature-induced variation. We empirically demonstrate a new form of variation that exists within a real DRAM chip, induced by the design and placement of different components in the DRAM chip: different regions in DRAM, based on their relative distances from the peripheral structures, require different minimum access latencies for reliable operation. In particular, we show that in most real DRAM chips, cells closer to the peripheral structures can be accessed much faster than cells that are farther. We call this phenomenon design-induced variation in DRAM. Our goals are to i) understand design-induced variation that exists in real, state-of-the-art DRAM chips, ii) exploit it to develop low-cost mechanisms that can dynamically find and use the lowest latency at which to operate a DRAM chip reliably, and, thus, iii) improve overall system performance while ensuring reliable system operation. To this end, we first experimentally demonstrate and analyze designed-induced variation in modern DRAM devices by testing and characterizing 96 DIMMs (768 DRAM chips). Our experimental study shows that i) modern DRAM chips exhibit design-induced latency variation in both row and column directions, ii) access latency gradually increases in the row direction within a DRAM cell array (mat) and this pattern repeats in every mat, and iii) some columns require higher latency than others due to the internal hierarchical organization of the DRAM chip.Our characterization identifies DRAM regions that are vulnerable to errors, if operated at lower latency, and finds consistency in their locations across a given DRAM chip generation, due to design-induced variation. Variations in the vertical and horizontal dimensions, together, divide the cell array into heterogeneous-latency regions, where cells in some regions require longer access latencies for reliable operation. Reducing the latency uniformly across all regions in DRAM would improve performance, but can introduce failures in the inherently slower regions that require longer access latencies for correct operation. We refer to these inherently slower regions of DRAM as design-induced vulnerable regions.Based on our extensive experimental analysis, we develop two mechanisms that reliably reduce DRAM latency. First, DIVI Profiling uses runtime profiling to dynamically identify the lowest DRAM latency that does not introduce failures. DIVA Profiling exploits design-induced variation and periodically profiles only the vulnerable regions to determine the lowest DRAM latency at low cost. It is the first mechanism to dynamically determine the lowest latency that can be used to operate DRAM reliably. DIVA Profiling reduces the latency of read/write requests by 35.1%/57.8%, respectively, at 55C. Our second mechanism, DIVA Shuffling, shuffles data such that values stored in vulnerable regions are mapped to multiple error-correcting code (ECC) codewords. As a result, DIVA Shuffling can correct 26% more multi-bit errors than conventional ECC. Combined together, our two mechanisms reduce read/write latency by 40.0%/60.5%, which translates to an overall system performance improvement of 14.7%/13.7%/13.8% (in 2-/4-/8-core systems) over a variety of workloads, while ensuring reliable operation.","author":["Donghyuk Lee","Samira Khan","Lavanya Subramanian","Saugata Ghose","Rachata Ausavarungnirun","Gennady Pekhimenko","Vivek Seshadri","Onur Mutlu"],"issue":["ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review","Volume 45","Issue 1","June 2017","pp   54","https://doi.org/10.1145/3143314.3078533"],"date":"05 June 2017"},{"_id":"10.1145/3158107","doi":"10.1145/3158107","title":"Simplifying ARM concurrency: multicopy-atomic axiomatic and operational models for ARMv8","abstract":"ARM has a relaxed memory model, previously specified in informal prose for ARMv7 and ARMv8. Over time, and partly due to work building formal semantics for ARM concurrency, it has become clear that some of the complexity of the model is not justified by the potential benefits. In particular, the model was originally non-multicopy-atomic: writes could become visible to some other threads before becoming visible to all \u2014 but this has not been exploited in production implementations, the corresponding potential hardware optimisations are thought to have insufficient benefits in the ARM context, and it gives rise to subtle complications when combined with other ARMv8 features. The ARMv8 architecture has therefore been revised: it now has a multicopy-atomic model. It has also been simplified in other respects, including more straightforward notions of dependency, and the architecture now includes a formal concurrency model. In this paper we detail these changes and discuss their motivation. We define two formal concurrency models: an operational one, simplifying the Flowing model of Flur et al., and the axiomatic model of the revised ARMv8 specification. The models were developed by an academic group and by ARM staff, respectively, and this extended collaboration partly motivated the above changes. We prove the equivalence of the two models. The operational model is integrated into an executable exploration tool with new web interface, demonstrated by exhaustively checking the possible behaviours of a loop-unrolled version of a Linux kernel lock implementation, a previously known bug due to unprevented speculation, and a fixed version.","author":["Christopher Pulte","Shaked Flur","Will Deacon","Jon French","Susmit Sarkar","Peter Sewell"],"issue":["Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages","Volume 2","Issue POPL","January 2018","Article No.: 19","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/3158107"],"date":"27 December 2017","ref":[{"text":"Allon Adir, Hagit Attiya, and Gil Shurek. 2003.

Using the Robotic Social Attributes Scale (RoSAS), we explore how users socially judge robot receivers as three factors are varied: initial position of the robot arm prior to handover, grasp method employed by the robot when receiving a handover object trading off perceived object safety for time efficiency, and retraction speed of the arm following handover. Our results show that over multiple handover interactions with the robot, users gradually perceive the robot receiver as being less discomforting and having more emotional warmth. Additionally, we have found that by varying grasp method and retraction speed, users may hold significantly different judgments of robot competence and discomfort. With these results, we recognize empirically that users are able to develop social perceptions of robots which can change through modification of robot receiving behaviour and through repeated interaction with the robot. More widely, this work suggests that measurement of user social perceptions should play a larger role in the design and evaluation of human-robot interactions and that the RoSAS can serve as a standardized tool in this regard.","author":["Matthew K.X.J.

SGD is widely used for Collaborative Filtering (CF), itself a well-known machine learning technique for recommender systems. In this paper, we develop an FPGA-based accelerator, FASTCF, to accelerate the SGD-based CF algorithm. FASTCF consists of parallel, pipelined processing units which concurrently process distinct user ratings by accessing a shared on-chip buffer. We design FASTCF through a holistic analysis of the specific design challenges for the acceleration of SGD-based CF on FPGA. Based on our analysis of these design challenges, we develop a bipartite graph processing approach with a novel 3-level hierarchical partitioning scheme that enables conflict-minimizing scheduling and processing of on-chip feature vector data to significantly accelerate the processing of this bipartite graph. First, we develop a fast heuristic to partition the input graph into induced subgraphs; this enables FASTCF to efficiently buffer vertex data for reuse and completely hide communication overhead. Second, we partition all the edges of each subgraph into matchings to extract the maximum parallelism. Third, we schedule the execution of the edges inside each matching to reduce concurrent memory access conflicts to the shared on-chip buffer. Compared with non-optimized baseline designs, the hierarchical partitioning approach results in up to 60x data dependency reduction, 4.2x bank conflict reduction, and 15.4x speedup. We implement FASTCF based on state-of-the-art FPGA and evaluate its performance using three large real-life datasets. Experimental results show that FASTCF sustains a high throughput of up to 217 billion floating-point operations per second (GFLOPS). Compared with state-of-the-art multi-core and GPU implementations, FASTCF demonstrates 13.3x and 12.7x speedup, respectively.","author":["Shijie Zhou","Rajgopal Kannan","Yu Min","Viktor K.

The emerging Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) has been considered as an energy-efficient replacement of DRAM for next-generation main memory. In this article, we propose an RRAM-based SQL query unit with process-in-memory (PIM) characteristics. A bidirectional storage structure for a database in RRAM crossbar array is proposed that avoids redundant data transfer to cache and reduces cache miss rate compared with the storage method in DRAM for an in-memory database. The proposed RRAM-based SQL query unit can support a representative subset of SQL queries in memory and thus can further reduce the data transfer cost. The corresponding query optimization method is proposed to fully utilize the PIM characteristics. Simulation results show that the energy efficiency of the proposed RRAM-based SQL query unit is increased by 4 to 6 orders of magnitudes compared with the traditional architecture.","author":["Yuliang Sun","Yu Wang","Huazhong Yang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 14","Issue 1","April 2018","Article No.: 8","pp   1\u201319","https://doi.org/10.1145/3177917"],"date":"09 March 2018","ref":[{"text":"Peter Bakkum and Kevin Skadron. 2010.

Among these techniques, Statistical Fault Localization (SFL) is particularly popular. One issue with SFL is that it is based on strong, often unrealistic assumptions on how developers behave when debugging. To address this problem, we propose Enlighten, an interactive, feedback-driven fault localization technique. Given a failing test, Enlighten (1) leverages SFL and dynamic dependence analysis to identify suspicious method invocations and corresponding data values, (2) presents the developer with a query about the most suspicious invocation expressed in terms of inputs and outputs, (3) encodes the developer feedback on the correctness of individual data values as extra program specifications, and (4) repeats these steps until the fault is found. We evaluated Enlighten in two ways. First, we applied Enlighten to 1,807 real and seeded faults in 3 open source programs using an automated oracle as a simulated user; for over 96% of these faults, Enlighten required less than 10 interactions with the simulated user to localize the fault, and a sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust to erroneous responses. Second, we performed an actual user study on 4 faults with 24 participants and found that participants who used Enlighten performed significantly better than those not using our tool, in terms of both number of faults localized and time needed to localize the faults.","author":["Xiangyu Li","Shaowei Zhu","Marcelo d'Amorim","Alessandro Orso"],"issue":["ICSE '18: Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Software Engineering","May 2018","Pages   82\u201392","https://doi.org/10.1145/3180155.3180242"],"date":"27 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"2015.

As opposed to Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) and Asynchronous Parallel (AP) models, AAP reduces both stragglers and stale computations by dynamically adjusting relative progress of workers. We show that BSP, AP and Stale Synchronous Parallel model (SSP) are special cases of AAP. Better yet, AAP optimizes parallel processing by adaptively switching among these models at different stages of a single execution. Moreover, employing the programming model of GRAPE, AAP aims to parallelize existing sequential algorithms based on fixpoint computation with partial and incremental evaluation. Under a monotone condition, AAP guarantees to converge at correct answers if the sequential algorithms are correct. Furthermore, we show that AAP can optimally simulate MapReduce, PRAM, BSP, AP and SSP. Using real-life and synthetic graphs, we experimentally verify that AAP outperforms BSP, AP and SSP for a variety of graph computations.","author":["Wenfei Fan","Ping Lu","Xiaojian Luo","Jingbo Xu","Qiang Yin","Wenyuan Yu","Ruiqi Xu"],"issue":["SIGMOD '18: Proceedings of the 2018 International Conference on Management of Data","May 2018","Pages   1141\u20131156","https://doi.org/10.1145/3183713.3196918"],"date":"27 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"Friendster. https://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-Friendster.html.","order":1},{"text":"Giraph. http://giraph.apache.org/.","order":2},{"text":"GTgraph. http://www.cse.psu.edu/~kxm85/software/GTgraph/.","order":3},{"text":"Movielens. http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/.","order":4},{"text":"MPICH. https://www.mpich.org/.","order":5},{"text":"Netflix prize data. https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data.","order":6},{"text":"Traffic. http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml.","order":7},{"text":"UKWeb. http://law.di.unimi.it/webdata/uk-union-2006-06--2007-05/, 2006.","order":8},{"text":"U.

The adaptive AMG presented is meant to handle general symmetric and positive definite (SPD) sparse linear systems, without assuming any a priori information of the problem and its origin; the goal of adaptivity is to achieve a method with a prescribed convergence rate. The presented method exploits a general coarsening process based on aggregation of unknowns, obtained by a maximum weight matching in the adjacency graph of the system matrix. More specifically, a maximum product matching is employed to define an effective smoother subspace (complementary to the coarse space), a process referred to as compatible relaxation, at every level of the recursive two-level hierarchical AMG process.Results on a large variety of test cases and comparisons with related work demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of the method and of the software.","author":["Pasqua D\u2019ambra","Salvatore Filippone","Panayot S.

Previous work showed that analog multipliers based on nonvolatile memories have superior energy efficiency as compared to digital counterparts at low-to-medium computing precision. In this paper, we propose extremely energy efficient analog mode VMM circuit with digital input/output interface and configurable precision. Similar to some previous work, the computation is performed by gate-coupled circuit utilizing embedded floating gate (FG) memories. The main novelty of our approach is an ultra-low power sensing circuitry, which is designed based on translinear Gilbert cell in topological combination with a floating resistor and a low-gain amplifier. Additionally, the digital-to-analog input conversion is merged with VMM, while current-mode algorithmic analog-to-digital circuit is employed at the circuit backend. Such implementations of conversion and sensing allow for circuit operation entirely in a current domain, resulting in high performance and energy efficiency. For example, post-layout simulation results for 400\u00d7400 5-bit VMM circuit designed in 55 nm process with embedded NOR flash memory, show up to 400 MHz operation, 1.68 POps/J energy efficiency, and 39.45 TOps/mm2 computing throughput. Moreover, the circuit is robust against process-voltage-temperature variations, in part due to inclusion of additional FG cells that are utilized for offset compensation.","author":["M.

In contrast to this sequential design approach, we consider joint optimization of an optical system (for example, the physical shape of the lens) together with the parameters of the reconstruction algorithm. We build a fully-differentiable simulation model that maps the true source image to the reconstructed one. The model includes diffractive light propagation, depth and wavelength-dependent effects, noise and nonlinearities, and the image post-processing. We jointly optimize the optical parameters and the image processing algorithm parameters so as to minimize the deviation between the true and reconstructed image, over a large set of images. We implement our joint optimization method using autodifferentiation to efficiently compute parameter gradients in a stochastic optimization algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by applying it to achromatic extended depth of field and snapshot super-resolution imaging.","author":["Vincent Sitzmann","Steven Diamond","Yifan Peng","Xiong Dun","Stephen Boyd","Wolfgang Heidrich","Felix Heide","Gordon Wetzstein"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 37","Issue 4","August 2018","Article No.: 114","pp   1\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/3197517.3201333"],"date":"30 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"N.

It moves along the function with steps proportional to the negative of the gradient. Quantum version of this algorithm has the advantage of exponential speedup for problems with high dimensional inputs. On the other hand, Factorization Machines (FMs) are modeling classes with important advantages in comparison with other modeling ones such as SVMs. They, in contrast to SVMs, use factorized parameters in order to model all interactions between variables. Accordingly, unlike SVMs, they can estimate interactions in problems with large sparsity. In this work, we show that Factorization Machine can be implemented on quantum computers, using quantum gradient descent to learn the parameters of a FM. The parameters we have chosen to learn via quantum gradient descent is a bottleneck in learning parameters of a FM. Our proposed idea results in time computational complexity O(k polylog n) where k and n are the dimensions of the parameter matrix. By doing so and under some constraints on the dimensions, an exponential speedup over classical algorithms can be obtained.","author":["Narges Alavi Samani","Hossein Aghababa"],"issue":["SETN '18: Proceedings of the 10th Hellenic Conference on Artificial Intelligence","July 2018","Article No.: 49","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.1145/3200947.3201025"],"date":"09 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Rendle, S. 2010.

Such dense vector representations offer great promises for many network analysis problems. However, existing NE approaches are still faced with challenges posed by the characteristics of complex networks in real-world applications. First, for many real-world networks associated with rich content information, previous NE methods tend to learn separated content and structure representations for each node, which requires a post-processing of combination. The empirical and simple combination strategies often make the final vector suboptimal. Second, the existing NE methods preserve the structure information by considering short and fixed neighborhood scope, such as the first- and/or the second-order proximities. However, it is hard to decide the scope of the neighborhood when facing a complex problem. To this end, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model based NE framework which is referred to as Self-Translation Network Embedding (STNE) model. With the sequences generated by random walks on a network, STNE learns the mapping that translates each sequence itself from the content sequence to the node sequence. On the one hand, the bi-directional LSTM encoder of STNE fuses the content and structure information seamlessly from the raw input. On the other hand, high-order proximity can be flexibly learned with the memories of LSTM to capture long-range structural information. By such self-translation from content to node, the learned hidden representations can be adopted as node embeddings. Extensive experimental results based on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed STNE outperforms the state-of-the-art NE approaches. To facilitate reproduction and further study, we provide Internet access to the code and datasets\\footnotehttp://dm.nankai.edu.cn/code/STNE.rar.","author":["Jie Liu","Zhicheng He","Lai Wei","Yalou Huang"],"issue":["KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2018","Pages   1794\u20131802","https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3219988"],"date":"19 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio . 2014.

More recently, ANNs have caught attention of the bioinformatics community for their ability to not only speed up by not having to assemble genomes but also work with imperfect data set with duplications. ANNs for bioinformatics also have the added attraction of better scaling for massive parallelism compared to traditional bioinformatics algorithms. In this paper, we have adapted Self-organizing Maps for rapid identification of bacterial genomes called BioSOM. BioSOM has been implemented on a design of two coarse grain reconfigurable fabrics customized for dense linear algebra and streaming scratchpad memory respectively. These fabrics are implemented in a novel synchoros VLSI design style that enables composition by abutment. The synchoricity empowers rapid and accurate synthesis from Matlab models to create near ASIC like efficient solution. This platform, called SiLago (Silicon Lego) is benchmarked against a GPU implementation. The SiLago implementation of BioSOMs in four different dimensions, 128, 256, 512 and 1024 Neurons, were trained for two E Coli strains of bacteria with 40K training vectors. The results of SiLago implementation were benchmarked against a GPU GTX 1070 implementation in the CUDA framework. The comparison reveals 4 to 140X speed up and 4 to 5 orders of improvement in energy-delay product compared to implementation on GPU. This extreme efficiency comes with the added benefit of automated generation of GDSII level design from Matlab by using the Synchoros VLSI design style.","author":["Yu Yang","Dimitrios Stathis","Prashant Sharma","Kolin Paul","Ahmed Hemani","Manfred Grabherr","Rafi Ahmad"],"issue":["SAMOS '18: Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation","July 2018","Pages   105\u2013114","https://doi.org/10.1145/3229631.3229650"],"date":"15 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Takashi Abe, Kennosuke Wada, Yuki Iwasaki, and Toshimichi Ikemura. 2009.

Following the rapid adoption of FaaS technologies and the introduction of numerous self hosted FaaS systems, the need for real time monitoring and scheduling of functions in an ecosystem of providers has become critical. In this paper, we present MPSC, a framework for supporting Multi-Provider Serverless Computing. MPSC monitors the performance of serverless providers in real time, and schedules applications across these providers. In addition, MPSC also provides APIs for users to define their own scheduling algorithms. When compared to scheduling on a single cloud resource MPSC provides a 4X speedup across multiple providers in a volatile edge computing environment.","author":["Austin Aske","Xinghui Zhao"],"issue":["ICPP '18: Proceedings of the 47th International Conference on Parallel Processing Companion","August 2018","Article No.: 20","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3229710.3229742"],"date":"13 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"2018.

Syllable segmentation methods based on matching lead to performance subject to the syllable segmentation effect. This article proposes a word segmentation method with fusion conditions of double syllable features. It combines word segmentation and segmentation of syllables into one process, thus reducing the impact of errors on the syllable segmentation of Burmese. In the first layer of the conditional random fields (CRF) model, Burmese characters as atomic features are integrated into the Burma section of the Barkis Speech Paradigm (Backus normal form) features to realize the Burma syllable sequence tags. In the second layer of the CRFs model, with the syllable marked as input, it realizes the sequence markers through building a feature template with syllables as atomic features. The experimental results show that the proposed method has a better effect compared with the method based on the matching of syllables.","author":["Shaoning Zhang","Cunli Mao","Zhengtao Yu","Hongbin Wang","Zhongwei Li","Jiafu Zhang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing","Volume 18","Issue 1","January 2019","Article No.: 6","pp   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/3232537"],"date":"12 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"Sun Maosong and Zou Jiayan. 2001.

However, most existing algorithms only exploit the visual cues of these concepts but ignore external knowledge information for modeling their relationships during the evolution of videos. In fact, humans have remarkable ability to utilize acquired knowledge to reason about the dynamically changing world. To narrow the knowledge gap between existing methods and humans, we propose an end-to-end video classification framework based on a structured knowledge graph, which can model the dynamic knowledge evolution in videos overtime. Here, we map the concepts of videos to the nodes of the knowledge graph. To effectively leverage the knowledge graph, we adopt a graph convLSTM model to not only identify local knowledge structures in each video shot but also model dynamic patterns of knowledge evolution across these shots. Furthermore, a novel knowledge-based attention model is designed by considering the importance of each video shot and relationships between concepts. We show that by using knowledge graphs, our framework is able to improve the performance of various existing methods. Extensive experimental results on two video classification benchmarks UCF101 and Youtube-8M demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed framework.","author":["Junyu Gao","Tianzhu Zhang","Changsheng Xu"],"issue":["MM '18: Proceedings of the 26th ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2018","Pages   690\u2013699","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240508.3240566"],"date":"15 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Sami Abu-El-Haija, Nisarg Kothari, Joonseok Lee, Paul Natsev, George Toderici, Balakrishnan Varadarajan, and Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan. 2016.

Towards efficient image classification under hardware constraints, prior work has proposed adaptive CNNs, i.e., systems of networks with different accuracy and computation characteristics, where a selection scheme adaptively selects the network to be evaluated for each input image. While previous efforts have investigated different network selection schemes, we find that they do not necessarily result in energy savings when deployed on mobile systems. The key limitation of existing methods is that they learn only how data should be processed among the CNNs and not the network architectures, with each network being treated as a blackbox. To address this limitation, we pursue a more powerful design paradigm where the architecture settings of the CNNs are treated as hyper-parameters to be globally optimized. We cast the design of adaptive CNNs as a hyper-parameter optimization problem with respect to energy, accuracy, and communication constraints imposed by the mobile device. To efficiently solve this problem, we adapt Bayesian optimization to the properties of the design space, reaching near-optimal configurations in few tens of function evaluations. Our method reduces the energy consumed for image classification on a mobile device by up to 6X, compared to the best previously published work that uses CNNs as blackboxes. Finally, we evaluate two image classification practices, i.e., classifying all images locally versus over the cloud under energy and communication constraints.","author":["Dimitrios Stamoulis","Ting-Wu (Rudy) Chin","Anand Krishnan Prakash","Haocheng Fang","Sribhuvan Sajja","Mitchell Bognar","Diana Marculescu"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 23","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240796"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"T.

Reservoir computing, an emerging computing paradigm based on the recurrent neural network with proven benefits across multifaceted applications, offers an alternative training mechanism only at the readout stage. In this work, we successfully design and fabricate an energy-efficient analog delayed feedback reservoir (DFR) computing system, which is built upon a temporal encoding scheme, a nonlinear transfer function, and a dynamic delayed feedback loop. Measurement results demonstrate its high energy efficiency with rich dynamic behaviors, making the designed system a candidate for low power embedded applications. The system performance, as well as the robustness, are studied and analyzed through the Monte Carlo simulation. The chaotic time series prediction benchmark, NARMA10, is examined through the proposed DFR computing system, and exhibits a 36%\u221285% reduction on the error rate compared to state-of-the-art DFR computing system designs. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first analog integrated circuit (IC) implementation of the DFR computing system.","author":["Kangjun Bai","Yang Yi"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 14","Issue 4","December 2018","Article No.: 45","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/3264659"],"date":"06 December 2018","ref":[{"text":"Abdulrahman Alalshekmubarak and Leslie S.

Entity linking for these short texts is quite important. Most of supervised approaches are not effective for short text entity linking. The training data for supervised approaches are not suitable for short text and insufficient for low-resourced languages. Previous unsupervised methods are incapable of handling the sparsity and noisy problem of short text. We try to solve the problem by mapping the sparse short text to a topic space. We notice that the concepts of entities have rich topic information and characterize entities in a very fine-grained granularity. Hence, we use the concepts of entities as topics to explicitly represent the context, which helps improve the performance of entity linking for short text. We leverage our linking approach to segment the short text semantically, and build a system for short entity text recognition and linking. Our entity linking approach exhibits the state-of-the-art performance on several datasets for the realistic short text entity linking problem.","author":["Lihan Chen","Jiaqing Liang","Chenhao Xie","Yanghua Xiao"],"issue":["CIKM '18: Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2018","Pages   457\u2013466","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271809"],"date":"17 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Nitish Aggarwal and Paul Buitelaar. 2014.

Edge cloud or edge computing is an emerging topic and a technology that can tackle the deficiencies of the currently centralized-only cloud computing model and move the computation and storage resources closer to the devices in support of the above-mentioned applications. To make this happen, efficient coordination mechanisms and \u201coffloading\u201d algorithms are needed to allow mobile devices and the edge cloud to work together smoothly. In this survey article, we investigate the key issues, methods, and various state-of-the-art efforts related to the offloading problem. We adopt a new characterizing model to study the whole process of offloading from mobile devices to the edge cloud. Through comprehensive discussions, we aim to draw an overall \u201cbig picture\u201d on the existing efforts and research directions. Our study also indicates that the offloading algorithms in the edge cloud have demonstrated profound potentials for future technology and application development.","author":["Jianyu Wang","Jianli Pan","Flavio Esposito","Prasad Calyam","Zhicheng Yang","Prasant Mohapatra"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 52","Issue 1","February 2019","Article No.: 2","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3284387"],"date":"13 February 2019","ref":[{"text":"2018.

Genomics data, however, is far outpacing Moore\u00bbs Law. Third-generation sequencing technologies produce 100X longer reads than second generation technologies and reveal a much broader mutation spectrum of disease and evolution. However, these technologies incur prohibitively high computational costs. Over 1,300 CPU hours are required for reference-guided assembly of the human genome, and over 15,600 CPU hours are required for de novo assembly. This paper describes \"Darwin\" --- a co-processor for genomic sequence alignment that, without sacrificing sensitivity, provides up to $15,000X speedup over the state-of-the-art software for reference-guided assembly of third-generation reads. Darwin achieves this speedup through hardware/algorithm co-design, trading more easily accelerated alignment for less memory-intensive filtering, and by optimizing the memory system for filtering. Darwin combines a hardware-accelerated version of D-SOFT, a novel filtering algorithm, alignment at high speed, and with a hardware-accelerated version of GACT, a novel alignment algorithm. GACT generates near-optimal alignments of arbitrarily long genomic sequences using constant memory for the compute-intensive step. Darwin is adaptable, with tunable speed and sensitivity to match emerging sequencing technologies and to meet the requirements of genomic applications beyond read assembly.","author":["Yatish Turakhia","Gill Bejerano","William J.

A practical concern, in the rush to adopt DL models as a service, is protecting the models against Intellectual Property (IP) infringement. DL models are commonly built by allocating substantial computational resources that process vast amounts of proprietary training data. The resulting models are therefore considered to be an IP of the model builder and need to be protected to preserve the owner's competitive advantage. We propose DeepSigns, the first end-to-end IP protection framework that enables developers to systematically insert digital watermarks in the target DL model before distributing the model. DeepSigns is encapsulated as a high-level wrapper that can be leveraged within common deep learning frameworks including TensorFlow and PyTorch. The libraries in DeepSigns work by dynamically learning the Probability Density Function (pdf) of activation maps obtained in different layers of a DL model. DeepSigns uses the low probabilistic regions within the model to gradually embed the owner's signature (watermark) during DL training while minimally affecting the overall accuracy and training overhead. DeepSigns can demonstrably withstand various removal and transformation attacks, including model pruning, model fine-tuning, and watermark overwriting. We evaluate DeepSigns performance on a wide variety of DL architectures including wide residual convolution neural networks, multi-layer perceptrons, and long short-term memory models. Our extensive evaluations corroborate DeepSigns' effectiveness and applicability. We further provide a highly-optimized accompanying API to facilitate training watermarked neural networks with a training overhead as low as 2.2%.","author":["Bita Darvish Rouhani","Huili Chen","Farinaz Koushanfar"],"issue":["ASPLOS '19: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","April 2019","Pages   485\u2013497","https://doi.org/10.1145/3297858.3304051"],"date":"04 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"Y.

Decision making at the edge of a wireless sensor network promises fast response times but is limited by the availability of energy, data transfer speed, processing and memory constraints. In this work we present a realization of a wireless sensor network for hazard monitoring based on an array of event-triggered single-channel micro-seismic sensors with advanced signal processing and characterization capabilities based on a novel co-detection technique. On the one hand we leverage an ultra-low power, threshold-triggering circuit paired with on-demand digital signal acquisition capable of extracting relevant information exactly and efficiently at times when it matters most and consequentially not wasting precious resources when nothing can be observed. On the other hand we utilize machine-learning-based classification implemented on low-power, off-the-shelf microcontrollers to avoid false positive warnings and to actively identify humans in hazard zones. The sensors' response time and memory requirement is substantially improved by quantizing and pipelining the inference of a convolutional neural network. In this way, convolutional neural networks that would not run unmodified on a memory constrained device can be executed in real-time and at scale on low-power embedded devices.

Recent advances in memory technology have enabled near-data accelerators (NDAs), which reside off-chip close to main memory and can yield further benefits than on-chip accelerators. However, enforcing coherence with the rest of the system, which is already a major challenge for accelerators, becomes more difficult for NDAs. This is because (1) the cost of communication between NDAs and CPUs is high, and (2) NDA applications generate a lot of off-chip data movement. As a result, as we show in this work, existing coherence mechanisms eliminate most of the benefits of NDAs. We extensively analyze these mechanisms, and observe that (1) the majority of off-chip coherence traffic is unnecessary, and (2) much of the off-chip traffic can be eliminated if a coherence mechanism has insight into the memory accesses performed by the NDA. Based on our observations, we propose CoNDA, a coherence mechanism that lets an NDA optimistically execute an NDA kernel, under the assumption that the NDA has all necessary coherence permissions. This optimistic execution allows CoNDA to gather information on the memory accesses performed by the NDA and by the rest of the system. CoNDA exploits this information to avoid performing unnecessary coherence requests, and thus, significantly reduces data movement for coherence. We evaluate CoNDA using state-of-the-art graph processing and hybrid in-memory database workloads. Averaged across all of our workloads operating on modest data set sizes, CoNDA improves performance by 19.6% over the highest-performance prior coherence mechanism (66.0%/51.7% over a CPU-only/NDA-only system) and reduces memory system energy consumption by 18.0% over the most energy-efficient prior coherence mechanism (43.7% over CPU-only). CoNDA comes within 10.4% and 4.4% of the performance and energy of an ideal mechanism with no cost for coherence. The benefits of CoNDA increase with large data sets, as CoNDA improves performance over the highest-performance prior coherence mechanism by 38.3% (8.4x/7.7x over CPU-only/NDA-only), and comes within 10.2% of an ideal no-cost coherence mechanism.","author":["Amirali Boroumand","Saugata Ghose","Minesh Patel","Hasan Hassan","Brandon Lucia","Rachata Ausavarungnirun","Kevin Hsieh","Nastaran Hajinazar","Krishna T.

Targeting energy efficiency, approximate designs for multipliers, adders, and multiply-accumulate (MAC) have been extensively investigated in the past decade. However, accelerator designs for relatively bigger architectures have been of less attention yet. The Least Squares (LS) algorithm is widely used in digital signal processing applications, e.g., image reconstruction. This work proposes a novel LS accelerator design based on a heterogeneous architecture, where the heterogeneity is introduced using accurate and approximate processing cores. We have considered a case study of radio astronomy calibration processing that employs a complex-input iterative LS algorithm. Our proposed methodology exploits the intrinsic error-resilience of the aforesaid algorithm, where initial iterations are processed on approximate modules while the later ones on accurate modules. Our energy-quality experiments have shown up to 24% of energy savings as compared to an accurate (optimized) counterpart for biased designs and up to 29% energy savings when unbiasing is introduced. The proposed LS accelerator design does not increase the number of iterations and provides sufficient precision to converge to an acceptable solution.","author":["G. A. Gillani","A. Krapukhin","A. B.

Such codes generalize stabilizer QLDPC codes, which are exact quantum error-correcting codes with sparse, low-weight stabilizer generators (i.e. each stabilizer generator acts on a few qubits, and each qubit participates in a few stabilizer generators). Our investigation is motivated by an important question in Hamiltonian complexity and quantum coding theory: do stabilizer QLDPC codes with constant rate, linear distance, and constant-weight stabilizers exist?  We show that obtaining such optimal scaling of parameters (modulo polylogarithmic corrections) is possible if we go beyond stabilizer codes: we prove the existence of a family of [[N,k,d,\u03b5]] approximate QLDPC codes that encode k = \u03a9(N) logical qubits into N physical qubits with distance d = \u03a9(N) and approximation infidelity \u03b5 = 1/(N). The code space is stabilized by a set of 10-local noncommuting projectors, with each physical qubit only participating in N projectors. We prove the existence of an efficient encoding map and show that the spectral gap of the code Hamiltonian scales as \u03a9(N\u22123.09). We also show that arbitrary Pauli errors can be locally detected by circuits of polylogarithmic depth.  Our family of approximate QLDPC codes is based on applying a recent connection between circuit Hamiltonians and approximate quantum codes (Nirkhe, et al., ICALP 2018) to a result showing that random Clifford circuits of polylogarithmic depth yield asymptotically good quantum codes (Brown and Fawzi, ISIT 2013). Then, in order to obtain a code with sparse checks and strong detection of local errors, we use a spacetime circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction in order to take advantage of the parallelism of the Brown-Fawzi circuits. Because of this, we call our codes spacetime codes.  The analysis of the spectral gap of the code Hamiltonian is the main technical contribution of this work. We show that for any depth D quantum circuit on n qubits there is an associated spacetime circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction with spectral gap \u03a9(n\u22123.09 D\u22122 log\u22126(n)). To lower bound this gap we use a Markov chain decomposition method to divide the state space of partially completed circuit configurations into overlapping subsets corresponding to uniform circuit segments of depth logn, which are based on bitonic sorting circuits. We use the combinatorial properties of these circuit configurations to show rapid mixing between the subsets, and within the subsets we develop a novel isomorphism between the local update Markov chain on bitonic circuit configurations and the edge-flip Markov chain on equal-area dyadic tilings, whose mixing time was recently shown to be polynomial (Cannon, Levin, and Stauffer, RANDOM 2017). Previous lower bounds on the spectral gap of spacetime circuit Hamiltonians have all been based on a connection to exactly solvable quantum spin chains and applied only to 1+1 dimensional nearest-neighbor quantum circuits with at least linear depth.","author":["Thomas C.

A plethora of blockchain consensus protocols have been proposed---ranging from new designs, to novel modifications and extensions of consensus protocols from the classical distributed systems literature. The inherent complexity of consensus protocols and their rapid and dramatic evolution makes it hard to contextualize the design landscape. We address this challenge by conducting a systematization of knowledge of blockchain consensus protocols. After first discussing key themes in classical consensus protocols, we describe: (i) protocols based on proof-of-work; (ii) proof-of-X protocols that replace proof-of-work with more energy-efficient alternatives; and (iii) hybrid protocols that are compositions or variations of classical consensus protocols. This survey is guided by a systematization framework we develop, to highlight the various building blocks of blockchain consensus design, along with a discussion on their security and performance properties.

However, cameras inside are generating a large amount of data, which brings challenges to the transmission through resource-constrained wireless networks. Observing that most collected consecutive frames are redundant with few objects of interest (OoIs), the filtering of these frames can dramatically relieve the transmission pressure. Additionally, real-world environment may bring shielding or blind areas in videos, which notoriously affects the accuracy of frame analysis. The collaboration between cameras facing at different angles can compensate for such accuracy loss. In this work, we present Litedge, a light-weight edge computing strategy to improve the QoS (i.e., the latency and accuracy) of wireless surveillance systems. Two main modules are designed on edge cameras: (i) the light-weight video compression module for frame filtering, mainly realized by model compression and convolutional acceleration; and (ii) the collaborative validation module for error compensation between the master-slave camera pair. We also implement an enhanced surveillance system prototype from real-time monitoring and pre-processing on edge cameras to the backend data analysis on a server. Experiments based on real-world collected videos show the efficiency of Litedge. It achieves 82% transmission latency reduction with a maximal 0.119s additional processing delay, compared with the full video transmission. Remarkably, 91.28% of redundant frames are successfully filtered out, greatly reducing the transmission burden. Litedge outperforms state-of-the-art light-weight AI models and video compression methods by balancing the QoS balance ratio between accuracy and latency.","author":["Yutong Liu","Linghe Kong","Muhammad Hassan","Long Cheng","Guangtao Xue","Guihai Chen"],"issue":["IWQoS '19: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Quality of Service","June 2019","Article No.: 31","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3326285.3329066"],"date":"24 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"D.

Ranging from early matrix factorization to recently emerged deep learning based methods, existing efforts typically obtain a user's (or an item's) embedding by mapping from pre-existing features that describe the user (or the item), such as ID and attributes. We argue that an inherent drawback of such methods is that, the collaborative signal, which is latent in user-item interactions, is not encoded in the embedding process. As such, the resultant embeddings may not be sufficient to capture the collaborative filtering effect. In this work, we propose to integrate the user-item interactions - more specifically the bipartite graph structure - into the embedding process. We develop a new recommendation framework Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF), which exploits the user-item graph structure by propagating embeddings on it. This leads to the expressive modeling of high-order connectivity in user-item graph, effectively injecting the collaborative signal into the embedding process in an explicit manner. We conduct extensive experiments on three public benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements over several state-of-the-art models like HOP-Rec [39] and Collaborative Memory Network [5]. Further analysis verifies the importance of embedding propagation for learning better user and item representations, justifying the rationality and effectiveness of NGCF.

From the viewpoint of data structure, the coursework can be potentially structured as a graph. Incorporating this graph-structured nature into the knowledge tracing model as a relational inductive bias can improve its performance; however, previous methods, such as deep knowledge tracing, did not consider such a latent graph structure. Inspired by the recent successes of the graph neural network (GNN), we herein propose a GNN-based knowledge tracing method, i.e., graph-based knowledge tracing. Casting the knowledge structure as a graph enabled us to reformulate the knowledge tracing task as a time-series node-level classification problem in the GNN. As the knowledge graph structure is not explicitly provided in most cases, we propose various implementations of the graph structure. Empirical validations on two open datasets indicated that our method could potentially improve the prediction of student performance and demonstrated more interpretable predictions compared to those of the previous methods, without the requirement of any additional information.","author":["Hiromi Nakagawa","Yusuke Iwasawa","Yutaka Matsuo"],"issue":["WI '19: IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence","October 2019","Pages   156\u2013163","https://doi.org/10.1145/3350546.3352513"],"date":"14 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Peter Battaglia, Razvan Pascanu, Matthew Lai, Danilo\u00a0Jimenez Rezende, 2016.

Many open domain and specific domain knowledge graphs have been constructed, and many industries have benefited from knowledge graph. Currently, enterprise related knowledge graph is classified as specific domain, but the applications span from solving a narrow specific problem to Enterprise Knowledge Management system. With the digital transform of traditional industry, Enterprise knowledge becomes more and more complicated, it involves knowledge from common domain, multiple specific domains, and corporate-specific in general. This tutorial provides an overview of current Enterprise Knowledge Graph(EKG). It distinguishes the EKG from specific domain according to the knowledge it covers, and provides the examples to illustrate the difference between EKG and specific domain KG. The tutorial further summarizes EKG into three types: Specific Business Task Enterprise KG, Specific Business Unit Enterprise KG and Cross Business Unit Enterprise KG, and illustrates the characteristics, steps, challenges, and future research in constructing and consuming of each of these three types of EKG .","author":["Rong Duan","Yanghua Xiao"],"issue":["CIKM '19: Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2019","Pages   2965\u20132966","https://doi.org/10.1145/3357384.3360314"],"date":"03 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"Eugene Agichtein and Luis Gravano. 2000.

Emerging non-volatile technologies, such as memristor, enable new resistive architectures that alleviate at least two of such bottlenecks, as they can process data within the memory with almost no leakage. In this paper, we propose a novel resistive computing architecture by extending a conventional architecture with a resistive based Computation-In-Memory accelerator (CIMX). We evaluate the delay, energy and area of the conventional and CIMX architecture using an analytical model and a simulation framework. The results (both based on the analytical model and simulation framework) show that the proposed architecture achieves at least one order of magnitude improvement in terms of performance, area, and energy efficiency for the considered benchmarks.","author":["Hoang Anh Du Nguyen","Jintao Yu","Muath Abu Lebdeh","Mottaqiallah Taouil","Said Hamdioui"],"issue":["MEMSYS '19: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Memory Systems","September 2019","Pages   19\u201332","https://doi.org/10.1145/3357526.3357554"],"date":"30 September 2019","ref":[{"text":"David A Patterson. 2006.

These characteristics position NVM as a promising new tier in the memory hierarchy. Nevertheless, NVM has asymmetric read and write performance, and considerably higher write energy than DRAM. Our work provides an in-depth evaluation of the first commercially available byte-addressable NVM -- the Intel Optane\u00ae DC\u2122 persistent memory. The first part of our study quantifies the latency, bandwidth, power efficiency, and energy consumption under eight memory configurations. We also evaluate the real impact on in-memory graph processing workloads. Our results show that augmenting NVM with DRAM is essential, and the combination can effectively bridge the performance gap and provide reasonable performance with higher capacity. We also identify NUMA-related performance characteristics for accesses to memory on a remote socket. In the second part, we employ two fine-grained allocation policies to control traffic distribution between DRAM and NVM. Our results show that bandwidth spilling between DRAM and NVM could provide 2.0x bandwidth and enable 20% larger problems than using DRAM as a cache. Also, write isolation between DRAM and NVM could save up to 3.9x energy and improves bandwidth by 3.1x compared to DRAM-cached NVM. We establish a roofline model to explore power and energy efficiency at various distributions of read-only traffic. Our results show that NVM requires 1.8x lower power than DRAM for data-intensive workloads. Overall, applications can significantly optimize performance and power efficiency by adapting traffic distribution to NVM and DRAM through memory configurations and fine-grained policies to fully exploit the new memory device.","author":["Ivy B.

A novel graph neural network reasons over the free-text graph\u2014combining evidence on the nodes via information along edge sentences\u2014to select a final answer. Experiments on three question answering datasets show delft can answer entity-rich questions better than machine reading based models, bert-based answer ranking and memory networks. delft\u2019s advantage comes from both the high coverage of its free-text knowledge graph\u2014more than double that of dbpedia relations\u2014and the novel graph neural network which reasons on the rich but noisy free-text evidence.","author":["Chen Zhao","Chenyan Xiong","Xin Qian","Jordan Boyd-Graber"],"issue":["WWW '20: Proceedings of The Web Conference 2020","April 2020","Pages   1205\u20131216","https://doi.org/10.1145/3366423.3380197"],"date":"20 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"Junwei Bao, Nan Duan, Ming Zhou, and Tiejun Zhao. 2014.

With its unique in-memory computing feature, resistive crossbar-based computing attracts researchers\u2019 attention as a promising solution to the memory bottleneck issue in von Neumann architectures. However, the parasitic resistances in crossbar deviate its behavior from the ideal weighted summation operation. In large-scale implementations, the impact of parasitic resistances must be carefully considered and mitigated to ensure circuits\u2019 functionality. In this work, we implemented and simulated CNNs on resistive crossbar circuits with consideration of parasitic resistances. Moreover, we carried out a new mapping scheme for high utilization of crossbar arrays on convolution, and a mitigation algorithm to mitigate parasitic resistances in CNN applications. The mitigation algorithm considers parasitic resistances as well as data/kernel patterns of each layer to minimize the computing error in crossbar-based convolutions of CNNs. We demonstrated the proposed methods with implementations of a 4-layer CNN on MNIST, and residual neural network (ResNet) (20, 32, and 56) on CIFAR-10. Simulation results show the proposed methods well mitigate the parasitic resistances in crossbars. With our methods, modern CNNs on crossbars can preserve ideal (software) level classification accuracy with 6-bit ADCs and DACs implementation.","author":["Fan Zhang","Miao Hu"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 16","Issue 3","July 2020","Article No.: 25","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/3371277"],"date":"19 May 2020","ref":[{"text":"Gina C.

While low bandwidth off-chip memories in prior FPGA works have hindered the system-level performance, modern FPGAs offer high bandwidth memory (HBM2) that unlocks opportunities to improve the throughput/energy of FPGA-based CNN training. This paper presents a FPGA accelerator for CNN training which (1) uses HBM2 for efficient off-chip communication, and (2) supports various training operations (e.g. residual connections, stride-2 convolutions) for modern CNNs. We analyze the impact of HBM2 on CNN training workloads, provide a comprehensive comparison with DDR3, and present the strategies to efficiently use HBM2 features for enhanced CNN training performance. For training ResNet-20/VGG-like CNNs for CIFAR-10 dataset with low batch size of 2, the proposed CNN training accelerator on Intel Stratix-10 MX FPGA demonstrates 1.4/1.7X energy-efficiency improvement compared to Stratix-10 GX FPGA with DDR3 memory, and 4.5/9.7 X energy-efficiency improvement compared to Tesla V100 GPU.","author":["Shreyas K.

However, the bounding volume hierarchies that current ray tracing hardware relies on are known to struggle with long, thin primitives like cylinders and curves, because the axis-aligned bounding boxes that these hierarchies rely on cannot tightly bound such primitives. In this paper, we evaluate the use of RTX ray tracing capabilities to accelerate these primitives by tricking the GPU's instancing units into executing a hardware-accelerated oriented bounding box (OBB) rejection test before calling the user's intersection program. We show that this can be done with minimal changes to the intersection programs and demonstrate speedups of up to 5.9\u00d7 on a variety of data sets.","author":["Ingo Wald","Nate Morrical","Stefan Zellmann","Lei Ma","Will Usher","Tiejun Huang","Valerio Pascucci"],"issue":["Proceedings of the ACM on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques","Volume 3","Issue 2","August 2020","Article No.: 17","pp   1\u201316","https://doi.org/10.1145/3406179"],"date":"26 August 2020","ref":[{"text":"Giorgio A Ascoli, Duncan E Donohue, and Maryam Halavi. 2007.

Although hyper-sparse workloads have received considerable attention in the past, moderately-sparse workloads prevalent in machine learning applications, graph processing and HPC have not. Where the former can bypass the cache hierarchy, the latter fit in the cache. This article makes the observation that intelligent, near-processor cache management can improve bandwidth utilization for data-irregular accesses, thereby accelerating moderately-sparse workloads. We propose SortCache, a processor-centric approach to accelerating sparse workloads by introducing accelerators that leverage the on-chip cache subsystem, with minimal programmer intervention.","author":["Sriseshan Srikanth","Anirudh Jain","Thomas M.

Given a set I of identifiers, two methods are presented for building, in a mechanical way, perfect hashing functions, i.e. functions transforming the elements of I into unique addresses. The first method, the \u201cquotient reduction\u201d method, is shown to be complete in the sense that for every set I the smallest table in which the elements of I can be stored and from which they can be retrieved by using a perfect hashing function constructed by this method can be found. However, for nonuniformly distributed sets, this method can give rather sparse tables. The second method, the \u201cremainder reduction\u201d method, is not complete in the above sense, but it seems to give minimal (or almost minimal) tables for every kind of set. The two techniques are applicable directly to small sets. Some methods to extend these results to larger sets are also presented. A rough comparison with ordinary hashing is given which shows that this method can be used conveniently in several practical applications.","author":["Renzo Sprugnoli"],"issue":["Communications of the ACM","Volume 20","Issue 11","Nov. 1977","pp   841\u2013850","https://doi.org/10.1145/359863.359887"],"date":"01 November 1977","ref":[{"text":"Greniewski, M., and Turski, W.

It is based on a flow diagram and uses only the steady state average values of the variables. It is general enough to handle nonuniform access, shared locks, static locking, multiple transaction classes, and transactions of indeterminate length. The analysis is restricted to the case in which all conflicts are resolved by restarts. It has been shown elsewhere that, under certain conditions, this pure restart policy is as good as, if not better than, a policy that uses both blocking and restarts.The analysis is straightforward, and the computational complexity of the solution, given some nonrestrictive approximations, does not depend on the input parameters. The solution is also well defined and well behaved. The model's predictions agree well with simulation results.The model shows that data contention can cause the throughput to thrash, and gives a limit on the workload that will prevent this. It also shows that systems with a particular kind of nonuniform access and systems in which transactions share locks are equivalent to systems in which there is uniform access and only exclusive locking. Static locking has higher throughput, but longer response time, than dynamic locking. Replacing updates by queries in a multiprogramming mix may degrade performance if the queries are longer than the updates.","author":["Y. C.

An alternative method based on the preflow concept of Karzanov is introduced. A preflow is like a flow, except that the total amount flowing into a vertex is allowed to exceed the total amount flowing out. The method maintains a preflow in the original network and pushes local flow excess toward the sink along what are estimated to be shortest paths. The algorithm and its analysis are simple and intuitive, yet the algorithm runs as fast as any other known method on dense graphs, achieving an O(n3) time bound on an n-vertex graph. By incorporating the dynamic tree data structure of Sleator and Tarjan, we obtain a version of the algorithm running in O(nm log(n2/m)) time on an n-vertex, m-edge graph. This is as fast as any known method for any graph density and faster on graphs of moderate density. The algorithm also admits efficient distributed and parallel implementations. A parallel implementation running in O(n2log n) time using n processors and O(m) space is obtained. This time bound matches that of the Shiloach-Vishkin algorithm, which also uses n processors but requires O(n2) space.","author":["Andrew V. Goldberg","Robert E.

If the expected profit from a customer is greater than the cost of marketing to her, the marketing action for that customer is executed. So far, work in this area has considered only the intrinsic value of the customer (i.e, the expected profit from sales to her). We propose to model also the customer's network value: the expected profit from sales to other customers she may influence to buy, the customers those may influence, and so on recursively. Instead of viewing a market as a set of independent entities, we view it as a social network and model it as a Markov random field. We show the advantages of this approach using a social network mined from a collaborative filtering database. Marketing that exploits the network value of customers---also known as viral marketing---can be extremely effective, but is still a black art. Our work can be viewed as a step towards providing a more solid foundation for it, taking advantage of the availability of large relevant databases.","author":["Pedro Domingos","Matt Richardson"],"issue":["KDD '01: Proceedings of the seventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2001","Pages   57\u201366","https://doi.org/10.1145/502512.502525"],"date":"26 August 2001","ref":[{"text":"A.

Such a scheme leads to a compact representation of objects so that similarity of objects can be estimated from their compact sketches, and also leads to efficient algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor search and clustering. Min-wise independent permutations provide an elegant construction of such a locality sensitive hashing scheme for a collection of subsets with the set similarity measure sim(A,B) = \\frac{|A \u2229 B|}{|A \u222a B|}.(MATH) We show that rounding algorithms for LPs and SDPs used in the context of approximation algorithms can be viewed as locality sensitive hashing schemes for several interesting collections of objects.

Tiling can also be used to exploit data reuse at the register level and to improve a program's ILP. However, previous proposals in the literature (as well as commercial compilers) are only able to perform multidimensional tiling for the register level when the iteration space is rectangular. In this article we present a new general algorithm to perform multidimensional tiling for the register level in both rectangular and nonrectangular iteration spaces. We also propose a simple heuristic to determine the tiling parameters at this level. Finally, we evaluate our method using as benchmarks typical linear algebra algorithms having nonrectangular iteration spaces and compare our proposal against hand-optimized vendor-supplied numerical libraries and against commercial compilers able to perform optimizing code transformations such as inner unrolling, unroll-and-jam, and software pipelining. Measurements were taken on three different superscalar microprocessors. Results will show that our method outperforms the native compilers (showing speedups of 2.5 in average) and matches the performance of vendor-supplied numerical libraries. The general conclusion is that compiler technology can make it possible for nonrectangular loop nests to achieve as high performance as hand-optimized codes.","author":["Marta Jim\u00e9nez","Jos\u00e9 M.

Unfortunately, their design has been extremely error prone. Most of the protocols found in the literature contain redundancies or security flaws. A simple logic has allowed us to describe the beliefs of trustworthy parties involved in authentication protocols and the evolution of these beliefs as a consequence of communication. We have been able to explain a variety of authentication protocols formally, to discover subtleties and errors in them, and to suggest improvements. In this paper we present the logic and then give the results of our analysis of four published protocols, chosen either because of their practical importance or because they serve to illustrate our method.","author":["Michael Burrows","Martin Abadi","Roger Needham"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Computer Systems","Volume 8","Issue 1","Feb. 1990","pp   18\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/77648.77649"],"date":"01 February 1990","ref":[{"text":"BAUER, R.

It allows one to compute curves of equilibria, limit points, Hopf points, limit cycles, period doubling bifurcation points of limit cycles, and fold bifurcation points of limit cycles. All curves are computed by the same function that implements a prediction-correction continuation algorithm based on the Moore-Penrose matrix pseudo-inverse. The continuation of bifurcation points of equilibria and limit cycles is based on bordering methods and minimally extended systems. Hence no additional unknowns such as singular vectors and eigenvectors are used and no artificial sparsity in the systems is created. The sparsity of the discretized systems for the computation of limit cycles and their bifurcation points is exploited by using the standard Matlab sparse matrix methods. The MATLAB environment makes the standard MATLAB Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) Suite interactively available and provides computational and visualization tools; it also eliminates the compilation stage and so makes installation straightforward. Compared to other packages such as AUTO and CONTENT, adding a new type of curves is easy in the MATLAB environment. We illustrate this by a detailed description of the limit point curve type.","author":["A. Dhooge","W. Govaerts","Yu. A.

For large circuits, which most benefit from 3-D designs, efficient placement algorithms with low time complexity are required.We present an iterative 3-D placement algorithm that places circuit elements in three dimensions in linear time. Using an order of magnitude less time, our proposed algorithm produces placements with better than 11% less wire lengths than partitioning placement using the best and fastest partitioner. Due to the algorithms iterative nature, wire-length results can be further improved by increasing the number of iterations.Further, we provide empirical evidence that large circuits benefit most from 3-D technology and that even a small number of layers can provide significant wire-length improvements.","author":["Stefan Thomas Obenaus","Ted H.

Implementing low-latency cache coherence in these systems is difficult, because traditional approaches either add indirection for common cache-to-cache misses (directory protocols) or require a totally-ordered interconnect (traditional snooping protocols). Unfortunately, totally-ordered interconnects are difficult to implement in glueless designs. An ideal coherence protocol would avoid indirections and interconnect ordering; however, such an approach introduces numerous protocol races that are difficult to resolve.We propose a new coherence framework to enable such protocols by separating performance from correctness. A performance protocol can optimize for the common case (i.e., absence of races) and rely on the underlying correctness substrate to resolve races, provide safety, and prevent starvation. We call the combination Token Coherence, since it explicitly exchanges and counts tokens to control coherence permissions.This paper develops TokenB, a specific Token Coherence performance protocol that allows a glueless multiprocessor to both exploit a low-latency unordered interconnect (like directory protocols) and avoid indirection (like snooping protocols). Simulations using commercial workloads show that our new protocol can significantly outperform traditional snooping and directory protocols.","author":["Milo M. K. Martin","Mark D. Hill","David A.

Collaborative filtering, the most successful recommendation approach, makes recommendations based on past transactions and feedback from consumers sharing similar interests. A major problem limiting the usefulness of collaborative filtering is the sparsity problem, which refers to a situation in which transactional or feedback data is sparse and insufficient to identify similarities in consumer interests. In this article, we propose to deal with this sparsity problem by applying an associative retrieval framework and related spreading activation algorithms to explore transitive associations among consumers through their past transactions and feedback. Such transitive associations are a valuable source of information to help infer consumer interests and can be explored to deal with the sparsity problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we have conducted an experimental study using a data set from an online bookstore. We experimented with three spreading activation algorithms including a constrained Leaky Capacitor algorithm, a branch-and-bound serial symbolic search algorithm, and a Hopfield net parallel relaxation search algorithm. These algorithms were compared with several collaborative filtering approaches that do not consider the transitive associations: a simple graph search approach, two variations of the user-based approach, and an item-based approach. Our experimental results indicate that spreading activation-based approaches significantly outperformed the other collaborative filtering methods as measured by recommendation precision, recall, the F-measure, and the rank score. We also observed the over-activation effect of the spreading activation approach, that is, incorporating transitive associations with past transactional data that is not sparse may \"dilute\" the data used to infer user preferences and lead to degradation in recommendation performance.","author":["Zan Huang","Hsinchun Chen","Daniel Zeng"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 22","Issue 1","January 2004","pp   116\u2013142","https://doi.org/10.1145/963770.963775"],"date":"01 January 2004","ref":[{"text":"Aggarwal, C.

Various methods have been published for the determination of shadows in computer synthesized scenes. The display of shadows may make the shape and relative position of objects in such scenes more comprehensible; it is a technique lending vividness and realism to computer animation.To date, algorithms for the determination of shadows have been restricted to scenes constructed of planar polygons. A simple algorithm is described which utilizes Z-buffer visible surface computation to display shadows cast by objects modelled of smooth surface patches. The method can be applied to all environments, in fact, for which visible surfaces can be computed. The cost of determining the shadows associated with each light source is roughly twice the cost of rendering the scene without shadows, plus a fixed transformation overhead which depends on the image resolution. No extra entities are added to the scene description in the shadowing process. This comprehensive algorithm, which permits curved shadows to be cast on curved surfaces, is contrasted with a less costly method for casting the shadows of the environment on a single ground plane.In order to attain good results, the discrete nature of the visible-surface computations must be treated with care. The effects of dither, interpolation, and geometric quantization at different stages of the shadowing algorithm are examined. The special problems posed by self-shadowing surfaces are described.","author":["Lance Williams"],"issue":["ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics","Volume 12","Issue 3","August 1978","pp   270\u2013274","https://doi.org/10.1145/965139.807402"],"date":"23 August 1978","ref":[{"text":"Catmull, E., \"A Subdivision Algorithm for Computer Display of Curved Surfaces,\" PhD. thesis, Dept. of Computer Science, University of Utah, 1974.","doi":"10.5555/907242","order":1},{"text":"Newell, M.

Graphs are a natural \"lowest common denominator\" representation which can combine relational, XML and HTML data. Responses to keyword queries are usually modeled as trees that connect nodes matching the keywords.In this paper we address the problem of keyword search on graphs that may be significantly larger than memory. We propose a graph representation technique that combines a condensed version of the graph (the \"supernode graph\") which is always memory resident, along with whatever parts of the detailed graph are in a cache, to form a multi-granular graph representation. We propose two alternative approaches which extend existing search algorithms to exploit multigranular graphs; both approaches attempt to minimize IO by directing search towards areas of the graph that are likely to give good results. We compare our algorithms with a virtual memory approach on several real data sets. Our experimental results show significant benefits in terms of reduction in IO due to our algorithms.","author":["Bhavana Bharat Dalvi","Meghana Kshirsagar","S.

Abadi, A. Marcus, S. R. Madden, and K. Hollenbach [1]. We revisit the proposed benchmark and examine both the data and query space coverage. The benchmark is extended to cover a larger portion of the query space in a canonical way. Repeatability of the experiments is assessed using the code base obtained from the authors. Inspired by the proposed vertically-partitioned storage solution for RDF data and the performance figures using a column-store, we conduct a complementary analysis of state-of-the-art RDF storage solutions. To this end, we employ MonetDB/SQL, a fully-functional open source column-store, and a well-known -- for its performance -- commercial row-store DBMS. We implement two relational RDF storage solutions -- triple-store and vertically-partitioned -- in both systems. This allows us to expand the scope of [1] with the performance characterization along both dimensions -- triple-store vs. vertically-partitioned and row-store vs. column-store -- individually, before analyzing their combined effects. A detailed report of the experimental test-bed, as well as an in-depth analysis of the parameters involved, clarify the scope of the solution originally presented and position the results in a broader context by covering more systems.","author":["Lefteris Sidirourgos","Romulo Goncalves","Martin Kersten","Niels Nes","Stefan Manegold"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 1","Issue 2","August 2008","pp   1553\u20131563","https://doi.org/10.14778/1454159.1454227"],"date":"01 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"D.

Unlike parallel DBMSs, MapReduce allows non-expert users to run complex analytical tasks over very large data sets on very large clusters and clouds. However, this comes at a price: MapReduce processes tasks in a scan-oriented fashion. Hence, the performance of Hadoop --- an open-source implementation of MapReduce --- often does not match the one of a well-configured parallel DBMS. In this paper we propose a new type of system named Hadoop++: it boosts task performance without changing the Hadoop framework at all (Hadoop does not even 'notice it'). To reach this goal, rather than changing a working system (Hadoop), we inject our technology at the right places through UDFs only and affect Hadoop from inside. This has three important consequences: First, Hadoop++ significantly outperforms Hadoop. Second, any future changes of Hadoop may directly be used with Hadoop++ without rewriting any glue code. Third, Hadoop++ does not need to change the Hadoop interface. Our experiments show the superiority of Hadoop++ over both Hadoop and HadoopDB for tasks related to indexing and join processing.","author":["Jens Dittrich","Jorge-Arnulfo Quian\u00e9-Ruiz","Alekh Jindal","Yagiz Kargin","Vinay Setty","J\u00f6rg Schad"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   515\u2013529","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920908"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"Dbcolumn on MapReduce, http://databasecolumn.vertica.com/2008/01/mapreduce-a-major-step-back.html.","order":1},{"text":"HDFS Bug, http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-96.","order":2},{"text":"A.

Similar to the problem of similarity search in standard graphs, a fundamental problem for probabilistic graphs is to efficiently answer k-nearest neighbor queries (k-NN), which is the problem of computing the k closest nodes to some specific node.In this paper we introduce a framework for processing k-NN queries in probabilistic graphs. We propose novel distance functions that extend well-known graph concepts, such as shortest paths. In order to compute them in probabilistic graphs, we design algorithms based on sampling. During k-NN query processing we efficiently prune the search space using novel techniques.Our experiments indicate that our distance functions outperform previously used alternatives in identifying true neighbors in real-world biological data. We also demonstrate that our algorithms scale for graphs with tens of millions of edges.","author":["Michalis Potamias","Francesco Bonchi","Aristides Gionis","George Kollios"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   997\u20131008","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920967"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"E.

The emergence of standardized support for location providers in web browsers, as well as of providers of accurate locations, enables so-called hyper-local web querying where the location of a user is accurate at a much finer granularity than with IP-based positioning.This paper addresses the problem of determining the importance of points of interest, or places, in local-search results. In doing so, the paper proposes techniques that exploit logged directions queries. A query that asks for directions from a location a to a location b is taken to suggest that a user is interested in traveling to b and thus is a vote that location b is interesting. Such user-generated directions queries are particularly interesting because they are numerous and contain precise locations.Specifically, the paper proposes a framework that takes a user location and a collection of near-by places as arguments, producing a ranking of the places. The framework enables a range of aspects of directions queries to be exploited for the ranking of places, including the frequency with which places have been referred to in directions queries. Next, the paper proposes an algorithm and accompanying data structures capable of ranking places in response to hyper-local web queries. Finally, an empirical study with very large directions query logs offers insight into the potential of directions queries for the ranking of places and suggests that the proposed algorithm is suitable for use in real web search engines.","author":["Petros Venetis","Hector Gonzalez","Christian S.

Many of the problems they encounter can be overcome by applying techniques learned from over three decades of research on parallel DBMSs. However, translating these techniques to a Map-Reduce implementation such as Hadoop presents unique challenges that can lead to new design choices. This paper describes how column-oriented storage techniques can be incorporated in Hadoop in a way that preserves its popular programming APIs.We show that simply using binary storage formats in Hadoop can provide a 3x performance boost over the naive use of text files. We then introduce a column-oriented storage format that is compatible with the replication and scheduling constraints of Hadoop and show that it can speed up MapReduce jobs on real workloads by an order of magnitude. We also show that dealing with complex column types such as arrays, maps, and nested records, which are common in MapReduce jobs, can incur significant CPU overhead. Finally, we introduce a novel skip list column format and lazy record construction strategy that avoids deserializing unwanted records to provide an additional 1.5x performance boost. Experiments on a real intranet crawl are used to show that our column-oriented storage techniques can improve the performance of the map phase in Hadoop by as much as two orders of magnitude.","author":["Avrilia Floratou","Jignesh M.

Algorithmic approaches have been improving in quality, but remain far from perfect. Crowdsourcing platforms offer a more accurate but expensive (and slow) way to bring human insight into the process. Previous work has proposed batching verification tasks for presentation to human workers but even with batching, a human-only approach is infeasible for data sets of even moderate size, due to the large numbers of matches to be tested. Instead, we propose a hybrid human-machine approach in which machines are used to do an initial, coarse pass over all the data, and people are used to verify only the most likely matching pairs. We show that for such a hybrid system, generating the minimum number of verification tasks of a given size is NP-Hard, but we develop a novel two-tiered heuristic approach for creating batched tasks. We describe this method, and present the results of extensive experiments on real data sets using a popular crowdsourcing platform. The experiments show that our hybrid approach achieves both good efficiency and high accuracy compared to machine-only or human-only alternatives.","author":["Jiannan Wang","Tim Kraska","Michael J.

It provides an evolving suite of SQL-based algorithms for machine learning, data mining and statistics that run at scale within a database engine, with no need for data import/export to other tools. The goal is for MADlib to eventually serve a role for scalable database systems that is similar to the CRAN library for R: a community repository of statistical methods, this time written with scale and parallelism in mind.In this paper we introduce the MADlib project, including the background that led to its beginnings, and the motivation for its open-source nature. We provide an overview of the library's architecture and design patterns, and provide a description of various statistical methods in that context. We include performance and speedup results of a core design pattern from one of those methods over the Greenplum parallel DBMS on a modest-sized test cluster. We then report on two initial efforts at incorporating academic research into MADlib, which is one of the project's goals.MADlib is freely available at http://madlib.net, and the project is open for contributions of both new methods, and ports to additional database platforms.","author":["Joseph M.

MONOMI works by encrypting the entire database and running queries over the encrypted data. MONOMI introduces split client/server query execution, which can execute arbitrarily complex queries over encrypted data, as well as several techniques that improve performance for such workloads, including per-row precomputation, space-efficient encryption, grouped homomorphic addition, and pre-filtering. Since these optimizations are good for some queries but not others, MONOMI introduces a designer for choosing an efficient physical design at the server for a given workload, and a planner to choose an efficient execution plan for a given query at runtime. A prototype of MONOMI running on top of Postgres can execute most of the queries from the TPC-H benchmark with a median overhead of only 1.24\u00d7 (ranging from 1.03\u00d7to 2.33\u00d7) compared to an un-encrypted Postgres database where a compromised server would reveal all data.","author":["Stephen Tu","M.

However, the relatively low bandwidth and high latency of the PCI-e bus are usually bottleneck issues for co-processing. Recently, coupled CPU-GPU architectures have received a lot of attention, e.g. AMD APUs with the CPU and the GPU integrated into a single chip. That opens up new opportunities for optimizing query co-processing. In this paper, we experimentally revisit hash joins, one of the most important join algorithms for main memory databases, on a coupled CPU-GPU architecture. Particularly, we study the fine-grained co-processing mechanisms on hash joins with and without partitioning. The co-processing outlines an interesting design space. We extend existing cost models to automatically guide decisions on the design space. Our experimental results on a recent AMD APU show that (1) the coupled architecture enables fine-grained co-processing and cache reuses, which are inefficient on discrete CPU-GPU architectures; (2) the cost model can automatically guide the design and tuning knobs in the design space; (3) fine-grained co-processing achieves up to 53%, 35% and 28% performance improvement over CPU-only, GPU-only and conventional CPU-GPU co-processing, respectively. We believe that the insights and implications from this study are initial yet important for further research on query co-processing on coupled CPU-GPU architectures.","author":["Jiong He","Mian Lu","Bingsheng He"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 10","August 2013","pp   889\u2013900","https://doi.org/10.14778/2536206.2536216"],"date":"01 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, increasing the number of compute nodes increases the chance of node failures. Therefore, provisioning an efficient failure recovery strategy is critical for distributed graph processing systems. This paper proposes a novel recovery mechanism for distributed graph processing systems that parallelizes the recovery process. The key idea is to partition the part of the graph that is lost during a failure among a subset of the remaining nodes. To do so, we augment the existing checkpoint-based and log-based recovery schemes with a partitioning mechanism that is sensitive to the total computation and communication cost of the recovery process. Our implementation on top of the widely used Giraph system outperforms checkpoint-based recovery by up to 30x on a cluster of 40 compute nodes.","author":["Yanyan Shen","Gang Chen","H. V.

This problem has recently drawn intense research interest. Various goodness metrics have been proposed. However, most existing metrics tend to include irrelevant subgraphs in the detected local community. We refer to such irrelevant subgraphs as free riders. We systematically study the existing goodness metrics and provide theoretical explanations on why they may cause the free rider effect. We further develop a query biased node weighting scheme to reduce the free rider effect. In particular, each node is weighted by its proximity to the query node. We define a query biased density metric to integrate the edge and node weights. The query biased densest subgraph, which has the largest query biased density, will shift to the neighborhood of the query nodes after node weighting. We then formulate the query biased densest connected subgraph (QDC) problem, study its complexity, and provide efficient algorithms to solve it. We perform extensive experiments on a variety of real and synthetic networks to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.","author":["Yubao Wu","Ruoming Jin","Jing Li","Xiang Zhang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 7","February 2015","pp   798\u2013809","https://doi.org/10.14778/2752939.2752948"],"date":"01 February 2015","ref":[{"text":"http://filer.case.edu/yxw407.","order":1},{"text":"R.

In-memory key-value stores have several unique properties that include (1) data intensive operations demanding high memory bandwidth for fast data accesses, (2) high data parallelism and simple computing operations demanding many slim parallel computing units, and (3) a large working set. As data volume continues to increase, our experiments show that conventional and general-purpose multicore systems are increasingly mismatched to the special properties of key-value stores because they do not provide massive data parallelism and high memory bandwidth; the powerful but the limited number of computing cores do not satisfy the demand of the unique data processing task; and the cache hierarchy may not well benefit to the large working set.In this paper, we make a strong case for GPUs to serve as special-purpose devices to greatly accelerate the operations of in-memory key-value stores. Specifically, we present the design and implementation of Mega-KV, a GPU-based in-memory key-value store system that achieves high performance and high throughput. Effectively utilizing the high memory bandwidth and latency hiding capability of GPUs, Mega-KV provides fast data accesses and significantly boosts overall performance. Running on a commodity PC installed with two CPUs and two GPUs, Mega-KV can process up to 160+ million key-value operations per second, which is 1.4-2.8 times as fast as the state-of-the-art key-value store system on a conventional CPU-based platform.","author":["Kai Zhang","Kaibo Wang","Yuan Yuan","Lei Guo","Rubao Lee","Xiaodong Zhang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 11","July 2015","pp   1226\u20131237","https://doi.org/10.14778/2809974.2809984"],"date":"01 July 2015","ref":[{"text":"Intel dpdk. \"http://dpdk.org/\".","order":1},{"text":"Memcached. \"http://memcached.org/\".","order":2},{"text":"Redis. \"http://redis.io/\".","order":3},{"text":"S.

With the advent of big data, there is an increasing demand for efficient join algorithms that can scale with the input data size and the available hardware resources.In this paper, we explore the implementation of distributed join algorithms in systems with several thousand cores connected by a low-latency network as used in high performance computing systems or data centers. We compare radix hash join to sort-merge join algorithms and discuss their implementation at this scale. In the paper, we explain how to use MPI to implement joins, show the impact and advantages of RDMA, discuss the importance of network scheduling, and study the relative performance of sorting vs. hashing.

HoloClean unifies qualitative data repairing, which relies on integrity constraints or external data sources, with quantitative data repairing methods, which leverage statistical properties of the input data. Given an inconsistent dataset as input, HoloClean automatically generates a probabilistic program that performs data repairing. Inspired by recent theoretical advances in probabilistic inference, we introduce a series of optimizations which ensure that inference over HoloClean's probabilistic model scales to instances with millions of tuples. We show that HoloClean finds data repairs with an average precision of \u223c 90% and an average recall of above \u223c 76% across a diverse array of datasets exhibiting different types of errors. This yields an average F1 improvement of more than 2\u00d7 against state-of-the-art methods.","author":["Theodoros Rekatsinas","Xu Chu","Ihab F.

In this work, we propose the concept of compression-based direct processing to alleviate issues in both dimensions. The main idea is to enable direct document analytics on compressed data. We present how the concept can be materialized on Sequitur, a compression algorithm that produces hierarchical grammar-like representations. We discuss the major challenges in applying the idea to various document analytics tasks, and reveal a set of guidelines and also assistant software modules for developers to effectively apply compression-based direct processing. Experiments show that our proposed techniques save 90.8% storage space and 77.5% memory usage, while speeding up data processing significantly, i.e., by 1.6X on sequential systems, and 2.2X on distributed clusters, on average.","author":["Feng Zhang","Jidong Zhai","Xipeng Shen","Onur Mutlu","Wenguang Chen"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 11","July 2018","pp   1522\u20131535","https://doi.org/10.14778/3236187.3236203"],"date":"01 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"C++ B-tree. https://code.google.com/archive/p/cpp-btree/, 2017.","order":1},{"text":"Wikipedia HTML data dumps. https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/, 2017.","order":2},{"text":"R.

The recommendation is to apply strong, semantically secure encryption to the \"sensitive\" columns and protect other columns with property-revealing encryption (PRE) that supports operations such as sorting.We design, implement, and evaluate a new methodology for inferring data stored in such encrypted databases. The cornerstone is the multinomial attack, a new inference technique that is analytically optimal and empirically outperforms prior heuristic attacks against PRE-encrypted data. We also extend the multinomial attack to take advantage of correlations across multiple columns. This recovers PRE-encrypted data with sufficient accuracy to then apply machine learning and record linkage methods to infer columns protected by semantically secure encryption or redaction.We evaluate our methodology on medical, census, and union-membership datasets, showing for the first time how to infer full database records. For PRE-encrypted attributes such as demographics and ZIP codes, our attack outperforms the best prior heuristic by a factor of 16. Unlike any prior technique, we also infer attributes, such as incomes and medical diagnoses, protected by strong encryption. For example, when we infer that a patient in a hospital-discharge dataset has a mental health or substance abuse condition, this prediction is 97% accurate.","author":["Vincent Bindschaedler","Paul Grubbs","David Cash","Thomas Ristenpart","Vitaly Shmatikov"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 11","July 2018","pp   1715\u20131728","https://doi.org/10.14778/3236187.3236217"],"date":"01 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Nabil R.

They do not cope well with the multitude of storage devices that are competitive at their price `sweet spots'. To make use of different storage device classes, users have to resort to workarounds, such as storing data in different tablespaces. A lot of research has been done on heterogeneous storage frameworks for distributed big data query engines. These engines scale well for big data sets but are often CPU- or network-bound. Both approaches only maximize performance for previously purchased storage devices.We present Mosaic, a storage engine for scan-heavy workloads on RDBMS that manages devices in a tierless pool and provides device purchase recommendations for a specified workload and budget. In contrast to existing systems, Mosaic generates a performance/budget curve that is Pareto-optimal, along which the user can choose. Our approach uses device models and linear optimization to find a data placement solution that maximizes I/O throughput for the workload. Our evaluation shows that Mosaic provides a higher throughput at the same budget or a similar throughput at a lower budget than the state-of-the-art approaches of big data query engines and RDBMS.","author":["Lukas Vogel","Viktor Leis","Alexander van Renen","Thomas Neumann","Satoshi Imamura","Alfons Kemper"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 13","Issue 12","August 2020","pp   2662\u20132675","https://doi.org/10.14778/3407790.3407852"],"date":"01 July 2020","ref":[{"text":"https://facebook.github.io/zstd/, 2020.

Text expresses a vast, rich range of information, but encodes this information in a form that is difficult to decipher automatically. Perhaps for this reason, there has been little work in text data mining to date, and most people who have talked about it have either conflated it with information access or have not made use of text directly to discover heretofore unknown information. In this paper I will first define data mining, information access, and corpus-based computational linguistics, and then discuss the relationship of these to text data mining. The intent behind these contrasts is to draw attention to exciting new kinds of problems for computational linguists. I describe examples of what I consider to be real text data mining efforts and briefly outline recent ideas about how to pursue exploratory data analysis over text.","author":["Marti A.

After using both the monolingual and bilingual classifiers for a few months, we have convinced ourselves that the performance is remarkably good. Nevertheless, we would really like to be able to make a stronger statement, and therefore, we decided to try to develop some more objective evaluation measures. Although there has been a fair amount of literature on sense-disambiguation, the literature does not offer much guidance in how we might establish the success or failure of a proposed solution such as the two systems mentioned in the previous paragraph. Many papers avoid quantitative evaluations altogether, because it is so difficult to come up with credible estimates of performance.This paper will attempt to establish upper and lower bounds on the level of performance that can be expected in an evaluation. An estimate of the lower bound of 75% (averaged over ambiguous types) is obtained by measuring the performance produced by a baseline system that ignores context and simply assigns the most likely sense in all cases. An estimate of the upper bound is obtained by assuming that our ability to measure performance is largely limited by our ability obtain reliable judgments from human informants. Not surprisingly, the upper bound is very dependent on the instructions given to the judges. Jorgensen, for example, suspected that lexicographers tend to depend too much on judgments by a single informant and found considerable variation over judgments (only 68% agreement), as she had suspected. In our own experiments, we have set out to find word-sense disambiguation tasks where the judges can agree often enough so that we could show that they were outperforming the baseline system. Under quite different conditions, we have found 96.8% agreement over judges.","author":["William Gale","Kenneth Ward Church","David Yarowsky"],"issue":["ACL '92: Proceedings of the 30th annual meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics","June 1992","Pages   249\u2013256","https://doi.org/10.3115/981967.981999"],"date":"28 June 1992","ref":[{"text":"Bar-Hillel (1960), \"Automatic Translation of Languages,\" in Advances in Computers, Donald Booth and R.

Denali's goal is to allow new Internet services to be \"pushed\" into third party infrastructure, relieving Internet service authors from the burden of acquiring and maintaining physical infrastructure. Our isolation kernel exposes a virtual machine abstraction, but unlike conventional virtual machine monitors, Denali does not attempt to emulate the underlying physical architecture precisely, and instead modifies the virtual architecture to gain scale, performance, and simplicity of implementation. In this paper, we first discuss design principles of isolation kernels, and then we describe the design and implementation of Denali. Following this, we present a detailed evaluation of Denali, demonstrating that the overhead of virtualization is small, that our architectural choices are warranted, and that we can successfully scale to more than 10,000 virtual machines on commodity hardware.","author":["Andrew Whitaker","Marianne Shaw","Steven D.

This work investigated how people respond to a sociable robot based on its performance at different locations. We performed an experiment in which the robot's ability to understand social signals was artificially attenuated by distance. Participants (N = 180) instructed the robot using speech and pointing gestures, provided proxemic preferences before and after the interaction, and responded to a questionnaire. Our analysis of questionnaire responses revealed that robot performance factors---rather than human-robot proxemics---are significant predictors of user evaluations of robot competence, anthropomorphism, engagement, likability, and technology adoption. Our behavioral analysis suggests that human proxemic preferences change over time as users interact with and come to understand the needs of the robot, and those changes improve robot performance.","author":["Ross Mead","Maja J.
