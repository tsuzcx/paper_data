[{"_id":"10.1145/1014052.1014118","title":"Kernel k-means: spectral clustering and normalized cuts","abstract":"Kernel k-means and spectral clustering have both been used to identify clusters that are non-linearly separable in input space. Despite significant research, these methods have remained only loosely related. In this paper, we give an explicit theoretical connection between them. We show the generality of the weighted kernel k-means objective function, and derive the spectral clustering objective of normalized cut as a special case. Given a positive definite similarity matrix, our results lead to a novel weighted kernel k-means algorithm that monotonically decreases the normalized cut. This has important implications: a) eigenvector-based algorithms, which can be computationally prohibitive, are not essential for minimizing normalized cuts, b) various techniques, such as local search and acceleration schemes, may be used to improve the quality as well as speed of kernel k-means. Finally, we present results on several interesting data sets, including diametrical clustering of large gene-expression matrices and a handwriting recognition data set.","author":["Inderjit S.

It provides several Data Distribution Management (DDM) services to reduce the transmission and reception of irrelevant data. These services rely on the computation of the intersection between \"update\" and \"subscription\" regions. Currently, there are several main DDM filtering algorithms. Since each approach still has some shortcomings, we have focused our research on the design and the evaluation of intersection algorithms for the DDM. In this article, we introduce a new algorithm in which extents are sorted before computing the intersections. Our experiments show that usually the sort-based algorithm has the best performance among all approaches. The improvement of its performance ranges between 30% and 99% over the brute force and hybrid approaches.","author":["C. Raczy","G. Tan","J.

In contrast to the compile-once-run-anywhere concept of virtual machines, reconfigurable applications lack portability and transparent SW/HW interfacing: applicability of accelerated hardware solutions is often limited to a single platform. In this work, we apply a virtualisation layer that provides portable and seamless integration of hardware and software components to a Java Virtual Machine platform, making it capable of accelerating any Java bytecode method by using platform-independent hardware accelerators. The virtualisation layer not only improves portability of accelerated Java bytecode applications, but also supports runtime optimisations and enables unrestricted automated synthesis of arbitrary Java bytecode to hardware. To show the advantages and measure the limited overheads of our approach, we run several accelerated applications (handwritten and synthesised) on a real embedded platform. We also show our synthesis flow and discuss its advanced features fostered by the virtualisation layer.","author":["Miljan Vuleti\u0106","Christophe Dubach","Laura Pozzi","Paolo Ienne"],"issue":["CODES+ISSS '05: Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE/ACM/IFIP international conference on Hardware/software codesign and system synthesis","September 2005","Pages   243\u2013248","https://doi.org/10.1145/1084834.1084896"],"date":"19 September 2005","ref":[{"text":"T.

In many cases, general (non-local and non-sequential) constraints may exist over the output sequence, but cannot be incorporated and exploited in a natural way by this inference procedure. This paper proposes a novel inference procedure based on integer linear programming (ILP) and extends CRF models to naturally and efficiently support general constraint structures. For sequential constraints, this procedure reduces to simple linear programming as the inference process.

The matrices representing quantum gates, and vectors modeling qubit states grow exponentially with an increase in the number of qubits. However, by using a new data structure called the Quantum Information Decision Diagram (QuIDD) that exploits the structure of quantum operators, many of these matrices and vectors can be represented in a form that grows polynomially. Using QuIDDs, we implemented a general-purpose quantum computing simulator in C++ called QuIDDPro and tested it on Grover's algorithm. Our QuIDD technique asymptotically outperforms other known simulation techniques.","author":["George F. Viamontes","Manoj Rajagopalan","Igor L. Markov","John P.

Early use of these techniques can also increase the sense of belonging for students and can lead to the early development of collaborative skills to prepare students for team experiences in subsequent courses and future careers. During the weekly lab sessions of a second semester introduction to programming course students engaged in collaborative learning experiences through team-based problem solving, project planning, pair programming, and other agile software development practices. Course objectives provided specific goals and criteria for assessment relative to these skills. The assessment in the authors' prior work identified several problem areas which led to specific initiatives to address those problems: (a) instructor-chosen teams, (b) early instruction and reflection on team skills, (c) feedback on team performance, and (d) the use of an IDE that incorporates an automated test-driven development tool. This paper describes the implementation and assessment of these efforts. A significant increase in student team skills from the middle of the semester to the end of the semester was observed.","author":["Dawn McKinney","Leo F.

Particularly, voltage has the largest influence on gate oxide reliability. An important trend designers should be aware of is the planned shift to new gate oxide failure criteria, which will tolerate progressive soft breakdowns in the gate oxide introducing additional gate leakage and noise. With increasing electric oxide fields negative bias instability of pFET devices became a severe problem, which cannot be solved by technology alone but requires also design solutions. Thus, simulation of MOSFETs being degraded by hot carrier stress and negative bias temperature stress becomes mandatory, as well as the control of device properties of circuit elements in a design. Design-in reliability in the metallization levels mainly is related to via placing and therefore, design tools should be able to trade off between increase in size, e.g. due to redundant vias, and benefit in reliability. Analysis of metal lines with maximum potential difference and minimal spacing also becomes mandatory in order to calculate the risk of time-dependent dielectric breakdown in the inter-metal dielectric, particularly for low-k dielectrics. From ESD point of view the following demands exist for future EDA solutions: 1) verification of net oriented ESD rules, 2) IR-drop analysis on layout to check ESD metallization rules, and 3) automatic placement of ESD or I/O cells depending on some formalized ESD guide lines that codify the ESD protection concept.","author":["T.

But \"bounded\" and \"best-effort\" hardware TM proposals impose unreasonable constraints on programmers, while more flexible software TM implementations are considered too slow. Proposals for supporting \"unbounded\" transactions in hardware entail significantly higher complexity and risk than best-effort designs.We introduce Hybrid Transactional Memory (HyTM), an approach to implementing TMin software so that it can use best effort hardware TM (HTM) to boost performance but does not depend on HTM. Thus programmers can develop and test transactional programs in existing systems today, and can enjoy the performance benefits of HTM support when it becomes available.We describe our prototype HyTM system, comprising a compiler and a library. The compiler allows a transaction to be attempted using best-effort HTM, and retried using the software library if it fails. We have used our prototype to \"transactify\" part of the Berkeley DB system, as well as several benchmarks. By disabling the optional use of HTM, we can run all of these tests on existing systems. Furthermore, by using a simulated multiprocessor with HTM support, we demonstrate the viability of the HyTM approach: it can provide performance and scalability approaching that of an unbounded HTM implementation, without the need to support all transactions with complicated HTM support.","author":["Peter Damron","Alexandra Fedorova","Yossi Lev","Victor Luchangco","Mark Moir","Daniel Nussbaum"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 41","Issue 11","November 2006","pp   336\u2013346","https://doi.org/10.1145/1168918.1168900"],"date":"20 October 2006","ref":[{"text":"A.-R.

The design assumes that all servers eventually fail and attempts to maintain data despite those failures. Antiquity uses a secure log to maintain data integrity, replicates each log on multiple servers for durability, and uses dynamic Byzantine fault-tolerant quorum protocols to ensure consistency among replicas. We present Antiquity's design and an experimental evaluation with global and local testbeds. Antiquity has been running for over two months on 400+ PlanetLab servers storing nearly 20,000 logs totaling more than 84 GB of data.

However, current state-of-the-art packet-switched networks rely on complex routers which increases the communication overhead and energy consumption as compared to the ideal interconnection fabric.In this paper, we try to close the gap between the state-of-the-art packet-switched network and the ideal interconnect by proposing express virtual channels (EVCs), a novel flow control mechanism which allows packets to virtually bypass intermediate routers along their path in a completely non-speculative fashion, thereby lowering the energy/delay towards that of a dedicated wire while simultaneously approaching ideal throughput with a practical design suitable for on-chip networks.Our evaluation results using a detailed cycle-accurate simulator on a range of synthetic traffic and SPLASH benchmark traces show upto 84% reduction in packet latency and upto 23% improvement in throughput while reducing the average router energy consumption by upto 38% over an existing state-of-the-art packet-switched design. When compared to the ideal interconnect, EVCs add just two cycles to the no-load latency, and are within 14% of the ideal throughput. Moreover, we show that the proposed design incurs a minimal hardware overhead while exhibiting excellent scalability with increasing network sizes.","author":["Amit Kumar","Li-Shiuan Peh","Partha Kundu","Niraj K.

One solution to this problem could be clustering similar items in the feed reader to make the information more manageable for a user. Clustering items at the feed reader end is a challenging task as usually only a small part of the actual article is received through the feed. In this paper, we propose a method of improving the accuracy of clustering short texts by enriching their representation with additional features from Wikipedia. Empirical results indicate that this enriched representation of text items can substantially improve the clustering accuracy when compared to the conventional bag of words representation.","author":["Somnath Banerjee","Krishnan Ramanathan","Ajay Gupta"],"issue":["SIGIR '07: Proceedings of the 30th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval","July 2007","Pages   787\u2013788","https://doi.org/10.1145/1277741.1277909"],"date":"23 July 2007","ref":[{"text":"E.

From assertions, one can generate hardware assertion checkers for use in emulation, simulation acceleration and silicon debug. We present techniques for checker generation of the complete set of PSL properties, including all variants of operators, both strong and weak. A full automata-based approach allows an entire assertion to be represented by a single automaton, hence allowing optimizations that can not be done in a modular approach where subcircuits are created only for individual operators. For this purpose, automata algorithms are developed for the base cases, and a complete set of rewrite rules is derived for other operators. Automata splitting is introduced for an efficient implementation of the eventually! operator.","author":["Marc Boul\u00e9","Zeljko Zilic"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 13","Issue 1","January 2008","Article No.: 4","pp   1\u201321","https://doi.org/10.1145/1297666.1297670"],"date":"06 February 2008","ref":[{"text":"Abarbanel, Y., Beer, I., Glushovsky, L., Keidar, S., and Wolfsthal, Y. 2000.

We present a comprehensive simulation study that compares the performance of these storage types and of different usage forms. The following usage forms are considered: allocation of entire log and database files in non-volatile semiconductor memory, using a so-called write buffer to perform disk writes asynchronously, and caching of database pages at intermediate storage levels (in addition to main memory caching).

However, the limited battery-lifetime of these devices restricts their portability and applicability, and this weakness can be exacerbated by mobile malware targeting depletion of battery energy. Such malware are usually difficult to detect and prevent, and frequent outbreaks of new malware variants also reduce the effectiveness of commonly-seen signature-based detection. To alleviate these problems, we propose a power-aware malware-detection framework that monitors, detects, and analyzes previously unknown energy-depletion threats. The framework is composed of (1) a power monitor which collects power samples and builds a power consumption history from the collected samples, and (2) a data analyzer which generates a power signature from the constructed history. To generate a power signature, simple and effective noise-filtering and data-compression are applied, thus reducing the detection overhead. Similarities between power signatures are measured by the \u03c72-distance, reducing both false-positive and false-negative detection rates. According to our experimental results on an HP iPAQ running a Windows Mobile OS, the proposed framework achieves significant (up to 95%) storage-savings without losing the detection accuracy, and a 99% true-positive rate in classifying mobile malware.","author":["Hahnsang Kim","Joshua Smith","Kang G.

Many approaches have been used to track memory trace, such as simulation, binary instrumentation and hardware snooping. However, they usually have limitations of time, accuracy and capacity.In this paper we propose a platform independent memory trace monitoring system, which is able to track virtual memory reference trace of full systems (including OS, VMMs, libraries, and applications). The system adopts a DIMM-snooping mechanism that uses hardware boards plugged in DIMM slots to snoop. There are several advantages in this approach, such as fast, complete, undistorted, and portable. Three key techniques are proposed to address the system design challenges with this mechanism: (1) To keep up with memory speeds, the DDR protocol state machine is simplified, and large FIFOs are added between the state machine and the trace transmitting logic to handle burst memory accesses; (2) To reconstruct physical-tovirtual mapping and distinguish one process' address space from others, an OS kernel module, which collects page table information, and a synchronization mechanism, which synchronizes the page table information with the memory race, are developed; (3) To dump massive trace data, we employ a straightforward method to compress the trace and use Gigabit Ethernet and RAID to send and receive the compressed trace.We present our implementation of an initial monitoring system, named HMTT (Hyper Memory Trace Tracker). Using HMTT, we have observed that burst bandwidth utilization is much larger than average bandwidth utilization, by up to 5X in desktop applications. We have also confirmed that the stream memory accesses of many applications contribute even more than 40% of L2 Cache misses and OS virtual memory management may decrease stream accesses in view of memory controller (or L2 Cache), by up to 30.2%. Moreover, we have evaluated OS impact on memory performance in real systems. The evaluations and case studies show the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed monitoring mechanism and techniques.","author":["Yungang Bao","Mingyu Chen","Yuan Ruan","Li Liu","Jianping Fan","Qingbo Yuan","Bo Song","Jianwei Xu"],"issue":["ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review","Volume 36","Issue 1","June 2008","pp   229\u2013240","https://doi.org/10.1145/1384529.1375484"],"date":"02 June 2008","ref":[{"text":"DyninstAPI. http://www.dyninst.org/.","order":1},{"text":"Intel Corp.

Integrating MRAM with CMOS logic may incur extra manufacture cost, due to its hybrid magnetic-CMOS fabrication process. Stacking MRAM on top of CMOS logics using 3D integration is a way to minimize this cost overhead. In this paper, we discuss the circuit design issues for MRAM, and present the MRAM cache model. Based on the model, we compare MRAM against SRAM and DRAM in terms of area, performance, and energy. Finally we conduct architectural evaluation for 3D microprocessor stacking with MRAM. The experimental results show that MRAM stacking offers competitive IPC performance with a large reduction in power consumption compared to SRAM and DRAM counterparts.","author":["Xiangyu Dong","Xiaoxia Wu","Guangyu Sun","Yuan Xie","Helen Li","Yiran Chen"],"issue":["DAC '08: Proceedings of the 45th annual Design Automation Conference","June 2008","Pages   554\u2013559","https://doi.org/10.1145/1391469.1391610"],"date":"08 June 2008","ref":[{"text":"Y.

They are often confronted by two major problems: data sparseness and cold-start for new individuals. Data sparseness refers to the fact that most users only visit a small portion of Web pages and hence a very sparse user-term relationship matrix is generated, while cold-start for new individuals means that the system cannot conduct any personalization without previous browsing history. Recently, community-based approaches were proposed to use the group's social behaviors as a supplement to personalization. However, these approaches only consider the commonality of a group of users and still cannot satisfy the diverse information needs of different users. In this article, we present a new approach, called collaborative personalized search. It considers not only the commonality factor among users for defining group user profiles and global user profiles, but also the specialties of individuals. Then, a statistical user language model is proposed to integrate the individual model, group user model and global user model together. In this way, the probability that a user will like a Web page is calculated through a two-step smoothing mechanism. First, a global user model is used to smooth the probability of unseen terms in the individual profiles and provide aggregated behavior of global users. Then, in order to precisely describe individual interests by looking at the behaviors of similar users, users are clustered into groups and group-user models are constructed. The group-user models are integrated into an overall model through a cluster-based language model. The behaviors of the group users can be utilized to enhance the performance of personalized search. This model can alleviate the two aforementioned problems and provide a more effective personalized search than previous approaches. Large-scale experimental evaluations are conducted to show that the proposed approach substantially improves the relevance of a search over several competitive methods.","author":["Gui-Rong Xue","Jie Han","Yong Yu","Qiang Yang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 27","Issue 2","February 2009","Article No.: 11","pp   1\u201328","https://doi.org/10.1145/1462198.1462203"],"date":"09 March 2009","ref":[{"text":"Agichtein, E., Brill, E., Dumais, S.

To ensure high data reliability and availability, erasure codes with high fault tolerance are required. In this article, we present a new family of erasure codes with high fault tolerance, named GRID codes. They are called such because they are a family of strip-based codes whose strips are arranged into multi-dimensional grids. In the construction of GRID codes, we first introduce a concept of matched codes and then discuss how to use matched codes to construct GRID codes. In addition, we propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm for GRID codes. We also discuss some important features of GRID codes. Finally, we compare GRID codes with several categories of existing codes. Our comparisons show that for large-scale storage systems, our GRID codes have attractive advantages over many existing erasure codes: (a) They are completely XOR-based and have very regular structures, ensuring easy implementation; (b) they can provide up to 15 and even higher fault tolerance; and (c) their storage efficiency can reach up to 80% and even higher. All the advantages make GRID codes more suitable for large-scale storage systems.","author":["Mingqiang Li","Jiwu Shu","Weimin Zheng"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 4","Issue 4","January 2009","Article No.: 15","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/1480439.1480444"],"date":"09 February 2009","ref":[{"text":"Aguilera, M.

Accordingly, we first examine the costs of cloud service data centers today. The cost breakdown reveals the importance of optimizing work completed per dollar invested. Unfortunately, the resources inside the data centers often operate at low utilization due to resource stranding and fragmentation. To attack this first problem, we propose (1) increasing network agility, and (2) providing appropriate incentives to shape resource consumption. Second, we note that cloud service providers are building out geo-distributed networks of data centers. Geo-diversity lowers latency to users and increases reliability in the presence of an outage taking out an entire site. However, without appropriate design and management, these geo-diverse data center networks can raise the cost of providing service. Moreover, leveraging geo-diversity requires services be designed to benefit from it. To attack this problem, we propose (1) joint optimization of network and data center resources, and (2) new systems and mechanisms for geo-distributing state.","author":["Albert Greenberg","James Hamilton","David A.

The proposed architecture, implemented in a 65nm FPGA system, consists of a pipelined interpolating time-to-digital converter (TDC). The TDC comprises a coarse time discriminator and a fine delay line, capable of sustained operation at a clock frequency of 300MHz. A Turbo version of the circuit implements a pipelined interpolating TDC with suppressed dead time to reach a conversion rate of 300MS/s at the expense of a systematic asymmetry that requires fast error correction. The TDCs proposed in this paper can be compensated for process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations using a conventional charge pump based feedback or a digital calibration technique.

These communities are inherent characteristics of human interaction in online social networks, as well as paper citation networks. Also, communities may evolve over time, due to changes to individuals' roles and social status in the network as well as changes to individuals' research interests. We present an innovative algorithm that deviates from the traditional two-step approach to analyze community evolutions. In the traditional approach, communities are first detected for each time slice, and then compared to determine correspondences. We argue that this approach is inappropriate in applications with noisy data. In this paper, we propose FacetNet for analyzing communities and their evolutions through a robust unified process. This novel framework will discover communities and capture their evolution with temporal smoothness given by historic community structures. Our approach relies on formulating the problem in terms of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, where the community structure is estimated both by the observed networked data and by the prior distribution given by historic community structures. Then we develop an iterative algorithm, with proven low time complexity, which is guaranteed to converge to an optimal solution. We perform extensive experimental studies, on both synthetic datasets and real datasets, to demonstrate that our method discovers meaningful communities and provides additional insights not directly obtainable from traditional methods.","author":["Yu-Ru Lin","Yun Chi","Shenghuo Zhu","Hari Sundaram","Belle L.

The widely believed rule-of-thumb used by router manufacturers today mandates a buffer size equal to the delay-bandwidth product. This rule was first challenged by researchers in 2004 who argued that if there are a large number of long-lived TCP connections flowing through a router, then the buffer size needed is equal to the delay-bandwidth product divided by the square root of the number of long-lived TCP flows. The publication of this result has since reinvigorated interest in the buffer sizing problem with numerous other papers exploring this topic in further detail - ranging from papers questioning the applicability of this result to proposing alternate schemes to developing new congestion control algorithms, etc.This paper provides a synopsis of the recently proposed buffer sizing strategies and broadly classifies them according to their desired objective: link utilisation, and per-flow performance. We discuss the pros and cons of these different approaches. These prior works study buffer sizing purely in the context of TCP. Subsequently, we present arguments that take into account both real-time and TCP traffic. We also report on the performance studies of various high-speed TCP variants and experimental results for networks with limited buffers. We conclude this paper by outlining some interesting avenues for further research.","author":["Arun Vishwanath","Vijay Sivaraman","Marina Thottan"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 39","Issue 2","April 2009","pp   34\u201339","https://doi.org/10.1145/1517480.1517487"],"date":"31 March 2009","ref":[{"text":"C.

In this article, Built-In Self-Test (BIST) and System-on-Chip (SOC) approaches are proposed for automating this adjustment and they are evaluated by implementation of filters using a Distributed Arithmetic Algorithm (DAA) and sinewave generator using the COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC). Both the circuits are studied by adopting three schemes: wave-pipelining, pipelining, and nonpipelining. Xilinx Spartan II and Altera Cyclone II FPGAs with Nios II soft-core processor are used for implementation of the circuits with the BIST and SOC approaches, respectively. The proposed schemes increase the speed of the WP circuits by a factor of 1.19--2.6 compared to nonpipelined circuits. The pipelined circuits achieve higher speed than the WP circuits by a factor of 1.13--3.27 at the cost of increase in area and power. When both pipelined and WP circuits are operated at the same frequency, the former dissipates more power for circuits with higher word sizes and for moderate logic depths. The observation regarding the dependence of the superiority of the WP circuits with regard to power dissipation on the logic depth is one of the major contributions of this article.","author":["G.

LDPC decoders are supported by VLSI technology, which delivers good parallel computational power with excellent throughputs, but at the expense of significant costs. In this work, we propose an alternative flexible LDPC decoder that exploits data-parallelism for simultaneous multicodeword decoding, supported by multithreading on CUDA-based graphics processing units (GPUs). The ratio of arithmetic operations per memory access is low for the efficient min-sum LDPC decoding algorithm proposed, which causes a bottleneck due to memory latency and data collisions. We propose runtime data realignment to allow coalesced parallel memory accesses to be performed by distinct threads inside the same warp. The memory access patterns of LDPC codes are random, which does not admit the simultaneous use of coalescence in both read and write operations of the decoding process. To overcome this problem we have developed a data mapping transformation which allows new addresses to be contiguously accessed for one of the mentioned memory access types. Our implementation shows throughputs above 100Mbps and BER curves that compare well with ASIC solutions.","author":["Gabriel Falc\u00e3o","Vitor Silva","Leonel Sousa"],"issue":["ICS '09: Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on Supercomputing","June 2009","Pages   390\u2013399","https://doi.org/10.1145/1542275.1542330"],"date":"08 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"R.

Features include shared title words, journal name, coauthors, medical subject headings, language, affiliations, and author name features (middle initial, suffix, and prevalence in MEDLINE). Here we test the hypothesis that the Author-ity model will suffice to disambiguate author names for the vast majority of articles in MEDLINE. Methods: Enhancements include: (a) incorporating first names and their variants, email addresses, and correlations between specific last names and affiliation words; (b) new methods of generating large unbiased training sets; (c) new methods for estimating the prior probability; (d) a weighted least squares algorithm for correcting transitivity violations; and (e) a maximum likelihood based agglomerative algorithm for computing clusters of articles that represent inferred author-individuals. Results: Pairwise comparisons were computed for all author names on all 15.3 million articles in MEDLINE (2006 baseline), that share last name and first initial, to create Author-ity 2006, a database that has each name on each article assigned to one of 6.7 million inferred author-individual clusters. Recall is estimated at \u223c98.8%. Lumping (putting two different individuals into the same cluster) affects \u223c0.5% of clusters, whereas splitting (assigning articles written by the same individual to >1 cluster) affects \u223c2% of articles. Impact: The Author-ity model can be applied generally to other bibliographic databases. Author name disambiguation allows information retrieval and data integration to become person-centered, not just document-centered, setting the stage for new data mining and social network tools that will facilitate the analysis of scholarly publishing and collaboration behavior.

Clustering on such a network may lead to better understanding of both hidden structures of the network and the individual role played by every object in each cluster. However, although clustering on homogeneous networks has been studied over decades, clustering on heterogeneous networks has not been addressed until recently. A recent study proposed a new algorithm, RankClus, for clustering on bi-typed heterogeneous networks. However, a real-world network may consist of more than two types, and the interactions among multi-typed objects play a key role at disclosing the rich semantics that a network carries. In this paper, we study clustering of multi-typed heterogeneous networks with a star network schema and propose a novel algorithm, NetClus, that utilizes links across multityped objects to generate high-quality net-clusters. An iterative enhancement method is developed that leads to effective ranking-based clustering in such heterogeneous networks. Our experiments on DBLP data show that NetClus generates more accurate clustering results than the baseline topic model algorithm PLSA and the recently proposed algorithm, RankClus. Further, NetClus generates informative clusters, presenting good ranking and cluster membership information for each attribute object in each net-cluster.","author":["Yizhou Sun","Yintao Yu","Jiawei Han"],"issue":["KDD '09: Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","June 2009","Pages   797\u2013806","https://doi.org/10.1145/1557019.1557107"],"date":"28 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"A.

Although a new Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) programming model from NVIDIA offers improved programmability for general computing, programming GPGPUs is still complex and error-prone. This paper presents a compiler framework for automatic source-to-source translation of standard OpenMP applications into CUDA-based GPGPU applications. The goal of this translation is to further improve programmability and make existing OpenMP applications amenable to execution on GPGPUs. In this paper, we have identified several key transformation techniques, which enable efficient GPU global memory access, to achieve high performance. Experimental results from two important kernels (JACOBI and SPMUL) and two NAS OpenMP Parallel Benchmarks (EP and CG) show that the described translator and compile-time optimizations work well on both regular and irregular applications, leading to performance improvements of up to 50X over the unoptimized translation (up to 328X over serial).","author":["Seyong Lee","Seung-Jai Min","Rudolf Eigenmann"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 44","Issue 4","April 2009","pp   101\u2013110","https://doi.org/10.1145/1594835.1504194"],"date":"14 February 2009","ref":[{"text":"Randy Allen and Ken Kennedy.

The basic principle is to relax the energy requirement by allowing possibly incorrect computation results. For devices with probabilistic components, energy should be assigned to each component wisely, in order to achieve a good trade-off between energy consumption and correctness of the outputs. Recently, a few schemes have been proposed for energy assignment of ripple-carry adders, which are often based on intuitive arguments. In the present paper, we extend the idea of energy assignment to probabilistic multipliers. We focus on a fundamental type of multipliers, known as array multipliers. We derive some analytical results. Guided by these results, we devise an energy assignment scheme. We also find that energy assignment for array multipliers and ripple-carry adders can be quite different, due to differences in their structures. To our best knowledge, our work here is the first attempt in the literature to consider energy assignment for multipliers. Some examples, including digital image enhancement, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","author":["Mark S.K.

This is particularly evident in large, regular and dense structures such as DRAMs. DRAMs are built using minimized transistors with presumably uniform speed in an organized array structure. Process variation can introduce latency disparity among different memory arrays. With the proliferation of 3D stacking technology, DRAMs become a favorable choice for stacking on top of a multicore processor as a last level cache for large capacity, high bandwidth, and low power. Hence, variations in bank speed creates a unique problem of non-uniform cache accesses in 3D space. In this paper, we investigate cache management techniques for tolerating process variation in a 3D DRAM stacked onto a multicore processor. We modeled the process variation in a 4-layer DRAM memory to characterize the latency variations among different banks. As a result, the notion of fast and slow banks from the core's standpoint is no longer associated with their physical distances with the banks. They are determined by the different bank latencies due to process variation. We develop cache migration schemes that utilizes fast banks while limiting the cost due to migration. Our experiments show that there is a great performance benefit in exploiting fast memory banks through migration. On average, a variation-aware management can improve the performance of a workload over the baseline (where one of the slowest bank speed is assumed for all banks) by 17.8%. We are also only 0.45% away in performance from an ideal memory where no process variation is present.","author":["Bo Zhao","Yu Du","Youtao Zhang","Jun Yang"],"issue":["MICRO 42: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2009","Pages   222\u2013231","https://doi.org/10.1145/1669112.1669141"],"date":"12 December 2009","ref":[{"text":"A.

The management of the DRAM row buffer can significantly impact both power consumption and latency. Modern DRAM systems read data from cell arrays and populate a row buffer as large as 8 KB on a memory request. But only a small fraction of these bits are ever returned back to the CPU. This ends up wasting energy and time to read (and subsequently write back) bits which are used rarely. Traditionally, an open-page policy has been used for uni-processor systems and it has worked well because of spatial and temporal locality in the access stream. In future multi-core processors, the possibly independent access streams of each core are interleaved, thus destroying the available locality and significantly under-utilizing the contents of the row buffer. In this work, we attempt to improve row-buffer utilization for future multi-core systems.The schemes presented here are motivated by our observations that a large number of accesses within heavily accessed OS pages are to small, contiguous \"chunks\" of cache blocks. Thus, the co-location of chunks (from different OS pages) in a row-buffer will improve the overall utilization of the row buffer contents, and consequently reduce memory energy consumption and access time. Such co-location can be achieved in many ways, notably involving a reduction in OS page size and software or hardware assisted migration of data within DRAM. We explore these mechanisms and discuss the trade-offs involved along with energy and performance improvements from each scheme. On average, for applications with room for improvement, our best performing scheme increases performance by 9% (max. 18%) and reduces memory energy consumption by 15% (max. 70%).","author":["Kshitij Sudan","Niladrish Chatterjee","David Nellans","Manu Awasthi","Rajeev Balasubramonian","Al Davis"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 45","Issue 3","March 2010","pp   219\u2013230","https://doi.org/10.1145/1735971.1736045"],"date":"13 March 2010","ref":[{"text":"STREAM -- Sustainable Memory Bandwidth in High Performance Computers. http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/.","order":1},{"text":"Virtutech Simics Full System Simulator. http://www.virtutech.com.","order":2},{"text":"Java Server Benchmark, 2005.

Standard examples include the Web graph and various social networks. The scale of these graphs - in some cases billions of vertices, trillions of edges - poses challenges to their efficient processing. In this paper we present a computational model suitable for this task. Programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations, in each of which a vertex can receive messages sent in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, and modify its own state and that of its outgoing edges or mutate graph topology. This vertex-centric approach is flexible enough to express a broad set of algorithms. The model has been designed for efficient, scalable and fault-tolerant implementation on clusters of thousands of commodity computers, and its implied synchronicity makes reasoning about programs easier. Distribution-related details are hidden behind an abstract API. The result is a framework for processing large graphs that is expressive and easy to program.","author":["Grzegorz Malewicz","Matthew H. Austern","Aart J.C Bik","James C.

Modern processors provide tremendous computing power by integrating multiple cores, each with wide vector units. There has been much work to exploit modern processor architectures for database primitives like scan, sort, join and aggregation. However, unlike other primitives, tree search presents significant challenges due to irregular and unpredictable data accesses in tree traversal. In this paper, we present FAST, an extremely fast architecture sensitive layout of the index tree. FAST is a binary tree logically organized to optimize for architecture features like page size, cache line size, and SIMD width of the underlying hardware. FAST eliminates impact of memory latency, and exploits thread-level and datalevel parallelism on both CPUs and GPUs to achieve 50 million (CPU) and 85 million (GPU) queries per second, 5X (CPU) and 1.7X (GPU) faster than the best previously reported performance on the same architectures. FAST supports efficient bulk updates by rebuilding index trees in less than 0.1 seconds for datasets as large as 64Mkeys and naturally integrates compression techniques, overcoming the memory bandwidth bottleneck and achieving a 6X performance improvement over uncompressed index search for large keys on CPUs.","author":["Changkyu Kim","Jatin Chhugani","Nadathur Satish","Eric Sedlar","Anthony D.

This greatly complicates operation because it requires testing and adaptation to find the best rate, transmit power or other parameter that is tuned to boost performance. We show that, for the first time, wireless packet delivery can be accurately predicted for commodity 802.11 NICs from only the channel measurements that they provide. Our model uses 802.11n Channel State Information measurements as input to an OFDM receiver model we develop by using the concept of effective SNR. It is simple, easy to deploy, broadly useful, and accurate. It makes packet delivery predictions for 802.11a/g SISO rates and 802.11n MIMO rates, plus choices of transmit power and antennas. We report testbed experiments that show narrow transition regions (<2 dB for most links) similar to the near-ideal case of narrowband, frequency-flat channels. Unlike RSSI, this lets us predict the highest rate that will work for a link, trim transmit power, and more. We use trace-driven simulation to show that our rate prediction is as good as the best rate adaptation algorithms for 802.11a/g, even over dynamic channels, and extends this good performance to 802.11n.","author":["Daniel Halperin","Wenjun Hu","Anmol Sheth","David Wetherall"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 40","Issue 4","October 2010","pp   159\u2013170","https://doi.org/10.1145/1851275.1851203"],"date":"30 August 2010","ref":[{"text":"IEEE Std. 802.11n-2009: Enhancements for higher throughput","order":1},{"text":"Intel Wireless WiFi Link drivers for Linux. http://intellinuxwireless.org.","order":2},{"text":"D.

Moreover, the system is programmable by means of a declarative language that can be used to express adaptive rules to improve power saving. We evaluate a system prototype on Nokia Symbian phones by means of several small-scale experiments aimed at testing performance in terms of accuracy and power consumption. Finally, we present the results of real deployment where we study participants emotions and interactions. We cross-validate our measurements with the results obtained through questionnaires filled by the users, and the results presented in social psychological studies using traditional methods. In particular, we show how speakers and participants' emotions can be automatically detected by means of classifiers running locally on off-the-shelf mobile phones, and how speaking and interactions can be correlated with activity and location measures.","author":["Kiran K.

Graph vertices represent entities, and graph edges represent their relationships or interactions. In many large graphs, there is usually one or more attributes associated with every graph vertex to describe its properties. In many application domains, graph clustering techniques are very useful for detecting densely connected groups in a large graph as well as for understanding and visualizing a large graph. The goal of graph clustering is to partition vertices in a large graph into different clusters based on various criteria such as vertex connectivity or neighborhood similarity. Many existing graph clustering methods mainly focus on the topological structure for clustering, but largely ignore the vertex properties, which are often heterogenous. In this article, we propose a novel graph clustering algorithm, SA-Cluster, which achieves a good balance between structural and attribute similarities through a unified distance measure. Our method partitions a large graph associated with attributes into k clusters so that each cluster contains a densely connected subgraph with homogeneous attribute values. An effective method is proposed to automatically learn the degree of contributions of structural similarity and attribute similarity. Theoretical analysis is provided to show that SA-Cluster is converging quickly through iterative cluster refinement. Some optimization techniques on matrix computation are proposed to further improve the efficiency of SA-Cluster on large graphs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SA-Cluster through comparisons with the state-of-the-art graph clustering and summarization methods.","author":["Hong Cheng","Yang Zhou","Jeffrey Xu Yu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data","Volume 5","Issue 2","February 2011","Article No.: 12","pp   1\u201333","https://doi.org/10.1145/1921632.1921638"],"date":"01 February 2011","ref":[{"text":"1998.

Since a wash droplet may have a finite capability of residue removal, one has to design an efficient route planning for wash droplet(s) that minimizes the washing time and/or electrode actuation.

Recently, \"geographical load balancing\" has been suggested to reduce energy cost by exploiting the electricity price differences across regions. However, this reduction of cost can paradoxically increase total energy use. This paper explores whether the geographical diversity of Internet-scale systems can additionally be used to provide environmental gains. Specifically, we explore whether geographical load balancing can encourage use of \"green\" renewable energy and reduce use of \"brown\" fossil fuel energy. We make two contributions. First, we derive two distributed algorithms for achieving optimal geographical load balancing. Second, we show that if electricity is dynamically priced in proportion to the instantaneous fraction of the total energy that is brown, then geographical load balancing provides significant reductions in brown energy use. However, the benefits depend strongly on the degree to which systems accept dynamic energy pricing and the form of pricing used.","author":["Zhenhua Liu","Minghong Lin","Adam Wierman","Steven H.

To address this problem, we present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model that scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique that shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images.","author":["Honglak Lee","Roger Grosse","Rajesh Ranganath","Andrew Y.

This new algorithm is often faster than comparable ray-tracing methods at rendering dynamic scenes, and has a similar level of performance when compared to static ray-tracers. Memory management is made minimal and deterministic, which simplifies ray-tracing engineering, as spatial subdivision data structures are no longer considered in the graphics pipeline. This is possible with a modification of Whitted's naive ray-tracing algorithm by using a divide-and-conquer approach, and by having a sufficient collection of rays in order to reduce the complexity of naive ray-tracing. In particular, the algorithm excels at spontaneously solving large Ray/Primitive intersection problems.","author":["Benjamin Mora"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 30","Issue 5","October 2011","Article No.: 117","pp   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2019627.2019636"],"date":"22 October 2011","ref":[{"text":"Akenine-M\u00f6ller, T. 2001.

Optical communication technologies are introduced to NoCs in order to empower ultra-high bandwidth with low power consumption. However, in existing optical NoCs, communication locality is poorly supported, and the importance of floorplanning is overlooked. These significantly limit the power efficiency and performance of optical NoCs. In this work, we address these issues and propose a torus-based hierarchical hybrid optical-electronic NoC, called THOE. THOE takes advantage of both electrical and optical routers and interconnects in a hierarchical manner. It employs several new techniques including floorplan optimization, an adaptive power control mechanism, low-latency control protocols, and hybrid optical-electrical routers with a low-power optical switching fabric. Both of the unfolded and folded torus topologies are explored for THOE. Based on a set of real MPSoC applications, we compared THOE with a typical torus-based optical NoC as well as a torus-based electronic NoC in 45nm on a 256-core MPSoC, using a SystemC-based cycle-accurate NoC simulator. Compared with the matched electronic torus-based NoC, THOE achieves 2.46X performance and 1.51X network switching capacity utilization, with 84% less energy consumption. Compared with the optical torus-based NoC, THOE achieves 4.71X performance and 3.05X network switching capacity utilization, while reducing 99% of energy consumption. Besides real MPSoC applications, a uniform traffic pattern is also used to show the average packet delay and network throughput of THOE. Regarding hardware cost, THOE reduces 75% of laser sources and half of optical receivers compared with the optical torus-based NoC.","author":["Yaoyao Ye","Jiang Xu","Xiaowen Wu","Wei Zhang","Weichen Liu","Mahdi Nikdast"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 8","Issue 1","February 2012","Article No.: 5","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/2093145.2093150"],"date":"01 February 2012","ref":[{"text":"2008.

However, the interaction between LLC management and hardware prefetching has received very little attention. This paper characterizes the performance of state-of-the-art LLC management policies in the presence and absence of hardware prefetching. Although prefetching improves performance by fetching useful data in advance, it can interact with LLC management policies to introduce application performance variability. This variability stems from the fact that current replacement policies treat prefetch and demand requests identically. In order to provide better and more predictable performance, we propose Prefetch-Aware Cache Management (PACMan). PACMan dynamically estimates and mitigates the degree of prefetch-induced cache interference by modifying the cache insertion and hit promotion policies to treat demand and prefetch requests differently. Across a variety of emerging workloads, we show that PACMan eliminates the performance variability in state-of-the-art replacement policies under the influence of prefetching. In fact, PACMan improves performance consistently across multimedia, games, server, and SPEC CPU2006 workloads by an average of 21.9% over the baseline LRU policy. For multiprogrammed workloads, on a 4-core CMP, PACMan improves performance by 21.5% on average.","author":["Carole-Jean Wu","Aamer Jaleel","Margaret Martonosi","Simon C.

In real environments where robots are deployed, distant-talking speech recognition is difficult to realize due to the effects of reverberation. This leads to the degradation of speech recognition and understanding, and hinders a seamless human-robot interaction. To minimize this problem, traditional speech enhancement techniques optimized for human perception are adopted to achieve robustness in human-robot interaction. However, human and machine perceive speech differently: an improvement in speech recognition performance may not automatically translate to an improvement in human-robot interaction experience (as perceived by the users). In this paper, we propose a method in optimizing speech enhancement techniques specifically to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) with emphasis on the human-robot interaction experience. Experimental results using real reverberant data in a multi-party conversation, show that the proposed method improved human-robot interaction experience in severe reverberant conditions compared to the traditional techniques.","author":["Randy Gomez","Tatsuya Kawahara","Keisuke Nakamura","Kazuhiro Nakadai"],"issue":["HRI '12: Proceedings of the seventh annual ACM/IEEE international conference on Human-Robot Interaction","March 2012","Pages   439\u2013446","https://doi.org/10.1145/2157689.2157835"],"date":"05 March 2012","ref":[{"text":"S.

We argue that this is a consequence of conflating what computations define the algorithm, with decisions about storage and the order of computation. We refer to these latter two concerns as the schedule, including choices of tiling, fusion, recomputation vs. storage, vectorization, and parallelism.We propose a representation for feed-forward imaging pipelines that separates the algorithm from its schedule, enabling high-performance without sacrificing code clarity. This decoupling simplifies the algorithm specification: images and intermediate buffers become functions over an infinite integer domain, with no explicit storage or boundary conditions. Imaging pipelines are compositions of functions. Programmers separately specify scheduling strategies for the various functions composing the algorithm, which allows them to efficiently explore different optimizations without changing the algorithmic code.We demonstrate the power of this representation by expressing a range of recent image processing applications in an embedded domain specific language called Halide, and compiling them for ARM, x86, and GPUs. Our compiler targets SIMD units, multiple cores, and complex memory hierarchies. We demonstrate that it can handle algorithms such as a camera raw pipeline, the bilateral grid, fast local Laplacian filtering, and image segmentation. The algorithms expressed in our language are both shorter and faster than state-of-the-art implementations.","author":["Jonathan Ragan-Kelley","Andrew Adams","Sylvain Paris","Marc Levoy","Saman Amarasinghe","Fr\u00e9do Durand"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 31","Issue 4","July 2012","Article No.: 32","pp   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2185520.2185528"],"date":"01 July 2012","ref":[{"text":"Adams, A., Talvala, E.-V., Park, S.

In this paper, we propose a framework (titled DRoF) that Discovers Regions of different Functions in a city using both human mobility among regions and points of interests (POIs) located in a region. Specifically, we segment a city into disjointed regions according to major roads, such as highways and urban express ways. We infer the functions of each region using a topic-based inference model, which regards a region as a document, a function as a topic, categories of POIs (e.g., restaurants and shopping malls) as metadata (like authors, affiliations, and key words), and human mobility patterns (when people reach/leave a region and where people come from and leave for) as words. As a result, a region is represented by a distribution of functions, and a function is featured by a distribution of mobility patterns. We further identify the intensity of each function in different locations. The results generated by our framework can benefit a variety of applications, including urban planning, location choosing for a business, and social recommendations. We evaluated our method using large-scale and real-world datasets, consisting of two POI datasets of Beijing (in 2010 and 2011) and two 3-month GPS trajectory datasets (representing human mobility) generated by over 12,000 taxicabs in Beijing in 2010 and 2011 respectively. The results justify the advantages of our approach over baseline methods solely using POIs or human mobility.","author":["Jing Yuan","Yu Zheng","Xing Xie"],"issue":["KDD '12: Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2012","Pages   186\u2013194","https://doi.org/10.1145/2339530.2339561"],"date":"12 August 2012","ref":[{"text":"J.

The existing approach to automated test-case reduction, delta debugging, works by removing substrings of the original input; the result is a concatenation of substrings that delta cannot remove. We have found this approach less than ideal for reducing C programs because it typically yields test cases that are too large or even invalid (relying on undefined behavior). To obtain small and valid test cases consistently, we designed and implemented three new, domain-specific test-case reducers. The best of these is based on a novel framework in which a generic fixpoint computation invokes modular transformations that perform reduction operations. This reducer produces outputs that are, on average, more than 25 times smaller than those produced by our other reducers or by the existing reducer that is most commonly used by compiler developers. We conclude that effective program reduction requires more than straightforward delta debugging.","author":["John Regehr","Yang Chen","Pascal Cuoq","Eric Eide","Chucky Ellison","Xuejun Yang"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 47","Issue 6","June 2012","pp   335\u2013346","https://doi.org/10.1145/2345156.2254104"],"date":"11 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"Bruno Blanchet, Patrick Cousot, Radhia Cousot, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Feret, Laurent Mauborgne, Antoine Min\u00e9, David Monniaux, and Xavier Rival.

Prior work does not adequately address the problem of large datasets and minimization of I/O costs.This paper presents a data clustering method named BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies), and demonstrates that it is especially suitable for very large databases. BIRCH incrementally and dynamically clusters incoming multi-dimensional metric data points to try to produce the best quality clustering with the available resources (i.e., available memory and time constraints). BIRCH can typically find a good clustering with a single scan of the data, and improve the quality further with a few additional scans. BIRCH is also the first clustering algorithm proposed in the database area to handle \"noise\" (data points that are not part of the underlying pattern) effectively.We evaluate BIRCH's time/space efficiency, data input order sensitivity, and clustering quality through several experiments. We also present a performance comparisons of BIRCH versus CLARANS, a clustering method proposed recently for large datasets, and show that BIRCH is consistently superior.","author":["Tian Zhang","Raghu Ramakrishnan","Miron Livny"],"issue":["ACM SIGMOD Record","Volume 25","Issue 2","June 1996","pp   103\u2013114","https://doi.org/10.1145/235968.233324"],"date":"01 June 1996","ref":[{"text":"Peter C, heeselnan, James Kelly, Matthew Self, et al., Auto CIass : A Bayesian Classification System, Proc. of the 5th Int'l Conf. on Machine Learning, Morgan Kaufman, 3un. 1988.","order":1},{"text":"Richard Duds, and Peter E.

Unfortunately, directly applying well-known compression algorithms (usually implemented in software) leads to high hardware complexity and unacceptable decompression/compression latencies, which in turn can negatively affect performance. Hence, there is a need for a simple yet efficient compression technique that can effectively compress common in-cache data patterns, and has minimal effect on cache access latency. In this paper, we introduce a new compression algorithm called Base-Delta-Immediate (B\u0394I) compression, a practical technique for compressing data in on-chip caches. The key idea is that, for many cache lines, the values within the cache line have a low dynamic range - i.e., the differences between values stored within the cache line are small. As a result, a cache line can be represented using a base value and an array of differences whose combined size is much smaller than the original cache line (we call this the base+delta encoding). Moreover, many cache lines intersperse such base+delta values with small values - our B\u0394I technique efficiently incorporates such immediate values into its encoding. Compared to prior cache compression approaches, our studies show that B\u0394I strikes a sweet-spot in the tradeoff between compression ratio, decompression/compression latencies, and hardware complexity. Our results show that B\u0394I compression improves performance for both single-core (8.1% improvement) and multi-core workloads (9.5% / 11.2% improvement for two/four cores). For many applications, B\u0394I provides the performance benefit of doubling the cache size of the baseline system, effectively increasing average cache capacity by 1.53X.","author":["Gennady Pekhimenko","Vivek Seshadri","Onur Mutlu","Phillip B.

During test, it can far exceed the values reached during normal operation and, thus, lead to temperatures above the allowed threshold. Without appropriate temperature reduction, permanent damage may be caused to the IC or invalid test results may be obtained. FinFET is a double-gate field-effect transistor (DG-FET) that was introduced commercially in 2012. Due to the vertical nature of FinFETs and, hence, weaker ability to dissipate heat, this problem is likely to get worse for FinFET circuits. Another technology rapidly gaining popularity is 3D IC integration. Unfortunately, the compact nature of a multidie 3D IC is likely to aggravate the temperature-during-test problem even further. Hence, before temperature-aware test methodologies can be developed, it is important to thermally analyze both FinFET and 3D circuits under test.In this article, we present a methodology for thermal characterization of various test techniques, such as scan and built-in self-test (BIST), for FinFET and 3D ICs. FinFET thermal characterization makes use of a FinFET standard cell library that is characterized with the help of the University of Florida double-gate (UFDG) SPICE model. Thermal profiles for circuits under test are produced by ISAC2 from University of Colorado for FinFET circuits and HotSpot from University of Virginia for 3D ICs. Experimental results indicate that high temperatures result under BIST and much less often under scan, and that both power consumption and test application time should be reduced to lower the temperature of circuits under test, just reducing the power consumption is not enough.","author":["Aoxiang Tang","Niraj K.

In this paper, we propose a novel performance modeling algorithm that is referred to as Bayesian Model Fusion (BMF). Our key idea is to borrow the simulation data generated from an early stage (e.g., schematic level) to facilitate efficient high-dimensional performance modeling at a late stage (e.g., post layout) with low computational cost. Such a goal is achieved by statistically modeling the performance correlation between early and late stages through Bayesian inference. Several circuit examples designed in a commercial 32nm CMOS process demonstrate that BMF achieves up to 9x runtime speedup over the traditional modeling technique without surrendering any accuracy.","author":["Fa Wang","Wangyang Zhang","Shupeng Sun","Xin Li","Chenjie Gu"],"issue":["DAC '13: Proceedings of the 50th Annual Design Automation Conference","May 2013","Article No.: 64","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2463209.2488812"],"date":"29 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"Semiconductor Industry Associate,","order":1},{"text":"X.

RBD instruments circuits with mechanisms to identify and correct timing violations, thereby allowing reduced guard bands or design margins. In addition, RBD enables aggressive voltage overscaling to a point where timing errors occur even under nominal conditions. A major barrier to the widespread adoption of RBD is that traditional design practices and synthesis tools result in circuits with so-called\"path walls\", leading to an explosion in the number of timing errors beyond a certain critical operating voltage. To alleviate this effect, previous techniques focused on combinational circuit optimizations such as sizing, use of dual Vth cells, re-structuring, etc. to favorably reshape the path delay distribution. However, these techniques are limited by the inherent sequential structure of the circuit, which defines the boundaries of the combinational logic. In this work, we explore a completely different approach to synthesize circuits for RBD. We propose the use of retiming, a well-known and powerful sequential optimization technique to redefine the boundaries of combinational logic, thereby creating new opportunities for RBD that cannot be explored by previous techniques. We make the key observation that, in retiming circuits with RBD (unlike classical retiming), it is acceptable for a few paths in the circuit to exceed the clock period. Using this insight, we propose a synthesis methodology, Relax-and-Retime, wherein the original circuit is relaxed by ignoring timing constraints on selected paths that are bottlenecks to retiming. When classical minimum period retiming is employed on this relaxed circuit, the path wall is shifted to a lower delay, thus allowing additional voltage overscaling. The Relax-and-Retime methodology judiciously selects bottleneck paths by trading off recovery overheads caused by timing errors due to these paths with the opportunities for retiming. We utilize the proposed methodology to synthesize a wide range of benchmarks including arithmetic circuits, ISCAS89 benchmarks and modules from the UltraSPARC T1 processor. Our results demonstrate 9-25% (average of 15.3%) improvement in overall energy compared to a well-optimized baseline with RBD.","author":["Shankar Ganesh Ramasubramanian","Swagath Venkataramani","Adithya Parandhaman","Anand Raghunathan"],"issue":["DAC '13: Proceedings of the 50th Annual Design Automation Conference","May 2013","Article No.: 111","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2463209.2488871"],"date":"29 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"D.

A refresh command blocks a full rank, decreasing available parallelism in the memory subsystem significantly, thus decreasing performance. Fine Granularity Refresh (FGR) is a feature recently announced as part of JEDEC's DDR4 DRAM specification that attempts to tackle this problem by creating a range of refresh options that provide a trade-off between refresh latency and frequency. In this paper, we first conduct an analysis of DDR4 DRAM's FGR feature, and show that there is no one-size-fits-all option across a variety of applications. We then present Adaptive Refresh (AR), a simple yet effective mechanism that dynamically chooses the best FGR mode for each application and phase within the application. When looking at the refresh problem more closely, we identify in high-density DRAM systems a phenomenon that we call command queue seizure, whereby the memory controller's command queue seizes up temporarily because it is full with commands to a rank that is being refreshed. To attack this problem, we propose two complementary mechanisms called Delayed Command Expansion (DCE) and Preemptive Command Drain (PCD). Our results show that AR does exploit DDR4's FGR effectively. However, once our proposed DCE and PCD mechanisms are added, DDR4's FGR becomes redundant in most cases, except in a few highly memory-sensitive applications, where the use of AR does provide some additional benefit. In all, our simulations show that the proposed mechanisms yield 8% (14%) mean speedup with respect to traditional refresh, at normal (extended) DRAM operating temperatures, for a set of diverse parallel applications.","author":["Janani Mukundan","Hillery Hunter","Kyu-hyoun Kim","Jeffrey Stuecheli","Jos\u00e9 F.

Decision support places some rather different requirements on database technology compared to traditional on-line transaction processing applications. This paper provides an overview of data warehousing and OLAP technologies, with an emphasis on their new requirements. We describe back end tools for extracting, cleaning and loading data into a data warehouse; multidimensional data models typical of OLAP; front end client tools for querying and data analysis; server extensions for efficient query processing; and tools for metadata management and for managing the warehouse. In addition to surveying the state of the art, this paper also identifies some promising research issues, some of which are related to problems that the database research community has worked on for years, but others are only just beginning to be addressed.

The key is to cohesively exploit the NAND flash memory device write speed vs. raw storage reliability trade-off at the physical layer and runtime data access workload dynamics at the system level. Leveraging runtime data access workload variation, we can opportunistically slow down NAND flash memory write speed and hence improve NAND flash memory raw storage reliability. This naturally enables an opportunistic use of weaker error correction schemes that can directly reduce SSD read access latency. We develop a disk-level scheduling scheme to effectively smooth the write workload in order to maximize the occurrence of runtime opportunistic NAND flash memory write slowdown. Using 2 bits/cell NAND flash memory with BCH-based error correction correction as a test vehicle, we carry out extensive simulations over various workloads and demonstrate that this developed cross-layer co-design solution can reduce the average SSD read latency by up to 59.4% without sacrificing the write throughput performance.","author":["Guanying Wu","Xubin He","Ningde Xie","Tong Zhang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","Volume 18","Issue 4","October 2013","Article No.: 55","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/2489792"],"date":"25 October 2013","ref":[{"text":"Agrawal, N., Prabhakaran, V., Wobber T., Davis, J.

Although innovative solutions have already been proposed, there is no solution that is universally accepted, easily implemented, user centric, and, most importantly, works in the absence of GSM coverage or WiFi availability. The advent of sensor rich smartphones has paved a way to develop a solution that can cater to these requirements.By employing a smartphone's built-in magnetic field sensor, magnetic signatures were collected inside buildings. These signatures displayed a uniqueness in their patterns due to the presence of different kinds of pillars, doors, elevators, etc., that consist of ferromagnetic materials like steel or iron. We theoretically analyze the cause of this uniqueness and then present an indoor localization solution by classifying signatures based on their patterns. However, to account for user walking speed variations so as to provide an application usable to a variety of users, we follow a dynamic time-warping-based approach that is known to work on similar signals irrespective of their variations in the time axis.Our approach resulted in localization distances of approximately 2m--6m with accuracies between 80--100% implying that it is sufficient to walk short distances across hallways to be located by the smartphone. The implementation of the application on different smartphones yielded response times of less than five secs, thereby validating the feasibility of our approach and making it a viable solution.","author":["Kalyan Pathapati Subbu","Brandon Gozick","Ram Dantu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology","Volume 4","Issue 4","September 2013","Article No.: 73","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/2508037.2508054"],"date":"08 October 2013","ref":[{"text":"Addlesee, M., Curwen, R., Hodges, S., Newman, J., Steggles, P., Ward, A., and Hopper, A. 2001.

Unfortunately, representing this uncertain data with discrete types (floats, integers, and booleans) encourages developers to pretend it is not probabilistic, which causes three types of uncertainty bugs. (1) Using estimates as facts ignores random error in estimates. (2) Computation compounds that error. (3) Boolean questions on probabilistic data induce false positives and negatives.  This paper introduces Uncertain<T>, a new programming language abstraction for uncertain data. We implement a Bayesian network semantics for computation and conditionals that improves program correctness. The runtime uses sampling and hypothesis tests to evaluate computation and conditionals lazily and efficiently. We illustrate with sensor and machine learning applications that Uncertain<T> improves expressiveness and accuracy. Whereas previous probabilistic programming languages focus on experts, Uncertain<T> serves a wide range of developers. Experts still identify error distributions. However, both experts and application writers compute with distributions, improve estimates with domain knowledge, and ask questions with conditionals. The Uncertain<T> type system and operators encourage developers to expose and reason about uncertainty explicitly, controlling false positives and false negatives. These benefits make Uncertain<T> a compelling programming model for modern applications facing the challenge of uncertainty.","author":["James Bornholt","Todd Mytkowicz","Kathryn S.

During the parallelism optimization for the data path, memory becomes a crucial bottleneck that impedes performance enhancement. Simultaneous data access is highly restricted by the data mapping strategy and memory port constraint. Memory partitioning can efficiently map data elements in the same logical array onto multiple physical banks so that the accesses to the array are parallelized. Previous methods for memory partitioning mainly focused on cyclic partitioning for single-port memory. In this work we propose a generalized memory-partitioning framework to provide high data throughput of on-chip memories. We generalize cyclic partitioning into block-cyclic partitioning for a larger design space exploration. We build the conflict detection algorithm on polytope emptiness testing, and use integer points counting in polytopes for intra-bank offset generation. Memory partitioning for multi-port memory is supported in this framework. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to the state-of-art partitioning algorithm, our proposed algorithm can reduce the number of block RAM by 19.58%, slice by 20.26% and DSP by 50%.","author":["Yuxin Wang","Peng Li","Jason Cong"],"issue":["FPGA '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM/SIGDA international symposium on Field-programmable gate arrays","February 2014","Pages   199\u2013208","https://doi.org/10.1145/2554688.2554780"],"date":"26 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"7 Series FPGAs Memory Resources. http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation.","order":1},{"text":"C-to-Silicon Compiler. http://www.cadence.com/products/.","order":2},{"text":"Catapult C. http://calypto.com/.","order":3},{"text":"Cynthesizer. www.forteds.com.","order":4},{"text":"JM Software. http://iphome.hhi.de/suehring/tml/.","order":5},{"text":"Polylib. http://www.irisa.fr/polylib/.","order":6},{"text":"ROSE compiler infrastructure. http://rosecompiler.org/.","order":7},{"text":"Synphony C Compiler. http://www.synopsys.com.","order":8},{"text":"Vivado High-Level Synthesis. http://www.xilinx.com/.","order":9},{"text":"S.

Although these two fields have been actively and extensively studied separately, researchers are beginning to realize the importance of the scenarios at their intersection: providing an integrated search and information discovery user experience. In this paper, we study a novel application, i.e., personalized entity recommendation for search engine users, by utilizing user click log and the knowledge extracted from Freebase. To better bridge the gap between search engines and recommender systems, we first discuss important heuristics and features of the datasets. We then propose a generic, robust, and time-aware personalized recommendation framework to utilize these heuristics and features at different granularity levels. Using movie recommendation as a case study, with user click log dataset collected from a widely used commercial search engine, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework over other popular and state-of-the-art recommendation techniques.","author":["Xiao Yu","Hao Ma","Bo-June (Paul) Hsu","Jiawei Han"],"issue":["WSDM '14: Proceedings of the 7th ACM international conference on Web search and data mining","February 2014","Pages   263\u2013272","https://doi.org/10.1145/2556195.2556233"],"date":"24 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"K.

Past approaches to learning behavior in Ms. Pac-Man have treated the game as a single task to be learned using monolithic policy representations. In contrast, this paper uses a framework called Modular Multiobjective NEAT to evolve modular neural networks. Each module defines a separate policy; evolution discovers these policies and when to use them. The number of modules can be fixed or learned using a new version of a genetic operator, called Module Mutation, which duplicates an existing module that can then evolve to take on a distinct behavioral identity. Both the fixed modular networks and Module Mutation networks outperform traditional monolithic networks. More interestingly, the best modular networks dedicate modules to critical behaviors that do not follow the customary division of the game into chasing edible and escaping threatening ghosts.","author":["Jacob Schrum","Risto Miikkulainen"],"issue":["GECCO '14: Proceedings of the 2014 Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation","July 2014","Pages   325\u2013332","https://doi.org/10.1145/2576768.2598234"],"date":"12 July 2014","ref":[{"text":"A.

Therefore, highly ranked Web pages generally have higher visibility to people and pushing the ranking higher has become the top priority for Web masters. As a matter of fact, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) has became a sizeable business that attempts to improve their clients\u2019 ranking. Still, the lack of ways to validate SEO\u2019s methods has created numerous myths and fallacies associated with ranking algorithms.In this article, we focus on two ranking algorithms, Google\u2019s and Bing\u2019s, and design, implement, and evaluate a ranking system to systematically validate assumptions others have made about these popular ranking algorithms. We demonstrate that linear learning models, coupled with a recursive partitioning ranking scheme, are capable of predicting ranking results with high accuracy. As an example, we manage to correctly predict 7 out of the top 10 pages for 78% of evaluated keywords. Moreover, for content-only ranking, our system can correctly predict 9 or more pages out of the top 10 ones for 77% of search terms. We show how our ranking system can be used to reveal the relative importance of ranking features in a search engine\u2019s ranking function, provide guidelines for SEOs and Web masters to optimize their Web pages, validate or disprove new ranking features, and evaluate search engine ranking results for possible ranking bias.","author":["Ao-Jan Su","Y.

In-memory database systems running on NUMA platforms face several issues such as the increased latency and the decreased bandwidth when accessing remote main memory. To cope with these NUMA-related issues, a DBMS has to allow flexible data partitioning and data placement at runtime. In this demonstration, we present ERIS, our NUMA-aware in-memory storage engine. ERIS uses an adaptive partitioning approach that exploits the topology of the underlying NUMA platform and significantly reduces NUMA-related issues. We demonstrate throughput numbers and hardware performance counter evaluations of ERIS and a NUMA-unaware index for different workloads and configurations. All experiments are conducted on a standard server system as well as on a system consisting of 64 multiprocessors, 512 cores, and 8 TBs main memory.","author":["Tim Kiefer","Thomas Kissinger","Benjamin Schlegel","Dirk Habich","Daniel Molka","Wolfgang Lehner"],"issue":["SIGMOD '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","June 2014","Pages   689\u2013692","https://doi.org/10.1145/2588555.2594524"],"date":"18 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"M.

The only parameters which depend on the size of the input are the soundness of the protocol and the security of the output (both are inverse exponential in m). This settles a long-standing open problem in the area of randomness expansion and device-independence. The analysis of our protocols involves overcoming fundamental challenges in the study of adaptive device-independent protocols. Our primary technical contribution is the design and analysis of device-independent protocols which are Input Secure; that is, their output is guaranteed to be secure against a quantum eavesdropper, even if the input randomness was generated by that same eavesdropper!

Existing designs, however, consume significant power and computational resources, and hence cannot be run on low complexity, power constrained backscatter devices. This paper makes two main contributions: (1) we introduce the first multi-antenna cancellation design that operates on backscatter devices while retaining a small form factor and power footprint, (2) we introduce a novel coding mechanism that enables long range communication as well as concurrent transmissions and can be decoded on backscatter devices. We build hardware prototypes of the above designs that can be powered solely using harvested energy from TV and solar sources. The results show that our designs provide benefits for both RFID and ambient backscatter systems: they enable RFID tags to communicate directly with each other at distances of tens of meters and through multiple walls. They also increase the communication rate and range achieved by ambient backscatter systems by 100X and 40X respectively. We believe that this paper represents a substantial leap in the capabilities of backscatter communication.","author":["Aaron N. Parks","Angli Liu","Shyamnath Gollakota","Joshua R.

Emerging non-volatile memory such as magnetoresistive memory (MRAM) offers a DRAM alternative and can potentially lead to a more energy-efficient memory system. The MRAM technology is already mature, but considering the memory industry is highly standardized, we are still unable to see any MRAM used in mainstream products. To tackle this problem, we design an LPDDRx-compatible MRAM interface by considering both MRAM pros and cons. Our design solves the pin-compatibility and the performance issues caused by MRAM small page size, and it optimizes the interface protocol by leveraging the MRAM unique feature of non-destructive reads. Combining our techniques, we boost the MRAM performance by 14% and provide a DRAM-swappable MRAM solution with 20% less energy.","author":["Jue Wang","Xiangyu Dong","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["ISLPED '14: Proceedings of the 2014 international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2014","Pages   339\u2013344","https://doi.org/10.1145/2627369.2627610"],"date":"11 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"J.

Consequently, it is possible to apply voltage over-scaling (VOS) in their implementation to save energy. In this paper, the impact of VOS on timing errors is characterized for a typical min-sum LDPC decoder architecture using circuit simulations. Failure modes are analyzed for arithmetic circuits performing variable and check node computations. It is shown that a rather unconventional register placement in the variable node unit is beneficial for voltage scaling, and that the check node unit may be designed such that only the least significant bits are more likely to experience errors. Insights into timing error characteristics obtained through this analysis can be used to estimate the limits of voltage scaling and associated energy saving in practical LDPC decoder designs.","author":["Behnam Sedighi","N.

First, a generic superscalar pipeline is defined. Then the specific areas of register renaming, instruction window wakeup and selection logic, and operand bypassing are analyzed. Each is modeled and Spice simulated for feature sizes of 0.8&micro;m, 0.35&micro;m, and 0.18&micro;m. Performance results and trends are expressed in terms of issue width and window size. Our analysis indicates that window wakeup and selection logic as well as operand bypass logic are likely to be the most critical in the future.A microarchitecture that simplifies wakeup and selection logic is proposed and discussed. This implementation puts chains of dependent instructions into queues, and issues instructions from multiple queues in parallel. Simulation shows little slowdown as compared with a completely flexible issue window when performance is measured in clock cycles. Furthermore, because only instructions at queue heads need to be awakened and selected, issue logic is simplified and the clock cycle is faster --- consequently overall performance is improved. By grouping dependent instructions together, the proposed microarchitecture will help minimize performance degradation due to slow bypasses in future wide-issue machines.","author":["Subbarao Palacharla","Norman P.

In-memory objects can themselves be persistent without the need for a separate persistent data storage format. However, the challenge is to ensure that such data remains consistent if a failure occurs during execution. In this paper, we present our system, called Atlas, which adds durability semantics to lock-based code, typically allowing us to automatically maintain a globally consistent state even in the presence of failures. We identify failure-atomic sections of code based on existing critical sections and describe a log-based implementation that can be used to recover a consistent state after a failure. We discuss several subtle semantic issues and implementation tradeoffs. We confirm the ability to rapidly flush CPU caches as a core implementation bottleneck and suggest partial solutions. Experimental results confirm the practicality of our approach and provide insight into the overheads of such a system.","author":["Dhruva R. Chakrabarti","Hans-J.

Our incomplete knowledge of the effects of metabolic load and biological \u201ccrosstalk\u201d on the host cell make it difficult to construct multilevel genetic logic circuits in a single cell, limiting the scalability of engineered biological systems. Microfluidic technologies provide reliable and scalable construction of synthetic biological systems by allowing compartmentalization of cells encoding simple genetic circuits and the spatiotemporal control of communication among these cells. This control is achieved via valves on the microfluidics chip which restrict fluid flow when activated. We describe a Computer Aided Design (CAD) framework called \u201cFluigi\u201d for optimizing the layout of genetic circuits on a microfluidic chip, generating the control sequence of the associated signaling fluid valves, and simulating the behavior of the configured biological circuits. We demonstrate the capabilities of Fluigi on a set of Boolean algebraic benchmark circuits found in both synthetic biology and electrical engineering and a set of assay-based benchmark circuits. The integration of microfluidics and synthetic biology has the capability to increase the scale of engineered biological systems for applications in DNA assembly, biosensors, and screening assays for novel orthogonal genetic parts.","author":["Haiyao Huang","Douglas Densmore"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 11","Issue 3","December 2014","Article No.: 26","pp   1\u201319","https://doi.org/10.1145/2660773"],"date":"30 December 2014","ref":[{"text":"Nada Amin, William Thies, and Saman Amarasinghe. 2009.

Both static and dynamic power dissipations are increasing, caused mainly by the intrinsic leakage currents and large data traffic. Alternative approaches beyond charge-only-based electronics, and in particular, spin-based devices, show promising potential to overcome these issues by adding the spin freedom of electrons to electronic circuits. Spintronics provides data non-volatility, fast data access, and low-power operation, and has now become a hot topic in both academia and industry for achieving ultra-low-power circuits and systems. The ITRS report on emerging research devices identified the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) nanopillar (one of the Spintronics nanodevices) as one of the most promising technologies to be part of future micro-electronic circuits. In this review we will give an overview of the status and prospects of spin-based devices and circuits that are currently under intense investigation and development across the world, and address particularly their merits and challenges for practical applications. We will also show that, with a rapid development of Spintronics, some novel computing architectures and paradigms beyond classic Von-Neumann architecture have recently been emerging for next-generation ultra-low-power circuits and systems.","author":["Wang Kang","Yue Zhang","Zhaohao Wang","Jacques-Olivier Klein","Claude Chappert","Dafin\u00e9 Ravelosona","Gefei Wang","Youguang Zhang","Weisheng Zhao"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 12","Issue 2","August 2015","Article No.: 16","pp   1\u201342","https://doi.org/10.1145/2663351"],"date":"02 September 2015","ref":[{"text":"Agilent Technologies. 2007.

Environmental energy sources vary widely and are often difficult both to predict and to reproduce in the lab during testing. These variations are also behavior dependent---a factor that leaves application engineers unable to make even simple comparisons between algorithms or hardware configurations, using traditional testing approaches. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of Ekho, an emulator capable of recording energy harvesting conditions and accurately recreating those conditions in the lab. This makes it possible to conduct realistic and repeatable experiments involving energy harvesting devices. Ekho is a general-purpose tool that supports a wide range of harvesting technologies. We demonstrate, using a working prototype, that Ekho is capable of reproducing both solar and RF energy harvesting environments accurately and consistently. Our results show that Ekho can recreate harvesting-dependent program behaviors by emulating energy harvesting conditions accurately to within 77.4 \u03bcA for solar environments, and can emulate RF energy harvesting conditions significantly more consistently than a programmable RF harvesting environment.","author":["Josiah Hester","Timothy Scott","Jacob Sorber"],"issue":["SenSys '14: Proceedings of the 12th ACM Conference on Embedded Network Sensor Systems","November 2014","Pages   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/2668332.2668336"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"D.

We argue that the conventional AP deployment model of co-located antennas as well as their PHY and MAC mechanisms are not designed to realize the complete potential of MU-MIMO. We propose to leverage distributed antenna systems (DAS) to empower next generation 802.11ac networks. We highlight the multitude of benefits that DAS brings to MU-MIMO and 802.11ac in general. However, several challenges arise in the process of realizing these benefits in practice, where avoiding client modifications and making only minimal software modifications to APs is important to enable rapid adoption. Towards addressing these challenges, we present the design and implementation of MIDAS, the Multiple-Input Distributed Antenna System. MIDAS couples a DAS deployment of AP antennas with a suite of novel yet standards-compatible mechanisms at the PHY and MAC layers that best leverage the DAS deployment to maximize 802.11ac performance. Our WARP-based experimental evaluation demonstrates MIDAS's ability to significantly boost the performance of current 802.11ac design, demonstrating throughput gains over 802.11ac MU-MIMO for 100-200%, while remaining amenable to commercial adoption.","author":["Jie Xiong","Karthikeyan Sundaresan","Kyle Jamieson","Mohammad A.

The reliability of the computation is the probability that it will produce an acceptably accurate result. Emerging approximate hardware platforms provide approximate operations that, in return for reduced energy consumption and/or increased performance, exhibit reduced reliability and/or accuracy. We present Chisel, a system for reliability- and accuracy-aware optimization of approximate computational kernels that run on approximate hardware platforms. Given a combined reliability and/or accuracy specification, Chisel automatically selects approximate kernel operations to synthesize an approximate computation that minimizes energy consumption while satisfying its reliability and accuracy specification. We evaluate Chisel on five applications from the image processing, scientific computing, and financial analysis domains. The experimental results show that our implemented optimization algorithm enables Chisel to optimize our set of benchmark kernels to obtain energy savings from 8.7% to 19.8% compared to the fully reliable kernel implementations while preserving important reliability guarantees.","author":["Sasa Misailovic","Michael Carbin","Sara Achour","Zichao Qi","Martin C.

Its performance profile is unique in that its latency is close to main memory and it is byte addressable, but it exhibits asymmetric I/O in that writes are more expensive than reads. These properties imply that it cannot act as a drop-in replacement for either main-memory or disk. Therefore, we must revisit the salient aspects of data management in light of this new technology. In what follows we present the current work in the area with a view towards identifying the open problems and exposing the research opportunities. In particular, we address issues like: (a) incorporating non-volatile memory into the data management stack, (b) supporting transactions and ensuring persistence and recovery, and (c) query processing.","author":["Stratis D.

While existing technologies have harvested power from ambient RF sources (e.g., TV broadcasts), they require a dedicated gateway (like an RFID reader) for Internet connectivity. We present Wi-Fi Backscatter, a novel communication system that bridges RF-powered devices with the Internet. Specifically, we show that it is possible to reuse existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to provide Internet connectivity to RF-powered devices. To show Wi-Fi Backscatter's feasibility, we build a hardware prototype and demonstrate the first communication link between an RF-powered device and commodity Wi-Fi devices. We use off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices including Intel Wi-Fi cards, Linksys Routers, and our organization's Wi-Fi infrastructure, and achieve communication rates of up to 1 kbps and ranges of up to 2.1 meters. We believe that this new capability can pave the way for the rapid deployment and adoption of RF-powered devices and achieve ubiquitous connectivity via nearby mobile devices that are Wi-Fi enabled.","author":["Bryce Kellogg","Aaron Parks","Shyamnath Gollakota","Joshua R.

We propose an operating system (OS) and programming interface to place data from within the user application. We present a profiling tool to help programmers decide on the placement of application data in hybrid memory systems. Cycle-accurate simulation of modified applications confirms that our approach is more energy-efficient than state-of-the-art hardware or OS approaches at equivalent performance. Moreover, our results are validated on several candidate NVM technologies and a wide set of 14 benchmarks. The key observation behind this work is that, for the workloads we evaluated, application objects are too short-lived to motivate migration. Utilizing this property significantly reduces the hardware complexity of hybrid memory systems.","author":["Ahmad Hassan","Hans Vandierendonck","Dimitrios S.

Compressed sensing (CS) theory provides a sub-Nyquist sampling paradigm to improve the energy efficiency of electroencephalography (EEG) signal acquisition. However, EEG is a structure-variational signal with time-varying sparsity, which decreases the efficiency of compressed sensing. In this paper, we present a new adaptive CS architecture to tackle the challenge of EEG signal acquisition. Specifically, we design a dynamic knob framework to respond to EEG signal dynamics, and then formulate its design optimization into a dynamic programming problem. We verify our proposed adaptive CS architecture on a publicly available data set. Experimental results show that our adaptive CS can improve signal reconstruction quality by more than 70% under different energy budgets while only consuming 187.88 nJ/event. This indicates that the adaptive CS architecture can effectively adapt to the EEG signal dynamics in the BCI.","author":["Aosen Wang","Zhanpeng Jin","Chen Song","Wenyao Xu"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 173","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744792"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"C-T Lin, L-W Ko, M-H Chang, J-R Duann, J-Y Chen, T-P Su, and T-P Jung.

In application-specific and portable microfluidic devices, critical microvalves need to switch at the same time for correct functionality. Those microvalves are required to have equal or similar channel lengths to the control pin, so that the control signal can reach them simultaneously. This paper presents a practical control-layer routing flow (PACOR) considering the critical length-matching constraint. Major features of PACOR include: (1) effective candidate Steiner tree construction and selection methods for multiple microvalves based on the deferred-merge embedding (DME) algorithm and maximum weight clique problem (MWCP) formulation, (2) minimum cost flow-based formulation for simultaneous escape routing for improved routability, and (3) minimum-length bounded routing method to detour paths for length matching. Computational simulation results show effectiveness and efficiency of PACOR with promising matching results and 100% routing completion rate.","author":["Hailong Yao","Tsung-Yi Ho","Yici Cai"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 142","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744887"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"F.

Although attractive, STTRAM is susceptible to contactless tampering through malicious exposure to magnetic field with the intention to steal or modify the bitcell content. In this paper, for the first time to our knowledge, we analyze the impact of magnetic attacks on STTRAM using micro-magnetic simulations. Next, we propose a novel array-based sensor to detect the polarity and magnitude of such attacks and then propose two design techniques to mitigate the attack, namely, array sleep with encoding and variable strength Error Correction Code (ECC). Simulation results indicate that the proposed sensor can reliably detect an attack and provide sufficient compensation window (few ns to ~100us) to enable proactive protection measures. Finally, we shows that variable-strength ECC can adapt correction capability to tolerate failures with various strength of an attack.","author":["Jae-Won Jang","Jongsun Park","Swaroop Ghosh","Swarup Bhunia"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 77","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744909"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"Driskill-Smith, A.

To aid such understanding, this paper presents a detailed microarchitectural analysis of live datacenter jobs, measured on more than 20,000 Google machines over a three year period, and comprising thousands of different applications. We first find that WSC workloads are extremely diverse, breeding the need for architectures that can tolerate application variability without performance loss. However, some patterns emerge, offering opportunities for co-optimization of hardware and software. For example, we identify common building blocks in the lower levels of the software stack. This \"datacenter tax\" can comprise nearly 30% of cycles across jobs running in the fleet, which makes its constituents prime candidates for hardware specialization in future server systems-on-chips. We also uncover opportunities for classic microarchitectural optimizations for server processors, especially in the cache hierarchy. Typical workloads place significant stress on instruction caches and prefer memory latency over bandwidth. They also stall cores often, but compute heavily in bursts. These observations motivate several interesting directions for future warehouse-scale computers.","author":["Svilen Kanev","Juan Pablo Darago","Kim Hazelwood","Parthasarathy Ranganathan","Tipp Moseley","Gu-Yeon Wei","David Brooks"],"issue":["ISCA '15: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2015","Pages   158\u2013169","https://doi.org/10.1145/2749469.2750392"],"date":"13 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"David G Andersen, Jason Franklin, Michael Kaminsky, Amar Phanishayee, Lawrence Tan, and Vijay Vasudevan.

Given a user's purchase history, usually a sequence of transaction data, one attempts to build a recommender that can predict the next few items that the user most probably would like. Ideally, a good recommender should be able to explore the sequential behavior (i.e., buying one item leads to buying another next), as well as account for users' general taste (i.e., what items a user is typically interested in) for recommendation. Moreover, these two factors may interact with each other to influence users' next purchase. To tackle the above problems, in this paper, we introduce a novel recommendation approach, namely hierarchical representation model (HRM). HRM can well capture both sequential behavior and users' general taste by involving transaction and user representations in prediction. Meanwhile, the flexibility of applying different aggregation operations, especially nonlinear operations, on representations allows us to model complicated interactions among different factors. Theoretically, we show that our model subsumes several existing methods when choosing proper aggregation operations. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art baselines under different evaluation metrics on real-world transaction data.","author":["Pengfei Wang","Jiafeng Guo","Yanyan Lan","Jun Xu","Shengxian Wan","Xueqi Cheng"],"issue":["SIGIR '15: Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2015","Pages   403\u2013412","https://doi.org/10.1145/2766462.2767694"],"date":"09 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"G.

Feature selection is effective in preparing high-dimensional data for data analytics. The characteristics of social media present novel challenges for feature selection. First, social media data is not fully structured and its features are usually not predefined, but are generated dynamically. For example, in Twitter, slang words (features) are created everyday and quickly become popular within a short period of time. It is hard to directly apply traditional batch-mode feature selection methods to find such features. Second, given the nature of social media, label information is costly to collect. It exacerbates the problem of feature selection without knowing feature relevance. On the other hand, opportunities are also unequivocally present with additional data sources; for example, link information is ubiquitous in social media and could be helpful in selecting relevant features. In this paper, we study a novel problem to conduct unsupervised streaming feature selection for social media data. We investigate how to exploit link information in streaming feature selection, resulting in a novel unsupervised streaming feature selection framework USFS. Experimental results on two real-world social media datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework comparing with the state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection algorithms.","author":["Jundong Li","Xia Hu","Jiliang Tang","Huan Liu"],"issue":["CIKM '15: Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2015","Pages   1041\u20131050","https://doi.org/10.1145/2806416.2806501"],"date":"17 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"C.

Especially in a security context, they must be well distributed and unpredictable. We investigate the practical use of random number generators (RNGs) that are built from digital elements found in FPGAs. For this, we implement different types of ring oscillators (ROs) and memory collision-based circuits on FPGAs from major vendors. Implementing RNGs on the same device as the rest of the system benefits an overall reduction of vulnerability to attacks and wire tapping. Nevertheless, we investigate different attacks by tampering with power supply, chip temperature, and by exposition to strong magnetic fields and X-radiation. We also consider their usability as massively deployed components, whose functionality cannot be tested individually anymore, by conducting a technology invariance experiment. Our experiments show that BlockRAM-based RNGs cannot be considered as a suitable entropy source. We further show that RO-based RNGs work reliably under a wide range of operating conditions. While magnetic fields and X-rays did not induce any notable change, voltage and temperature variations caused an increase in propagation delays within the circuits. We show how reliable RNGs can be constructed and deployed on FPGAs.","author":["Michael Raitza","Markus Vogt","Christian Hochberger","Thilo Pionteck"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 9","Issue 2","February 2016","Article No.: 15","pp   1\u201321","https://doi.org/10.1145/2807699"],"date":"04 December 2015","ref":[{"text":"Lawrence E.

The UAP supports a wide range of existing finite automata models (DFAs, NFAs, A-DFAs, JFAs, counting-DFAs, and counting-NFAs), and future novel FA models. Evaluation on realistic workloads shows that UAP implements all models efficiently, achieving line rates 94.5% of ideal. A single UAP lane delivers line rates 50x greater than software approaches on CPUs and GPUs. Scaling UAP to 64 lanes achieves FA transition throughputs as high as 295 Gbps, more than 100x higher than CPUs and GPUs, and even exceeding ASIC approaches such as IBM's RegX by 6x. With efficient support for multiple input streams, UAP achieves throughputs that saturate even high speed stacked DRAM memory systems. The UAP design and implementation is efficient in instructions executed, memory references, and energy. UAP achieves a 1.2 Ghz clock rate (32nm TSMC CMOS), and a 64-lane UAP requires only 2.2 mm2 and 563 mW. At these levels of performance and energy-efficiency, UAP is a promising candidate for integration into general-purpose computing architectures.","author":["Yuanwei Fang","Tung T.

Besides the common users, social networks providing similar services can also share many other kinds of information entities, e.g., locations, videos and products. However, these shared information entities in different networks are mostly isolated without any known corresponding connections. In this paper, we aim at inferring such potential corresponding connections linking multiple kinds of shared entities across networks simultaneously. Formally, the problem is referred to as the network \"Partial Co-alignmenT\" (PCT) problem. PCT is an important problem and can be the prerequisite for many concrete cross-network applications, like social network fusion, mutual information exchange and transfer. Meanwhile, the PCT problem is also very challenging to address due to various reasons, like (1) the heterogeneity of social networks, (2) lack of training instances to build models, and (3) one-to-one constraint on the correspondence connections. To resolve these challenges, a novel unsupervised network alignment framework, UNICOAT (UNsupervIsed COncurrent AlignmenT)), is introduced in this paper. Based on the heterogeneous information, UNICOAT transforms the PCT problem into a joint optimization problem. To solve the objective function, the one-to-one constraint on the corresponding relationships is relaxed, and the redundant non-existing corresponding connections introduced by such a relaxation will be pruned with a novel network co-matching algorithm proposed in this paper. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world co-aligned social network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of UNICOAT in addressing the PCT problem.","author":["Jiawei Zhang","Philip S.

Often, this configurability renders the analysis of every individual system configuration infeasible. To address this problem, researchers have proposed a diverse set of sampling algorithms. We present a comparative study of 10 state-of-the-art sampling algorithms regarding their fault-detection capability and size of sample sets. The former is important to improve software quality and the latter to reduce the time of analysis. In a nutshell, we found that sampling algorithms with larger sample sets are able to detect higher numbers of faults, but simple algorithms with small sample sets, such as most-enabled-disabled, are the most efficient in most contexts. Furthermore, we observed that the limiting assumptions made in previous work influence the number of detected faults, the size of sample sets, and the ranking of algorithms. Finally, we have identified a number of technical challenges when trying to avoid the limiting assumptions, which questions the practicality of certain sampling algorithms.","author":["Fl\u00e1vio Medeiros","Christian K\u00e4stner","M\u00e1rcio Ribeiro","Rohit Gheyi","Sven Apel"],"issue":["ICSE '16: Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Software Engineering","May 2016","Pages   643\u2013654","https://doi.org/10.1145/2884781.2884793"],"date":"14 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"I.

In this article, we present a survey of techniques for approximate computing (AC). We discuss strategies for finding approximable program portions and monitoring output quality, techniques for using AC in different processing units (e.g., CPU, GPU, and FPGA), processor components, memory technologies, and so forth, as well as programming frameworks for AC. We classify these techniques based on several key characteristics to emphasize their similarities and differences. The aim of this article is to provide insights to researchers into working of AC techniques and inspire more efforts in this area to make AC the mainstream computing approach in future systems.","author":["Sparsh Mittal"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 48","Issue 4","May 2016","Article No.: 62","pp   1\u201333","https://doi.org/10.1145/2893356"],"date":"18 March 2016","ref":[{"text":"Ismail Akturk, Karen Khatamifard, and Ulya R.

Halide programmers need only provide a high-level strategy for mapping an image processing pipeline to a parallel machine (a schedule), and the Halide compiler carries out the mechanical task of generating platform-specific code that implements the schedule. Unfortunately, designing high-performance schedules for complex image processing pipelines requires substantial knowledge of modern hardware architecture and code-optimization techniques. In this paper we provide an algorithm for automatically generating high-performance schedules for Halide programs. Our solution extends the function bounds analysis already present in the Halide compiler to automatically perform locality and parallelism-enhancing global program transformations typical of those employed by expert Halide developers. The algorithm does not require costly (and often impractical) auto-tuning, and, in seconds, generates schedules for a broad set of image processing benchmarks that are performance-competitive with, and often better than, schedules manually authored by expert Halide developers on server and mobile CPUs, as well as GPUs.","author":["Ravi Teja Mullapudi","Andrew Adams","Dillon Sharlet","Jonathan Ragan-Kelley","Kayvon Fatahalian"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 35","Issue 4","July 2016","Article No.: 83","pp   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897824.2925952"],"date":"11 July 2016","ref":[{"text":"Adams, A., Talvala, E.-V., Park, S.

Cache plays an important role and highly affects the number of write backs to NVM and DRAM blocks. However, existing cache policies fail to fully address the significant asymmetry between NVM operations (especially writes) and DRAM operations, leading to non-optimal system designs. We propose a write-back aware last-level cache management scheme for the hybrid main memory, which improves the cache hit ratio of NVM memory blocks and minimizes write-backs to NVM. Experimental results show that our proposed framework leads to better performance and energy saving compared with the state-of-the-art cache management scheme for hybrid main memory architecture.","author":["Deshan Zhang","Lei Ju","Mengying Zhao","Xiang Gao","Zhiping Jia"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 172","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898110"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"B.

In this paper, we demonstrate how lack of strong location authentication allows creation of software-based Sybil devices that expose crowdsourced map systems to a variety of security and privacy attacks. Our experiments show that a single Sybil device with limited resources can cause havoc on Waze, reporting false congestion and accidents and automatically rerouting user traffic. More importantly, we describe techniques to generate Sybil devices at scale, creating armies of virtual vehicles capable of remotely tracking precise movements for large user populations while avoiding detection. We propose a new approach to defend against Sybil devices based on co-location edges, authenticated records that attest to the one-time physical co-location of a pair of devices. Over time, co-location edges combine to form large proximity graphs that attest to physical interactions between devices, allowing scalable detection of virtual vehicles. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach using large-scale simulations, and discuss how they can be used to dramatically reduce the impact of attacks against crowdsourced mapping services.","author":["Gang Wang","Bolun Wang","Tianyi Wang","Ana Nika","Haitao Zheng","Ben Y.

The models utilize information about single terms in the query and documents as well as term sequences marked as entities by some entity-linking tool. The key principle of the language models is accounting, simultaneously, for the uncertainty inherent in the entity-markup process and the balance between using entity-based and term-based information. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the merits of using the language models for retrieval. For example, the performance transcends that of a state-of-the-art term proximity method. We also show that the language models can be effectively used for cluster-based document retrieval and query expansion.","author":["Hadas Raviv","Oren Kurland","David Carmel"],"issue":["SIGIR '16: Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","July 2016","Pages   65\u201374","https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2911508"],"date":"07 July 2016","ref":[{"text":"N.

An IR system gains from understanding a user need and from understanding documents, and hence being able to determine whether a document has information that satisfies the user need. Much of NLP is about the same thing: Natural language understanding aims to understand the meaning of questions and documents and meaning relationships. The exciting recent application of deep learning approaches in NLP has brought new tools for effectively understanding language semantics. In principle, there should be a lot of synergy, though in practice the concerns of IR on large systems and macro-scale understanding have tended to contrast with the emphasis in NLP on language structure and micro-scale understanding. My talk will emphasize the two topics of how NLP can contribute to understanding textual relationships and how deep learning approaches substantially aid in this goal. One basic -- and very successful tool -- has been the new generation of distributed word representations: neural word embeddings. However, beyond just word meanings, we need to understand how to compose the meanings of larger pieces of text. Two requirements for that are good ways to understand the structure of human language utterances and ways to compose their meanings. Deep learning methods can help for both tasks. Finally, we need to understand relationships between pieces of text, to be able to do tasks such as Natural Language Inference (or Recognizing Textual Entailment) and Question Answering, and I will look at some of our recent work in these areas, both with and without the help of neural networks","author":["Christopher Manning"],"issue":["SIGIR '16: Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","July 2016","Pages   1","https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2926732"],"date":"07 July 2016"},{"_id":"10.1145/2934583.2934642","title":"A Low Power Current-Mode Flash ADC with Spin Hall Effect based Multi-Threshold Comparator","abstract":"Current-mode Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) has drawn many attentions due to its high operating speed, power and ground noise immunity, and etc. However, 2n -- 1 comparators are required in traditional n-bit current-mode ADC design, leading to inevitable high power consumption and large chip area. In this work, we propose a low power and compact current mode Multi-Threshold Comparator (MTC) based on giant Spin Hall Effect (SHE). The two threshold currents of the proposed SHE-MTC are 200\u03bcA and 250\u03bcA with 1ns switching time, respectively. The proposed current-mode hybrid spin-CMOS flash ADC based on SHE-MTC reduces the number of comparators almost by half (2n-1), thus correspondingly reducing the required current mirror branches, total power consumption and chip area. Moreover, due to the non-volatility of SHE-MTC, the front-end analog circuits can be switched off when it is not required to further increase power efficiency. The device dynamics of SHE-MTC is simulated using a numerical device model based on Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation with Spin-Transfer Torque (STT) term and SHE term. The device-circuit co-simulation in SPICE (45nm CMOS technology) have shown that the average power dissipation of proposed ADC is 1.9mW, operating at 500MS/s with 1.2 V power supply. The INL and DNL are in the range of 0.23LSB and 0.32LSB, respectively.","author":["Zhezhi He","Deliang Fan"],"issue":["ISLPED '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","August 2016","Pages   314\u2013319","https://doi.org/10.1145/2934583.2934642"],"date":"08 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"C.

Since Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and ZigBee radios are widely available, this approach enables a backscatter design that works using only commodity devices. We build prototype backscatter hardware using an FPGA and experiment with various Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee devices. Our experiments show we can create 2--11~Mbps Wi-Fi standards-compliant signals by backscattering Bluetooth transmissions. To show the generality of our approach, we also demonstrate generation of standards-complaint ZigBee signals by backscattering Bluetooth transmissions. Finally, we build proof-of-concepts for previously infeasible applications including the first contact lens form-factor antenna prototype and an implantable neural recording interface that communicate directly with commodity devices such as smartphones and watches, thus enabling the vision of Internet connected implanted devices.","author":["Vikram Iyer","Vamsi Talla","Bryce Kellogg","Shyamnath Gollakota","Joshua Smith"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGCOMM Conference","August 2016","Pages   356\u2013369","https://doi.org/10.1145/2934872.2934894"],"date":"22 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"Altera de1 fpga development board. http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?No=83.","order":1},{"text":"Atheros targets cellphone with wi-fi chip. http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1172134.","order":2},{"text":"Cadence rfspectre. http://www.cadence.com/products/rf/spectre_rf_simulation/pages/default.aspx.","order":3},{"text":"Fcc id value: 2abz2-a0001. https://www.fcc.gov/general/fcc-id-search-page.","order":4},{"text":"Fcc id value: A3lsmg920f. https://www.fcc.gov/general/fcc-id-search-page.","order":5},{"text":"Fcc id value: A3lsmn920i. https://www.fcc.gov/general/fcc-id-search-page.","order":6},{"text":"Fcc id value: Bcg-e2817a. https://www.fcc.gov/general/fcc-id-search-page.","order":7},{"text":"Hms190bms8 by hittite microwave devices. https://www.hittite.com/content/documents/data_sheet/hmc190bms8.pdf.","order":8},{"text":"Nasa news release: A wi-fi reflector chip to speed up wearables. http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4663.","order":9},{"text":"Rfid uhf portable mini reader writer. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00W9IUALK.","order":10},{"text":"Synopsis design complier. http://www.synopsys.com/Tools/Implementation/RTLSynthesis/DesignCompiler/Pages/default.aspx.","order":11},{"text":"Ti cc2650. http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/CC2650F128RHBR/CC2650F128RHBR-ND/5189550.","order":12},{"text":"Epc radio-frequency identity protocols class-1 generation-2 uhf rfid protocol for communications at 860 mhz-960mhz version 1.2.0, 2008. http://www.gs1.org/sites/default/files/docs/epc/uhfc1g2_1_2_0-standard-20080511.pdf.","order":13},{"text":"Man, machine and in between.","order":14},{"text":"A 100-channel hermetically sealed implantable device for wireless neurosensing applications.

So far, however, the understanding of how M-MIMO could affect the performance of network control and optimization algorithms remains rather limited. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the performance of the queue-length-based joint congestion control and scheduling framework (QCS) over M-MIMO cellular networks with limited channel state information (CSI). Our contributions in this paper are two-fold: i) We characterize the scaling performance of the queue-lengths and show that there exists a phase transitioning phenomenon in the steady-state queue-length deviation respect to the CSI quality (reflected in the number of bits B that represent CSI); and ii) We characterize the congestion control rate scaling performance and show that there also exists a phase transitioning phenomenon in steady-state congestion control rate deviation respect to the CSI quality. Collectively, the findings in this paper advance our understanding of the trade-offs between delay, throughput, and the accuracy/complexity of CSI acquisition in M-MIMO cellular network systems.","author":["Jia Liu","Atilla Eryilmaz","Ness B.

We demonstrate that indiscriminately storing encoded images in approximate memory generates unacceptable and uncontrollable quality degradation. The key finding is that errors in the encoded bit streams have non-uniform impact on the decoded image quality. We develop a methodology to determine the relative importance of encoded bits and store them in an approximate storage substrate. The storage cells are optimized to reduce error rate via biasing and are tuned to meet the desired reliability requirement via selective error correction. In a case study with the progressive transform codec (PTC), a precursor to JPEG XR, the proposed approximate image storage system exhibits a 2.7x increase in density of pixels per silicon volume under bounded error rates, and this achievement is additive to the storage savings of PTC compression.","author":["Qing Guo","Karin Strauss","Luis Ceze","Henrique S.

The low speed of these networks may hinder real-time applications especially when computational resources are limited. In this paper, an efficient and effective approach is proposed to accelerate the test-phase computation of CNNs based on low-rank and group sparse tensor decomposition. Specifically, for each convolutional layer, the kernel tensor is decomposed into the sum of a small number of low multilinear rank tensors. Then we replace the original kernel tensors in all layers with the approximate tensors and fine-tune the whole net with respect to the final classification task using standard backpropagation. \\\\ Comprehensive experiments on ILSVRC-12 demonstrate significant reduction in computational complexity, at the cost of negligible loss in accuracy. For the widely used VGG-16 model, our approach obtains a 6.6$\\times$ speed-up on PC and 5.91$\\times$ speed-up on mobile device of the whole network with less than 1\\% increase on top-5 error.","author":["Peisong Wang","Jian Cheng"],"issue":["MM '16: Proceedings of the 24th ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2016","Pages   541\u2013545","https://doi.org/10.1145/2964284.2967280"],"date":"01 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"L.

In P-DMFBs, electrodes and control lines are printed on a piece of photo paper using inkjet printer and conductive ink of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Compared with traditional digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs), P-DMFBs enjoy notable advantages, such as faster in-place fabrication with printer and ink, lower costs, better disposability, etc. Because electrodes and CNT control lines are printed on the same side of a paper, a new design challenge for P-DMFB is to prevent the interference between moving droplets and the voltages on CNT control lines. These interactions may result in unexpected droplet movements and thus incorrect assay outputs. To address the new challenges in automated design of P-DMFBs, this paper proposes the first control-fluidic codesign flow, which simultaneously adjusts the control line routing and fluidic droplet scheduling to achieve an optimized solution. As the control line routing may not be able to address all the interferences between moving droplets and the voltages on control lines, droplet rescheduling is performed to effectively deal with the remaining interferences in the routing solution. Computational simulation results on real-life bioassays show that the proposed codesign method successfully eliminates all the interferences, while a state-of-the-art maze routing method cannot solve any of the benchmarks without conflicts.","author":["Qin Wang","Zeyan Li","Haena Cheong","Oh-Sun Kwon","Hailong Yao","Tsung-Yi Ho","Kwanwoo Shin","Bing Li","Ulf Schlichtmann","Yici Cai"],"issue":["ICCAD '16: Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2016","Article No.: 103","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967018"],"date":"07 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"H.

Memory based PUF implementations are an attractive option due to the ubiquitous nature of memory in electronic devices and the requirement of minimal (or no) additional circuitry. DRAM based PUFs are particularly advantageous due to their large address space and multiple controllable parameters during response generation. However, prior works on DRAM PUFs use a static response generation mechanism making them vulnerable to security attacks. Further, they result in very slow device authentication, are not applicable to off-the-shelf DRAM modules, or require DRAM power cycling prior to authentication. In this paper, we propose D-PUF, an intrinsically reconfigurable DRAM PUF based on refresh pausing. A key feature of the proposed DRAM PUF is that it can be reconfigured by varying the refresh-pause interval, which changes it's challenge-response behavior, making it robust against various attacks. We use the PUF to design a secure, low-overhead methodology for performing device authentication. The design is implemented and validated using an Altera Stratix IV GX FPGA based Terasic TR4-230 development board and several off-the-shelf 1GB DDR3 DRAM modules. Our experimental results demonstrate a 4.3\u00d7-6.4\u00d7 reduction in authentication time, compared to previous work. Using controlled temperature and accelerated aging tests, we also demonstrate the robustness of our authentication mechanism to temperature variations and aging effects.","author":["Soubhagya Sutar","Arnab Raha","Vijay Raghunathan"],"issue":["CASES '16: Proceedings of the International Conference on Compilers, Architectures and Synthesis for Embedded Systems","October 2016","Article No.: 12","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2968455.2968519"],"date":"01 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"U.

A new test is generated by slightly mutating a seed input. If the test exercises a new and interesting path, it is added to the set of seeds; otherwise, it is discarded. We observe that most tests exercise the same few \"high-frequency\" paths and develop strategies to explore significantly more paths with the same number of tests by gravitating towards low-frequency paths. We explain the challenges and opportunities of CGF using a Markov chain model which specifies the probability that fuzzing the seed that exercises path i generates an input that exercises path j. Each state (i.e., seed) has an energy that specifies the number of inputs to be generated from that seed. We show that CGF is considerably more efficient if energy is inversely proportional to the density of the stationary distribution and increases monotonically every time that seed is chosen. Energy is controlled with a power schedule. We implemented the exponential schedule by extending AFL. In 24 hours, AFLFAST exposes 3 previously unreported CVEs that are not exposed by AFL and exposes 6 previously unreported CVEs 7x faster than AFL. AFLFAST produces at least an order of magnitude more unique crashes than AFL.","author":["Marcel B\u00f6hme","Van-Thuan Pham","Abhik Roychoudhury"],"issue":["CCS '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2016","Pages   1032\u20131043","https://doi.org/10.1145/2976749.2978428"],"date":"24 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"F.

However, the strong PUF with numerous Challenge and Response Pairs (CRPs), e.g. the arbiter PUF, is vulnerable to modeling attacks. There are two major kinds of countermeasures. One is restricting CRP access interface, such as controlled PUF and XOR arbiter PUF, which unfortunately has been broken with the help of side-channels. The other is using non-linear electronic characteristics to produce CRPs, such as the current mirror PUF and the voltage transfer PUF. They are only proved to be resistant to SVM based attack, while no more analysis is further explored so far. In this paper, we propose an attack method based on compound heuristic algorithms of evolution strategy, simulated annealing, and ant colony to efficiently attack these two non-linear PUFs. This paper reveals that current mirror and voltage transfer are still not able to help strong PUF resist attacks.

Standard text based IR models provide no easy way of representing semantic relations between terms that are not necessarily phrases, such as the equivalence relationship between `osteoporosis' and the terms `bone' and `decay'. To alleviate this limitation, we introduce a relevance feedback (RF) method which makes use of word embedded vectors. We leverage the fact that the vector addition of word embeddings leads to a semantic composition of the corresponding terms, e.g. addition of the vectors for `bone' and `decay' yields a vector that is likely to be close to the vector for the word `osteoporosis'. Our proposed RF model enables incorporation of semantic relations by exploiting term compositionality with embedded word vectors. We develop our model for RF as a generalization of the relevance model (RLM). Our experiments demonstrate that our word embedding based RF model significantly outperforms the RLM model on standard TREC test collections, namely the TREC 6,7,8 and Robust ad-hoc and the TREC 9 and 10 WT10G test collections.","author":["Dwaipayan Roy","Debasis Ganguly","Mandar Mitra","Gareth J.F.

To achieve large capacity as well as energy-efficiency, it is necessary to use both DRAM and STT-MRAM for the main memory of a computer. In this paper, we propose a hypervisor-based hybrid memory mechanism (RAMinate) that reduces write traffic to STT-MRAM by optimizing page locations between DRAM and STT-MRAM. In contrast to past studies, our mechanism works at the hypervisor level, not at the hardware or operating system level. It does not require any special program at the operating system level nor any design changes of the current memory controller at the hardware level. We developed a prototype of the proposed system by extending Qemu/KVM and conducted experiments with application benchmarks. We confirmed that our page replacement mechanism successfully worked for unmodified operating systems and dynamically diverted memory write traffic to DRAM. Our experiments also confirmed that our system successfully reduced write traffic to STT-MRAM by approximately 70% for tested workloads, which results in a 50% reduction in energy consumption in comparison to a DRAM-only system.","author":["Takahiro Hirofuchi","Ryousei Takano"],"issue":["SoCC '16: Proceedings of the Seventh ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing","October 2016","Pages   112\u2013125","https://doi.org/10.1145/2987550.2987570"],"date":"05 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"Siege. http://www.joedog.org/siege-home.","order":1},{"text":"N.

As datasets grow from petabytes to exabytes and beyond, it becomes increasingly difficult to run advanced analytics, especially Machine Learning (ML) applications, in a reasonable time and on a practical power budget using traditional architectures. Previous work has focused on accelerating analytics readily implemented as SQL queries on data-parallel platforms, generally using off-the-shelf CPUs and General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) for computation or acceleration. However, these systems are general-purpose and still require a vast amount of data transfer between the storage devices and computing elements, thus limiting the system efficiency. As an alternative, this article presents a reconfigurable memory-centric advanced analytics accelerator that operates at the last level of memory and dramatically reduces energy required for data transfer. We functionally validate the framework using an FPGA-based hardware emulation platform and three representative applications: Na\u00efve Bayesian Classification, Convolutional Neural Networks, and k-Means Clustering. Results are compared with implementations on a modern CPU and workstation GPGPU. Finally, the use of in-memory dataset decompression to further reduce data transfer volume is investigated. With these techniques, the system achieves an average energy efficiency improvement of 74\u00d7 and 212\u00d7 over GPU and single-threaded CPU, respectively, while dataset compression is shown to improve overall efficiency by an additional 1.8\u00d7 on average.","author":["Robert Karam","Somnath Paul","Ruchir Puri","Swarup Bhunia"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 13","Issue 3","May 2017","Article No.: 34","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/2997649"],"date":"01 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"Altera. 2016.

On one hand, the convenience of offering certain services via drones is attractive. On the other hand, the mere operation of these airborne machines, which rely heavily on their cyber capabilities, poses great threats to people and property. Also, while the Federal Aviation Administration NextGen project aims to integrate civilian drones into the national airspace, the regulation is still a work-in-progress and does not cope with their threats. This article surveys the main security, privacy, and safety aspects associated with the use of civilian drones in the national airspace. In particular, we identify both the physical and cyber threats of such systems and discuss the security properties required by their critical operation environment. We also identify the research challenges and possible future directions in the fields of civilian drone security, safety, and privacy. Based on our investigation, we forecast that security will be a central enabling technology for the next generation of civilian unmanned aerial vehicles.","author":["Riham Altawy","Amr M.

In particular, for a dataset without any negative entries, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is often used to find a low-rank approximation by the product of two nonnegative matrices. With reduced dimensions, these matrices can be effectively used for many applications such as clustering. The existing methods of NMF are often afflicted with their sensitivity to outliers and noise in the data. To mitigate this drawback, in this paper, we consider integrating NMF into a robust principal component model, and design a robust formulation that effectively captures noise and outliers in the approximation while incorporating essential nonlinear structures. A set of comprehensive empirical evaluations in clustering applications demonstrates that the proposed method has strong robustness to gross errors and superior performance to current state-of-the-art methods.","author":["Chong Peng","Zhao Kang","Yunhong Hu","Jie Cheng","Qiang Cheng"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data","Volume 11","Issue 3","April 2017","Article No.: 33","pp   1\u201330","https://doi.org/10.1145/3003730"],"date":"06 March 2017","ref":[{"text":"Sanjeev Arora, Rong Ge, Ravindran Kannan, and Ankur Moitra. 2012.

Our model relies on the use of semantic linking systems for forming a graph representation of documents and queries, where nodes represent concepts extracted from documents and edges represent semantic relatedness between concepts. Based on this graph, our model adopts a probabilistic reasoning model for calculating the conditional probability of a query concept given values assigned to document concepts. We present an integration framework for interpolating other retrieval systems with the presented model in this paper. Our empirical experiments on a number of TREC collections show that the semantic retrieval has a synergetic impact on the results obtained through state of the art keyword-based approaches, and the consideration of semantic information obtained from entity linking on queries and documents can complement and enhance the performance of other retrieval models.","author":["Faezeh Ensan","Ebrahim Bagheri"],"issue":["WSDM '17: Proceedings of the Tenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","February 2017","Pages   181\u2013190","https://doi.org/10.1145/3018661.3018692"],"date":"02 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"B.

FPGAs are well known to be able to perform convolutions efficiently, however, most recent efforts to run CNNs on FPGAs have shown limited advantages over other devices such as GPUs. Previous approaches on FPGAs have often been memory bound due to the limited external memory bandwidth on the FPGA device. We show a novel architecture written in OpenCL(TM), which we refer to as a Deep Learning Accelerator (DLA), that maximizes data reuse and minimizes external memory bandwidth. Furthermore, we show how we can use the Winograd transform to significantly boost the performance of the FPGA. As a result, when running our DLA on Intel's Arria 10 device we can achieve a performance of 1020 img/s, or 23 img/s/W when running the AlexNet CNN benchmark. This comes to 1382 GFLOPs and is 10x faster with 8.4x more GFLOPS and 5.8x better efficiency than the state-of-the-art on FPGAs. Additionally, 23 img/s/W is competitive against the best publicly known implementation of AlexNet on nVidia's TitanX GPU.","author":["Utku Aydonat","Shane O'Connell","Davor Capalija","Andrew C.

Approximate storage can ease this demand by enabling denser storage at the expense of occasional errors. Unfortunately, even minor storage errors, such as bit flips, can result in major visual damage in encoded videos. Similarly, video encryption, widely employed for privacy and digital rights management, may create long dependencies between bits that show little or no tolerance to storage errors. In this paper we propose VideoApp, a novel and efficient methodology to compute bit-level reliability requirements for encoded videos by tracking visual and metadata dependencies within encoded bitstreams. We further show how VideoApp can be used to trade video quality for storage density in an optimal way. We integrate our methodology into a popular H.264 encoder to partition an encoded video stream into multiple streams that can receive different levels of error correction according to their reliability needs. When applied to a dense and highly error-prone multi-level cell storage substrate, our variable error correction mechanism reduces the error correction overhead by half under the most error-intolerant encoder settings, achieving quality/density points that neither compression nor approximation can achieve alone. Finally, we define the basic invariants needed to support encrypted approximate video storage. We present an analysis of block cipher modes of operation, showing that some are fully compatible with approximation, enabling approximate and secure video storage systems.","author":["Djordje Jevdjic","Karin Strauss","Luis Ceze","Henrique S.

Those algorithms are local in the sense that they only query a small number of entries of the corrupted codeword. The fundamental question about LCCs and LTCs is to determine the optimal tradeoff among their rate, distance, and query complexity.In this work, we construct the first LCCs and LTCs with constant rate, constant relative distance, and sub-polynomial query complexity. Specifically, we show that there exist LCCs and LTCs with block length n, constant rate (which can even be taken arbitrarily close to 1), and constant relative distance, whose query complexity is exp(\u00d5(\u221alog n)) (for LCCs) and (log n)O(log log n) (for LTCs).In addition to having small query complexity, our codes also achieve better tradeoffs between the rate and the relative distance than were previously known to be achievable by LCCs or LTCs. Specifically, over large (but constant size) alphabet, our codes approach the Singleton bound, that is, they have almost the best-possible relationship between their rate and distance. Over the binary alphabet, our codes meet the Zyablov bound. Such tradeoffs between the rate and the relative distance were previously not known for any o(n) query complexity. Our results on LCCs also immediately give locally decodable codes with the same parameters.","author":["Swastik Kopparty","Or Meir","Noga Ron-Zewi","Shubhangi Saraf"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 64","Issue 2","June 2017","Article No.: 11","pp   1\u201342","https://doi.org/10.1145/3051093"],"date":"25 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"Noga Alon, Jehoshua Bruck, Joseph Naor, Moni Naor, and Ron M.

There exist different algorithms for CNNs computation. In this paper, we explore conventional convolution algorithm with a faster algorithm using Winograd's minimal filtering theory for efficient FPGA implementation. Distinct from the conventional convolution algorithm, Winograd algorithm uses less computing resources but puts more pressure on the memory bandwidth. We first propose a fusion architecture that can fuse multiple layers naturally in CNNs, reusing the intermediate data. Based on this fusion architecture, we explore heterogeneous algorithms to maximize the throughput of a CNN. We design an optimal algorithm to determine the fusion and algorithm strategy for each layer. We also develop an automated toolchain to ease the mapping from Caffe model to FPGA bitstream using Vivado HLS. Experiments using widely used VGG and AlexNet demonstrate that our design achieves up to 1.99X performance speedup compared to the prior fusion-based FPGA accelerator for CNNs.","author":["Qingcheng Xiao","Yun Liang","Liqiang Lu","Shengen Yan","Yu-Wing Tai"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 62","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062244"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"M.

In this paper, we propose RESPARC - a reconfigurable and energy efficient architecture built-on Memristive Crossbar Arrays (MCA) for deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Prior works were primarily focused on device and circuit implementations of SNNs on crossbars. RESPARC advances this by proposing a complete system for SNN acceleration and its subsequent analysis. RESPARC utilizes the energy-efficiency of MCAs for inner-product computation and realizes a hierarchical reconfigurable design to incorporate the data-flow patterns in an SNN in a scalable fashion. We evaluate the proposed architecture on different SNNs ranging in complexity from 2k-230k neurons and 1.2M-5.5M synapses. Simulation results on these networks show that compared to the baseline digital CMOS architecture, RESPARC achieves 500x (15x) efficiency in energy benefits at 300x (60x) higher throughput for multi-layer perceptrons (deep convolutional networks). Furthermore, RESPARC is a technology-aware architecture that maps a given SNN topology to the most optimized MCA size for the given crossbar technology.","author":["Aayush Ankit","Abhronil Sengupta","Priyadarshini Panda","Kaushik Roy"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 27","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062311"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

The erase-free scheme brings tons of benefits to flash memory performance and endurance. For example, the erase-free scheme could reclaim invalid (page) space without physically erasing a flash block. However, current flash management designs could not fully exploit the benefits of the erase-free scheme. With the considerations of the features of the erase-free scheme, this paper is the first work to propose a novel flash management design, namely VirtualGC strategy, to deal with the erase-free garbage collection process. By taking the advantages of the erase-free scheme, the proposed strategy reduces the overhead of copying live pages so as to increase flash memory performance. The results show that the proposed strategy significantly improves the performance of rewritable 3D flash memory drives.","author":["Tseng-Yi Chen","Yuan-Hao Chang","Yuan-Hung Kuan","Yu-Ming Chang"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 25","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062339"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Y.

While recent work showed how to port applications and large-scale computations to run under SGX, the performance implications of using the technology remains an open question. We present the first comprehensive quantitative study to evaluate the performance of SGX. We show that straightforward use of SGX library primitives for calling functions add between 8,200 - 17,000 cycles overhead, compared to 150 cycles of a typical system call. We quantify the performance impact of these library calls and show that in applications with high system calls frequency, such as memcached, openVPN, and lighttpd, which all have high bandwidth network requirements, the performance degradation may be as high as 79%. We investigate the sources of this performance degradation by leveraging a new set of microbenchmarks for SGX-specific operations such as enclave entry-calls and out-calls, and encrypted memory I/O accesses. We leverage the insights we gain from these analyses to design a new SGX interface framework HotCalls. HotCalls are based on a synchronization spin-lock mechanism and provide a 13-27x speedup over the default interface. It can easily be integrated into existing code, making it a practical solution. Compared to a baseline SGX implementation of memcached, openVPN, and lighttpd - we show that using the new interface boosts the throughput by 2.6-3.7x, and reduces application latency by 62-74%.","author":["Ofir Weisse","Valeria Bertacco","Todd Austin"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   81\u201393","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080208"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"http_load - multiprocessing http test client. http://acme.com/software/http_load/.","order":1},{"text":"SGX Secure Enclaves in Practice: Security and Crypto Review.

Many works have been developed upon Dally's theory proving that a network is deadlock-free if there is no cyclic dependency on the channel dependency graph. However, finding such acyclic graph has been very challenging, which limits Dally's theory to networks with a low number of channels. In this paper, we introduce three theorems that directly lead to routing algorithms with an acyclic channel dependency graph. We also propose the partitioning methodology, enabling a design to reach the maximum adaptiveness for the n-dimensional mesh and k-ary n-cube topologies with any given number of channels. In addition, deadlock-free routing algorithms can be derived ranging from maximally fully adaptive routing down to deterministic routing. The proposed theorems can drastically remove the difficulties of designing deadlock-free routing algorithms.","author":["Masoumeh Ebrahimi","Masoud Daneshtalab"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   703\u2013715","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080253"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Giuseppe Ascia, Vincenzo Catania, Maurizio Palesi, and Davide Patti. 2008.

Though the computation latency can be reduced using hardware, big data processing cost is dominated by data transfers. In this article, we propose a low overhead framework based on compressive sensing (CS) to reduce data transfers up to 67% without affecting signal quality. CS has two important kernels: \u201csensing\u201d and \u201creconstruction.\u201d In this article, we focus on CS reconstruction is using orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm. We implement the OMP CS reconstruction algorithm on a domain-specific PENC many-core platform and a low-power Jetson TK1 platform consisting of an ARM CPU and a K1 GPU. Detailed performance analysis of OMP algorithm on each platform suggests that the PENC many-core platform has 15\u00d7 and 18\u00d7 less energy consumption and 16\u00d7 and 8\u00d7 faster reconstruction time as compared to the low-power ARM CPU and K1 GPU, respectively. Furthermore, we implement the proposed CS-based framework on heterogeneous architecture, in which the PENC many-core architecture is used as an \u201caccelerator\u201d and processing is performed on the ARM CPU platform. For demonstration, we integrate the proposed CS-based framework with a hadoop MapReduce platform for a face detection application. The results show that the proposed CS-based framework with the PENC many-core as an accelerator achieves a 26.15% data storage/transfer reduction, with an execution time and energy consumption overhead of 3.7% and 0.002%, respectively, for 5,000 image transfers. Compared to the CS-based framework implementation on the low-power Jetson TK1 ARM CPU+GPU platform, the PENC many-core implementation is 2.3\u00d7 faster for the image reconstruction part, while achieving 29% higher performance and 34% better energy efficiency for the complete face detection application on the Hadoop MapReduce platform.","author":["Amey Kulkarni","Colin Shea","Tahmid Abtahi","Houman Homayoun","Tinoosh Mohsenin"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 17","Issue 1","January 2018","Article No.: 25","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/3092944"],"date":"06 December 2017","ref":[{"text":"2016.

In this paper, we propose the first relaxed memory model that (1) accounts for a broad spectrum of features from the C++11 concurrency model, (2) is implementable, in the sense that it provably validates many standard compiler optimizations and reorderings, as well as standard compilation schemes to x86-TSO and Power, (3) justifies simple invariant-based reasoning, thus demonstrating the absence of bad \"out-of-thin-air\" behaviors, (4) supports \"DRF\" guarantees, ensuring that programmers who use sufficient synchronization need not understand the full complexities of relaxed-memory semantics, and (5) defines the semantics of racy programs without relying on undefined behaviors, which is a prerequisite for applicability to type-safe languages like Java.  The key novel idea behind our model is the notion of *promises*: a thread may promise to execute a write in the future, thus enabling other threads to read from that write out of order. Crucially, to prevent out-of-thin-air behaviors, a promise step requires a thread-local certification that it will be possible to execute the promised write even in the absence of the promise. To establish confidence in our model, we have formalized most of our key results in Coq.","author":["Jeehoon Kang","Chung-Kil Hur","Ori Lahav","Viktor Vafeiadis","Derek Dreyer"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 52","Issue 1","January 2017","pp   175\u2013189","https://doi.org/10.1145/3093333.3009850"],"date":"01 January 2017","ref":[{"text":"Coq development and supplementary material for this paper available at: http://sf.snu.ac.kr/promise-concurrency.","order":1},{"text":"LLVM documentation.

Typically, those candidate articles are recommended manually by platform editors from a much larger pool of articles aggregated from multiple sources. Such a hand-pick process is labor intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we study the editor article selection behavior and propose a learning by demonstration system to automatically select a subset of articles from the large pool. Our data analysis shows that (i) editors' selection criteria are non-explicit, which are less based only on the keywords or topics, but more depend on the quality and attractiveness of the writing from the candidate article, which is hard to capture based on traditional bag-of-words article representation. And (ii) editors' article selection behaviors are dynamic: articles with different data distribution come into the pool everyday and the editors' preference varies, which are driven by some underlying periodic or occasional patterns. To address such problems, we propose a meta-attention model across multiple deep neural nets to (i) automatically catch the editors' underlying selection criteria via the automatic representation learning of each article and its interaction with the meta data and (ii) adaptively capture the change of such criteria via a hybrid attention model. The attention model strategically incorporates multiple prediction models, which are trained in previous days. The system has been deployed in a commercial article feed platform. A 9-day A/B testing has demonstrated the consistent superiority of our proposed model over several strong baselines.","author":["Xuejian Wang","Lantao Yu","Kan Ren","Guanyu Tao","Weinan Zhang","Yong Yu","Jun Wang"],"issue":["KDD '17: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2017","Pages   2051\u20132059","https://doi.org/10.1145/3097983.3098096"],"date":"13 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, and others 2016.

In a typical face verification method, feature normalization is a critical step for boosting performance. This motivates us to introduce and study the effect of normalization during training. But we find this is non-trivial, despite normalization being differentiable. We identify and study four issues related to normalization through mathematical analysis, which yields understanding and helps with parameter settings. Based on this analysis we propose two strategies for training using normalized features. The first is a modification of softmax loss, which optimizes cosine similarity instead of inner-product. The second is a reformulation of metric learning by introducing an agent vector for each class. We show that both strategies, and small variants, consistently improve performance by between 0.2% to 0.4% on the LFW dataset based on two models. This is significant because the performance of the two models on LFW dataset is close to saturation at over 98%.","author":["Feng Wang","Xiang Xiang","Jian Cheng","Alan Loddon Yuille"],"issue":["MM '17: Proceedings of the 25th ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2017","Pages   1041\u20131049","https://doi.org/10.1145/3123266.3123359"],"date":"19 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton. 2016.

ETL workloads pose significant performance challenges on conventional architectures, so we propose the design of the unstructured data processor (UDP), a software programmable accelerator that includes multi-way dispatch, variable-size symbol support, Flexible-source dispatch (stream buffer and scalar registers), and memory addressing to accelerate ETL kernels both for current and novel future encoding and compression. Specifically, UDP excels at branch-intensive and symbol and pattern-oriented workloads, and can offload them from CPUs. To evaluate UDP, we use a broad set of data processing workloads inspired by ETL, but broad enough to also apply to query execution, stream processing, and intrusion detection/monitoring. A single UDP accelerates these data processing tasks 20-fold (geometric mean, largest increase from 0.4 GB/s to 40 GB/s) and performance per watt by a geomean of 1,900-fold. UDP ASIC implementation in 28nm CMOS shows UDP logic area of 3.82mm2 (8.69mm2 with 1MB local memory), and logic power of 0.149W (0.864W with 1MB local memory); both much smaller than a single core.","author":["Yuanwei Fang","Chen Zou","Aaron J.

Many models have been applied to the motor control and image stabilization in robots. Often computationally complex, cerebellar models have rarely been implemented in dedicated hardware. Here, we propose an efficient hardware design for cerebellar models using approximate circuits with a small area and a low power. Leveraging the inherent error tolerance in the cerebellum, approximate adders and multipliers are carefully evaluated for implementations in an adaptive filter based cerebellar model to achieve a good tradeoff in accuracy and hardware usage. A saccade system, whose vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is controlled by the cerebellum, is simulated to show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed design. Simulation results show that the approximate cerebellar circuit achieves a similar accuracy as an exact implementation, but it saves area by 29.7% and power by 37.3%.","author":["Honglan Jiang","Leibo Liu","Jie Han"],"issue":["CODES '17: Proceedings of the Twelfth IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis Companion","October 2017","Article No.: 31","Pages   1\u20132","https://doi.org/10.1145/3125502.3125537"],"date":"15 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"James S Albus. 1971.

In this paper we present our findings from the scientometric analysis of full papers from the HAI conference since its inception to date. We extracted various bibliometric measures and qualitatively coded our sample of 107 full papers over the 4 years of the conference. Our results show that the conference has not really grown rapidly and attracts papers from predominantly Asian Pacific regions. User studies were the common research methodology undertaken in HAI papers and humanoid robots are the popular agent of choice. Domains such as Education and Health were surprisingly underrepresented whereas communication was the focus of almost half of the papers. We also report on a mini comparison with the ICSR and IVA conference as a bench-marking strategy, which provides us with some reflections on how the HAI conference can be moved forward. In conclusion, we speculate on our findings and provide some insights to the organizers and steering committee of the HAI conference.","author":["Omar Mubin","Max Manalo","Muneeb Ahmad","Mohammad Obaid"],"issue":["HAI '17: Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Human Agent Interaction","October 2017","Pages   45\u201351","https://doi.org/10.1145/3125739.3125747"],"date":"27 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"2014.

The framework suggests an operational retrieval model that extends recent developments in the language modeling approach to information retrieval. A language model for each document is estimated, as well as a language model for each query, and the retrieval problem is cast in terms of risk minimization. The query language model can be exploited to model user preferences, the context of a query, synonomy and word senses. While recent work has incorporated word translation models for this purpose, we introduce a new method using Markov chains defined on a set of documents to estimate the query models. The Markov chain method has connections to algorithms from link analysis and social networks. The new approach is evaluated on TREC collections and compared to the basic language modeling approach and vector space models together with query expansion using Rocchio. Significant improvements are obtained over standard query expansion methods for strong baseline TF-IDF systems, with the greatest improvements attained for short queries on Web data.","author":["John Lafferty","Chengxiang Zhai"],"issue":["ACM SIGIR Forum","Volume 51","Issue 2","July 2017","pp   251\u2013259","https://doi.org/10.1145/3130348.3130375"],"date":"02 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

The write amplification problem is due to the Log-Structured Merge Trees data structure that underlies these key-value stores. To remedy this problem, this paper presents a novel data structure that is inspired by Skip Lists, termed Fragmented Log-Structured Merge Trees (FLSM). FLSM introduces the notion of guards to organize logs, and avoids rewriting data in the same level. We build PebblesDB, a high-performance key-value store, by modifying HyperLevelDB to use the FLSM data structure. We evaluate PebblesDB using micro-benchmarks and show that for write-intensive workloads, PebblesDB reduces write amplification by 2.4-3x compared to RocksDB, while increasing write throughput by 6.7x. We modify two widely-used NoSQL stores, MongoDB and HyperDex, to use PebblesDB as their underlying storage engine. Evaluating these applications using the YCSB benchmark shows that throughput is increased by 18-105% when using PebblesDB (compared to their default storage engines) while write IO is decreased by 35-55%.","author":["Pandian Raju","Rohan Kadekodi","Vijay Chidambaram","Ittai Abraham"],"issue":["SOSP '17: Proceedings of the 26th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","October 2017","Pages   497\u2013514","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132747.3132765"],"date":"14 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Ittai Abraham, James Aspnes, and Jian Yuan. 2005.

Previous work only considers the user's sequential behavior in the current session, whereas the user's main purpose in the current session is not emphasized. In this paper, we propose a novel neural networks framework, i.e., Neural Attentive Recommendation Machine (NARM), to tackle this problem. Specifically, we explore a hybrid encoder with an attention mechanism to model the user's sequential behavior and capture the user's main purpose in the current session, which are combined as a unified session representation later. We then compute the recommendation scores for each candidate item with a bi-linear matching scheme based on this unified session representation. We train NARM by jointly learning the item and session representations as well as their matchings. We carried out extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets. Our experimental results show that NARM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both datasets. Furthermore, we also find that NARM achieves a significant improvement on long sessions, which demonstrates its advantages in modeling the user's sequential behavior and main purpose simultaneously.","author":["Jing Li","Pengjie Ren","Zhumin Chen","Zhaochun Ren","Tao Lian","Jun Ma"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   1419\u20131428","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132926"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"G.

Our protocol allows a server to compute the sum of large, user-held data vectors from mobile devices in a secure manner (i.e. without learning each user's individual contribution), and can be used, for example, in a federated learning setting, to aggregate user-provided model updates for a deep neural network. We prove the security of our protocol in the honest-but-curious and active adversary settings, and show that security is maintained even if an arbitrarily chosen subset of users drop out at any time. We evaluate the efficiency of our protocol and show, by complexity analysis and a concrete implementation, that its runtime and communication overhead remain low even on large data sets and client pools. For 16-bit input values, our protocol offers $1.73 x communication expansion for 210 users and 220-dimensional vectors, and 1.98 x expansion for 214 users and 224-dimensional vectors over sending data in the clear.","author":["Keith Bonawitz","Vladimir Ivanov","Ben Kreuter","Antonio Marcedone","H.

These architectures offer potential for energy efficient computing if the application task is mapped to the right core. Realizing such potential is challenging due to the complex and evolving nature of hardware and applications. This paper presents an automatic approach to map OpenCL kernels onto heterogeneous multi-cores for a given optimization criterion \u2013 whether it is faster runtime, lower energy consumption or a trade-off between them. This is achieved by developing a machine learning based approach to predict which processor to use to run the OpenCL kernel and the host program, and at what frequency the processor should operate. Instead of hand-tuning a model for each optimization metric, we use machine learning to develop a unified framework that first automatically learns the optimization heuristic for each metric off-line, then uses the learned knowledge to schedule OpenCL kernels at runtime based on code and runtime information of the program. We apply our approach to a set of representative OpenCL benchmarks and evaluate it on an ARM big.LITTLE mobile platform. Our approach achieves over 93% of the performance delivered by a perfect predictor.We obtain, on average, 1.2x, 1.6x, and 1.8x improvement respectively for runtime, energy consumption and the energy delay product when compared to a comparative heterogeneous-aware OpenCL task mapping scheme.","author":["Ben Taylor","Vicent Sanz Marco","Zheng Wang"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 52","Issue 5","May 2017","pp   11\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/3140582.3081040"],"date":"21 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"H.

Unfortunately, the ever-increasing size of LSTM model leads to inefficient designs on FPGAs due to the limited on-chip resources. The previous work proposes to use a pruning based compression technique to reduce the model size and thus speedups the inference on FPGAs. However, the random nature of the pruning technique transforms the dense matrices of the model to highly unstructured sparse ones, which leads to unbalanced computation and irregular memory accesses and thus hurts the overall performance and energy efficiency.  In contrast, we propose to use a structured compression technique which could not only reduce the LSTM model size but also eliminate the irregularities of computation and memory accesses. This approach employs block-circulant instead of sparse matrices to compress weight matrices and reduces the storage requirement from  $\\mathcalO  (k^2)$ to  $\\mathcalO  (k)$. Fast Fourier Transform algorithm is utilized to further accelerate the inference by reducing the computational complexity from  $\\mathcalO  (k^2)$ to $\\mathcalO  (k\\textlog  k)$. The datapath and activation functions are quantized as 16-bit to improve the resource utilization. More importantly, we propose a comprehensive framework called C-LSTM to automatically optimize and implement a wide range of LSTM variants on FPGAs. According to the experimental results, C-LSTM achieves up to 18.8X and 33.5X gains for performance and energy efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art LSTM implementation under the same experimental setup, and the accuracy degradation is very small.","author":["Shuo Wang","Zhe Li","Caiwen Ding","Bo Yuan","Qinru Qiu","Yanzhi Wang","Yun Liang"],"issue":["FPGA '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2018","Pages   11\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/3174243.3174253"],"date":"15 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi et al. 2016.

To overcome these issues, Input-Feeding and Copying mechanism are adopted. Although our approach does not require any manual features or preprocessed pattern matching dictionaries, our best single model achieves an F-score of 97.08. This is competitive with the current state-of-the-art model (F-score 98.03), which requires extensive manual feature processing.","author":["Sangkeun Jung","Changki Lee","Hyunsun Hwang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing","Volume 17","Issue 3","May 2018","Article No.: 19","pp   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178458"],"date":"14 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Jiatao Gu, Zhengdong Lu, Hang Li, and Victor OK Li. 2016.

While these properties make NVM highly promising, it is not yet clear how to best integrate NVM into the storage layer of modern database systems. Two system designs have been proposed. The first is to use NVM exclusively, i.e., to store all data and index structures on it. However, because NVM has a higher latency than DRAM, this design can be less efficient than main-memory database systems. For this reason, the second approach uses a page-based DRAM cache in front of NVM. This approach, however, does not utilize the byte addressability of NVM and, as a result, accessing an uncached tuple on NVM requires retrieving an entire page. In this work, we evaluate these two approaches and compare them with in-memory databases as well as more traditional buffer managers that use main memory as a cache in front of SSDs. This allows us to determine how much performance gain can be expected from NVM. We also propose a lightweight storage manager that simultaneously supports DRAM, NVM, and flash. Our design utilizes the byte addressability of NVM and uses it as an additional caching layer that improves performance without losing the benefits from the even faster DRAM and the large capacities of SSDs.","author":["Alexander van Renen","Viktor Leis","Alfons Kemper","Thomas Neumann","Takushi Hashida","Kazuichi Oe","Yoshiyasu Doi","Lilian Harada","Mitsuru Sato"],"issue":["SIGMOD '18: Proceedings of the 2018 International Conference on Management of Data","May 2018","Pages   1541\u20131555","https://doi.org/10.1145/3183713.3196897"],"date":"27 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"Persistent memory programming. http://www.pmem.io.

Existing deep learning systems use batching to improve throughput, which do not perform well when serving Recurrent Neural Networks with dynamic dataflow graphs. We propose the technique of cellular batching, which improves both the latency and throughput of RNN inference. Unlike existing systems that batch a fixed set of dataflow graphs, cellular batching makes batching decisions at the granularity of an RNN \"cell\" (a subgraph with shared weights) and dynamically assembles a batched cell for execution as requests join and leave the system. We implemented our approach in a system called BatchMaker.

Optical proximity correction (OPC) is one of the prevailing resolution enhancement techniques (RETs) that can significantly improve mask printability. However, in advanced technology nodes, the mask optimization process consumes more and more computational resources. In this paper, we develop a generative adversarial network (GAN) model to achieve better mask optimization performance. We first develop an OPC-oriented GAN flow that can learn target-mask mapping from the improved architecture and objectives, which leads to satisfactory mask optimization results. To facilitate the training process and ensure better convergence, we also propose a pre-training procedure that jointly trains the neural network with inverse lithography technique (ILT). At convergence, the generative network is able to create quasi-optimal masks for given target circuit patterns and fewer normal OPC steps are required to generate high quality masks. Experimental results show that our flow can facilitate the mask optimization process as well as ensure a better printability.","author":["Haoyu Yang","Shuhe Li","Yuzhe Ma","Bei Yu","Evangeline F. Y.

However, it does not scale well to large-scale problems due to its quadratic complexity in constructing similarity graphs and computing subsequent eigendecomposition. Although a number of methods have been proposed to accelerate spectral clustering, most of them compromise considerable information loss in the original data for reducing computational bottlenecks. In this paper, we present a novel scalable spectral clustering method using Random Binning features (RB) to simultaneously accelerate both similarity graph construction and the eigendecomposition. Specifically, we implicitly approximate the graph similarity (kernel) matrix by the inner product of a large sparse feature matrix generated by RB. Then we introduce a state-of-the-art SVD solver to effectively compute eigenvectors of this large matrix for spectral clustering. Using these two building blocks, we reduce the computational cost from quadratic to linear in the number of data points while achieving similar accuracy. Our theoretical analysis shows that spectral clustering via RB converges faster to the exact spectral clustering than the standard Random Feature approximation. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks show that the proposed method either outperforms or matches the state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and runtime. Moreover, our method exhibits linear scalability in both the number of data samples and the number of RB features.","author":["Lingfei Wu","Pin-Yu Chen","Ian En-Hsu Yen","Fangli Xu","Yinglong Xia","Charu Aggarwal"],"issue":["KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2018","Pages   2506\u20132515","https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3220090"],"date":"19 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Aleksandar Bojchevski, Yves Matkovic, and Stephan G\u00fcnnemann . 2017.

In order to accelerate the development cycle, FPGA high-level synthesis tools have been developed such as Intel HLS, OpenCL, and OpenSPL. These tools aim to free the designer from having to know all the FPGA low-level details. However, in order to achieve high performance processing, the developer should still understand the details of the deeper system layers. Moreover, OpenCL usually consumes more resources/compile time than a design developed directly in RTL. In this work we propose a novel framework to automatically integrate hardware accelerator cores in a final architecture by generating a HW/SW interface for an Intel CPU-FPGA modern platform. Our goal is to simplify the Intel Open Programmable Acceleration Engine (OPAE) by introducing a novel abstraction layer with a simple stream protocol channel. The experimental results for a set of dataflow benchmarks show a performance of up to 131.7 Gops/s, and a power efficiency of up to 353.7 Gops/W even when we bound the memory bandwidth to 12 GB/s.","author":["Lucas Bragan\u00e7a","Fredy Alves","Jeronimo Costa Penha","Gabriel Coimbra","Ricardo Ferreira","Jos\u00e9 Augusto M.

These compute with the same constructs as stochastic computing but operate on deterministic bit streams. These approaches reduce the area, greatly reduce the latency (by an exponential factor), and produce completely accurate results. However, these methods do not scale well. Also, they lack the property of progressive precision enjoyed by SC. As a result, these deterministic approaches are not competitive for applications where some degree of inaccuracy can be tolerated. In this work we introduce two fast-converging, scalable deterministic approaches to SC based on low-discrepancy sequences. The results are completely accurate when running the operations for the required number of cycles. However, the computation can be truncated early if some inaccuracy is acceptable. Experimental results show that the proposed approaches significantly improve both the processing time and area-delay product compared to prior approaches.","author":["M. Hassan Najafi","David J.

EMAT utilizes the energy-efficiency of ReRAM arrays for matrix-vector multiplication and realizes a hierarchical reconfigurable design with heterogeneous computation components to incorporate the data patterns in transfer learning.

A neural approximator can map the input data to output while a classifier determines whether the input data are safe to approximate with quality guarantee. However, existing works cannot maximize the invocation of the approximator, resulting in limited speedup and energy saving. By exploring the mapping space of those target functions, in this paper, we observe a nonuniform distribution of the approximation error incurred by the same approximator. We thus propose a novel approximate computing architecture with a Multiclass-Classifier and Multiple Approximators (MCMA). These approximators have identica network topologies, and thus can share the same hardware resource in an neural processing unit(NPU) clip. In the runtime, MCMA can swap in the invoked approximator by merely shipping the synapse weights from the on-chip memory to the buffers near MAC within a cycle. We also propose efficient co-training methods for such MCMA architecture. Experimental results show a more substantial invocation of MCMA as well as the gain of energy-efficiency.","author":["Haiyue Song","Chengwen Xu","Qiang Xu","Zhuoran Song","Naifeng Jing","Xiaoyao Liang","Li Jiang"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 50","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240819"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"T.

Many of the stencil kernels are complex, usually consist of multiple stages or iterations, and are often computation-bounded. Such kernels are often offloaded to FPGAs to take advantages of the efficiency of dedicated hardware. However, implementing such complex kernels efficiently is not trivial, due to complicated data dependencies, difficulties of programming FPGAs with RTL, as well as large design space. In this paper we present SODA, an automated framework for implementing Stencil algorithms with Optimized Dataflow Architecture on FPGAs. The SODA microarchitecture minimizes the on-chip reuse buffer size required by full data reuse and provides flexible and scalable fine-grained parallelism. The SODA automation framework takes high-level user input and generates efficient, high-frequency dataflow implementation. This significantly reduces the difficulty of programming FPGAs efficiently for stencil algorithms. The SODA design-space exploration framework models the resource constraints and searches for the performance-optimized configuration with accurate models for post-synthesis resource utilization and on-board execution throughput. Experimental results from on-board execution using a wide range of benchmarks show up to 3.28x speed up over 24-thread CPU and our fully automated framework achieves better performance compared with manually designed state-of-the-art FPGA accelerators.","author":["Yuze Chi","Jason Cong","Peng Wei","Peipei Zhou"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 116","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240850"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"Alan C.

Our experiments reveal two potential pitfalls in the evaluation of activity recognition algorithms: 1) unnoticed overfitting due to autocorrelation (i.e. dependencies between temporally close samples), and 2) the accuracy/generality trade-off due to idealized conditions and lack of variation in the data. We show that evaluation with a random training/test split suggests highly accurate recognition of eight different travel activities with an average F1 score of 96% for single-participant/fixed-position data, whereas with proper backtesting the F1 score drops to 84%, for data of different participants in the SHL Dataset to 61%, and for different carrying positions to 54%.

However, recent studies show that GCNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e. small deliberate perturbations in graph structures and node attributes, which poses great challenges for applying GCNs to real world applications. How to enhance the robustness of GCNs remains a critical open problem. To address this problem, we propose Robust GCN (RGCN), a novel model that \"fortifies'' GCNs against adversarial attacks. Specifically, instead of representing nodes as vectors, our method adopts Gaussian distributions as the hidden representations of nodes in each convolutional layer. In this way, when the graph is attacked, our model can automatically absorb the effects of adversarial changes in the variances of the Gaussian distributions. Moreover, to remedy the propagation of adversarial attacks in GCNs, we propose a variance-based attention mechanism, i.e. assigning different weights to node neighborhoods according to their variances when performing convolutions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively improve the robustness of GCNs. On three benchmark graphs, our RGCN consistently shows a substantial gain in node classification accuracy compared with state-of-the-art GCNs against various adversarial attack strategies.","author":["Dingyuan Zhu","Ziwei Zhang","Peng Cui","Wenwu Zhu"],"issue":["KDD '19: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2019","Pages   1399\u20131407","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292500.3330851"],"date":"25 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"Aleksandar Bojchevski and Stephan G\u00fcnnemann. 2018.

Such systems with few tens to few hundreds of qubits are termed as Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum computers (NISQ), and these systems can provide benefits for a class of quantum algorithms. In this paper, we study the problems of Qubit-Allocation (mapping of program qubits to machine qubits) and Qubit-Movement (routing qubits from one location to another for entanglement). We observe that there can be variation in the error rates of different qubits and links, which can impact the decisions for qubit movement and qubit allocation. We analyze publicly available characterization data for the IBM-Q20 to quantify the variation and show that there is indeed significant variability in the error rates of the qubits and the links connecting them. We show that the device variability has a significant impact on the overall system reliability. To exploit the variability in error rate, we propose Variation-Aware Qubit Movement (VQM) and Variation-Aware Qubit Allocation (VQA), policies that optimize the movement and allocation of qubits to avoid the weaker qubits and links, and guide more operations towards the stronger qubits and links. Our evaluations, with a simulation-based model of IBM-Q20, show that Variation-Aware policies can improve the system reliability by up to 1.7x. We also evaluate our policies on the IBM-Q5 machine and demonstrate that our proposal significantly improves the reliability of real systems (up to 1.9X).","author":["Swamit S. Tannu","Moinuddin K.

High performance and extreme energy efficiency are critical for deployments of DNN, especially in mobile platforms such as autonomous vehicles, cameras, and other devices of internet of things. However, DNNs lead to massive data movement and memory accesses, which prevents it from being integrated into always-on Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Recently, computing in-memory (CIM) architectures embeds analog computation circuits in/near the memory arrays. It significantly reduces data movement energy. This paper summarizes the most recent novel methods on the CIM architectures based on the time-domain computation. Compared with voltage-domain and frequency-domain analog computing method, time-domain computation provides more flexibility, higher accuracy and greater scalability for larger neural networks. Thereafter, the first in-memory binary weight network (BWN) processor based on pulse-width modulation in which the feature is stored in memory is also presented. This work significantly reduces memory accesses (4x), and achieves state-of-the-art peak energy efficiency of 119.7TOPS/W.","author":["Yuyao Kong","Jun Yang"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '19: Proceedings of the 2019 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2019","Pages   435\u2013438","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299874.3319484"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"S.

This article presents POS tagging experiments conducted using an Igbo corpus as a test bed for identifying the POS taggers and the Machine Learning (ML) methods that can achieve a good performance with the small dataset available for the language. Experiments have been conducted using different well-known POS taggers developed for English or European languages, and different training data styles and sizes. Igbo has a number of language-specific characteristics that present a challenge for effective POS tagging. One interesting case is the wide use of verbs (and nominalizations thereof) that have an inherent noun complement, which form \u201clinked pairs\u201d in the POS tagging scheme, but which may appear discontinuously. Another issue is Igbo\u2019s highly productive agglutinative morphology, which can produce many variant word forms from a given root. This productivity is a key cause of the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words observed during Igbo tagging. We report results of experiments on a promising direction for improving tagging performance on such morphologically-inflected OOV words.","author":["Ikechukwu E.

The clustering problem has been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. However, clustering is a difficult problem combinatorially, and differences in assumptions and contexts in different communities has made the transfer of useful generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This paper presents an overview\nof pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of clustering practitioners. We present a taxonomy of clustering techniques, and identify\n cross-cutting themes and recent advances.

Many consider blockchain as a technology breakthrough for cryptography and cybersecurity, with use cases ranging from globally deployed cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin, to smart contracts, smart grids over the Internet of Things, and so forth. Although blockchain has received growing interests in both academia and industry in the recent years, the security and privacy of blockchains continue to be at the center of the debate when deploying blockchain in different applications. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy of blockchain. To facilitate the discussion, we first introduce the notion of blockchains and its utility in the context of Bitcoin-like online transactions. Then, we describe the basic security properties that are supported as the essential requirements and building blocks for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency systems, followed by presenting the additional security and privacy properties that are desired in many blockchain applications. Finally, we review the security and privacy techniques for achieving these security properties in blockchain-based systems, including representative consensus algorithms, hash chained storage, mixing protocols, anonymous signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, and so forth. We conjecture that this survey can help readers to gain an in-depth understanding of the security and privacy of blockchain with respect to concept, attributes, techniques, and systems.","author":["Rui Zhang","Rui Xue","Ling Liu"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 52","Issue 3","July 2019","Article No.: 51","pp   1\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316481"],"date":"03 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"{n.d.}.

Monolithic 3D (M3D) integration enables 3DV-ReRAM to improve its array area efficiency by stacking peripheral circuits underneath an array. A 3DV-ReRAM array has to be large enough to fully cover the peripheral circuits, but such large array size significantly increases its access latency. In this paper, we propose Magma, a M3D stacked heterogeneous ReRAM array architecture, for future main memory systems by stacking a large unipolar 3DV-ReRAM array on the top of a small bipolar 3DV-ReRAM array and peripheral circuits shared by two arrays. We further architect the small bipolar array as a direct-mapped cache for the main memory system. Compared to homogeneous ReRAMs, on average, Magma improves the system performance by 11.4%, reduces the system energy by 24.3% and obtains > 5-year lifetime.","author":["Farzaneh Zokaee","Mingzhe Zhang","Xiaochun Ye","Dongrui Fan","Lei Jiang"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 115","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317858"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"M.

Stochastic computing (SC) is a promising low-cost alternative to conventional binary implementations of CNNs. Despite the low-cost advantage, SC-based arithmetic units suffer from prohibitive execution time due to processing long bit-streams. In particular, multiplication as the main operation in convolution computation, is an extremely time-consuming operation which hampers employing SC methods in designing embedded CNNs. In this work, we propose a novel architecture, called SkippyNN, that reduces the computation time of SC-based multiplications in the convolutional layers of CNNs. Each convolution in a CNN is composed of numerous multiplications where each input value is multiplied by a weight vector. Producing the result of the first multiplication, the following multiplications can be performed by multiplying the input and the differences of the successive weights. Leveraging this property, we develop a differential Multiply-and-Accumulate unit, called DMAC, to reduce the time consumed by convolutions in SkippyNN. We evaluate the efficiency of SkippyNN using four modern CNNs. On average, SkippyNN ofers 1.2x speedup and 2.7x energy saving compared to the binary implementation of CNN accelerators.","author":["Reza Hojabr","Kamyar Givaki","S. M.

In the intrinsic evaluation, after vectorizing the abbreviations and their original words, we measure their semantic similarity, and compare with the semantic similarity of synonym collection; In the extrinsic evaluation, we propose an abbreviation recognition task, like named entity recognition. Through this task, the degree of mutual substitution between abbreviations and the original words can be described. The above experiments show that after the abbreviations and their original words are expressed by word vectors, there is still a strong semantic relationship between them.","author":["Jianyu Zheng","Jin Sun","Xin'ge Xiao","Lijiao Yang"],"issue":["ICIAI 2019: Proceedings of the 2019 3rd International Conference on Innovation in Artificial Intelligence","March 2019","Pages   60\u201364","https://doi.org/10.1145/3319921.3319938"],"date":"15 March 2019","ref":[{"text":"Zi, Y.

The major barrier to broader progress has been the dependency of indoor positioning on environment-specific infrastructure and resulting tailored technical solutions. Combined with the fragmentation and compartmentalization of indoor environments, this poses significant challenges to widespread adoption of indoor location-based services. This article puts aside all approaches of infrastructure-based support for human indoor localization and navigation and instead reviews technical concepts that are independent of sensors embedded in the environment. The reviewed concepts rely on a mobile computing platform with sensing capability and a human interaction interface (\u201csmartphone\u201d). This platform may or may not carry a stored map of the environment, but does not require in situ internet access. In this regard, the presented approaches are more challenging than any localization and navigation solutions specific to a particular, infrastructure-equipped indoor space, since they are not adapted to local context, and they may lack some of the accuracy achievable with those tailored solutions. However, only these approaches have the potential to be universally applicable.","author":["Stephan Winter","Martin Tomko","Maria Vasardani","Kai-Florian Richter","Kourosh Khoshelham","Mohsen Kalantari"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 52","Issue 3","May 2020","Article No.: 61","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/3321516"],"date":"18 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"H.

The concurrency mechanisms, while powerful, are quite difficult to properly master by mobile developers. In fact, prior studies have shown concurrency issues, such as event-race defects, to be prevalent among real-world Android apps. In this paper, we propose a flow-, context-, and thread-sensitive static analysis framework, called ER Catcher, for detection of event-race defects in Android apps. ER Catcher introduces a new type of summary function aimed at modeling the concurrent behavior of methods in both Android apps and libraries. In addition, it leverages a novel, statically constructed Vector Clock for rapid analysis of happens-before relations. Altogether, these design choices enable ER Catcher to not only detect event-race defects with a substantially higher degree of accuracy, but also in a fraction of time compared to the existing state-of-the-art technique.","author":["Navid Salehnamadi","Abdulaziz Alshayban","Iftekhar Ahmed","Sam Malek"],"issue":["ASE '20: Proceedings of the 35th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering","December 2020","Pages   324\u2013335","https://doi.org/10.1145/3324884.3416639"],"date":"21 December 2020","ref":[{"text":"2020.","order":1},{"text":"2020.","order":2},{"text":"2020.","order":3},{"text":"Karim Ali and Ond\u0159ej Lhot\u00e1k. 2013.

In contrast to wearing an extra camera to record daily life, people are used to log their life on social media platforms. In this paper, we aim to extract life events from textual data shared on Twitter and construct personal knowledge bases of individuals. The issues to be tackled include (1) not all text descriptions are related to life events, (2) life events in a text description can be expressed explicitly or implicitly, (3) the predicates in the implicit events are often absent, and (4) the mapping from natural language predicates to knowledge base relations may be ambiguous. A joint learning approach is proposed to detect life events in tweets and extract event components including subjects, predicates, objects, and time expressions. Finally, the extracted information is transformed to knowledge base facts. The evaluation is performed on a collection of lifelogs from 18 Twitter users. Experimental results show our proposed system is effective in life event extraction, and the constructed personal knowledge bases are expected to be useful to memory recall applications.","author":["An-Zi Yen","Hen-Hsen Huang","Hsin-Hsi Chen"],"issue":["SIGIR'19: Proceedings of the 42nd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","July 2019","Pages   185\u2013194","https://doi.org/10.1145/3331184.3331209"],"date":"18 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"S\u00f6ren Auer, Christian Bizer, Georgi Kobilarov, Jens Lehmann, Richard Cyganiak, and Zachary G.

Inspired by the methodology of the AlphaGo Zero, MM-NER formalizes the problem of named entity recognition with a Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) enhanced Markov decision process (MDP) model, in which the time steps correspond to the positions of words in a sentence from left to right, and each action corresponds to assign an NER tag to a word. Two Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are used to summarize the past tag assignments and words in the sentence. Based on the outputs of GRUs, the policy for guiding the tag assignment and the value for predicting the whole tagging accuracy of the whole sentence are produced. The policy and value are then strengthened with MCTS, which takes the produced raw policy and value as inputs, simulates and evaluates the possible tag assignments at the subsequent positions, and outputs a better search policy for assigning tags. A reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to train the model parameters. Empirically, we show that MM-NER can accurately predict the tags thanks to the exploratory decision making mechanism introduced by MCTS. It outperformed the conventional sequence tagging baselines and performed equally well with the state-of-the-art baseline BLSTM-CRF.","author":["Yadi Lao","Jun Xu","Sheng Gao","Jun Guo","Ji-Rong Wen"],"issue":["SIGIR'19: Proceedings of the 42nd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","July 2019","Pages   1245\u20131248","https://doi.org/10.1145/3331184.3331349"],"date":"18 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"Kai-Wei Chang, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Alekh Agarwal, Hal Daume III, and John Langford. 2015.

However, user privacy is badly undermined even though user identity can be anonymized. Graph de-anonymization to identify nodes from an anonymized graph is widely adopted to evaluate users' privacy risks. Most existing de-anonymization methods which are heavily reliant on side information (e.g., seeds, user profiles, community labels) are unrealistic due to the difficulty of collecting this side information. A few graph de-anonymization methods only using structural information, called seed-free methods, have been proposed recently, which mainly take advantage of the local and manual features of nodes while overlooking the global structural information of the graph for de-anonymization. In this paper, a seed-free graph de-anonymization method is proposed, where a deep neural network is adopted to learn features and an adversarial framework is employed for node matching. To be specific, the latent representation of each node is obtained by graph autoencoder. Furthermore, an adversarial learning model is proposed to transform the embedding of the anonymized graph to the latent space of auxiliary graph embedding such that a linear mapping can be derived from a global perspective. Finally, the most similar node pairs in the latent space as the anchor nodes are utilized to launch propagation to de-anonymize all the remaining nodes. The extensive experiments on some real datasets demonstrate that our method is comparative with the seed-based approaches and outperforms the start-of-the-art seed-free method significantly.","author":["Kaiyang Li","Guoming Lu","Guangchun Luo","Zhipeng Cai"],"issue":["CIKM '20: Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management","October 2020","Pages   745\u2013754","https://doi.org/10.1145/3340531.3411970"],"date":"19 October 2020","ref":[{"text":"[n.d.].

In this paper, we design the LDPC encoding and decoding scheme to get stepwise code rate according to the P/E cycle by applying rate-compatible LDPC, as well as the management scheme of excessive parity data. Through this, we can improve the error recovery rate of flash memory storage system and extend the lifetime of NAND flash storage system while reducing the system read and write overhead due to the increase in additional parity data.","author":["Jae-Bin Lee","Geon-Myeong Kim","Seung-Ho Lim"],"issue":["CASES '19: Proceedings of the International Conference on Compliers, Architectures and Synthesis for Embedded Systems Companion","October 2019","Article No.: 3","Pages   1\u20132","https://doi.org/10.1145/3349569.3351535"],"date":"13 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"N.

Cache conscious index structures such as Cache Sensitive Search Trees (CSS-Trees) perform lookups much faster than binary search and T-Trees. However, CSS-Trees are designed for decision support workloads with relatively static data. Although B+-Trees are more cache conscious than binary search and T-Trees, their utilization of a cache line is low since half of the space is used to store child pointers. Nevertheless, for applications that require incremental updates, traditional B+-Trees perform well.Our goal is to make B+-Trees as cache conscious as CSS-Trees without increasing their update cost too much. We propose a new indexing technique called \u201cCache Sensitive B+-Trees\u201d (CSB+-Trees). It is a variant of B+-Trees that stores all the child nodes of any given node contiguously, and keeps only the address of the first child in each node. The rest of the children can be found by adding an offset to that address. Since only one child pointer is stored explicitly, the utilization of a cache line is high. CSB+-Trees support incremental updates in a way similar to B+-Trees.We also introduce two variants of CSB+-Trees. Segmented CSB+-Trees divide the child nodes into segments. Nodes within the same segment are stored contiguously and only pointers to the beginning of each segment are stored explicitly in each node. Segmented CSB+-Trees can reduce the copying cost when there is a split since only one segment needs to be moved.

However, without leveraging the full-stack design of computer systems, modern computer architectures undermine the potential of approximate computing. In this paper, we present Varifocal Storage, a dynamic multi-resolution storage system that tackles challenges in performance, quality, flexibility and cost for computer systems supporting diverse application demands. Varifocal Storage dynamically adjusts the dataset resolution within a storage device, thereby mitigating the performance bottleneck of exchanging/preparing data for approximate compute kernels. Varifocal Storage introduces Autofocus and iFilter mechanisms to provide quality control inside the storage device and make programs more adaptive to diverse datasets. Varifocal Storage also offers flexible, efficient support for approximate and exact computing without exceeding the costs of conventional storage systems by (1) saving the raw dataset in the storage device, and (2) targeting operators that complement the power of existing SSD controllers to dynamically generate lower-resolution datasets. We evaluate the performance of Varifocal Storage by running applications on a heterogeneous computer with our prototype SSD. The results show that Varifocal Storage can speed up data resolution adjustments by 2.02\u00d7 or 1.74\u00d7 without programmer input. Compared to conventional approximate-computing architectures, Varifocal Storage speeds up the overall execution time by 1.52\u00d7.","author":["Yu-Ching Hu","Murtuza Taher Lokhandwala","Te I.","Hung-Wei Tseng"],"issue":["MICRO '52: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","October 2019","Pages   196\u2013210","https://doi.org/10.1145/3352460.3358282"],"date":"12 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen, Craig Citro, Greg S.

Serverless cloud services provide fine-grained provisioning of resources, which scale automatically with user demand. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) applications follow this serverless model, with the developer providing their application as a set of functions which are executed in response to a user- or system-generated event. Functions are designed to be short-lived and execute inside containers or virtual machines, introducing a range of system-level overheads. This paper studies the architectural implications of this emerging paradigm. Using the commercial-grade Apache OpenWhisk FaaS platform on real servers, this work investigates and identifies the architectural implications of FaaS serverless computing. The workloads, along with the way that FaaS inherently interleaves short functions from many tenants frustrates many of the locality-preserving architectural structures common in modern processors. In particular, we find that: FaaS containerization brings up to 20x slowdown compared to native execution, cold-start can be over 10x a short function's execution time, branch mispredictions per kilo-instruction are 20x higher for short functions, memory bandwidth increases by 6x due to the invocation pattern, and IPC decreases by as much as 35% due to inter-function interference. We open-source FaaSProfiler, the FaaS testing and profiling platform that we developed for this work.","author":["Mohammad Shahrad","Jonathan Balkind","David Wentzlaff"],"issue":["MICRO '52: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","October 2019","Pages   1063\u20131075","https://doi.org/10.1145/3352460.3358296"],"date":"12 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"\"AWS Lambda.\" https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/.

Restoring Fairness in AXI Interconnects for FPGA SoCs","abstract":"AMBA AXI is a popular bus protocol that is widely adopted as the medium to exchange data in field-programmable gate array system-on-chips (FPGA SoCs). The AXI protocol does not specify how conflicting transactions are arbitrated and hence the design of bus arbiters is left to the vendors that adopt AXI. Typically, a round-robin arbitration is implemented to ensure a fair access to the bus by the master nodes, as for the popular SoCs by Xilinx.This paper addresses a critical issue that can arise when adopting the AXI protocol under round-robin arbitration; specifically, in the presence of bus transactions with heterogeneous burst sizes. First, it is shown that a completely unfair bandwidth distribution can be achieved under some configurations, making possible to arbitrarily decrease the bus bandwidth of a target master node. This issue poses serious performance, safety, and security concerns. Second, a low-latency (one clock cycle) module named AXI burst equalizer (ABE) is proposed to restore fairness. Our investigations and proposals are supported by implementations and tests upon three modern SoCs. Experimental results are reported to confirm the existence of the issue and assess the effectiveness of the ABE with bus traffic generators and hardware accelerators from the Xilinx\u2019s IP library.","author":["Francesco Restuccia","Marco Pagani","Alessandro Biondi","Mauro Marinoni","Giorgio Buttazzo"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 18","Issue 5s","October 2019","Article No.: 51","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/3358183"],"date":"07 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"ARM. 2012.

Typical HMS consists of a small-capacity high-performance memory and a large-capacity low-performance memory. Data placement on such systems plays a critical role in performance optimization. Existing efforts have explored coarse-grained data placement in applications with dense data structures; however, a thorough study of applications that are based on graph data structures is still missing.  This work proposes ATMem\u2014a runtime framework for adaptive granularity data placement optimization in graph applications. ATMem consists of a lightweight profiler, an analyzer using a novel m-ary tree-based strategy to identify sampled and estimated critical data chunks, and a high-bandwidth migration mechanism using a multi-stage multi-threaded approach. ATMem is evaluated in five applications on two HMS hardware, including the Intel Optane byte-addressable NVM and MCDRAM. Experimental results show that ATMem selects 5%-18% data to be placed on high-performance memory and achieves an average of 1.7\u00d7-3.4\u00d7 speedup on NVM-DRAM and 1.2\u00d7-2.0\u00d7 speedup on MCDRAM-DRAM, over the baseline that places all data on the large-capacity memory. On NVM-DRAM, ATMem achieves performance comparable to a full-DRAM system with as low as 9%-54% slowdown.","author":["Yu Chen","Ivy B.

However, both accelerators suffer from hardware uncertainties such as process variations. These uncertainty issues left unaddressed, the inference accuracy of these computing platforms can degrade significantly. In this paper, a statistical training method where weights under process variations and noise are modeled as statistical random variables is presented. To incorporate these statistical weights into training, the computations in neural networks are modified accordingly. For optical neural networks, we modify the cost function during software training to reduce the effects of process variations and thermal imbalance. In addition, the residual effects of process variations are extracted and calibrated in hardware test, and thermal variations on devices are also compensated in advance. Simulation results demonstrate that the inference accuracy can be improved significantly under hardware uncertainties for both platforms.","author":["Grace Li Zhang","Bing Li","Ying Zhu","Tianchen Wang","Yiyu Shi","Xunzhao Yin","Cheng Zhuo","Huaxi Gu","Tsung-Yi Ho","Ulf Schlichtmann"],"issue":["ASPDAC '21: Proceedings of the 26th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2021","Pages   853\u2013858","https://doi.org/10.1145/3394885.3431634"],"date":"18 January 2021","ref":[{"text":"C.

However, ECOs are highly time-consuming, and the power improvement is unknown in advance. Ever since the industrial benchmarks released by the ISPD-2012 gate-sizing contest, active research has been conducted extensively. Nonetheless, previous works were mostly based on heuristics or analytical methods whose timing models were over-simplified and lacked formal validations from commercial signoff tools. In this paper, we propose ECO-GNN, a transferable graph-learning-based framework, which harnesses graph neural networks (GNNs) to perform commercial-quality signoff power optimization through discrete Vth-assignment. Our framework generates tool-accurate optimization results instantly on unseen netlists that are not utilized in the training process. Furthermore, we implement a GNN-based explanation method to interpret the optimization results achieved by our framework. Experimental results on 14 industrial designs, including a RISC-V-based multi-core system and the renowned ISPD-2012 benchmarks, demonstrate that our framework achieves up to 14X runtime improvement with similar signoff power optimization quality compared with Synopsys PrimeTime.","author":["Yi-Chen Lu","Siddhartha Nath","Sai Surya Kiran Pentapati","Sung Kyu Lim"],"issue":["ICCAD '20: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2020","Article No.: 161","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/3400302.3415711"],"date":"17 December 2020","ref":[{"text":"K.

However, high write energy and latency are its major shortcomings, particularly for fast cache applications. High write costs can efficiently be reduced by relaxing the STT-MRAM non-volatility requirements at the expense of significant increase in retention failure and read disturb rates resulting in data corruption. Hybrid STT-MRAM architecture combining non-volatile (NVM) and semi-volatile (SVM) STT-MRAM blocks has been proposed recently, which provides energy-efficiency, high storage capacity, better performance, and high reliability. However, a key and challenging requirement is efficient data mapping and migration between NVM and SVM sub-arrays to maximize the benefits of such hybrid caches. On-the-fly data migration decisions usually depend on the last seen data behavior, as it is assumed to be identical to the next one, which has very limited accuracy for rapidly varying workload behavior. In this article, we propose a simple but effective on-the-fly data management policy, which mainly relies on the supervised learning data-pattern classification for quick and highly accurate prediction of the data behavior in the oncoming execution time. Three prediction approaches are proposed and compared for a maximum and average achieved accuracy of 86% and 75%, respectively. Our data management policies aim to optimally leverage the specific features of NVM (high reliability) and SVM blocks (fast and energy-efficient write) of hybrid STT-MRAM memory with minimal migration costs (i.e., energy and performance overheads). Our experimental evaluation reports that for a hybrid STT-MRAM cache with the proposed prediction techniques, the total energy consumption can be reduced around 10.5%, on average, in comparison to the state-of-the-art.","author":["Nour Sayed","Longfei Mao","Mehdi B.

The system compares this password with one recorded in a Password Table which is available to only the authentication program. The integrity of the system depends on keeping the table secret. In this paper a password scheme is presented which does not require secrecy in the computer. All aspects of the system, including all relevant code and data bases, may be known by anyone attempting to intrude.The scheme is based on using a function H which the would-be intruder is unable to invert. This function is applied to the user's password and the result compared to a table entry, a match being interpreted as authentication of the user. The intruder may know all about H and have access to the table, but he can penetrate the system only if he can invert H to determine an input that produces a given output.This paper discusses issues surrounding selection of a suitable H. Two different plausible arguments are given that penetration would be exceedingly difficult, and it is then argued that more rigorous results are unlikely. Finally, some human engineering problems relating to the scheme are discussed.","author":["Arthur Evans","William Kantrowitz","Edwin Weiss"],"issue":["Communications of the ACM","Volume 17","Issue 8","Aug. 1974","pp   437\u2013442","https://doi.org/10.1145/361082.361087"],"date":"01 August 1974","ref":[{"text":"Feistel, Horst.

Previously, the file system used hardware-provided labels on disk blocks to increase robustness against hardware and software errors. The new system does not require hardware disk labels, yet is more robust than the old system. Recovery is rapid after a crash. The performance of operations on file system metadata, e.g., file creation or open, is greatly improved.The new file system has two features that make it atypical. The system uses a log, as do most database systems, to recover metadata about the file system. To gain performance, it uses group commit, a concept derived from high performance database systems.

This paper presents the design and implementation of an architecture for resource management in a hosting center operating system, with an emphasis on energy as a driving resource management issue for large server clusters. The goals are to provision server resources for co-hosted services in a way that automatically adapts to offered load, improve the energy efficiency of server clusters by dynamically resizing the active server set, and respond to power supply disruptions or thermal events by degrading service in accordance with negotiated Service Level Agreements (SLAs).Our system is based on an economic approach to managing shared server resources, in which services \"bid\" for resources as a function of delivered performance. The system continuously monitors load and plans resource allotments by estimating the value of their effects on service performance. A greedy resource allocation algorithm adjusts resource prices to balance supply and demand, allocating resources to their most efficient use. A reconfigurable server switching infrastructure directs request traffic to the servers assigned to each service. Experimental results from a prototype confirm that the system adapts to offered load and resource availability, and can reduce server energy usage by 29% or more for a typical Web workload.","author":["Jeffrey S.

Iterative modulo scheduling is an algorithm for software pipelining in the presence of resource constraints. Integrating the best features of both yields a pipelining algorithm, retimed modulo scheduling, that can more effectively exploit the idiosyncrasies of reconfigurable hardware.

We propose a new 3D model acquisition system that permits the user to rotate an object by hand and see a continuously-updated model as the object is scanned. This tight feedback loop allows the user to find and fill holes in the model in real time, and determine when the object has been completely covered. Our system is based on a 60 Hz. structured-light rangefinder, a real-time variant of ICP (iterative closest points) for alignment, and point-based merging and rendering algorithms.

Pipeline processors provide high speed because their separate stages can operate concurrently, much as different people on a manufacturing assembly line work concurrently on material passing down the line. Although the concurrency of pipeline processors makes their design a demanding task, they can be found in graphics processors, in signal processing devices, in integrated circuit components for doing arithmetic, and in the instruction interpretation units and arithmetic operations of general purpose computing machinery.Because I plan to describe a variety of pipeline processors, I will start by suggesting names for their various forms. Pipeline processors, or more simply just pipelines, operate on data as it passes along them. The latency of a pipeline is a measure of how long it takes a single data value to pass through it. The throughput rate of a pipeline is a measure of how many data values can pass through it per unit time.Pipelines both store and process data; the storage elements and processing logic in them alternate along their length. I will describe pipelines in their complete form later, but first I will focus on their storage elements alone, stripping away all processing logic. Stripped of all processing logic, any pipeline acts like a series of storage elements through which data can pass.Pipelines can be clocked or event-driven, depending on whether their parts act in response to some widely-distributed external clock, or act independently whenever local events permit. Some pipelines are inelastic; the amount of data in them is fixed. The input rate and the output rate of an inelastic pipeline must match exactly. Stripped of any processing logic, an inelastic pipeline acts like a shift register. Other pipelines are elastic; the amount of data in them may vary. The input rate and the output rate of an elastic pipeline may differ momentarily because of internal buffering. Stripped of all processing logic, an elastic pipeline becomes a flow-through first-in-first-out memory, or FIFO. FIFOs may be clocked or event-driven; their important property is that they are elastic.I assign the name micropipeline to a particularly simple form of event-driven elastic pipeline with or without internal processing. The micro part of this name seems appropriate to me because micropipelines contain very simple circuitry, because micropipelines are useful in very short lengths, and because micropipelines are suitable for layout in microelectronic form.I have chosen micropipelines as the subject of this lecture for three reasons. First, micropipelines are simple and easy to understand. I believe that simple ideas are best, and I find beauty in the simplicity and symmetry of micropipelines. Second, I see confusion surrounding the design of FIFOs. I offer this description of micropipelines in the hope of reducing some of that confusion.The third reason I have chosen my subject addresses the limitations imposed on us by the clocked-logic conceptual framework now commonly used in the design of digital systems. I believe that this conceptual framework or mind set masks simple and useful structures like micropipelines from our thoughts, structures that are easy to design and apply given a different conceptual framework. Because micropipelines are event-driven, their simplicity is not available within the clocked-logic conceptual framework. I offer this description of micropipelines in the hope of focusing attention on an alternative transition-signalling conceptual framework.We need a new conceptual framework because the complexity of VLSI technology has now reached the point where design time and design cost often exceed fabrication time and fabrication cost. Moreover, most systems designed today are monolithic and resist mid-life improvement. The transition-signalling conceptual framework offers the opportunity to build up complex systems by hierarchical composition from simpler pieces. The resulting systems are easily modified. I believe that the transition-signalling conceptual framework has much to offer in reducing the design time and cost of complex systems and increasing their useful lifetime. I offer this description of micropipelines as an example of the transition-signalling conceptual framework.Until recently only a hardy few used the transition-signalling conceptual framework for design because it was too hard. It was nearly impossible to design the small circuits of 10 to 100 transistors that form the elemental building blocks from which complex systems are composed. Moreover, it was difficult to prove anything about the resulting compositions. In the past five years, however, much progress has been made on both fronts. Charles Molnar and his colleagues at Washington University have developed a simple way to design the small basic building blocks [9]. Martin Rem's \"VLSI Club\" at the Technical University of Eindhoven has been working effectively on the mathematics of event-driven systems [6, 10, 11, 19]. These emerging conceptual tools now make transition signalling a lively candidate for widespread use.","author":["I. E.

One of these features is Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) operations. In this paper, we propose a new design of MPI over InfiniBand which brings the benefit of RDMA to not only large messages, but also small and control messages. We also achieve better scalability by exploiting application communication pattern and combining send/receive operations with RDMA operations. Our RDMA-based MPI implementation currently delivers a latency of 6.8 microseconds for small messages and a peak bandwidth of 871 Million Bytes (831 Mega Bytes) per second. Performance evaluation at the MPI level shows that for small messages, our RDMA-based design can reduce the latency by 24%, increase the bandwidth by over 104%, and reduce the host overhead by up to 22%. For large messages, we improve performance by reducing the time for transferring control messages. We have also shown that our new design is beneficial to MPI collective communication and NAS Parallel Benchmarks.","author":["Jiuxing Liu","Jiesheng Wu","Sushmitha P.

In this paper, we describe a new model-based algorithm designed for this task, which is based on a generalization of probabilistic latent semantic analysis to continuous-valued response variables. More specifically, we assume that the observed user ratings can be modeled as a mixture of user communities or interest groups, where users may participate probabilistically in one or more groups. Each community is characterized by a Gaussian distribution on the normalized ratings for each item. The normalization of ratings is performed in a user-specific manner to account for variations in absolute shift and variance of ratings. Experiments on the EachMovie data set show that the proposed approach compares favorably with other collaborative filtering techniques.","author":["Thomas Hofmann"],"issue":["SIGIR '03: Proceedings of the 26th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in informaion retrieval","July 2003","Pages   259\u2013266","https://doi.org/10.1145/860435.860483"],"date":"28 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"D.

Typically the behavior of such processing algorithms is related to the smoothness of the parameterization and how much distortion it contains. Since a parameterization maps a bounded region of the plane to the surface, a parameterization for a surface which is not homeomorphic to a disc must be made up of multiple pieces. We present a novel parameterization algorithm for arbitrary topology surface meshes which computes a globally smooth parameterization with low distortion. We optimize the patch layout subject to criteria such as shape quality and metric distortion, which are used to steer a mesh simplification approach for base complex construction. Global smoothness is achieved through simultaneous relaxation over all patches, with suitable transition functions between patches incorporated into the relaxation procedure. We demonstrate the quality of our parameterizations through numerical evaluation of distortion measures and the excellent rate distortion performance of semi-regular remeshes produced with these parameterizations. The numerical algorithms required to compute the parameterizations are robust and run on the order of minutes even for large meshes.","author":["Andrei Khodakovsky","Nathan Litke","Peter Schr\u00f6der"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 22","Issue 3","July 2003","pp   350\u2013357","https://doi.org/10.1145/882262.882275"],"date":"01 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"BIERMANN, H., MARTIN, I., BERNARDINI, F., AND ZORIN, D. 2002.

The key idea is to carry along with the computation an explicit representation of the required rounding accuracy.We begin with the simpler problem of converting fixed-point fractions. A modification of the well-known algorithm for radix-conversion of fixed-point fractions by multiplication explicitly determines when to terminate the conversion process; a variable number of digits are produced. The algorithm has these properties:\u2022 No information is lost; the original fraction can be recovered from the output by rounding.\u2022 No \"garbage digits\" are produced.\u2022 The output is correctly rounded.\u2022 It is never necessary to propagate carries on rounding.We then derive two algorithms for free-format out-put of floating-point numbers. The first simply scales the given floating-point number to an appropriate fractional range and then applies the algorithm for fractions. This is quite fast and simple to code but has inaccuracies stemming from round-off errors and oversimplification. The second algorithm guarantees mathematical accuracy by using multiple-precision integer arithmetic and handling special cases. Both algorithms produce no more digits than necessary (intuitively, the \"1.3 prints as 1.2999999\" problem does not occur).Finally, we modify the free-format conversion algorithm for use in fixed-format applications. Information may be lost if the fixed format provides too few digit positions, but the output is always correctly rounded. On the other hand, no \"garbage digits\" are ever produced, even if the fixed format specifies too many digit positions (intuitively, the \"4/3 prints as 1.333333328366279602\" problem does not occur).","author":["Guy L.

One approach for addressing this phase ordering problem is to use an evolutionary algorithm to search for a specific sequence of phases for each module or function. While such searches have been shown to produce more efficient code, the approach can be extremely slow because the application is compiled and executed to evaluate each sequence's effectiveness. Consequently, evolutionary or iterative compilation schemes have been promoted for compilation systems targeting embedded applications where longer compilation times may be tolerated in the final stage of development. In this paper we describe two complementary general approaches for achieving faster searches for effective optimization sequences when using a genetic algorithm. The first approach reduces the search time by avoiding unnecessary executions of the application when possible. Results indicate search time reductions of 65% on average, often reducing searches from hours to minutes. The second approach modifies the search so fewer generations are required to achieve the same results. Measurements show that the average number of required generations decreased by 68%. These improvements have the potential for making evolutionary compilation a viable choice for tuning embedded applications.","author":["Prasad Kulkarni","Stephen Hines","Jason Hiser","David Whalley","Jack Davidson","Douglas Jones"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 39","Issue 6","May 2004","pp   171\u2013182","https://doi.org/10.1145/996893.996863"],"date":"09 June 2004","ref":[{"text":"M.

Many enterprises are shifting away from deploying their analytical databases on high-end proprietary machines, and moving towards cheaper, lower-end, commodity hardware, typically arranged in a shared-nothing MPP architecture, often in a virtualized environment inside public or private \"clouds\". At the same time, the amount of data that needs to be analyzed is exploding, requiring hundreds to thousands of machines to work in parallel to perform the analysis.There tend to be two schools of thought regarding what technology to use for data analysis in such an environment. Proponents of parallel databases argue that the strong emphasis on performance and efficiency of parallel databases makes them well-suited to perform such analysis. On the other hand, others argue that MapReduce-based systems are better suited due to their superior scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility to handle unstructured data. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of building a hybrid system that takes the best features from both technologies; the prototype we built approaches parallel databases in performance and efficiency, yet still yields the scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility of MapReduce-based systems.","author":["Azza Abouzeid","Kamil Bajda-Pawlikowski","Daniel Abadi","Avi Silberschatz","Alexander Rasin"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 2","Issue 1","August 2009","pp   922\u2013933","https://doi.org/10.14778/1687627.1687731"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"Hadoop.

In this paper, we study the problem of vector similarity join size estimation (VSJ). It is a generalization of the previously studied set similarity join size estimation (SSJ) problem and can handle more interesting cases such as TF-IDF vectors. One of the key challenges in similarity join size estimation is that the join size can change dramatically depending on the input similarity threshold.We propose a sampling based algorithm that uses Locality-Sensitive-Hashing (LSH). The proposed algorithm LSH-SS uses an LSH index to enable effective sampling even at high thresholds. We compare the proposed technique with random sampling and the state-of-the-art technique for SSJ (adapted to VSJ) and demonstrate LSH-SS offers more accurate estimates throughout the similarity threshold range and small variance using real-world data sets.","author":["Hongrae Lee","Raymond T.

Much work has been dedicated to supporting basic graph operations such as subgraph matching, reachability, regular expression matching, etc. In many cases, graph indices are employed to speed up query processing. Typically, most indices require either super-linear indexing time or super-linear indexing space. Unfortunately, for very large graphs, super-linear approaches are almost always infeasible. In this paper, we study the problem of subgraph matching on billion-node graphs. We present a novel algorithm that supports efficient subgraph matching for graphs deployed on a distributed memory store. Instead of relying on super-linear indices, we use efficient graph exploration and massive parallel computing for query processing. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of performing subgraph matching on web-scale graph data.","author":["Zhao Sun","Hongzhi Wang","Haixun Wang","Bin Shao","Jianzhong Li"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 5","Issue 9","May 2012","pp   788\u2013799","https://doi.org/10.14778/2311906.2311907"],"date":"01 May 2012","ref":[{"text":"http://neo4j.org/.","order":1},{"text":"http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics.","order":2},{"text":"http://www.infinitegraph.com/.","order":3},{"text":"C.

In the past few years, however, not just big data, but fast data has also exploded in volume and availability. Examples of such data include sensor data streams, the Twitter Firehose, and Facebook updates. Numerous applications must process fast data. Can we provide a MapReduce-style framework so that developers can quickly write such applications and execute them over a cluster of machines, to achieve low latency and high scalability?In this paper we report on our investigation of this question, as carried out at Kosmix and WalmartLabs. We describe MapUpdate, a framework like MapReduce, but specifically developed for fast data. We describe Muppet, our implementation of MapUpdate. Throughout the description we highlight the key challenges, argue why MapReduce is not well suited to address them, and briefly describe our current solutions. Finally, we describe our experience and lessons learned with Muppet, which has been used extensively at Kosmix and WalmartLabs to power a broad range of applications in social media and e-commerce.","author":["Wang Lam","Lu Liu","Sts Prasad","Anand Rajaraman","Zoheb Vacheri","AnHai Doan"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 5","Issue 12","August 2012","pp   1814\u20131825","https://doi.org/10.14778/2367502.2367520"],"date":"01 August 2012","ref":[{"text":"D.

First, the power consumption for analyzing sensor data must be low, since most wearables and portable devices are power-strapped. Second, the velocity of analyzing big data on these devices must be high, otherwise the limited local storage may overflow.This paper presents our hardware-software co-design of a classifier for wearables to detect a person's transportation mode (i.e., still, walking, running, biking, and on a vehicle). We particularly focus on addressing the big-data small-footprint requirement by designing a classifier that is low in both computational complexity and memory requirement. Together with a sensor-hub configuration, we are able to drastically reduce power consumption by 99%, while maintaining competitive mode-detection accuracy. The data used in the paper is made publicly available for conducting research.","author":["Meng-Chieh Yu","Tong Yu","Shao-Chen Wang","Chih-Jen Lin","Edward Y.

Today, the concept has been widely adopted in academia and industry and it is proven that it is feasible to run analytical queries on large data sets directly on a redundancy-free schema, eliminating the need to maintain pre-built aggregate tables during data entry transactions. The resulting reduction in transaction complexity leads to a dramatic simplification of data models and applications, redefining the way we build enterprise systems. First analyses of productive applications adopting this concept confirm that system architectures enabled by in-memory column stores are conceptually superior for business transaction processing compared to row-based approaches. Additionally, our analyses show a shift of enterprise workloads to even more read-oriented processing due to the elimination of updates of transaction-maintained aggregates.","author":["Hasso Plattner"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 13","August 2014","pp   1722\u20131729","https://doi.org/10.14778/2733004.2733074"],"date":"01 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"D.

Compared to systems that rely on disk storage, NVRAM-based systems promise significant improvements in performance for key applications like online transaction processing (OLTP). Unfortunately, NVRAM systems suffer from two drawbacks: their asymmetric read-write performance and the notable higher cost of the new memory technologies compared to disk. This paper investigates the cost-effective use of NVRAM in transaction systems. It shows that using NVRAM only for the logging subsystem (NV-Logging) provides much higher transactions per dollar than simply replacing all disk storage with NVRAM. Specifically, for NV-Logging, we show that the software overheads associated with centralized log buffers cause performance bottlenecks and limit scaling. The per-transaction logging methods described in the paper help avoid these overheads, enabling concurrent logging for multiple transactions. Experimental results with a faithful emulation of future NVRAM-based servers using the TPCC, TATP, and TPCB benchmarks show that NV-Logging improves throughput by 1.42 - 2.72x over the costlier option of replacing all disk storage with NVRAM. Results also show that NV-Logging performs 1.21 - 6.71x better than when logs are placed into the PMFS NVRAM-optimized file system. Compared to state-of-the-art distributed logging, NV-Logging delivers 20.4% throughput improvements.","author":["Jian Huang","Karsten Schwan","Moinuddin K.

Recently, Intel Many Integrated Core (MIC) co-processors (commonly known as Xeon Phi) embrace emerging x86 single-chip many-core techniques. Compared with contemporary multi-core CPUs, Xeon Phi has quite different architectural features: wider SIMD instructions, many cores and hardware contexts, as well as lower-frequency in-order cores. In this paper, we experimentally revisit the state-of-the-art hash join algorithms on Xeon Phi co-processors. In particular, we study two camps of hash join algorithms: hardware-conscious ones that advocate careful tailoring of the join algorithms to underlying hardware architectures and hardware-oblivious ones that omit such careful tailoring. For each camp, we study the impact of architectural features and software optimizations on Xeon Phi in comparison with results on multi-core CPUs. Our experiments show two major findings on Xeon Phi, which are quantitatively different from those on multi-core CPUs. First, the impact of architectural features and software optimizations has quite different behavior on Xeon Phi in comparison with those on the CPU, which calls for new optimization and tuning on Xeon Phi. Second, hardware oblivious algorithms can outperform hardware conscious algorithms on a wide parameter window. These two findings further shed light on the design and implementation of query processing on new-generation single-chip many-core technologies.","author":["Saurabh Jha","Bingsheng He","Mian Lu","Xuntao Cheng","Huynh Phung Huynh"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 6","February 2015","pp   642\u2013653","https://doi.org/10.14778/2735703.2735704"],"date":"01 February 2015","ref":[{"text":"Hash functions. http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html.","order":1},{"text":"Intel xeon phi coprocessor 5110p: http://ark.intel.com/products/71992/intel-xeon-phi-coprocessor-5110p-8gb-1_053-ghz-60-core.","order":2},{"text":"Intel xeon processor e5-2687w: http://ark.intel.com/products/64582/intel-xeon-processor-e5-2687w-20m-cache-3_10-ghz-8_00-gts-intel-qpi.","order":3},{"text":"Mumurhash3. https://code.google.com/p/smhasher/wiki/MurmurHash3.","order":4},{"text":"Optimization and performance tuning for intel xeon phi coprocessors. https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/optimization-and-performance-tuning-for-intel-xeon-phi-coprocessors-part-2-understanding.","order":5},{"text":"C.

Today's DISC systems offer very little tooling for debugging programs, and as a result programmers spend countless hours collecting evidence (e.g., from log files) and performing trial and error debugging. To aid this effort, we built Titian, a library that enables data provenance---tracking data through transformations---in Apache Spark. Data scientists using the Titian Spark extension will be able to quickly identify the input data at the root cause of a potential bug or outlier result. Titian is built directly into the Spark platform and offers data provenance support at interactive speeds---orders-of-magnitude faster than alternative solutions---while minimally impacting Spark job performance; observed overheads for capturing data lineage rarely exceed 30% above the baseline job execution time.","author":["Matteo Interlandi","Kshitij Shah","Sai Deep Tetali","Muhammad Ali Gulzar","Seunghyun Yoo","Miryung Kim","Todd Millstein","Tyson Condie"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 9","Issue 3","November 2015","pp   216\u2013227","https://doi.org/10.14778/2850583.2850595"],"date":"01 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"Hadoop. http://hadoop.apache.org.","order":1},{"text":"Mllib. http://spark.apache.org/mllib.","order":2},{"text":"Spark. http://spark.apache.org.","order":3},{"text":"P.

YourSQL realizes very early filtering of data by offloading data scanning of a query to user-programmable solid-state drives. We implement our system on a recent branch of MariaDB (a variant of MySQL). In order to quantify the performance gains of YourSQL, we evaluate SQL queries with varying complexities. Our result shows that YourSQL reduces the execution time of the whole TPC-H queries by 3.6\u00d7, compared to a vanilla system. Moreover, the average speed-up of the five TPC-H queries with the largest performance gains reaches over 15\u00d7. Thanks to this significant reduction of execution time, we observe sizable energy savings. Our study demonstrates that the YourSQL approach, combining the power of early filtering with end-to-end datapath optimization, can accelerate large-scale analytic queries with lower energy consumption.","author":["Insoon Jo","Duck-Ho Bae","Andre S.

However, existing GPU-based databases fail to deal with big data applications efficiently: their execution model suffers from scalability limitations on GPUs whose memory capacity is limited; existing systems fail to consider the discrepancy between fast GPUs and slow storage, which can counteract the benefit of GPU accelerators.In this paper, we propose HippogriffDB, an efficient, scalable GPU-accelerated OLAP system. It tackles the bandwidth discrepancy using compression and an optimized data transfer path. HippogriffDB stores tables in a compressed format and uses the GPU for decompression, trading GPU cycles for the improved I/O bandwidth. To improve the data transfer efficiency, HippogriffDB introduces a peer-to-peer, multi-threaded data transfer mechanism, directly transferring data from the SSD to the GPU. HippogriffDB adopts a query-over-block execution model that provides scalability using a stream-based approach. The model improves kernel efficiency with the operator fusion and double buffering mechanism.We have implemented HippogriffDB using an NVMe SSD, which talks directly to a commercial GPU. Results on two popular benchmarks demonstrate its scalability and efficiency. HippogriffDB outperforms existing GPU-based databases (YDB) and in-memory data analytics (MonetDB) by 1-2 orders of magnitude.","author":["Jing Li","Hung-Wei Tseng","Chunbin Lin","Yannis Papakonstantinou","Steven Swanson"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 9","Issue 14","October 2016","pp   1647\u20131658","https://doi.org/10.14778/3007328.3007331"],"date":"01 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-specifications/ssd-dc-s3700-spec.pdf.","order":1},{"text":"http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-servers.html.","order":2},{"text":"https://developer.nvidia.com/gpudirect.","order":3},{"text":"http://blog.pmcs.com/project-donard-peer-to-peer-communication-with-nvm-express-devices-part-two.","order":4},{"text":"https://trademarks.justia.com/865/43/nvmedirect-86543720.html.","order":5},{"text":"D.

In recent years, these sophisticated probabilistic methods have been used with considerable success on most of the core tasks of natural language processing, for speech language models, and for IR tasks such as text filtering and categorization, but the methods and their relationships are often not well understood by practitioners. Our focus is on insight and understanding, using graphical illustrations rather than detailed derivations whenever possible. The goal of the tutorial is that the inner workings of these modeling and estimation techniques be transparent and intuitive, rather than black boxes labeled \"magic here\".The tutorial decomposes these methods into optimization problems on the one side, and optimization methods on the other. The first hour of the tutorial presents the basics of non-linear optimization, assuming only knowledge of basic calculus. We begin with a discussion of convexity and unconstrained optimization, focusing on gradient methods. We discuss in detail both simple gradient descent and the much more practical conjugate gradient descent. The key ideas are presented, including a comparison/contrast with alternative methods. Next, the case of constrained optimization is presented, highlighting the method of Lagrange multipliers and presenting several ways of translating the abstract ideas into a concrete optimization method. The principal goal, again, is to make Lagrange methods appear as intuitively natural, rather than as mathematical sleight-of-hand.The second part of the tutorial begins with a presentation of maximum entropy models from first principles, showing their equivalence to exponential models (also known as loglinear models, and particular versions of which give logistic regression, and conditional random fields). We present many simple examples to build intuition for what maxent models can and cannot do. Finally, we discuss how to find parameters for maximum entropy models using the previously presented optimization methods. By this point in the tutorial, audience members should have a clear understanding of how to build a system for estimating maxent models. We conclude with a discussion of issues specific to the language technology domain, including conditional estimation of generative models, and the issues involved in choosing model structure (such as independence, label and observation biases, and so on). We also discuss methods of smoothing, focusing on how smoothing works differently for maxent models than for standard relative-frequency-based distributions.The tutorial will run 3 hours, with a break in the middle. Participants will be assumed to know basic calculus and probability theory, and to have some exposure to models such as Naive Bayes and HMMs, but need only have a basic awareness of language technology problems.","author":["Christopher Manning","Dan Klein"],"issue":["NAACL-Tutorials '03: Proceedings of the 2003 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Human Language Technology: Tutorials - Volume 5","May 2003","Pages   8","https://doi.org/10.3115/1075168.1075176"],"date":"27 May 2003"},{"_id":"10.3115/1075671.1075690","title":"An overview of the SPHINX-II speech recognition system","abstract":"In the past year at Carnegie Mellon steady progress has been made in the area of acoustic and language modeling.

The SNN takes as input all the frames of a phonetic segment and gives as output an estimate of the probability of each of the phonemes, given the input segment. By taking into account all the frames of a phonetic segment simultaneously, the SNN overcomes the well-known conditional-independence limitation of hidden Markov models (HMM). However, the problem of automatic segmentation with neural nets is a formidable computing task compared to HMMs. Therefore, to take advantage of the training and decoding speed of HMMs, we have developed a novel hybrid SNN/HMM system that combines the advantages of both types of approaches. In this hybrid system, use is made of the N-best paradigm to generate likely phonetic segmentations, which are then scored by the SNN. The HMM and SNN scores are then combined to optimize performance. In this manner, the recognition accuracy is guaranteed to be no worse than the HMM system alone.","author":["S. Austin","J.

Although state of the art supervised systems report good accuracies for selected words, they have not been shown to be promising in terms of scalability. In this paper, we present an approach for learning coarser and more general set of concepts from a sense tagged corpus, in order to alleviate the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. We show that these general concepts can be transformed to fine grained word senses using simple heuristics, and applying the technique for recent SENSEVAL data sets shows that our approach can yield state of the art performance.","author":["Upali S.

This paper explores the text-based emotion prediction problem empirically, using supervised machine learning with the SNoW learning architecture. The goal is to classify the emotional affinity of sentences in the narrative domain of children's fairy tales, for subsequent usage in appropriate expressive rendering of text-to-speech synthesis. Initial experiments on a preliminary data set of 22 fairy tales show encouraging results over a na\u00efve baseline and BOW approach for classification of emotional versus non-emotional contents, with some dependency on parameter tuning. We also discuss results for a tripartite model which covers emotional valence, as well as feature set alternations. In addition, we present plans for a more cognitively sound sequential model, taking into consideration a larger set of basic emotions.","author":["Cecilia Ovesdotter Alm","Dan Roth","Richard Sproat"],"issue":["HLT '05: Proceedings of the conference on Human Language Technology and Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing","October 2005","Pages   579\u2013586","https://doi.org/10.3115/1220575.1220648"],"date":"06 October 2005","ref":[{"text":"Antti Aarne. 1964.

Recent advances in corpus-based manual and automatic training methods have shown promise in reducing the time and cost of this porting process. These developments have focused even greater attention on the bottleneck of acquiring reliable, manually tagged training data. This paper describes a new set of integrated tools, collectively called the Alembic Workbench, that uses a mixed-initiative approach to \"bootstrapping\" the manual tagging process, with the goal of reducing the overhead associated with corpus development. Initial empirical studies using the Alembic Workbench to annotate \"named entities\" demonstrates that this approach can approximately double the production rate. As an added benefit, the combined efforts of machine and user produce domain specific annotation rules that can be used to annotate similar texts automatically through the Alembic-NLP system. The ultimate goal of this project is to enable end users to generate a practical domain-specific information extraction system within a single session.","author":["David Day","John Aberdeen","Lynette Hirschman","Robyn Kozierok","Patricia Robinson","Marc Vilain"],"issue":["ANLC '97: Proceedings of the fifth conference on Applied natural language processing","March 1997","Pages   348\u2013355","https://doi.org/10.3115/974557.974608"],"date":"31 March 1997","ref":[{"text":"John Aberdeen, John Burger, David Day, Lynette Hirschman, David Palmer, Patricia Robinson, and Marc Vilain. 1996.

Encouraging results have been obtained by testing the predictor on unknown words from the Brown corpus. The relative value of information sources such as affixes and context is discussed.

ReVirt removes the dependency on the target operating system by moving it into a virtual machine and logging below the virtual machine. This allows ReVirt to replay the system's execution before, during, and after an intruder compromises the system, even if the intruder replaces the target operating system. ReVirt logs enough information to replay a long-term execution of the virtual machine instruction-by-instruction. This enables it to provide arbitrarily detailed observations about what transpired on the system, even in the presence of non-deterministic attacks and executions. ReVirt adds reasonable time and space overhead. Overheads due to virtualization are imperceptible for interactive use and CPU-bound workloads, and 13--58% for kernel-intensive workloads. Logging adds 0--8% overhead, and logging traffic for our workloads can be stored on a single disk for several months.","author":["George W. Dunlap","Samuel T. King","Sukru Cinar","Murtaza A.

Recently, semi-Markov models have been applied to the problem, incorporating features based on complete words. In this paper, we propose an alternative, a latent variable model, which uses hybrid information based on both word sequences and character sequences. We argue that the use of latent variables can help capture long range dependencies and improve the recall on segmenting long words, e.g., named-entities. Experimental results show that this is indeed the case. With this improvement, evaluations on the data of the second SIGHAN CWS bakeoff show that our system is competitive with the best ones in the literature.","author":["Xu Sun","Yaozhong Zhang","Takuya Matsuzaki","Yoshimasa Tsuruoka","Jun'ichi Tsujii"],"issue":["NAACL '09: Proceedings of Human Language Technologies: The 2009 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics","May 2009","Pages   56\u201364"],"date":"31 May 2009","ref":[{"text":"Galen Andrew. 2006.
