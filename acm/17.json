Advantages of generic and generative techniques are, among other things, the high degree of reusability of systems parts and the reduction of development costs. Furthermore, generative methods can be used for the development or realization of novel learning models. In this paper, we discuss such a learning model that propagates a new way of explorative learning in computer science education with the help of generators. A realization of this model represents the educational software GANIFA on the theory of generating finite automata from regular expressions. In addition to the educational system's description, we present an evaluation of this system.","author":["Andreas Kerren"],"issue":["ITiCSE '04: Proceedings of the 9th annual SIGCSE conference on Innovation and technology in computer science education","June 2004","Pages   77\u201381","https://doi.org/10.1145/1007996.1008019"],"date":"28 June 2004","ref":[{"text":"P.

Previously, query logs have been studied from a single, cumulative view. In contrast, our analysis shows changes in popularity and uniqueness of topically categorized queries across the hours of the day. We examine query traffic on an hourly basis by matching it against lists of queries that have been topically pre-categorized by human editors. This represents 13% of the query traffic. We show that query traffic from particular topical categories differs both from the query stream as a whole and from other categories. This analysis provides valuable insight for improving retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. It is also relevant to the development of enhanced query disambiguation, routing, and caching algorithms.","author":["Steven M. Beitzel","Eric C.

In particular, the use of energy consuming memory, SDRAM, has become burdensome in battery-powered embedded systems. Intuitively, though demand paging can be used to mitigate the increasing requirement of main memory size, its applicability should be deliberately elaborated since NAND flash memory has asymmetric operation characteristics in terms of performance and energy consumption.In this paper, we present energy-aware demand paging technique to lower the energy consumption of embedded systems considering the characteristics of interactive embedded applications with large memory footprints. We also propose a flash memory-aware page replacement policy that can reduce the number of write and erase operations in NAND flash memory. With real-life workloads, we show the system-wide Energy\u00b7Delay can be reduced by 15~30% compared to the traditional shadowing architecture.","author":["Chanik Park","Jeong-Uk Kang","Seon-Yeong Park","Jin-Soo Kim"],"issue":["ISLPED '04: Proceedings of the 2004 international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2004","Pages   338\u2013343","https://doi.org/10.1145/1013235.1013317"],"date":"09 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"http://www.flash-memory-store.com/ibmmicrodrives.html.","order":1},{"text":"V.

The key ingredient of our method is the design of a suitable kernel or similarity function between user-item pairs that allows simultaneous generalization across the user and item dimensions.

XOM provides support for encryption/decryption and integrity checking. However, neither XOM nor any other current approach adequately addresses the problem of information leakage via the address bus. This paper shows that without address bus protection, the XOM model is severely crippled. Two realistic attacks are shown and experiments show that 70% of the code might be cracked and sensitive data might be exposed leading to serious security breaches.Although the problem of address bus leakage has been widely acknowledged both in industry and academia, no practical solution has ever been proposed that can provide an adequate security guarantee. The main reason is that the problem is very difficult to solve in practice due to severe performance degradation which accompanies most of the solutions. This paper presents an infrastructure called HIDE (Hardware-support for leakage-Immune Dynamic Execution) which provides a solution consisting of chunk-level protection with hardware support and a flexible interface which can be orchestrated through the proposed compiler optimization and user specifications that allow utilizing underlying hardware solution more efficiently to provide better security guarantees.Our results show that protecting both data and code with a high level of security guarantee is possible with negligible performance penalty (1.3% slowdown).","author":["Xiaotong Zhuang","Tao Zhang","Santosh Pande"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 39","Issue 11","November 2004","pp   72\u201384","https://doi.org/10.1145/1037187.1024403"],"date":"07 October 2004","ref":[{"text":"D.Lie, C.Thekkath, M.Mitchell, P.Lincoln, D.Boneh, J.Mitchell, M.Horowitz, \"Architectural Support for Copy and Tamper Resistant Software,\" International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, Nov. 2000.]]","doi":"10.1145/378993.379237","order":1},{"text":"D.Lie, C.Thekkath, M.Horowitz, \"Implementing an Untrusted Operating System on Trusted Hardware,\" 19th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP 2003), Oct. 2003.]]","doi":"10.1145/945445.945463","order":2},{"text":"J.Yang, Y.Zhang, L.Gao, \"Fast Secure Processor for Inhibiting Software Piracy and Tampering,\" International Symposium on Microarchitecture, Dec. 2003.]]","doi":"10.5555/956417.956576","order":3},{"text":"E.Suh, D.Clarke, B.Gassend, M.v.Dijk, S.Devadas, \"Efficient Memory Integrity Verification and Encryption for Secure Processors\", International Symposium on Microarchitecture, Dec. 2003.]]","doi":"10.5555/956417.956575","order":4},{"text":"B.Gassend, G.E.Suh, D.Clarke, M.v.Dijk, S.Devadas, \"Caches and Hash Trees for Efficient Memory Integrity Verification\", International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture, Feb. 2003.]]","doi":"10.5555/822080.822806","order":5},{"text":"G.E.Suh, D.Clarke, B.Gassend, M.v.Dijk, S.Devadas, \"AEGIS: Architecture for Tamper-Evident and Tamper-Resistant Processing,\" International Conference on Supercomputing, Jun. 2003.]]","doi":"10.1145/782814.782838","order":6},{"text":"M.G.Kuhn, \"Cipher Instruction Search Attack on the Bus-Encryption Security Microcontroller DS5002FP,\" IEEE Transaction on Computers, Vol.47, No.10, pp.1153--1157, 1998.]]","doi":"10.1109/12.729797","order":7},{"text":"M.Kuhn, \"The TrustNo 1 Cryptoprocessor Concept,\" CS555 Report, Purdue Univ. 1997.]]","order":8},{"text":"O.Goldreich, \"Towards a Theory of Software Protection and Simulation by Oblivious RAMs,\" The 19th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), 1987.]]","doi":"10.1145/28395.28416","order":9},{"text":"O.Goldreich, R.

Network security system use techniques such as deep packet inspection to detect the harmful packets. While software intrusion detection system running on general purpose processors can be updated in response to new attacks. They lack the processing power to monitor gigabit networks. We present a high performance pattern matching co-processor architecture that can be used to monitor and identify a large number of intrusion signature. The design consists of a bank of pattern matchers that are used to implement a highly concurrent filter. The pattern matchers can be programmed to match multiple patterns of various lengths, and are able to leverage the existing databases of threat signatures. We have been able to program the filters to match all the payload patterns defined in the widely used Snort network intrusion detection system at a rate above 7 Gbps, with memory space left to accommodate threat signatures that become available in the future.","author":["Young H.

It has been developed on top of PETSc and enforces the same programming paradigm.The emphasis of the software is on methods and techniques appropriate for problems in which the associated matrices are sparse, for example, those arising after the discretization of partial differential equations. Therefore, most of the methods offered by the library are projection methods such as Arnoldi or Lanczos, or other methods with similar properties. SLEPc provides basic methods as well as more sophisticated algorithms. It also provides built-in support for spectral transformations such as the shift-and-invert technique. SLEPc is a general library in the sense that it covers standard and generalized eigenvalue problems, both Hermitian and non-Hermitian, with either real or complex arithmetic.SLEPc can be easily applied to real world problems. To illustrate this, several case studies arising from real applications are presented and solved with SLEPc with little programming effort. The addressed problems include a matrix-free standard problem, a complex generalized problem, and a singular value decomposition. The implemented codes exhibit good properties regarding flexibility as well as parallel performance.","author":["Vicente Hernandez","Jose E.

We argue that the root of these problems lies in the complexity of the control and management planes--the software and protocols coordinating network elements--and particularly the way the decision logic and the distributed-systems issues are inexorably intertwined. We advocate a complete refactoring of the functionality and propose three key principles--network-level objectives, network-wide views, and direct control--that we believe should underlie a new architecture. Following these principles, we identify an extreme design point that we call \"4D,\" after the architecture's four planes: decision, dissemination, discovery, and data. The 4D architecture completely separates an AS's decision logic from pro-tocols that govern the interaction among network elements. The AS-level objectives are specified in the decision plane, and en-forced through direct configuration of the state that drives how the data plane forwards packets. In the 4D architecture, the routers and switches simply forward packets at the behest of the decision plane, and collect measurement data to aid the decision plane in controlling the network. Although 4D would involve substantial changes to today's control and management planes, the format of data packets does not need to change; this eases the deployment path for the 4D architecture, while still enabling substantial innovation in network control and management. We hope that exploring an extreme design point will help focus the attention of the research and industrial communities on this crucially important and intellectually challenging area.","author":["Albert Greenberg","Gisli Hjalmtysson","David A.

MMMF can be formulated as a semi-definite programming (SDP) and learned using standard SDP solvers. However, current SDP solvers can only handle MMMF problems on matrices of dimensionality up to a few hundred. Here, we investigate a direct gradient-based optimization method for MMMF and demonstrate it on large collaborative prediction problems. We compare against results obtained by Marlin (2004) and find that MMMF substantially outperforms all nine methods he tested.","author":["Jasson D. M.

Then, we apply the B*-tree based floorplanning technique to solve the SoC test scheduling problem. Experimental results based on the ITC'02 benchmarks show that our method is very effective and efficient---our method obtains the best results ever reported for SoC test scheduling with power constraint in every efficient running time.

The vast majority of this work has focused on triangular remeshing, yet quadrilateral meshes are preferred for many surface PDE problems, especially fluid dynamics, and are best suited for defining Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces. We describe a fundamentally new approach to the quadrangulation of manifold polygon meshes using Laplacian eigenfunctions, the natural harmonics of the surface. These surface functions distribute their extrema evenly across a mesh, which connect via gradient flow into a quadrangular base mesh. An iterative relaxation algorithm simultaneously refines this initial complex to produce a globally smooth parameterization of the surface. From this, we can construct a well-shaped quadrilateral mesh with very few extraordinary vertices. The quality of this mesh relies on the initial choice of eigenfunction, for which we describe algorithms and hueristics to efficiently and effectively select the harmonic most appropriate for the intended application.","author":["Shen Dong","Peer-Timo Bremer","Michael Garland","Valerio Pascucci","John C.

Modern FPGAs already have a significant amount of memory on the die, and with each generation the proportion of embedded memory to logic cells is growing. While assigning high Vth can limit the leakage power, embedded memory timing is critical to performance and will draw an increasingly significant amount of leakage current. However, unlike in many processor based systems, on-chip memory accesses are often fully deterministic and completely under the control of the scheduler. In this paper we explore a variety of techniques to battle the problem of leakage in FPGA embedded memories that range in complexity and effectiveness. Through the addition of sleep and drowsy modes, controlled by the scheduler, the amount of leakage power can be reduced by several orders of magnitude. We show how even very simple schemes offer large amounts of benefit, and that further reductions are possible through careful leakage-aware data placement.","author":["Yan Meng","Timothy Sherwood","Ryan Kastner"],"issue":["DAC '06: Proceedings of the 43rd annual Design Automation Conference","July 2006","Pages   612\u2013617","https://doi.org/10.1145/1146909.1147067"],"date":"24 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"Altera press releases and device data sheets. http://www.altera.com.","order":1},{"text":"Xilinx press releases and device data sheets. http://www.xilinx.com.","order":2},{"text":"A.Gayasen, Y.Tsai, N.

One promising option is 3D architectures where a stack of multiple device layers with direct vertical tunneling through them are put together on the same chip. As fabrication of 3D integrated circuits has become viable, developing CAD tools and architectural techniques is imperative to explore the design space to 3D microarchitectures. In this article, we give a brief introduction to 3D integration technology, discuss the EDA design tools that can enable the adoption of 3D ICs, and present the implementation of various microprocessor components using 3D technology.

The system is designed for flash-based implementations of Java Card, a variant of the Java platform for smart cards. In the Java Card platform, objects are persistent by default. The platform supports transactions: a sequence of accesses to objects can be explicitly declared to constitute a transaction. TinyStore supports explicit transactions and atomically executes individual accesses that are not part of transactions; it also supports garbage collection, even on systems with a small constant amount of ram. TinyStore uses a novel approach and specialized data structures to efficiently manage flash memory. We demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing it to a traditional eeprom-based memory management system for Java Cards.","author":["Michal Spivak","Sivan Toledo"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 41","Issue 7","July 2006","pp   22\u201333","https://doi.org/10.1145/1159974.1134655"],"date":"14 June 2006","ref":[{"text":"M.

We believe this should be addressed through higher-level models of concurrency that eliminate many of the usual challenges, such as nondeterminism arising from races.The shim model of computation provides deterministic concurrency, and there already exist ways of implementing it in hardware and software. In this work, we describe how to produce more efficient C code from shim systems.We propose two techniques: a largely mechanical one that produces tail-recursive code for simulating concurrency, and a more clever one that statically analyzes the communication pattern of multiple processes to produce code with far less overhead. Experimentally, we find our tail-recursive technique produces code that runs roughly twice as fast as a baseline; our statically-scheduled code can run up to twelve times faster.","author":["Stephen A.

The need for upsizing imposes an energy overhead, influencing the optimal supply voltage to minimize energy. Finally, we characterize performance variability by summing delay distributions of each stage in an arbitrary critical path and achieve results accurate to within 10% of Monte Carlo simulation.","author":["Joyce Kwong","Anantha P.

We predict an improvement in task efficiency and fluency compared to a purely reactive process.We then present results from a study involving untrained human subjects working with a simulated version of a robot using our system. We show a significant improvement in best-case task efficiency when compared to a group of users working with a reactive agent, as well as a significant difference in the perceived commitment of the robot to the team and its contribution to the team's uency and success.

Different granularities in space management impose different management costs and mapping efficiency.

The objective is to provide good performance in address mapping and space utilization and, at the same time, to have the memory space requirements, and the garbage collection overhead under proper management. The experimental results show that the proposed adaptive mechanism could provide significant performance improvement over the well-known coarsegrained management mechanism NFTL (NAND Flash Translation Layer) over realistic workloads.","author":["Chin-Hsien Wu","Tei-Wei Kuo"],"issue":["ICCAD '06: Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE/ACM international conference on Computer-aided design","November 2006","Pages   601\u2013606","https://doi.org/10.1145/1233501.1233624"],"date":"05 November 2006","ref":[{"text":"R.

For such applications, the majority of lines traverse from the MRU position to the LRU position without receiving any cache hits, resulting in inefficient use of cache space. Cache performance can be improved if some fraction of the working set is retained in the cache so that at least that fraction of the working set can contribute to cache hits. We show that simple changes to the insertion policy can significantly reduce cache misses for memory-intensive workloads. We propose the LRU Insertion Policy (LIP) which places the incoming line in the LRU position instead of the MRU position. LIP protects the cache from thrashing and results in close to optimal hitrate for applications that have a cyclic reference pattern. We also propose the Bimodal Insertion Policy (BIP) as an enhancement of LIP that adapts to changes in the working set while maintaining the thrashing protection of LIP. We finally propose a Dynamic Insertion Policy (DIP) to choose between BIP and the traditional LRU policy depending on which policy incurs fewer misses. The proposed insertion policies do not require any change to the existing cache structure, are trivial to implement, and have a storage requirement of less than two bytes. We show that DIP reduces the average MPKI of the baseline 1MB 16-way L2 cache by 21%, bridging two-thirds of the gap between LRU and OPT.","author":["Moinuddin K. Qureshi","Aamer Jaleel","Yale N.

One disadvantage of flash memory is that prewritten data cannot be dynamically overwritten. Before overwriting prewritten data, a time-consuming erase operation on the used blocks must precede, which significantly degrades the overall write performance of flash memory. In order to solve this \u201cerase-before-write\u201d problem, the flash memory controller can be integrated with a software module, called \u201cflash translation layer (FTL).\u201d Among many FTL schemes available, the log block buffer scheme is considered to be optimum. With this scheme, a small number of log blocks, a kind of write buffer, can improve the performance of write operations by reducing the number of erase operations. However, this scheme can suffer from low space utilization of log blocks. In this paper, we show that there is much room for performance improvement in the log buffer block scheme, and propose an enhanced log block buffer scheme, called FAST (full associative sector translation). Our FAST scheme improves the space utilization of log blocks using fully-associative sector translations for the log block sectors. We also show empirically that our FAST scheme outperforms the pure log block buffer scheme.","author":["Sang-Won Lee","Dong-Joo Park","Tae-Sun Chung","Dong-Ho Lee","Sangwon Park","Ha-Joo Song"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 6","Issue 3","July 2007","pp   18\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.1145/1275986.1275990"],"date":"01 July 2007","ref":[{"text":"Ban, A. 1995.

However, all the optimal algorithms for the computation of the exact Euclidean DT (EDT) were proposed only since the 1990s. In this work, state-of-the-art sequential 2D EDT algorithms are reviewed and compared, in an effort to reach more solid conclusions regarding their differences in speed and their exactness. Six of the best algorithms were fully implemented and compared in practice.","author":["Ricardo Fabbri","Luciano Da F. Costa","Julio C. Torelli","Odemir M.

The representtions are approximations to the original term space encoding, and are found using the matrix technique of Singular Value Decomposition. In comparison Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) is a class of data analysis techniques for representing data points as points in a multidimensional real-valued space. The objects are represented so that inter-point similarities in the space match inter-object similarity information provided by the researcher. We illustrate how the document representations given by LSI are equivalent to the optimal representations found when solving a particular MDS problem in which the given inter-object similarity  information is provided by the inner product similarities between the documents themselves. We further analyze a more general MDS problem in which the interdocument similarity information, although still in inner product form is arbitrary with respect to the vector space encoding of the documents.","author":["Brian T.

Our research purpose established a design guideline for SRT in communication robots. The first experiment observed user preferences toward different SRTs in interaction with a robot. In other existing user interfaces, faster response is usually preferred. In contrast, our experimental result indicated that user preference for SRT in a communication robot is highest at one second, and user preference ratings level off at two seconds. However, a robot cannot always respond in such a short time as one or two seconds. Thus, the important question is \"What should a robot do if it cannot respond quickly enough?\" The second experiment tested the effectiveness of a conversational filler: behavior to notify listeners that the robot is going to respond. In Japanese \"etto\" is used to buy time to think and resembles \"well...\" and \"uh...\" In English. We used the same strategy in a communication robot to shadow system response time. Our results indicated that using a conversational filler by the robot moderated the user's impression toward a long SRT.","author":["Toshiyuki Shiwa","Takayuki Kanda","Michita Imai","Hiroshi Ishiguro","Norihiro Hagita"],"issue":["HRI '08: Proceedings of the 3rd ACM/IEEE international conference on Human robot interaction","March 2008","Pages   153\u2013160","https://doi.org/10.1145/1349822.1349843"],"date":"12 March 2008","ref":[{"text":"H.

We present a data-centric solution to memory corruption called critical memory, a memory model that allows programmers to identify and protect data that is critical for correct program execution. Critical memory defines operations to consistently read and update critical data, and ensures that other non-critical updates in the program will not corrupt it. We also present Samurai, a runtime system that implements critical memory in software. Samurai uses replication and forward error correction to provide probabilistic guarantees of critical memory semantics. Because Samurai does not modify memory operations on non-critical data, the majority of memory operations in programs run at full speed, and Samurai is compatible with third party libraries. Using both applications, including a Web server, and libraries (an STL list class and a memory allocator), we evaluate the performance overhead and fault tolerance that Samurai provides. We find that Samurai is a useful and practical approach for the majority of the applications and libraries considered.","author":["Karthik Pattabiraman","Vinod Grover","Benjamin G.

In this paper, we analyzed and modeled the failure probabilities of STT MRAM cells due to parameter variations. Based on the model, we developed an efficient simulation tool to capture the coupled electro/magnetic dynamics of spintronic device, leading to effective prediction for memory yield. We also developed a statistical optimization methodology to minimize the memory failure probability.

However, typical design practices used for super-threshold operation are not necessarily compatible with the low voltage regime. Here, radically different guidelines may be needed since existing process technologies have been optimized for super-threshold operation. We therefore study the selection of the optimal technology in ultra low voltage designs to achieve minimum energy and minimum variability which are among foremost concerns. We investigate five industrial technologies, from 250nm to 65nm. We demonstrate that mature technologies are often the best choice in very low voltage applications, saving as much as ~1800X in total energy consumption compared to a poorly selected technology. In parallel, the effect of technology choice on variability is investigated, when operating at the energy optimal design point. The results show up to a 4X improvement in delay variation due to global process shift and mismatch when using the most advanced technologies despite their large variability at nominal Vdd.","author":["Mingoo Seok","Dennis Sylvester","David Blaauw"],"issue":["ISLPED '08: Proceedings of the 2008 international symposium on Low Power Electronics & Design","August 2008","Pages   9\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/1393921.1393930"],"date":"11 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"M.

A unique feature of this model is that it is not based on adding physical or virtual channels to network topologies (though it can be applied to networks with extra channels). Instead, the model is based on analyzing the directions in which packets can turn in a network and the cycles that the turns can form. Prohibiting just enough turns to break all of the cycles produces routing algorithms that are deadlock free, livelock free, minimal or nonminimal, and maximally adaptive for the network. In this paper, we focus on the two most common network topologies for wormhole routing, n-dimensional mesh, just a quarter of the  turns must be prohibited to prevent deadlock. The remaining three quarters of the turns permit partial adaptiveness in routing. Partially adaptive routing algorithms are described for 2D meshes, n-dimensional meshes, k-ary n-cubes, and hypercubes. Simulations of partially adaptive and nonadaptive routing algorithms for 2D meshes and hypercubes show that which algorithm has the lowest latencies and highest sustainable throughput depends on the pattern of message traffic. For nonuniform traffic, partially adaptive routing algorithms perform better than non-adaptive ones.","author":["Christopher J. Glass","Lionel M.

Data access redundancy is used as the metric to determine the optimal implementation for both the stencil-only computation, as well as the discretization of the wave equation, which is currently of great interest in seismic computing. For the larger stencils, the described approach achieves the throughput of between 2,400 to over 3,000 million of output points per second on a single Tesla 10-series GPU. This is roughly an order of magnitude higher than a 4-core Harpertown CPU running a similar code from seismic industry. Multi-GPU parallelization is also described, achieving linear scaling with GPUs by overlapping inter-GPU communication with computation.","author":["Paulius Micikevicius"],"issue":["GPGPU-2: Proceedings of 2nd Workshop on General Purpose Processing on Graphics Processing Units","March 2009","Pages   79\u201384","https://doi.org/10.1145/1513895.1513905"],"date":"08 March 2009","ref":[{"text":"Baysal, E., Kosloff, D.

Despite this, GPU virtualization is a nascent field of research. This paper introduces a taxonomy of strategies for GPU virtualization and describes in detail the specific GPU virtualization architecture developed for VMware's hosted products (VMware Workstation and VMware Fusion).We analyze the performance of our GPU virtualization with a combination of applications and microbenchmarks. We also compare against software rendering, the GPU virtualization in Parallels Desktop 3.0, and the native GPU. We find that taking advantage of hardware acceleration significantly closes the gap between pure emulation and native, but that different implementations and host graphics stacks show distinct variation. The microbenchmarks show that our architecture amplifies the overheads in the traditional graphics API bottlenecks: draw calls, downloading buffers, and batch sizes.Our virtual GPU architecture runs modern graphics-intensive games and applications at interactive frame rates while preserving virtual machine portability. The applications we tested achieve from 86% to 12% of native rates and 43 to 18 frames per second with VMware Fusion 2.0.","author":["Micah Dowty","Jeremy Sugerman"],"issue":["ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","Volume 43","Issue 3","July 2009","pp   73\u201382","https://doi.org/10.1145/1618525.1618534"],"date":"31 July 2009","ref":[{"text":"D.

In contrast to the uniform regularity of dense linear algebra, sparse operations encounter a broad spectrum of matrices ranging from the regular to the highly irregular. Harnessing the tremendous potential of throughput-oriented processors for sparse operations requires that we expose substantial fine-grained parallelism and impose sufficient regularity on execution paths and memory access patterns. We explore SpMV methods that are well-suited to throughput-oriented architectures like the GPU and which exploit several common sparsity classes. The techniques we propose are efficient, successfully utilizing large percentages of peak bandwidth. Furthermore, they deliver excellent total throughput, averaging 16 GFLOP/s and 10 GFLOP/s in double precision for structured grid and unstructured mesh matrices, respectively, on a GeForce GTX 285.

We describe an optimized implementation of semantic indexing and document search on manycore GPU platforms. We observed that a parallel implementation of semantic indexing on a 128-core Tesla C870 GPU is only 2.4X faster than a sequential implementation on an Intel Xeon 2.4GHz processor. We ascribe the less than spectacular speedup to a mismatch in the workload characteristics of semantic indexing and the unique architectural features of GPUs. Compared to the regular numerical computations that have been ported to GPUs with great success, our semantic indexing algorithm (the recently proposed Supervised Semantic Indexing algorithm called SSI) has interesting characteristics -- the amount of parallelism in each training instance is data-dependent, and each iteration involves the product of a dense matrix with a sparse vector, resulting in random memory access patterns. As a result, we observed that the baseline GPU implementation significantly under-utilizes the hardware resources (processing elements and memory bandwidth) of the GPU platform. However, the SSI algorithm also demonstrates unique characteristics, which we collectively refer to as the \"forgiving nature\" of the algorithm. These unique characteristics allow for novel optimizations that do not strive to preserve numerical equivalence of each training iteration with the sequential implementation. In particular, we consider best-effort computing techniques, such as dependency relaxation and computation dropping, to suitably alter the workload characteristics of SSI to leverage the unique architectural features of the GPU. We also show that the realization of dependency relaxation and computation dropping concepts on a GPU is quite different from how one would implement these concepts on a multicore CPU, largely due to the distinct architectural features supported by a GPU. Our new techniques dramatically enhance the amount of parallel workload, leading to much higher performance on the GPU. By optimizing data transfers between CPU and GPU, and by reducing GPU kernel invocation overheads, we achieve further performance gains. We evaluated our new GPU-accelerated implementation of semantic document search on a database of over 1.8 million documents from Wikipedia. By applying our novel performance-enhancing strategies, our GPU implementation on a 128-core Tesla C870 achieved a 5.5X acceleration as compared to a baseline parallel implementation on the same GPU. Compared to a baseline parallel TBB implementation on a dual-socket quad-core Intel Xeon multicore CPU (8-cores), the enhanced GPU implementation is 11X faster. Compared to a parallel implementation on the same multi-core CPU that also uses data dependency relaxation and dropping computation techniques, our enhanced GPU implementation is 5X faster.","author":["Surendra Byna","Jiayuan Meng","Anand Raghunathan","Srimat Chakradhar","Srihari Cadambi"],"issue":["GPGPU-3: Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on General-Purpose Computation on Graphics Processing Units","March 2010","Pages   86\u201393","https://doi.org/10.1145/1735688.1735705"],"date":"14 March 2010","ref":[{"text":"Bing Bai, Jason Weston, David Grangier, Ronan Collobert, Kunihiko Sadamasa, Yanjun Qi, Olivier Chapelle, Kilian Weinberger, \"Supervised semantic indexing\", Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management (CIKM), November 2009.","doi":"10.1145/1645953.1645979","order":1},{"text":"A.

NATURE is one such architecture that we have proposed recently. It comprises CMOS reconfigurable logic and CMOS fabrication-compatible nano RAMs. It uses distributed high-density and fast nano RAMs as on-chip storage for storing multiple reconfiguration copies, enabling fine-grain cycle-by-cycle reconfiguration. It supports a highly efficient computational model, called temporal logic folding, which makes possible more than an order of magnitude improvement in logic density and area-delay product, significant power reduction, and significant design flexibility in performing area-delay trade-offs.In this article, we extend NATURE in various dimensions, evaluating various FPGA approaches in the context of today's emerging technologies. First, we explore the introduction of embedded coarse-grain modules in the fine-grain NATURE architecture and present a unified dynamically reconfigurable architecture, which can significantly enhance NATURE's computation power for data-dominated applications. Second, we explore a 3D architecture for NATURE in which the nano RAM for reconfiguration storage is on one layer and the rest of the CMOS logic on another layer. This leads to further improvements in logic density and performance. Finally, we explore the possibility of using FinFETs, an emerging double-gate CMOS technology, to implement NATURE. Since power consumption is an important consideration in the deep nanometer regime, especially for FPGAs, we present a back-gate biasing methodology for flexible threshold voltage adjustment in FinFETs to significantly reduce NATURE's power consumption. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.","author":["Wei Zhang","Niraj K.

This is enabled by the advent of knowledge-sharing communities such as Wikipedia and the progress in automatically extracting entities and relationships from semistructured as well as natural-language Web sources. Recent endeavors of this kind include DBpedia, EntityCube, KnowItAll, ReadTheWeb, and our own YAGO-NAGA project (and others). The goal is to automatically construct and maintain a comprehensive knowledge base of facts about named entities, their semantic classes, and their mutual relations as well as temporal contexts, with high precision and high recall. This tutorial discusses state-of-the-art methods, research opportunities, and open challenges along this avenue of knowledge harvesting.","author":["Gerhard Weikum","Martin Theobald"],"issue":["PODS '10: Proceedings of the twenty-ninth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems","June 2010","Pages   65\u201376","https://doi.org/10.1145/1807085.1807097"],"date":"06 June 2010","ref":[{"text":"E.

These newer systems address \"cloud OLTP\" applications, though they typically do not support ACID transactions. Examples of systems proposed for cloud serving use include BigTable, PNUTS, Cassandra, HBase, Azure, CouchDB, SimpleDB, Voldemort, and many others. Further, they are being applied to a diverse range of applications that differ considerably from traditional (e.g., TPC-C like) serving workloads. The number of emerging cloud serving systems and the wide range of proposed applications, coupled with a lack of apples-to-apples performance comparisons, makes it difficult to understand the tradeoffs between systems and the workloads for which they are suited. We present the \"Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark\" (YCSB) framework, with the goal of facilitating performance comparisons of the new generation of cloud data serving systems. We define a core set of benchmarks and report results for four widely used systems: Cassandra, HBase, Yahoo!'s PNUTS, and a simple sharded MySQL implementation. We also hope to foster the development of additional cloud benchmark suites that represent other classes of applications by making our benchmark tool available via open source. In this regard, a key feature of the YCSB framework/tool is that it is extensible--it supports easy definition of new workloads, in addition to making it easy to benchmark new systems.","author":["Brian F.

However, the high cost-per-byte of solid-state media has hindered wide-spread adoption in servers. This paper proposes a new, cost-effective architecture - SieveStore - which enables the use of solid-state media to significantly filter access to storage ensembles. Our paper makes three key contributions. First, we make a case for highly-selective, storage-ensemble-level disk-block caching based on the highly-skewed block popularity distribution and based on the dynamic nature of the popular block set. Second, we identify the problem of allocation-writes and show that selective cache allocation to reduce allocation-writes - sieving - is fundamental to enable efficient ensemble-level disk-caching. Third, we propose two practical variants of SieveStore. Based on week-long block access traces from a storage ensemble of 13 servers, we find that the two components (sieving and ensemble-level caching) each contribute to SieveStore's cost-effectiveness. Compared to unsieved, ensemble-level disk-caches, SieveStore achieves significantly higher hit ratios (35%-50% more, on average) while using only 1/7th the number of SSD drives. Further, ensemble-level caching is strictly better in cost-performance compared to per-server caching.","author":["Timothy Pritchett","Mithuna Thottethodi"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 38","Issue 3","June 2010","pp   163\u2013174","https://doi.org/10.1145/1816038.1815982"],"date":"19 June 2010","ref":[{"text":"M.

These algorithms greatly reduce the cost of measuring programs with respect to the commonly used technique of placing code in each basic block. Program profiling counts the number of times each basic block in a program executes. Instruction tracing records the sequence of basic blocks traversed in a program execution. The algorithms optimize the placement of counting/tracing code with respect to the expected or measured frequency of each block or edge in a program's control-flow graph. We have implemented the algorithms in a profiling/tracing tool, and they substantially reduce the overhead of profiling and tracing.We also define and study the hierarchy of profiling problems. These  problems have two dimensions: what is profiled (i.e., vertices (basic blocks) or edges in a control-flow graph) and where the instrumentation code is placed (in blocks or along edges). We compare the optimal solutions to the profiling problems and describe a new profiling problem: basic-block profiling with edge counters. This problem is important because an optimal solution to any other profiling problem (for a given control-flow graph) is never better than an optimal solution to this problem. Unfortunately, finding an optimal placement of edge counters for vertex profiling appears to be a hard problem in general. However, our work shows that edge profiling with edge counters works well in practice because it is simple and efficient and finds optimal counter placements in most cases.  Furthermore, it yields more information than a vertex profile. Tracing also benefits from placing instrumentation code along edges rather than on vertices.","author":["Thomas Ball","James R.

Instead of using traditional layers of abstraction, our layers of abstraction are designed for directly accessing flash memory devices. DFS has two main novel features. First, it lays out its files directly in a very large virtual storage address space provided by FusionIO's virtual flash storage layer. Second, it leverages the virtual flash storage layer to perform block allocations and atomic updates. As a result, DFS performs better and is much simpler than a traditional Unix file system with similar functionalities. Our microbenchmark results show that DFS can deliver 94,000 I/O operations per second (IOPS) for direct reads and 71,000 IOPS for direct writes with the virtualized flash storage layer on FusionIO's ioDrive. For direct access performance, DFS is consistently better than ext3 on the same platform, sometimes by 20%. For buffered access performance, DFS is also consistently better than ext3, and sometimes by over 149%. Our application benchmarks show that DFS outperforms ext3 by 7% to 250% while requiring less CPU power.","author":["William K. Josephson","Lars A.

In this environment, today's state-of-the-art TCP protocol falls short. We present measurements of a 6000 server production cluster and reveal impairments that lead to high application latencies, rooted in TCP's demands on the limited buffer space available in data center switches. For example, bandwidth hungry \"background\" flows build up queues at the switches, and thus impact the performance of latency sensitive \"foreground\" traffic.To address these problems, we propose DCTCP, a TCP-like protocol for data center networks. DCTCP leverages Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) in the network to provide multi-bit feedback to the end hosts. We evaluate DCTCP at 1 and 10Gbps speeds using commodity, shallow buffered switches. We find DCTCP delivers the same or better throughput than TCP, while using 90% less buffer space. Unlike TCP, DCTCP also provides high burst tolerance and low latency for short flows. In handling workloads derived from operational measurements, we found DCTCP enables the applications to handle 10X the current background traffic, without impacting foreground traffic. Further, a 10X increase in foreground traffic does not cause any timeouts, thus largely eliminating incast problems.","author":["Mohammad Alizadeh","Albert Greenberg","David A.

However, current techniques for programming FPGAs require people to be specially trained to do so. Ideally, software engineers can more readily take advantage of the benefits FPGAs offer by being able to program them using their existing skills, a common one being object-oriented programming. However, traditional techniques for compiling object-oriented languages are at odds with today's FPGA tools, which support neither pointers nor complex data structures. Open until now is the problem of compiling an object-oriented language to an FPGA in a way that harnesses this potential for huge energy savings. In this paper, we present a new compilation technique that feeds into an existing FPGA tool chain and produces FPGAs with up to almost an order of magnitude in energy savings compared to a low-power microprocessor while still retaining comparable performance and area usage.","author":["Stephen Kou","Jens Palsberg"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 45","Issue 10","October 2010","pp   109\u2013124","https://doi.org/10.1145/1932682.1869470"],"date":"17 October 2010","ref":[{"text":"}}David Baldwin.

WioNA is implemented on a humanoid robot \"Nao\". In WioNA, we developed two ontologies: Japanese Wikipedia Ontology and Robot Action Ontology. Japanese Wikipedia Ontology has a large size of concept hierarchy and instance network with many properties from Japanese Wikipedia (semi) automatically. By giving Japanese Wikipedia Ontology to Nao as wisdom, Nao can dialogue with users on many topics of various fields. Robot Action Ontology, in contrast, is built by organizing various performable actions of Nao to control and generate robot actions. Aligning Robot Action Ontology with Japanese Wikipedia Ontology enables Nao to perform related actions to dialogue topics. To show the validities of WioNA, we describe human-robot conversation logs of two case studies whose dialogue topics are sport and rock singer.

Previous approaches to computing semantic relatedness mostly used static language resources, while essentially ignoring their temporal aspects. We believe that a considerable amount of relatedness information can also be found in studying patterns of word usage over time. Consider, for instance, a newspaper archive spanning many years. Two words such as \"war\" and \"peace\" might rarely co-occur in the same articles, yet their patterns of use over time might be similar. In this paper, we propose a new semantic relatedness model, Temporal Semantic Analysis (TSA), which captures this temporal information. The previous state of the art method, Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), represented word semantics as a vector of concepts. TSA uses a more refined representation, where each concept is no longer scalar, but is instead represented as time series over a corpus of temporally-ordered documents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate temporal evidence into models of semantic relatedness. Empirical evaluation shows that TSA provides consistent improvements over the state of the art ESA results on multiple benchmarks.","author":["Kira Radinsky","Eugene Agichtein","Evgeniy Gabrilovich","Shaul Markovitch"],"issue":["WWW '11: Proceedings of the 20th international conference on World wide web","March 2011","Pages   337\u2013346","https://doi.org/10.1145/1963405.1963455"],"date":"28 March 2011","ref":[{"text":"James Allan.

Most current TM implementations are software-based (STM) and incur noticeable overheads for each transactional memory access. Hardware TM proposals (HTM) address this issue but typically suffer from other restrictions such as limits on the number of data locations that can be accessed in a transaction. In this paper, we present several new hybrid TM algorithms that can execute HTM and STM transactions concurrently and can thus provide good performance over a large spectrum of workloads. The algorithms exploit the ability of some HTMs to have both speculative and nonspeculative (nontransactional) memory accesses within a transaction to decrease the transactions' runtime overhead, abort rates, and hardware capacity requirements. We evaluate implementations of these algorithms based on AMD's Advanced Synchronization Facility, an x86 instruction set extension proposal that has been shown to provide a sound basis for HTM.","author":["Torvald Riegel","Patrick Marlier","Martin Nowack","Pascal Felber","Christof Fetzer"],"issue":["SPAA '11: Proceedings of the twenty-third annual ACM symposium on Parallelism in algorithms and architectures","June 2011","Pages   53\u201364","https://doi.org/10.1145/1989493.1989501"],"date":"04 June 2011","ref":[{"text":"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Hardware and software systems that are thus designed may be viewed as \"scalable effort systems\", since they offer the capability to modulate the effort that they expend towards computation, thereby allowing for tradeoffs between output quality and efficiency. We propose the concept of Dynamic Effort Scaling (DES), which refers to dynamic management of the control knobs that are exposed by scalable effort systems. We argue the need for DES by observing that the degree of resilience often varies significantly across applications, across datasets, and even within a dataset. We propose a general conceptual framework for DES by formulating it as a feedback control problem, wherein the scaling mechanisms are regulated with the goal of maintaining output quality within a certain specified limit. We present an implementation of Dynamic Effort Scaling in the context of a scalable-effort processor for Support Vector Machines, and evaluate it under various application scenarios and data sets. Our results clearly demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach --- statically setting the scaling mechanisms leads to either significant error overshoot or significant opportunities for energy savings left on the table unexploited. In contrast, DES is able to effectively regulate the output quality while maximally exploiting the time-varying resiliency in the workload.","author":["Vinay Chippa","Anand Raghunathan","Kaushik Roy","Srimat Chakradhar"],"issue":["DAC '11: Proceedings of the 48th Design Automation Conference","June 2011","Pages   603\u2013608","https://doi.org/10.1145/2024724.2024863"],"date":"05 June 2011","ref":[{"text":"V.

Though there is much talk of using formal and semi-formal methods to develop designs and implementations, in practice most implementations are written without the support of any formal or semi-formal methodology. Having such a methodology brings many benefits, including improved likelihood of a correct implementation, lowering the cost of design exploration and lowering the cost of certification. In this paper, we introduce a semi formal methodology for connecting executable specifications written in the functional language Haskell to efficient VHDL implementations. The connection is performed by manual edits, using semi-formal equational reasoning facilitated by the worker/wrapper transformation, and directed using commutable functors. We explain our methodology on a full-scale example, an efficient Low-Density Parity Check forward error correcting code, which has been implemented on a Virtex-5 FPGA.","author":["Andy Gill","Andrew Farmer"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 46","Issue 9","September 2011","pp   209\u2013220","https://doi.org/10.1145/2034574.2034804"],"date":"19 September 2011","ref":[{"text":"K.

A code, EB12, for the sparse, unsymmetric eigenvalue problem based on a subspace iteration algorithm, optionally combined with Chebychev acceleration, has recently been described by Duff and Scott and is included in the Harwell Subroutine Library. In this article we consider variants of the method of Arnoldi and discuss the design and development of a code to implement these methods. The new code, which is called EB13, offers the user the choice of a basic Arnoldi algorithm, an Arnoldi algorithm with Chebychev acceleration, and a Chebychev preconditioned Arnoldi algorithm. Each method is available in blocked and unblocked form. The code may be used to compute either the rightmost eigenvalues, the eigenvalues of largest absolute value, or the eigenvalues of largest imaginary part. The performance of each option in the EB13 package is compared with that of subspace iteration on a range of test problems, and on the basis of the results, advice is offered to the user on the appropriate choice of method. \u2014Author's Abstract","author":["Jennifer A.

In achieving these goals, a significant sacrifice has been made in DRAM's operational complexity. To realize good performance, systems must properly manage the significant number of structural and timing restrictions of the DRAM devices. DRAM's use is further complicated in many-core systems where the memory interface is shared among multiple cores/threads competing for memory bandwidth. The use of the \"Page-mode\" feature of DRAM devices can mitigate many DRAM constraints. Current open-page policies attempt to garner the highest level of page hits. In an effort to achieve this, such greedy schemes map sequential address sequences to a single DRAM resource. This non-uniform resource usage pattern introduces high levels of conflict when multiple workloads in a many-core system map to the same set of resources. In this paper we present a scheme that provides a careful balance between the benefits (increased performance and decreased power), and the detractors (unfairness) of page-mode accesses. In our Minimalist approach, we target \"just enough\" page-mode accesses to garner page-mode benefits, avoiding system unfairness. We use a fair memory hashing scheme to control the maximum number of page mode hits, and direct the memory scheduler with processor-generated prefetch meta-data.","author":["Dimitris Kaseridis","Jeffrey Stuecheli","Lizy Kurian John"],"issue":["MICRO-44: Proceedings of the 44th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2011","Pages   24\u201335","https://doi.org/10.1145/2155620.2155624"],"date":"03 December 2011","ref":[{"text":"J.

In contrast to the original implicit representation of DCIs [Orzan et al. 2008], where determining a single texture value requires iterative computation of the entire DCI via the Poisson equation, diffusion curve textures provide an explicit representation from which the texture value at any point can be solved directly, while preserving the compactness and resolution independence of diffusion curves. This is achieved through a formulation of the DCI diffusion process in terms of Green's functions. This formulation furthermore allows the texture value of any rectangular region (e.g. pixel area) to be solved in closed form, which facilitates anti-aliasing. We develop a GPU algorithm that renders anti-aliased diffusion curve textures in real time, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this method through high quality renderings with detailed control curves and color variations.","author":["Xin Sun","Guofu Xie","Yue Dong","Stephen Lin","Weiwei Xu","Wencheng Wang","Xin Tong","Baining Guo"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 31","Issue 4","July 2012","Article No.: 74","pp   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/2185520.2185570"],"date":"01 July 2012","ref":[{"text":"Bayin, \u015e. 2006.","order":1},{"text":"Bezerra, H., Eisemann, E., DeCarlo, D., and Thollot, J. 2010.

Designing, evaluating and modeling systems that are resilient against memory errors requires a good understanding of the underlying characteristics of errors in DRAM in the field. While there have recently been a few first studies on DRAM errors in production systems, these have been too limited in either the size of the data set or the granularity of the data to conclusively answer many of the open questions on DRAM errors. Such questions include, for example, the prevalence of soft errors compared to hard errors, or the analysis of typical patterns of hard errors. In this paper, we study data on DRAM errors collected on a diverse range of production systems in total covering nearly 300 terabyte-years of main memory. As a first contribution, we provide a detailed analytical study of DRAM error characteristics, including both hard and soft errors. We find that a large fraction of DRAM errors in the field can be attributed to hard errors and we provide a detailed analytical study of their characteristics. As a second contribution, the paper uses the results from the measurement study to identify a number of promising directions for designing more resilient systems and evaluates the potential of different protection mechanisms in the light of realistic error patterns. One of our findings is that simple page retirement policies might be able to mask a large number of DRAM errors in production systems, while sacrificing only a negligible fraction of the total DRAM in the system.","author":["Andy A.

A silicon PUF is a special circuit embedded in an IC that relies on random fabrication process variations to produce a unique signature for its native IC. While current research directions have focused on improving PUF quality at the architectural level, little work has explicitly targeted their fundamental source of randomness, the fabrication process. During IC fabrication, Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) is typically used to suppress manufacturing variations. In this paper, we recognize that this is actually counterintuitive for PUFs. We provide a novel framework which enables OPC to increase the effects of manufacturing variations within PUF circuitry and produce more randomness in PUFs for greater uniqueness and reliability. The proposed OPC techniques are validated using a population of 100 ring oscillator PUFs. Results show that our schemes provide over five times larger variation in ring oscillator delay, improve PUF uniqueness by 5%, and improve PUF reliability by as much as 70% when compared to conventional OPC.","author":["Domenic Forte","Ankur Srivastava"],"issue":["DAC '12: Proceedings of the 49th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2012","Pages   96\u2013105","https://doi.org/10.1145/2228360.2228379"],"date":"03 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"D.

The efficient utilization of limited on-chip memory resources plays a vital role in reducing the off-chip memory accesses. This paper presents an efficient approach for optimizing the on-chip memory allocation by loop transformations in the imperfectly nested loops. We analytically model the on-chip buffer size and off-chip bandwidth after affine loop transformation, loop fusion/distribution and code motion. Branch-and-bound and knapsack reuse techniques are proposed to reduce the computation complexity in finding optimal solutions. Experimental results show that our scheme can save 40% of on-chip memory size with the same bandwidth consumption compared to the previous approaches.","author":["Jason Cong","Peng Zhang","Yi Zou"],"issue":["DAC '12: Proceedings of the 49th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2012","Pages   1233\u20131238","https://doi.org/10.1145/2228360.2228586"],"date":"03 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"F.

Yet, state-of-the-art statistical translation models (e.g., using Synchronous Context-Free Grammars) are far richer, capturing multi-term phrases, term dependencies, and contextual constraints on translation choice. We present a novel CLIR framework that is able to reach inside the translation \"black box\" and exploit these sources of evidence.

The results demonstrate the existence of Just Noticeable Degradation and Just Unacceptable Degradation thresholds on the factor. In light of the results, we design and implement a real-time perception-based quality adaptor for 3D tele-immersive video. Our experimental results show that the adaptation scheme can reduce resource usage (e.g., CPU cycles) while considerably enhancing the overall perceived visual quality.

Although these architectures have significant performance and energy potential, application designers face many device-specific challenges when choosing an appropriate accelerator or when customizing an algorithm for an accelerator. To help address this problem, in this article we thoroughly evaluate convolution, one of the most common operations in digital-signal processing, on multicores, graphics-processing units, and field-programmable gate arrays. Whereas many previous application studies evaluate a specific usage of an application, this article assists designers with design space exploration for numerous use cases by analyzing effects of different input sizes, different algorithms, and different devices, while also determining Pareto-optimal trade-offs between performance and energy.","author":["Jeremy Fowers","Greg Brown","John Wernsing","Greg Stitt"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 9","Issue 4","January 2013","Article No.: 25","pp   1\u201321","https://doi.org/10.1145/2400682.2400684"],"date":"20 January 2013","ref":[{"text":"Altera, Inc. 2011a.

The OptiX engine builds on the key observation that most ray tracing algorithms can be implemented using a small set of programmable operations. Consequently, the core of OptiX is a domain-specific just-in-time compiler that generates custom ray tracing kernels by combining user-supplied programs for ray generation, material shading, object intersection, and scene traversal. This enables the implementation of a highly diverse set of ray tracing-based algorithms and applications, including interactive rendering, offline rendering, collision detection systems, artificial intelligence queries, and scientific simulations such as sound propagation. OptiX achieves high performance through a compact object model and application of several ray tracing-specific compiler optimizations. For ease of use it exposes a single-ray programming model with full support for recursion and a dynamic dispatch mechanism similar to virtual function calls.","author":["Steven G.

This change has significant implications for software that has traditionally made a sharp distinction between durable and volatile storage. In this paper we describe a software-hardware architecture, WrAP, for persistent memory that provides atomicity and durability while simultaneously ensuring that fast paths through the cache, DRAM, and persistent memory layers are not slowed down by burdensome buffering or double-copying requirements.

Due to its bio-compatibility and ease of engineering, one promising approach for performing in-vivo computation is DNA strand displacement. This paper introduces computer architects to DNA strand displacement \"circuits\", discusses associated architectural challenges, and proposes a new organization that provides practical composability. In particular, prior approaches rely mostly on stochastic interaction of freely diffusing components. This paper proposes practical spatial isolation of components, leading to more easily designed DNA-based circuits. DNA nanotechnology is currently at a turning point, with many proposed applications being realized [20, 9].

We leverage the solution to PSP to predict a new terrorist network after removal of a set of terrorists and to answer the question: which set of k (k > 0) terrorists should be removed in order to minimize the lethality of the terrorist network? We propose a theoretical model to study these questions taking into account the fact that terrorists may have different individual capabilities. We develop an algorithm for PSP in which analysts can specify the conditions an individual needs to satisfy in order to replace another person. We test the correctness of our algorithm on a real-world partial network dataset for two terrorist groups: Al-Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Taiba where we have ground truth about who replaced who, as well as a synthetic dataset where experts estimate who replaced who. Building on the solution to PSP, we develop an algorithm to identify which set of k people to remove from a terrorist network to minimize the organization's efficiency (formalized as an objective function in some different ways).","author":["Francesca Spezzano","V.

By exploiting the relationship between the Voronoi diagram and the convex hull, the algorithm derives the approximation of the convex hull from the former. The other extreme vertices of the convex hull are then found by using a two-round checking in the digital and the continuous space successively. The algorithm does not need explicit locking or any other concurrency control mechanism, thus it can maximize the parallelism available on the modern GPU.The implementation using the CUDA programming model on NVIDIA GPUs is exact and efficient. The experiments show that it is up to an order of magnitude faster than other sequential convex hull implementations running on the CPU for inputs of millions of points. The works demonstrate that the GPU can be used to solve nontrivial computational geometry problems with significant performance benefit.","author":["Mingcen Gao","Thanh-Tung Cao","Ashwin Nanjappa","Tiow-Seng Tan","Zhiyong Huang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software","Volume 40","Issue 1","September 2013","Article No.: 3","pp   1\u201319","https://doi.org/10.1145/2513109.2513112"],"date":"03 October 2013","ref":[{"text":"Amato, N.

In this paper, we argue that existing DSLs can be implemented on top of a general-purpose infrastructure that (i) supports very fine-grain tasks, (ii) implements autonomous, speculative execution of these tasks, and (iii) allows application-specific control of task scheduling policies. To support this claim, we describe such an implementation called the Galois system. We demonstrate the capabilities of this infrastructure in three ways. First, we implement more sophisticated algorithms for some of the graph analytics problems tackled by previous DSLs and show that end-to-end performance can be improved by orders of magnitude even on power-law graphs, thanks to the better algorithms facilitated by a more general programming model. Second, we show that, even when an algorithm can be expressed in existing DSLs, the implementation of that algorithm in the more general system can be orders of magnitude faster when the input graphs are road networks and similar graphs with high diameter, thanks to more sophisticated scheduling. Third, we implement the APIs of three existing graph DSLs on top of the common infrastructure in a few hundred lines of code and show that even for power-law graphs, the performance of the resulting implementations often exceeds that of the original DSL systems, thanks to the lightweight infrastructure.","author":["Donald Nguyen","Andrew Lenharth","Keshav Pingali"],"issue":["SOSP '13: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","November 2013","Pages   456\u2013471","https://doi.org/10.1145/2517349.2522739"],"date":"03 November 2013","ref":[{"text":"E.

Cost-effectiveness is brought about by using multiple low-cost SSDs and reliability is enhanced through RAID-based data redundancy. RAID, however, is managed in a log-structured manner on multiple SSDs effectively eliminating the detrimental read-modify-write operations found in conventional RAID-5. Within the proposed framework, we also propose to eliminate parity blocks for stripes that are composed of clean blocks as the original data resides in primary storage. We also propose the use of destaging, instead of garbage collection, to make space in the cache when the SSD cache is full. We show that the proposed techniques have significant implications on the performance of the cache and lifetime of the SSDs that comprise the cache. Finally, we study various ways in which stripes can be formed based on data and parity block allocation policies. Our experimental results using different realistic I/O workloads show using the SRC scheme is on average 59% better than the conventional SSD cache scheme supporting RAID-5. In case of lifetime, our results show that SRC reduces the erase count of the SSD drives by an average of 47% compared to the RAID-5 scheme.","author":["Yongseok Oh","Jongmoo Choi","Donghee Lee","Sam H.

Association rules, whose significance is measured via support and confidence, are intended to identify rules of the type, \u201cA customer purchasing item A often also purchases item B.\u201d Motivated by the goal of generalizing beyond market baskets and the association rules used with them, we develop the notion of mining rules that identify correlations (generalizing associations), and we consider both the absence and presence of items as a basis for generating rules. We propose measuring significance of associations via the chi-squared test for correlation from classical statistics. This leads to a measure that is upward closed in the itemset lattice, enabling us to reduce the mining problem to the search for a border between correlated and uncorrelated itemsets in the lattice. We develop pruning strategies and devise an efficient algorithm for the resulting problem. We demonstrate its effectiveness by testing it on census data and finding term dependence in a corpus of text documents, as well as on synthetic data.","author":["Sergey Brin","Rajeev Motwani","Craig Silverstein"],"issue":["ACM SIGMOD Record","Volume 26","Issue 2","June 1997","pp   265\u2013276","https://doi.org/10.1145/253262.253327"],"date":"01 June 1997","ref":[{"text":"R.

Our approach leverages existing TV and cellular transmissions to eliminate the need for wires and batteries, thus enabling ubiquitous communication where devices can communicate among themselves at unprecedented scales and in locations that were previously inaccessible.To achieve this, we introduce ambient backscatter, a new communication primitive where devices communicate by backscattering ambient RF signals. Our design avoids the expensive process of generating radio waves; backscatter communication is orders of magnitude more power-efficient than traditional radio communication. Further, since it leverages the ambient RF signals that are already around us, it does not require a dedicated power infrastructure as in traditional backscatter communication. To show the feasibility of our design, we prototype ambient backscatter devices in hardware and achieve information rates of 1 kbps over distances of 2.5 feet and 1.5 feet, while operating outdoors and indoors respectively. We use our hardware prototype to implement proof-of-concepts for two previously infeasible ubiquitous communication applications.","author":["Vincent Liu","Aaron Parks","Vamsi Talla","Shyamnath Gollakota","David Wetherall","Joshua R.

In 2012, billions of RFIDs have been deployed to locate equipment, track drugs, tag retail goods, etc. Current RFID systems, however, can only identify whether a tagged object is within radio range (which could be up to tens of meters), but cannot pinpoint its exact location. Past proposals for addressing this limitation rely on a line-of-sight model and hence perform poorly when faced with multipath effects or non-line-of-sight, which are typical in real-world deployments. This paper introduces the first fine-grained RFID positioning system that is robust to multipath and non-line-of-sight scenarios. Unlike past work, which considers multipath as detrimental, our design exploits multipath to accurately locate RFIDs. The intuition underlying our design is that nearby RFIDs experience a similar multipath environment (e.g., reflectors in the environment) and thus exhibit similar multipath profiles. We capture and extract these multipath profiles by using a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) created via antenna motion. We then adapt dynamic time warping (DTW) techniques to pinpoint a tag's location. We built a prototype of our design using USRP software radios. Results from a deployment of 200 commercial RFIDs in our university library demonstrate that the new design can locate misplaced books with a median accuracy of 11~cm.","author":["Jue Wang","Dina Katabi"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 43","Issue 4","October 2013","pp   51\u201362","https://doi.org/10.1145/2534169.2486029"],"date":"27 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"ALN-9640 Squiggle Inlay. www.alientechnology.com.","order":1},{"text":"iRobot Create Programmable Robots. www.irobot.com.","order":2},{"text":"Physical and Psychological Barriers to RFID Adoption.

Nevertheless, most cloud facilities operate at very low utilization, hurting both cost effectiveness and future scalability. We present Quasar, a cluster management system that increases resource utilization while providing consistently high application performance. Quasar employs three techniques. First, it does not rely on resource reservations, which lead to underutilization as users do not necessarily understand workload dynamics and physical resource requirements of complex codebases. Instead, users express performance constraints for each workload, letting Quasar determine the right amount of resources to meet these constraints at any point. Second, Quasar uses classification techniques to quickly and accurately determine the impact of the amount of resources (scale-out and scale-up), type of resources, and interference on performance for each workload and dataset. Third, it uses the classification results to jointly perform resource allocation and assignment, quickly exploring the large space of options for an efficient way to pack workloads on available resources. Quasar monitors workload performance and adjusts resource allocation and assignment when needed. We evaluate Quasar over a wide range of workload scenarios, including combinations of distributed analytics frameworks and low-latency, stateful services, both on a local cluster and a cluster of dedicated EC2 servers. At steady state, Quasar improves resource utilization by 47% in the 200-server EC2 cluster, while meeting performance constraints for workloads of all types.","author":["Christina Delimitrou","Christos Kozyrakis"],"issue":["ASPLOS '14: Proceedings of the 19th international conference on Architectural support for programming languages and operating systems","February 2014","Pages   127\u2013144","https://doi.org/10.1145/2541940.2541941"],"date":"24 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"Faraz Ahmad, Srimat T.

The original article suggesting the new architecture made some untested assumptions on the circuitry needed to implement AIC architectures and did not develop completely the toolset necessary to assess comprehensively the idea. In this paper, we pick up the architecture that some of us proposed in the original AIC paper and try to implement it as thoroughly as we can afford. We build all components for the logic cluster at transistor level in a 40~nm technology as well as a LUT-based architecture inspired by Altera's Stratix~IV. We first determine that the characteristics of our LUT-based architecture are reasonably similar to those of the commercial counterpart. Then, we compare the AIC architecture to the baseline on a number of benchmarks, and we find a few difficulties that had been overlooked before. We thus explore other design possibilities around the original design point and show their detailed impact. Finally, we discuss how the very structure of current logic clusters seems not perfectly appropriate for getting the best out of AICs and conclude that, even though they are not confirmed as an immediate blessing today, AICs still offer rich research opportunities.","author":["Grace Zgheib","Liqun Yang","Zhihong Huang","David Novo","Hadi Parandeh-Afshar","Haigang Yang","Paolo Ienne"],"issue":["FPGA '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM/SIGDA international symposium on Field-programmable gate arrays","February 2014","Pages   45\u201354","https://doi.org/10.1145/2554688.2554791"],"date":"26 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"Altera Corporation.

Researchers have long known about the existence of Sybil accounts in online communities such as file-sharing systems, but they have not been able to perform large-scale measurements to detect them or measure their activities. In this article, we describe our efforts to detect, characterize, and understand Sybil account activity in the Renren Online Social Network (OSN). We use ground truth provided by Renren Inc. to build measurement-based Sybil detectors and deploy them on Renren to detect more than 100,000 Sybil accounts. Using our full dataset of 650,000 Sybils, we examine several aspects of Sybil behavior. First, we study their link creation behavior and find that contrary to prior conjecture, Sybils in OSNs do not form tight-knit communities. Next, we examine the fine-grained behaviors of Sybils on Renren using clickstream data. Third, we investigate behind-the-scenes collusion between large groups of Sybils. Our results reveal that Sybils with no explicit social ties still act in concert to launch attacks. Finally, we investigate enhanced techniques to identify stealthy Sybils. In summary, our study advances the understanding of Sybil behavior on OSNs and shows that Sybils can effectively avoid existing community-based Sybil detectors. We hope that our results will foster new research on Sybil detection that is based on novel types of Sybil features.","author":["Zhi Yang","Christo Wilson","Xiao Wang","Tingting Gao","Ben Y.

As a consequence, generating histograms on database tables is typically performed as a batch job, separately from query processing. In this paper, we show how to calculate statistics as a side effect of data movement within a DBMS using a hardware accelerator in the data path. This accelerator analyzes tables as they are transmitted from storage to the processing unit, and provides histograms on the data retrieved for queries at virtually no extra performance cost. To evaluate our approach, we implemented this accelerator on an FPGA. This prototype calculates histograms faster and with similar or better accuracy than commercial databases. Moreover, the FPGA can provide various types of histograms such as Equi-depth, Compressed, or Max-diff on the same input data in parallel, without additional overhead.","author":["Zsolt Istvan","Louis Woods","Gustavo Alonso"],"issue":["SIGMOD '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","June 2014","Pages   1567\u20131578","https://doi.org/10.1145/2588555.2612174"],"date":"18 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"H.

However, all families of quantum LDPC codes known to this date suffer from a poor distance scaling limited by the square-root of the code length. This is in a sharp contrast with the classical case where good families of LDPC codes are known that combine constant encoding rate and linear distance. Here we propose the first family of good quantum codes with low-weight stabilizers. The new codes have a constant encoding rate, linear distance, and stabilizers acting on at most O(\u221an) qubits, where n is the code length. For comparison, all previously known families of good quantum codes have stabilizers of linear weight. Our proof combines two techniques: randomized constructions of good quantum codes and the homological product operation from algebraic topology. We conjecture that similar methods can produce good stabilizer codes with stabilizer weight O(n\u03b1) for any \u03b1 > 0.","author":["Sergey Bravyi","Matthew B.

Our algorithm solves for the shape of a transparent object such that the refracted light paints a desired caustic image on a receiver screen. We introduce an optimal transport formulation to establish a correspondence between the input geometry and the unknown target shape. A subsequent 3D optimization based on an adaptive discretization scheme then finds the target surface from the correspondence map. Our approach supports piecewise smooth surfaces and non-bijective mappings, which eliminates a number of shortcomings of previous methods. This leads to a significantly richer space of caustic images, including smooth transitions, singularities of infinite light density, and completely black areas.

Most existing studies assume that all papers adopt the same criterion and follow the same behavioral pattern in deciding relevance and authority of a paper. However, in reality, papers have distinct citation behavioral patterns when looking for different references, depending on paper content, authors and target venues. In this study, we investigate the problem in the context of heterogeneous bibliographic networks and propose a novel cluster-based citation recommendation framework, called ClusCite, which explores the principle that citations tend to be softly clustered into interest groups based on multiple types of relationships in the network. Therefore, we predict each query's citations based on related interest groups, each having its own model for paper authority and relevance. Specifically, we learn group memberships for objects and the significance of relevance features for each interest group, while also propagating relative authority between objects, by solving a joint optimization problem. Experiments on both DBLP and PubMed datasets demonstrate the power of the proposed approach, with 17.68% improvement in [email\u00a0protected] and 9.57% growth in MRR over the best performing baseline.","author":["Xiang Ren","Jialu Liu","Xiao Yu","Urvashi Khandelwal","Quanquan Gu","Lidan Wang","Jiawei Han"],"issue":["KDD '14: Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2014","Pages   821\u2013830","https://doi.org/10.1145/2623330.2623630"],"date":"24 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"A.

Unfortunately, EHR data do not always directly and reliably map to phenotypes, or medical concepts, that clinical researchers need or use. Existing phenotyping approaches typically require labor intensive supervision from medical experts. We propose Marble, a novel sparse non-negative tensor factorization method to derive phenotype candidates with virtually no human supervision. Marble decomposes the observed tensor into two terms, a bias tensor and an interaction tensor. The bias tensor represents the baseline characteristics common amongst the overall population and the interaction tensor defines the phenotypes. We demonstrate the capability of our proposed model on both simulated and patient data from a publicly available clinical database. Our results show that Marble derived phenotypes provide at least a 42.8% reduction in the number of non-zero element and also retains predictive power for classification purposes. Furthermore, the resulting phenotypes and baseline characteristics from real EHR data are consistent with known characteristics of the patient population. Thus it can potentially be used to rapidly characterize, predict, and manage a large number of diseases, thereby promising a novel, data-driven solution that can benefit very large segments of the population.","author":["Joyce C.

To achieve this goal, a two-level method area with two on-chip circular buffers is proposed as an interface between the RISC core and the Java core.

Today, new technologies lead to an equilibrium situation where powerful and complex computers bring new biological knowledge of the brain behavior. At this point, we possess sufficient understanding to both imagine new brain-inspired computing paradigms and to sustain a classical paradigm which reaches its end programming and intellectual limitations.In this context, we propose to reconsider the computation problem first in the specific domain of mobile robotics. Our main proposal consists in considering computation as part of a global adaptive system, composed of sensors, actuators, a source of energy and a controlling unit. During the adaptation process, the proposed brain-inspired computing structure does not only execute the tasks of the application but also reacts to the external stimulation and acts on the emergent behavior of the system. This approach is inspired by cortical plasticity in mammalian brains and suggests developing the computation architecture along the system's experience.This article proposes modeling this plasticity as a problem of estimating a probability density function. This function would correspond to the nature and the richness of the environment perceived through multiple modalities. We define and develop a novel neural model solving the problem in a distributed and sparse manner. And we integrate this neural map into a bio-inspired hardware substrate that brings the plasticity property into parallel many-core architectures. The approach is then called Hardware Plasticity. The results show that the self-organization properties of our model solve the problem of multimodal sensory data clusterization. The properties of the proposed model allow envisaging the deployment of this adaptation layer into hardware architectures embedded into the robot's body in order to build intelligent controllers.","author":["Laurent Rodriguez","Beno\u00eet Miramond","Bertrand Granado"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 11","Issue 4","April 2015","Article No.: 33","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2638559"],"date":"27 April 2015","ref":[{"text":"Shun-ichi Amari. 1977.

However, such systems require either deployment of new infrastructure, or extensive fingerprinting of the environment through training or crowdsourcing, impeding their wide-scale adoption. We present Ubicarse, an accurate indoor localization system for commodity mobile devices, with no specialized infrastructure or fingerprinting. Ubicarse enables handheld devices to emulate large antenna arrays using a new formulation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Past work on SAR requires measuring mechanically controlled device movement with millimeter precision, far beyond what commercial accelerometers can provide. In contrast, Ubicarse's core contribution is the ability to perform SAR on handheld devices twisted by their users along unknown paths. Ubicarse is not limited to localizing RF devices; it combines RF localization with stereo-vision algorithms to localize common objects with no RF source attached to them. We implement Ubicarse on a HP SplitX2 tablet and empirically demonstrate a median error of 39 cm in 3-D device localization and 17 cm in object geotagging in complex indoor settings.","author":["Swarun Kumar","Stephanie Gil","Dina Katabi","Daniela Rus"],"issue":["MobiCom '14: Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking","September 2014","Pages   483\u2013494","https://doi.org/10.1145/2639108.2639142"],"date":"07 September 2014","ref":[{"text":"VICON T-Series. http://www.vicon.com.

They first extract traditional audio content features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and then predict user preferences. However, these traditional features, originally not created for music recommendation, cannot capture all relevant information in the audio and thus put a cap on recommendation performance. Using a novel model based on deep belief network and probabilistic graphical model, we unify the two stages into an automated process that simultaneously learns features from audio content and makes personalized recommendations. Compared with existing deep learning based models, our model outperforms them in both the warm-start and cold-start stages without relying on collaborative filtering (CF). We then present an efficient hybrid method to seamlessly integrate the automatically learnt features and CF. Our hybrid method not only significantly improves the performance of CF but also outperforms the traditional feature mbased hybrid method.","author":["Xinxi Wang","Ye Wang"],"issue":["MM '14: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Multimedia","November 2014","Pages   627\u2013636","https://doi.org/10.1145/2647868.2654940"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"P.

Smartphones with their various sensors are opening a new frontier in building human-centered applications for understanding users' personal and world contexts. While in-lab and controlled activity recognition systems have yielded very good results, they do not perform well under in-the-wild scenarios. The objective of this paper is to 1) Investigate how audio signal can complement and improve other on-board sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) for activity recognition; 2) Design and evaluate the fusion of such multiple signal streams to optimize performance and sampling rate. We show that fusion of these signal streams, including audio, achieves high performance even at very low sampling rates; 3) Evaluate the performance of the multi-stream human activity recognition under different real end-user activity conditions.","author":["Arindam Ghosh","Giuseppe Riccardi"],"issue":["MM '14: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Multimedia","November 2014","Pages   865\u2013868","https://doi.org/10.1145/2647868.2655034"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"D.

In order to capture the rich contextual structures in a query or a document, we start with each word within a temporal context window in a word sequence to directly capture contextual features at the word n-gram level. Next, the salient word n-gram features in the word sequence are discovered by the model and are then aggregated to form a sentence-level feature vector. Finally, a non-linear transformation is applied to extract high-level semantic information to generate a continuous vector representation for the full text string. The proposed convolutional latent semantic model (CLSM) is trained on clickthrough data and is evaluated on a Web document ranking task using a large-scale, real-world data set. Results show that the proposed model effectively captures salient semantic information in queries and documents for the task while significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art semantic models.","author":["Yelong Shen","Xiaodong He","Jianfeng Gao","Li Deng","Gr\u00e9goire Mesnil"],"issue":["CIKM '14: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2014","Pages   101\u2013110","https://doi.org/10.1145/2661829.2661935"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"Bengio, Y., 2009.

Currently most SWI methods heavily rely on sentiment seed words that have limited sentiment information. Even though there emerge non-seed approaches based on sentiment labels of documents, but in which the context information has not been fully considered. In this paper, based on matrix factorization with co-occurrence neighbor regularization which is derived from context, we propose a novel non-seed model called CONR for SWI. Instead of seed words, CONR exploits two important factors: sentiment matching and sentiment consistency for sentiment word identification. Experimental results on four publicly available datasets show that CONR can outperform the state of-the-art methods.","author":["Jiguang Liang","Xiaofei Zhou","Yue Hu","Li Guo","Shuo Bai"],"issue":["CIKM '14: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2014","Pages   1943\u20131946","https://doi.org/10.1145/2661829.2662015"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"G.

To achieve this goal, we propose a novel approach to dynamically adjust the system's performance level such that energy neutral operation, and thus long-term uninterrupted operation can be achieved. We first consider the annual dynamics of the energy source to design an appropriate power subsystem (i.e., solar panel size and energy store capacity), and then dynamically compute the long-term sustainable performance level at runtime. We show through trace-driven simulations using eleven years of real-world data that our approach outperforms existing predictive, e.g., EWMA, WCMA, and reactive, e.g., ENO-MAX, approaches in terms of average performance level by up to 177%, while reducing duty-cycle variance by up to three orders of magnitude. We further demonstrate the benefits of the dynamic power management scheme using a wireless sensor system deployed for environmental monitoring in a remote, high-alpine environment as a case study. A performance evaluation over two years reveals that the dynamic power management scheme achieves a two-fold improvement in system utility when compared to only applying appropriate capacity planning.","author":["Bernhard Buchli","Felix Sutton","Jan Beutel","Lothar Thiele"],"issue":["SenSys '14: Proceedings of the 12th ACM Conference on Embedded Network Sensor Systems","November 2014","Pages   31\u201345","https://doi.org/10.1145/2668332.2668333"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"J.

The proposed architecture integrates an arbitrary number of N digital leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) silicon neurons to mimic their biological counterparts and on-chip learning circuits to realize spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rules. We leverage memristor nanodevices to build an N\u00d7N crossbar array to store not only multibit synaptic weight values but also network configuration data with significantly reduced area overhead. Additionally, the crossbar array is designed to be accessible both column- and row-wise to expedite the synaptic weight update process for learning. The proposed digital pulse width modulator (PWM) produces binary pulses with various durations for reading and writing the multilevel memristive crossbar. The proposed column based analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) scheme efficiently accumulates the presynaptic weights of each neuron and reduces silicon area overhead by using a shared arithmetic unit to process the LIF operations of all N neurons. With 256 silicon neurons, learning circuits and 64K synapses, the power dissipation and area of our DNP are 6.45 mW and 1.86 mm2, respectively, when implemented in a 90-nm CMOS technology. The functionality of the proposed DNP architecture is demonstrated by realizing an unsupervised-learning based character recognition system.","author":["Yongtae Kim","Yong Zhang","Peng Li"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 11","Issue 4","April 2015","Article No.: 38","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2700234"],"date":"27 April 2015","ref":[{"text":"J.

However, problems need to be solved in the practical use of blind quantum computation and fault-tolerance is a major challenge. Broadbent et al. proposed running error correction over blind quantum computation, and Morimae and Fujii proposed using fault-tolerant entangled qubits as the resource for blind quantum computation. Both approaches impose severe demands on the teleportation channel, the former requiring unrealistic data rates and the latter near-perfect fidelity. To extend the application range of blind quantum computation, we suggest that Alice send input qubits encoded with error correction code instead of single input qubits. Two fault-tolerant protocols are presented and we showed the trade-off of the computational overhead using the ten-bit quantum carry-lookahead adder as an example. Though these two fault-tolerant protocols require the client to have more quantum computing ability than using approaches from prior work, they provide better fault-tolerance when the client and the server are connected by realistic quantum repeater networks.","author":["Chia-Hung Chien","Rodney Van Meter","Sy-Yen Kuo"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 12","Issue 1","July 2015","Article No.: 9","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/2700248"],"date":"03 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"Dorit Aharonov, Michael Ben-Or, and Elad Eban. 2008.

Existing methods index a video by the raw concept detection score that is dense and inconsistent, and thus cannot scale to \"big data\" that are readily available on the Internet. This paper proposes a scalable solution. The key is a novel step called concept adjustment that represents a video by a few salient and consistent concepts that can be efficiently indexed by the modified inverted index. The proposed adjustment model relies on a concise optimization framework with interpretations. The proposed index leverages the text-based inverted index for video retrieval. Experimental results validate the efficacy and the efficiency of the proposed method. The results show that our method can scale up the semantic search while maintaining state-of-the-art search performance. Specifically, the proposed method (with reranking) achieves the best result on the challenging TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection (MED) zero-example task. It only takes 0.2 second on a single CPU core to search a collection of 100 million Internet videos.","author":["Lu Jiang","Shoou-I Yu","Deyu Meng","Yi Yang","Teruko Mitamura","Alexander G.

In particular, three strategies are developed to effectively leverage the capability of ConvNets in mining discriminative features for recognition. Firstly, different viewpoints are mimicked by rotating virtual cameras around subject represented by the 3D points of the captured depth maps. This not only synthesizes more data from the captured ones, but also makes the trained ConvNets view-tolerant. Secondly, DMMs are constructed and further enhanced for recognition by encoding them into Pseudo-RGB images, turning the spatial-temporal motion patterns into textures and edges. Lastly, through transferring learning the models originally trained over ImageNet for image classification, the three ConvNets are trained independently on the color-coded DMMs constructed in three orthogonal planes. The proposed algorithm was extensively evaluated on MSRAction3D, MSRAction3DExt and UTKinect-Action datasets and achieved the state-of-the-art results on these datasets.","author":["Pichao Wang","Wanqing Li","Zhimin Gao","Chang Tang","Jing Zhang","Philip Ogunbona"],"issue":["MM '15: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2015","Pages   1119\u20131122","https://doi.org/10.1145/2733373.2806296"],"date":"13 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"B.

To address the information retrieval task, we raise and integrate a series of methods with visual features obtained by convolution neural network (CNN) models. In our experiments, we discover that the ranking strategies of Hierarchical clustering and PageRank methods are mutually complementary. Another task is fine-grained classification. In contrast to basic-level recognition, fine-grained classification aims to distinguish between different breeds or species or product models, and often requires distinctions that must be conditioned on the object pose for reliable identification. Current state-of-the-art techniques rely heavily upon the use of part annotations, while the bing datasets suffer both abundance of part annotations and dirty background. In this paper, we propose a CNN-based feature representation for visual recognition only using image-level information. Our CNN model is pre-trained on a collection of clean datasets and fine-tuned on the bing datasets. Furthermore, a multi-scale training strategy is adopted by simply resizing the input images into different scales and then merging the soft-max posteriors. We then implement our method into a unified visual recognition system on Microsoft cloud service.

These DSP units are dominated by sequential memory access where SRAM-based memory is inefficient in terms of area and power. We propose spintronic Domain Wall Memory (DWM) based embedded memories for DSP building blocks e.g., survivor-path memories in Viterbi decoder and First-In-First-Out (FIFO) register files in FFT processor that exploit the unique serial access mechanism, non-volatility and small footprint of the memory for area and power saving. Simulations using 65nm technology show that the DWM based Viterbi decoder achieves 66.4 % area and 59.6 % power savings over the conventional SRAM-based implementation. For 8K point FFT processor, the DWM based design shows 60.6 % area and 60.3 % power savings.","author":["Jinil Chung","Kenneth Ramclam","Jongsun Park","Swaroop Ghosh"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 64","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744825"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"F.

The interfaces between analog and digital units, especially AD/DAs, take up most of the area and power consumption of RCS and are always the bottleneck of mixed-signal computing systems. In this work, we propose a novel architecture, MEI, to minimize the overhead of AD/DA by MErging the Interface into the RRAM crossbar. An optional ensemble method, the Serial Array Adaptive Boosting (SAAB), is also introduced to take advantage of the area and power saved by MEI and boost the accuracy and robustness of RCS. On top of these two methods, a design space exploration is proposed to achieve trade-offs among accuracy, area, and power consumption. Experimental results on 6 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that, compared with the traditional architecture with AD/DAs, MEI is able to save 54.63%~86.14% area and reduce 61.82%~86.80% power consumption under quality guarantees; and SAAB can further improve the accuracy by 5.76% on average and ensure the system performance under noisy conditions.","author":["Boxun Li","Lixue Xia","Peng Gu","Yu Wang","Huazhong Yang"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 13","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744870"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"H.

This phenomenon indicates that the previous topology control solutions, which use static transmission power, transmission range, and link quality, might not be effective in the physical world. To address this issue, online transmission power control that adapts to external changes is necessary. This article presents ATPC, a lightweight algorithm for Adaptive Transmission Power Control in wireless sensor networks. In ATPC, each node builds a model for each of its neighbors, describing the correlation between transmission power and link quality. With this model, we employ a feedback-based transmission power control algorithm to dynamically maintain individual link quality over time. The intellectual contribution of this work lies in a novel pairwise transmission power control, which is significantly different from existing node-level or network-level power control methods. Also different from most existing simulation work, the ATPC design is guided by extensive field experiments of link quality dynamics at various locations over a long period of time. The results from the real-world experiments demonstrate that (1) with pairwise adjustment, ATPC achieves more energy savings with a finer tuning capability, and (2) with online control, ATPC is robust even with environmental changes over time.","author":["Shan Lin","Fei Miao","Jingbin Zhang","Gang Zhou","Lin Gu","Tian He","John A.

If a string is in the language, then there exists a proof such that the verifier accepts with probability 1 (i.e., for every choice of its random string). For strings not in the language, the verifier rejects every provided \u201cproof\u201d with probability at least 1/2. Our result builds upon and improves a recent result of Arora and Safra [1998] whose verifiers examine a nonconstant number of bits in the proof (though this number is a very slowly growing function of the input length).As a consequence, we prove that no MAX SNP-hard problem has a polynomial  time approximation scheme, unless NP = P. The class MAX SNP was defined by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [1991] and hard problems for this class include vertex cover, maximum satisfiability, maximum cut, metric TSP, Steiner trees and shortest superstring. We also improve upon the clique hardness results of Feige et al. [1996] and Arora and Safra [1998] and show that there exists a positive \u03b5 such that approximating the maximum clique size in an N-vertex graph to within a factor of N\u03b5 is NP-hard.","author":["Sanjeev Arora","Carsten Lund","Rajeev Motwani","Madhu Sudan","Mario Szegedy"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 45","Issue 3","May 1998","pp   501\u2013555","https://doi.org/10.1145/278298.278306"],"date":"01 May 1998","ref":[{"text":"ARORA, S. 1994.

Identifying users from multiple heterogeneous social networks and integrating the different networks is a fundamental issue in many applications. The existing methods tackle this problem by estimating pairwise similarity between users in two networks. However, those methods suffer from potential inconsistency of matchings between multiple networks. In this paper, we propose COSNET (COnnecting heterogeneous Social NETworks with local and global consistency), a novel energy-based model, to address this problem by considering both local and global consistency among multiple networks. An efficient subgradient algorithm is developed to train the model by converting the original energy-based objective function into its dual form. We evaluate the proposed model on two different genres of data collections: SNS and Academia, each consisting of multiple heterogeneous social networks. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model. On both data collections, the proposed COSNET method significantly outperforms several alternative methods by up to 10-30% (p << 0:001, t-test) in terms of F1-score. We also demonstrate that applying the integration results produced by our method can improve the accuracy of expert finding, an important task in social networks.","author":["Yutao Zhang","Jie Tang","Zhilin Yang","Jian Pei","Philip S.

The conventional belief is that a large register file is inevitable for accommodating more parallel thread contexts, and technology scaling makes it feasible to incorporate ever increasing size of register file. In this paper, we demonstrate that the register file size need not be large to accommodate more threads context. We first characterize the useful lifetime of a register and show that register lifetimes vary drastically across various registers that are allocated to a kernel. While some registers are alive for the entire duration of the kernel execution, some registers have a short lifespan. We propose GPU register file virtualization that allows multiple warps to share physical registers. Since warps may be scheduled for execution at different points in time, we propose to proactively release dead registers from one warp and re-allocate them to a different warp that may occur later in time, thereby reducing the needless demand for physical registers. By using register virtualization, we shrink the architected register space to a smaller physical register space. By under-provisioning the physical register file to be smaller than the architected register file we reduce dynamic and static power consumption. We then develop a new register throttling mechanism to run applications that exceed the size of the under-provisioned register file without any deadlock. Our evaluation shows that even after halving the architected register file size using our proposed GPU register file virtualization applications run successfully with negligible performance overhead.","author":["Hyeran Jeon","Gokul Subramanian Ravi","Nam Sung Kim","Murali Annavaram"],"issue":["MICRO-48: Proceedings of the 48th International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2015","Pages   420\u2013432","https://doi.org/10.1145/2830772.2830784"],"date":"05 December 2015","ref":[{"text":"\"asfermi: An assembler for the NVIDIA Fermi Instruction Set.\" {Online}.

Often these tasks involve real-time user interactions and must finish within a certain amount of time for smooth user experience. In this paper, we propose a DVFS framework for hardware accelerators involving real-time user interactions. The framework automatically generates a predictor for each accelerator that predicts its execution time, and sets a DVFS level to just meet the response time requirement. Our evaluation results show, compared to running each accelerator at a constant frequency, our DVFS framework achieves 36.7% energy savings on average across a set of accelerators, while only missing 0.4% of the deadlines. The energy savings are only 3.8% less than an optimal DVFS scheme. We show with the introduction of a boost level, the deadline misses can be completely eliminated while still achieving 36.4% energy savings.","author":["Tao Chen","Alexander Rucker","G.

However, CNN-based methods are com-putational-intensive and resource-consuming, and thus are hard to be integrated into embedded systems such as smart phones, smart glasses, and robots. FPGA is one of the most promising platforms for accelerating CNN, but the limited bandwidth and on-chip memory size limit the performance of FPGA accelerator for CNN. In this paper, we go deeper with the embedded FPGA platform on accelerating CNNs and propose a CNN accelerator design on embedded FPGA for Image-Net large-scale image classification. We first present an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art CNN models and show that Convolutional layers are computational-centric and Fully-Connected layers are memory-centric. Then the dynamic-precision data quantization method and a convolver design that is efficient for all layer types in CNN are proposed to improve the bandwidth and resource utilization. Results show that only 0.4% accuracy loss is introduced by our data quantization flow for the very deep VGG16 model when 8/4-bit quantization is used. A data arrangement method is proposed to further ensure a high utilization of the external memory bandwidth. Finally, a state-of-the-art CNN, VGG16-SVD, is implemented on an embedded FPGA platform as a case study. VGG16-SVD is the largest and most accurate network that has been implemented on FPGA end-to-end so far. The system on Xilinx Zynq ZC706 board achieves a frame rate at 4.45 fps with the top-5 accuracy of 86.66% using 16-bit quantization. The average performance of convolutional layers and the full CNN is 187.8 GOP/s and 137.0 GOP/s under 150MHz working frequency, which outperform previous approaches significantly.","author":["Jiantao Qiu","Jie Wang","Song Yao","Kaiyuan Guo","Boxun Li","Erjin Zhou","Jincheng Yu","Tianqi Tang","Ningyi Xu","Sen Song","Yu Wang","Huazhong Yang"],"issue":["FPGA '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2016","Pages   26\u201335","https://doi.org/10.1145/2847263.2847265"],"date":"21 February 2016","ref":[{"text":"O.

Previous work has examined this model by focusing on projects and their owners---we complement it by examining the work practices of project contributors and the challenges they face. We conducted a survey with 645 top contributors to active OSS projects using the pull-based model on GitHub, the prevalent social coding site. We also analyzed traces extracted from corresponding GitHub repositories. Our research shows that: contributors have a strong interest in maintaining awareness of project status to get inspiration and avoid duplicating work, but they do not actively propagate information; communication within pull requests is reportedly limited to low-level concerns and contributors often use communication channels external to pull requests; challenges are mostly social in nature, with most reporting poor responsiveness from integrators; and the increased transparency of this setting is a confirmed motivation to contribute. Based on these findings, we present recommendations for practitioners to streamline the contribution process and discuss potential future research directions.","author":["Georgios Gousios","Margaret-Anne Storey","Alberto Bacchelli"],"issue":["ICSE '16: Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Software Engineering","May 2016","Pages   285\u2013296","https://doi.org/10.1145/2884781.2884826"],"date":"14 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"GitHub is your new resume. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2763182.

Since software-oriented approaches offer flexible protection even in off-the-shelf processes, they are attractive solutions in protecting against soft errors. Among such approaches, in-application instruction duplication based approaches have been widely used and are deemed to be the most effective. Such techniques duplicate the program assembly instructions and periodically check the results to identify possible errors. Even though early reports suggest that these achieve close to 100% protection from soft errors, we find several gaps in the protection. Existing techniques are unable to protect several important microarchitectural components, as well as a significant fraction of instructions, resulting in Silent Data Corruptions (SDCs). This paper presents nZDC or near Zero silent Data Corruption -- an effective instruction duplication based approach to protect programs from soft errors. Extensive fault injection experiments on almost all the unprotected microarchitectural components in simulated ARM Cortex A53, while executing benchmarks fromMiBench suite, demonstrate that nZDC is extremely effective, without incurring any more performance penalty than the state-of-the-art.","author":["Moslem Didehban","Aviral Shrivastava"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 48","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898054"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"P.

In addition to its small dimensions, the RRAM device has many technological advantages including its low-programming voltages, high speed, low power, CMOS-compatible fabrication process, and potentially monolithic 3D integration. However, one of the critical challenges for RRAM technology is the reliability concerns due to retention and endurance failures. In this paper, we propose a novel Refresh circuit for 1T1R RRAM array which detects and distinguishes soft and hard errors from retention and endurance failures, as well as corrects the soft errors through refreshing. Using the HfO2/Hf RRAM array, our simulation results show that the proposed solution increases the resilience to soft-error of an 8Gb RRAM-based memory by 80% with a small penalty on the energy and delay of the Read operations (6% and 0.4% respectively). The proposed methodology can be used for other RRAM arrays with minor modifications to the design parameters depending on the characteristics of RRAM cell.","author":["Amr M.S.

With approximate computing, we expect to obtain acceptable results, but how do we make sure the quality of the final results are acceptable? This challenging problem remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient quality management framework to achieve controlled quality-efficiency tradeoffs. To be specific, at the offline stage, our solution automatically selects an appropriate approximator configuration considering rollback recovery for large occasional errors with minimum cost under the target quality requirement. Then during the online execution, our framework judiciously determines when and how to rollback, which is achieved with cost-effective yet accurate quality predictors that synergistically combine the outputs of several basic light-weight predictors. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed solution can achieve 11% to 23% energy savings compared to existing solutions under the target quality requirement.","author":["Ting Wang","Qian Zhang","Nam Sung Kim","Qiang Xu"],"issue":["ISLPED '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","August 2016","Pages   156\u2013161","https://doi.org/10.1145/2934583.2934608"],"date":"08 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"Q.

In this work, the MIT based two-terminal device is proposed as a compact oscillation neuron for the parallel read operation from the resistive synaptic array. The weighted sum is represented by the frequency of the oscillation neuron. Compared to the complex CMOS integrate-and-fire neuron with tens of transistors, the oscillation neuron achieves significant area reduction, thereby alleviating the column pitch matching problem of the peripheral circuitry in resistive memories. Firstly, the impact of MIT device characteristics on the weighted sum accuracy is investigated when the oscillation neuron is connected to a single resistive synaptic device. Secondly, the array-level performance is explored when the oscillation neurons are connected to the resistive synaptic array. To address the interference of oscillation between columns in simple cross-point arrays, a 2-transistor-1-resistor (2T1R) array architecture is proposed at negligible increase in array area. Finally, the circuit-level benchmark of the proposed oscillation neuron with the CMOS neuron is performed. At single neuron node level, oscillation neuron shows >12.5X reduction of area. At 128\u00d7128 array level, oscillation neuron shows a reduction of \u02dc4% total area, >30% latency, \u02dc5X energy and \u02dc40X leakage power, demonstrating its advantage of being integrated into the resistive synaptic array for neuro-inspired computing.","author":["Pai-Yu Chen","Jae-sun Seo","Yu Cao","Shimeng Yu"],"issue":["ICCAD '16: Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2016","Article No.: 15","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967015"],"date":"07 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"P.

As technology scales, especially under 40nm technology node, the read disturbance becomes severe since the read current approaches closely to the switching current. In addition, the read latency and access performance degrade significantly as well. The conventional 1T-1MTJ and 2T-2MTJ cell designs cannot address these challenges efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel 3T-3MTJ cell structure using the advanced perpendicular MTJ technology. This memory cell has higher storage density and better performance, and is particularly suitable for the deeply scaled technology node. A two-stage sensing scheme is also proposed to facilitate the read operation of the 3T-3MTJ cell design. Circuit-level and architecture-level simulations show that the proposed 3T-3MTJ cell structure can achieve a better tradeoff between storage density, access performance, energy consumption, and reliability compared to the prior 1T-1MTJ and 2T-2MTJ cell structures.","author":["Linuo Xue","Yuanqing Cheng","Jianlei Yang","Peiyuan Wang","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["ICCAD '16: Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2016","Article No.: 118","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967060"],"date":"07 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"Predictive technology model, http://ptm.asu.edu.","order":1},{"text":"S.

We present a design framework that performs fluidic task assignment, scheduling, and dynamic decision-making for quantitative epigenetics. We first describe our benchtop experimental studies to understand the relevance of chromatin structure on the regulation of gene function and its relationship to biochip design specifications. The proposed method models biochip design in terms of real-time multiprocessor scheduling and utilizes a heuristic algorithm to solve this NP-hard problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and it generates effective solutions for multiple sample pathways on a resource-limited biochip.

The maturity of computer vision (CV) techniques and the ubiquity of smartphone cameras hold promise for offering sub-meter accuracy localization services. However, pure CV-based solutions usually involve hundreds of photos and pre-calibration to construct image database, a labor-intensive overhead for practical deployment. We present ClickLoc, an accurate, easy-to-deploy, sensor-enriched, image-based indoor localization system. With core techniques rooted in semantic information extraction and optimization-based sensor data fusion, ClickLoc is able to bootstrap with few images. Leveraging sensor-enriched photos, ClickLoc also enables user localization with a single photo of the surrounding place of interest (POI) with high accuracy and short delay. Incorporating multi-modal localization with Manifold Alignment and Trapezoid Representation, ClickLoc not only localizes efficiently, but also provides image-assisted navigation. Extensive experiments in various environments show that the 80-percentile error is within 0.26m for POIs on the floor plan, which sheds light on sub-meter level indoor localization.","author":["Han Xu","Zheng Yang","Zimu Zhou","Longfei Shangguan","Ke Yi","Yunhao Liu"],"issue":["UbiComp '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing","September 2016","Pages   208\u2013219","https://doi.org/10.1145/2971648.2971668"],"date":"12 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"https://get.google.com/tango/.

Practical, Quantum-Secure Key Exchange from LWE","abstract":"Lattice-based cryptography offers some of the most attractive primitives believed to be resistant to quantum computers. Following increasing interest from both companies and government agencies in building quantum computers, a number of works have proposed instantiations of practical post-quantum key exchange protocols based on hard problems in ideal lattices, mainly based on the Ring Learning With Errors (R-LWE) problem. While ideal lattices facilitate major efficiency and storage benefits over their non-ideal counterparts, the additional ring structure that enables these advantages also raises concerns about the assumed difficulty of the underlying problems. Thus, a question of significant interest to cryptographers, and especially to those currently placing bets on primitives that will withstand quantum adversaries, is how much of an advantage the additional ring structure actually gives in practice. Despite conventional wisdom that generic lattices might be too slow and unwieldy, we demonstrate that LWE-based key exchange is quite practical: our constant time implementation requires around 1.3ms computation time for each party; compared to the recent NewHope R-LWE scheme, communication sizes increase by a factor of 4.7x, but remain under 12 KiB in each direction. Our protocol is competitive when used for serving web pages over TLS; when partnered with ECDSA signatures, latencies increase by less than a factor of 1.6x, and (even under heavy load) server throughput only decreases by factors of 1.5x and 1.2x when serving typical 1 KiB and 100 KiB pages, respectively. To achieve these practical results, our protocol takes advantage of several innovations. These include techniques to optimize communication bandwidth, dynamic generation of public parameters (which also offers additional security against backdoors), carefully chosen error distributions, and tight security parameters.","author":["Joppe Bos","Craig Costello","Leo Ducas","Ilya Mironov","Michael Naehrig","Valeria Nikolaenko","Ananth Raghunathan","Douglas Stebila"],"issue":["CCS '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2016","Pages   1006\u20131018","https://doi.org/10.1145/2976749.2978425"],"date":"24 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"D.

To bridge this gap, the user click data is employed recently. With this kind of data, images can be represented by the click feature vectors indicating their clicked queries. However, the large-scale and noisy queries from search engines bring low efficiency and accuracy. To enhance its performance, we propose to merge the queries with equivalent semantics and recognize images by the low-dimensional click features with merged queries. Besides, to further enhance its discriminative ability, we combine the click feature with deep CNN feature for image representation. The experimental results for image recognition on Clickture-Dog dataset show that, compared to a common visual feature, the user click feature is more powerful to characterize the image contents and can beat the state-of-the-art CNN feature. Also, the click feature computed on the merged queries will perform much better than CNN feature.","author":["Min Tan","Jun Yu","Guangjian Zheng","Weichen Wu","Kejia Sun"],"issue":["ICIMCS'16: Proceedings of the International Conference on Internet Multimedia Computing and Service","August 2016","Pages   118\u2013121","https://doi.org/10.1145/3007669.3007730"],"date":"19 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"Xian-Sheng Hua, Linjun Yang, Jingdong Wang, Jing Wang, Ming Ye, Kuansan Wang, Yong Rui, and Jin Li.

Prior proposed PIM architectures put additional computation logic in or near memory. The emerging metal-oxide resistive random access memory (ReRAM) has showed its potential to be used for main memory. Moreover, with its crossbar array structure, ReRAM can perform matrix-vector multiplication efficiently, and has been widely studied to accelerate neural network (NN) applications. In this work, we propose a novel PIM architecture, called PRIME, to accelerate NN applications in ReRAM based main memory. In PRIME, a portion of ReRAM crossbar arrays can be configured as accelerators for NN applications or as normal memory for a larger memory space. We provide microarchitecture and circuit designs to enable the morphable functions with an insignificant area overhead. We also design a software/hardware interface for software developers to implement various NNs on PRIME. Benefiting from both the PIM architecture and the efficiency of using ReRAM for NN computation, PRIME distinguishes itself from prior work on NN acceleration, with significant performance improvement and energy saving. Our experimental results show that, compared with a state-of-the-art neural processing unit design, PRIME improves the performance by ~2360\u00d7 and the energy consumption by ~895\u00d7, across the evaluated machine learning benchmarks.","author":["Ping Chi","Shuangchen Li","Cong Xu","Tao Zhang","Jishen Zhao","Yongpan Liu","Yu Wang","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 44","Issue 3","June 2016","pp   27\u201339","https://doi.org/10.1145/3007787.3001140"],"date":"18 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"S.

Traditional approaches often use Error Correction Code (ECC) to ensure the reliability of SSDs. For error-free flash memory pages, time costs spent on ECC are redundant and make read performance suboptimal. This article presents a CRC-Detect-First LDPC (CDF-LDPC) algorithm to optimize the read performance of SSDs. The basic idea is to bypass Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) decoding of error-free flash memory pages, which can be found using a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) code. Thus, error-free pages can be read directly without sacrificing the reliability of SSDs. Experiment results show that the read performance is improved more than 50% compared with traditional approaches. In particular, when idle time of benchmarks and SSD parallelism are exploited, CDF-LDPC can be performed more efficiently. In this case, the read performance of SSDs can be improved up to about 80% compared to that of the state-of-art.","author":["Shigui Qi","Dan Feng","Nan Su","Linjun Mei","Jingning Liu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 13","Issue 1","March 2017","Article No.: 7","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/3017430"],"date":"25 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"Nitin Agrawal, Vijayan Prabhakaran, Ted Wobber, John D.

However, given the large volume of the data involved, even modestly complex algorithms would require a prohibitively long time to complete. Hence it is the need of the hour to explore non-conventional implementation platforms to accelerate genomics research. In this work, we present an FPGA-accelerated implementation of the Pair HMM forward algorithm, the performance bottleneck in the HaplotypeCaller, a critical function in the popular GATK variant calling tool. We introduce the PE ring structure which, thanks to the fine-grained parallelism allowed by the FPGA, can be built into various configurations striking a trade-off between instruction-level parallelism (ILP) and data parallelism. We investigate the resource utilization and performance of different configurations. Our solution can achieve a speed-up of up to 487 times compared to the C++ baseline implementation on CPU and 1.56 times compared to the best published hardware implementation.","author":["Sitao Huang","Gowthami Jayashri Manikandan","Anand Ramachandran","Kyle Rupnow","Wen-mei W.

Energy-autonomy of such devices has great potential, but their intermittent power supply poses a challenge. Intermittent program execution compromises progress and leaves state inconsistent. This work describes Chain: a new model for programming intermittent devices.  A Chain program is a set of programmer-defined tasks that compute and exchange data through channels. Chain guarantees forward progress at task granularity. A task is restartable and never sees inconsistent state, because its input and output channels are separated. Our system supports language features for expressing advanced data exchange patterns and for encapsulating reusable functionality.  Chain fundamentally differs from state-of-the-art checkpointing approaches and does not incur the associated overhead. We implement Chain as C language extensions and a runtime library. We used Chain to implement four applications: machine learning, encryption, compression, and sensing. In experiments, Chain ensured consistency where prior approaches failed and improved throughput by 2-7x over the leading state-of-the-art system.","author":["Alexei Colin","Brandon Lucia"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 51","Issue 10","October 2016","pp   514\u2013530","https://doi.org/10.1145/3022671.2983995"],"date":"19 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"G.

A quantum computer comprises a cryogenic quantum processor and a classical electronic controller. When scaling up the cryogenic quantum processor to at least a few thousands, and possibly millions, of qubits required for any practical quantum algorithm, cryogenic CMOS (cryo-CMOS) electronics is required to allow feasible and compact interconnections between the controller and the quantum processor. Cryo-CMOS leverages the CMOS fabrication infrastructure while exploiting the continuous improvement of performance and miniaturization guaranteed by Moore's law, in order to enable the fabrication of a cost-effective practical quantum computer. However, designing cryo-CMOS integrated circuits requires a new set of CMOS device models, their embedding in design and verification tools, and the possibility to co-simulate the cryo-CMOS/quantum-processor architecture for full-system optimization. In this paper, we address these challenges by focusing on their impact on the design of complex cryo-CMOS systems.","author":["Fabio Sebastiano","Harald Homulle","Bishnu Patra","Rosario Incandela","Jeroen van Dijk","Lin Song","Masoud Babaie","Andrei Vladimirescu","Edoardo Charbon"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 13","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3072948"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

Ambiguities or errors in these specifications can lead to bugs in both compilers and applications. Yet architectures usually define their memory models with prose and litmus tests\u2014small concurrent programs that demonstrate allowed and forbidden outcomes. Recent work has formalized the memory models of common architectures through substantial manual effort, but as new architectures emerge, there is a growing need for tools to aid these efforts.   This paper presents MemSynth, a synthesis-aided system for reasoning about axiomatic specifications of memory models. MemSynth takes as input a set of litmus tests and a framework sketch that defines a class of memory models. The sketch comprises a set of axioms with missing expressions (or holes). Given these inputs, MemSynth synthesizes a completion of the axioms\u2014i.e., a memory model\u2014that gives the desired outcome on all tests. The MemSynth engine employs a novel embedding of bounded relational logic in a solver-aided programming language, which enables it to tackle complex synthesis queries intractable to existing relational solvers. This design also enables it to solve new kinds of queries, such as checking if a set of litmus tests unambiguously defines a memory model within a framework sketch.   We show that MemSynth can synthesize specifications for x86 in under two seconds, and for PowerPC in 12 seconds from 768 litmus tests. Our ambiguity check identifies missing tests from both the Intel x86 documentation and the validation suite of a previous PowerPC formalization. We also used MemSynth to reproduce, debug, and automatically repair a paper on comparing memory models in just two days.","author":["James Bornholt","Emina Torlak"],"issue":["PLDI 2017: Proceedings of the 38th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation","June 2017","Pages   467\u2013481","https://doi.org/10.1145/3062341.3062353"],"date":"14 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"S.

These emerging platforms have started to revolutionize many fields, including healthcare and wellness applications, particularly when integrated with intelligent analytic capabilities. However, a significant challenge that computer architects are facing is how to embed sophisticated analytic capabilities in wearable computers in an energy-efficient way while not compromising system performance. In this paper, we present XPro, a novel cross-end analytic engine architecture for wearable computing systems. The proposed cross-end architecture is able to realize a generic classification design across wearable sensors and a data aggregator with high energy-efficiency. To facilitate the practical use of XPro, we also develop an Automatic XPro Generator that formally generates XPro instances according to specific design constraints. As a proof of concept, we study the design and implementation of XPro with six different health applications. Evaluation results show that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, XPro can increase the battery life of the sensor node by 1.6-2.4X while at the same time reducing system delay by 15.6-60.8% for wearable computing systems.","author":["Aosen Wang","Lizhong Chen","Wenyao Xu"],"issue":["ISCA '17: Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2017","Pages   69\u201380","https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080219"],"date":"24 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"AHA Releases 2015 Heart and Stroke Statistics. http://www.sca-aware.org/sca-news/aha-releases-2015-heart-and-stroke-statistics.

The demand of higher speed and power efficiency, as well as the feature of error resilience in many applications (e.g., multimedia, recognition, and data analytics), have driven the development of approximate arithmetic design. In this article, a review and classification are presented for the current designs of approximate arithmetic circuits including adders, multipliers, and dividers. A comprehensive and comparative evaluation of their error and circuit characteristics is performed for understanding the features of various designs. By using approximate multipliers and adders, the circuit for an image processing application consumes as little as 47% of the power and 36% of the power-delay product of an accurate design while achieving similar image processing quality. Improvements in delay, power, and area are obtained for the detection of differences in images by using approximate dividers.","author":["Honglan Jiang","Cong Liu","Leibo Liu","Fabrizio Lombardi","Jie Han"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 13","Issue 4","August 2017","Article No.: 60","pp   1\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/3094124"],"date":"11 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Tinku Acharya and Ajoy K.

However, almost all previous models have failed to consider detailed context information and unknown states under which systems do not have enough information to answer given questions. These scenarios with incomplete or ambiguous information are very common in the setting of Interactive Question Answering (IQA). To address this challenge, we develop a novel model, employing context-dependent word-level attention for more accurate statement representations and question-guided sentence-level attention for better context modeling. We also generate unique IQA datasets to test our model, which will be made publicly available. Employing these attention mechanisms, our model accurately understands when it can output an answer or when it requires generating a supplementary question for additional input depending on different contexts. When available, user's feedback is encoded and directly applied to update sentence-level attention to infer an answer. Extensive experiments on QA and IQA datasets quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with significant improvement over state-of-the-art conventional QA models.","author":["Huayu Li","Martin Renqiang Min","Yong Ge","Asim Kadav"],"issue":["KDD '17: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2017","Pages   927\u2013935","https://doi.org/10.1145/3097983.3098115"],"date":"04 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2015.

Employing STT-MRAM as the main memory offers a wide variety of benefits, but also results in unique design challenges. In particular, read disturbance characterizes accidental data corruption in STT-MRAM after it is read, leading to a need of restoring data back to memory after each read operation. These extra restores significantly degrade system performance and energy efficiency, greatly changing the timing scenarios that conventional designs were optimized for. As a result, directly adopting conventional, restore-agnostic memory management techniques may lead to sub-optimal designs for STT-MRAM. In this work, we propose Restore-Aware Policy Selection (RAPS), a dynamic and hybrid row buffer management scheme that factors in the inevitable data restores in STT-MRAM-based main memory. RAPS monitors the row buffer hit rate at run time, dynamically switching between the open- and close-page policies. By factoring in restores, RAPS accurately captures the optimal design points, achieving optimal policy selections at run time. Our experimental results show that RAPS significantly improves system performance and energy efficiency compared to the conventional policies.","author":["Armin Haj Aboutalebi","Lide Duan"],"issue":["CASES '17: Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on Compilers, Architectures and Synthesis for Embedded Systems Companion","October 2017","Article No.: 21","Pages   1\u20132","https://doi.org/10.1145/3125501.3125517"],"date":"15 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Mohsen Ghasempour, Aamer Jaleel, Jim Garside, and Mikel Lujan. 2016.

However, most of these existing accelerators are designed with the same concept as their ASIC counterparts, that is all operations from different CNN layers are mapped to the same hardware units and work in a multiplexed way. Although this approach improves the generality of these accelerators, it does not take full advantage of reconfigurability and customizability of FPGAs, resulting in a certain degree of computational efficiency degradation, which is even worse on the embedded platforms. In this paper, we propose an FPGA-based CNN accelerator with all the layers mapped to their own on-chip units, and working concurrently as a pipeline. A strategy which can find the optimized paralleling scheme for each layer is proposed to eliminate the pipeline stall and achieve high resource utilization. In addition, a balanced pruning-based method is applied on fully connected (FC) layers to reduce the computational redundancy. As a case study, we implement a widely used CNNs model, LeNet-5, on an embedded FPGA device, Xilinx Zedboard. It can achieve a peak performance of 39.78 GOP/s and the power efficiency with a value 19.6 GOP/s/W which outperforms previous approaches.","author":["Lei Gong","Chao Wang","Xi Li","Huaping Chen","Xuehai Zhou"],"issue":["CODES '17: Proceedings of the Twelfth IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis Companion","October 2017","Article No.: 16","Pages   1\u20132","https://doi.org/10.1145/3125502.3125534"],"date":"15 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Jiachen Mao, Xiang Chen, Kent W Nixon, Christopher Krieger, and Yiran Chen.

While backscatter is low-power and low-cost, it is known to be limited to short ranges. This paper overturns this conventional wisdom about backscatter and presents the first wide-area backscatter system. Our design can successfully backscatter from any location between an RF source and receiver, separated by 475 m, while being compatible with commodity LoRa hardware. Further, when our backscatter device is co-located with the RF source, the receiver can be as far as 2.8 km away. We deploy our system in a 4,800 ft2 (446 m2) house spread across three floors, a 13,024 ft2 (1210 m2) office area covering 41 rooms, as well as a one-acre (4046 m2) vegetable farm and show that we can achieve reliable coverage, using only a single RF source and receiver. We also build a contact lens prototype as well as a flexible epidermal patch device attached to the human skin. We show that these devices can reliably backscatter data across a 3,328 ft2 (309 m2) room. Finally, we present a design sketch of a LoRa backscatter IC that shows that it costs less than a dime at scale and consumes only 9.25 \u03bcW of power, which is more than 1000x lower power than LoRa radio chipsets.","author":["Vamsi Talla","Mehrdad Hessar","Bryce Kellogg","Ali Najafi","Joshua R.

Intuitively, these attributes such as height, price or population count are able to richly characterize entities in knowledge graphs. This additional source of information may help to alleviate the inherent sparsity and incompleteness problem that are prevalent in knowledge graphs. Unfortunately, many state-of-the-art relational learning models ignore this information due to the challenging nature of dealing with non-discrete data types in the inherently binary-natured knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for both encoding and prediction of non-discrete attribute information in a relational setting. Specifically, we train a neural network for triplet prediction along with a separate network for attribute value regression. Via multi-task learning, we are able to learn representations of entities, relations and attributes that encode information about both tasks. Moreover, such attributes are not only central to many predictive tasks as an information source but also as a prediction target. Therefore, models that are able to encode, incorporate and predict such information in a relational learning context are highly attractive as well. We show that our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art methods for the tasks of relational triplet classification and attribute value prediction.","author":["Yi Tay","Luu Anh Tuan","Minh C.

Statistical relational learning methods can detect missing links by \"embedding\" the nodes and relations into latent feature tensors. Unfortunately, these methods are unable to learn good embeddings if the nodes are not well-connected. Our proposal is to learn embeddings for correlations between subgraphs and add a post-prediction phase to counter the lack of training data. This technique, applied on top of methods like TransE or HolE, can significantly increase the predictions on realistic KGs.","author":["Soumajit Pal","Jacopo Urbani"],"issue":["CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","November 2017","Pages   2247\u20132250","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133143"],"date":"06 November 2017","ref":[{"text":"Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Alberto Garc\u00eda-Dur\u00e1n, Jason Weston, and Oksana Yakhnenko. 2013.

With that, efficiency and security of code on the Web has become more important than ever. Yet JavaScript as the only built-in language of the Web is not well-equipped to meet these requirements, especially as a compilation target.  Engineers from the four major browser vendors have risen to the challenge and collaboratively designed a portable low-level bytecode called WebAssembly. It offers compact representation, efficient validation and compilation, and safe low to no-overhead execution. Rather than committing to a specific programming model, WebAssembly is an abstraction over modern hardware, making it language-, hardware-, and platform-independent, with use cases beyond just the Web. WebAssembly has been designed with a formal semantics from the start. We describe the motivation, design and formal semantics of WebAssembly and provide some preliminary experience with implementations.","author":["Andreas Haas","Andreas Rossberg","Derek L.

In many instances, the layouts of these networks are not entirely convex in shape. In this article, we propose a Kamada-Kawai-based algorithm called W-KK-MS for boundary node detection problems, which is capable of aligning node positions while achieving high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in producing a visual drawing from the input network topology. The algorithm put forward in this article selects and assigns weights to top-k nodes in each iteration to speed up the updating process of nodes. We also propose a novel approach to detect and unfold stacked regions in CNCAH networks. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can achieve fast convergence on boundary node detection in CNCAH networks and are able to successfully unfold stacked regions. The design and implementation of a prototype system called ELnet for analyzing CNCAH networks is also described in this article. The ELnet system is capable of generating synthetic networks for testing, integrating with force-directed algorithms, and visualizing and analyzing algorithms\u2019 outcomes.","author":["Se-Hang Cheong","Yain-Whar Si"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks","Volume 14","Issue 1","March 2018","Article No.: 1","pp   1\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/3154424"],"date":"21 December 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

The computational complexity of these algorithms and a need for high energy-efficiency has led to a surge in research on hardware accelerators. % for this paradigm. To reduce the latency and energy costs of accessing DRAM, most DNN accelerators are spatial in nature, with hundreds of processing elements (PE) operating in parallel and communicating with each other directly. DNNs are evolving at a rapid rate, and it is common to have convolution, recurrent, pooling, and fully-connected layers with varying input and filter sizes in the most recent topologies.They may be dense or sparse. They can also be partitioned in myriad ways (within and across layers) to exploit data reuse (weights and intermediate outputs). All of the above can lead to different dataflow patterns within the accelerator substrate. Unfortunately, most DNN accelerators support only fixed dataflow patterns internally as they perform a careful co-design of the PEs and the network-on-chip (NoC). In fact, the majority of them are only optimized for traffic within a convolutional layer. This makes it challenging to map arbitrary dataflows on the fabric efficiently, and can lead to underutilization of the available compute resources. DNN accelerators need to be programmable to enable mass deployment. For them to be programmable, they need to be configurable internally to support the various dataflow patterns that could be mapped over them. To address this need, we present MAERI, which is a DNN accelerator built with a set of modular and configurable building blocks that can easily support myriad DNN partitions and mappings by appropriately configuring tiny switches. MAERI provides 8-459% better utilization across multiple dataflow mappings over baselines with rigid NoC fabrics.","author":["Hyoukjun Kwon","Ananda Samajdar","Tushar Krishna"],"issue":["ASPLOS '18: Proceedings of the Twenty-Third International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2018","Pages   461\u2013475","https://doi.org/10.1145/3173162.3173176"],"date":"19 March 2018","ref":[{"text":"K.

Implementing of the general matrix-matrix multiplication on a new architecture is an important practice. To date, there has not been a sufficient description on a parallel implementation of the general matrix-matrix multiplication. In this study, we describe the parallel implementation of the double-precision general matrix-matrix multiplication (DGEMM) with OpenMP on the KNL. The implementation is based on the blocked matrix-matrix multiplication. We propose a method for choosing the cache block sizes and discuss the parallelism within the implementation of DGEMM. We show that the performance of DGEMM varies by the thread affinity environment variables. We conducted the performance experiments with the Intel Xeon Phi 7210 and 7250. The performance experiments validate our method.","author":["Roktaek Lim","Yeongha Lee","Raehyun Kim","Jaeyoung Choi"],"issue":["HPC Asia '18: Proceedings of Workshops of HPC Asia","January 2018","Pages   63\u201366","https://doi.org/10.1145/3176364.3176374"],"date":"31 January 2018","ref":[{"text":"Kazushige Goto and Robert A van de Geijn. 2008.

In general, news language is highly condensed, full of knowledge entities and common sense. However, existing methods are unaware of such external knowledge and cannot fully discover latent knowledge-level connections among news. The recommended results for a user are consequently limited to simple patterns and cannot be extended reasonably. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we propose a deep knowledge-aware network (DKN) that incorporates knowledge graph representation into news recommendation. DKN is a content-based deep recommendation framework for click-through rate prediction. The key component of DKN is a multi-channel and word-entity-aligned knowledge-aware convolutional neural network (KCNN) that fuses semantic-level and knowledge-level representations of news. KCNN treats words and entities as multiple channels, and explicitly keeps their alignment relationship during convolution. In addition, to address users\u00bb diverse interests, we also design an attention module in DKN to dynamically aggregate a user\u00bbs history with respect to current candidate news. Through extensive experiments on a real online news platform, we demonstrate that DKN achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art deep recommendation models. We also validate the efficacy of the usage of knowledge in DKN.","author":["Hongwei Wang","Fuzheng Zhang","Xing Xie","Minyi Guo"],"issue":["WWW '18: Proceedings of the 2018 World Wide Web Conference","April 2018","Pages   1835\u20131844","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186175"],"date":"10 April 2018","ref":[{"text":"Deepak Agarwal and Bee-Chung Chen. 2009.

Today, FPGAs provide more hardware parallelism than is possible with GPUs or CPUs, whereas C-like programming environments facilitate shorter development time, even close to software cycles. In this work, we address limitations and overheads in access and transfer of data to accelerators over common CPU-accelerator interconnects such as PCIe. We present three different FPGA accelerator dispatching methods for streaming applications (e.g., multimedia, vision computing). The first uses zero-copy data transfers and on-chip scratchpad memory (SPM) for energy efficiency, and the second uses also zero-copy but shared copy engines among different accelerator instances and local external memory. The third uses the processor\u2019s memory management unit to acquire the physical address of user pages and uses scatter-gather data transfers with SPM. Even though all techniques exhibit advantages in terms of scalability and relieve the processor from control overheads through using integrated schedulers, the first method presents the best energy-efficient acceleration in streaming applications.","author":["Dimitrios Mbakoyiannis","Othon Tomoutzoglou","George Kornaros"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization","Volume 15","Issue 1","April 2018","Article No.: 14","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/3180263"],"date":"22 March 2018","ref":[{"text":"Brad Brech, Juan Rubio, and Michael Hollinger. 2014.

Although many networks contain this type of temporal information, the majority of research in network representation learning has focused on static snapshots of the graph and has largely ignored the temporal dynamics of the network. In this work, we describe a general framework for incorporating temporal information into network embedding methods. The framework gives rise to methods for learning time-respecting embeddings from continuous-time dynamic networks. Overall, the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and dynamic network embedding approach as it achieves an average gain of 11.9% across all methods and graphs. The results indicate that modeling temporal dependencies in graphs is important for learning appropriate and meaningful network representations.","author":["Giang Hoang Nguyen","John Boaz Lee","Ryan A.

The amount of hardware resources needed for addition operations are quantified, and the performance of software and prototype hardware for posits are compared.

Most indoor localization solutions proposed in prior work do not deliver good accuracy without expensive infrastructure (and even then, the results may lack consistency). Ambient wireless received signal strength indication (RSSI) based fingerprinting using smart mobile devices is a low-cost approach to the problem. However, creating an accurate 'fingerprinting-only' solution remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to transform Wi-Fi signatures into images, to create a scalable fingerprinting framework based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our proposed CNN based indoor localization framework (CNN-LOC) is validated across several indoor environments and shows improvements over the best known prior works, with an average localization error of < 2 meters.","author":["Ayush Mittal","Saideep Tiku","Sudeep Pasricha"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '18: Proceedings of the 2018 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2018","Pages   117\u2013122","https://doi.org/10.1145/3194554.3194594"],"date":"30 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"\"How Google Maps Makes Money\", 2017 {Online} https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/061115/how-does-google-maps-makes-money.asp {Accessed: 1 Dec 2017}","order":1},{"text":"\"Target and Retailers Using Hybrid Indoor Location Tech to Enable New Customer Experiences\" {online} http://www.indoorlbs.com/new-blog-1/2015/11/30/target-and-other-retailers-using-indoor-location-tech {Accessed: 3 Dec 2017}","order":2},{"text":"\"Case Study: Accuracy & Precision of Google Analytics Geolocation\" 2017 {Online} Available at: https://radical-analytics.com/case-study-accuracy-precision-of-google-analytics-geolocation-4264510612c0 {Accessed: 1 Dec 2017}","order":3},{"text":"\"Ubisense Research Network\" {Online} Available: http://www.ubise nse.net/ {Accessed: 1 Dec 2017}","order":4},{"text":"G.

Inception and Residual are two promising structures adopted in many important modern DCNN models, including AlphaGo Zero's model. These structures allow considerably increasing the depth and width of the network to improve accuracy, without increasing the computational budget or the difficulty of convergence. Various accelerators for DCNNs have been proposed based on FPGA platform because it has advantages of high performance, good power efficiency, and fast development round, etc. However, previous FPGA mapping methods cannot fully adapt to the different data localities among layers and other characteristics of Inception and Residual, which leads to a under-utilization of FPGA resources. We propose LCP, a Layer Clusters Paralleling mapping method to classify the layers into clusters based on their differences of parameters and data localities, and then accelerate them in different partitions of FPGA. We evaluate our mapping method by implementing Inception/Residual modules from GoogLeNet [8] and ResNet-50 [4] on Xilinx VC709 (Virtex 690T) FPGA. The results show that the proposed method fully utilizes resources and achieves up to 4.03\u00d7 performance than the baseline and 2.00\u00d7 performance than the state-of-the-art methods.","author":["Xinhan Lin","Shouyi Yin","Fengbin Tu","Leibo Liu","Xiangyu Li","Shaojun Wei"],"issue":["DAC '18: Proceedings of the 55th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2018","Article No.: 16","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3196067"],"date":"24 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Manoj Alwani, Han Chen, Michael Ferdman, and Peter Milder. 2016.

To improve the performance of CNNs on FPGAs, fast algorithms and sparse methods emerge as the most attractive alternatives, which can effectively reduce the complexity of CNNs. Using fast algorithms, the feature maps are transformed to special domain to reduce the arithmetic complexity. On the other hand, compressing CNN models by pruning the unimportant connections reduces both storage and arithmetic complexity. In this paper, we introduce sparse Winograd convolution accelerator (SpWA) combining these two orthogonal approaches on FPGAs. First, we employ a novel dataflow by rearranging the filter layout in Winograd convolution. Then we design an efficient architecture to implement SpWA using line buffer design and Compress-Sparse-Column (CSC) format-based processing element. Finally, we propose an efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming to balance the computation among different processing elements.

In this paper, a novel method to detect SQLIA based on word vector of SQL tokens and LSTM neural networks is described. In the proposed method, SQL query strings were firstly syntactically analyzed into tokens, and then likelihood ratio test is used to build the word vector of SQL tokens, ultimately, an LSTM model is trained with sequences of token word vectors.

One component supports the logical database as seen by the user. Another component maps the information into physical records. The third component, called the storage component, is responsible for mapping these records onto auxiliary storage (generally disks) and controlling their transfer to and from main storage.This paper is primarily concerned with the implementation of a storage component. It considers a simple and classical interface to the storage component: Seen at this level the database is a collection of segments. Each segment is a linear address space.A recovery scheme is first proposed for system failure (hardware or software error which causes the contents of main storage to be lost). It is based on maintaining a dual mapping between pages and their location on disk. One mapping represents the current state of a segment being modified; the other represents a previous backup state. At any time the backup state can be replaced by the current state without any data merging. Procedures for segment modification, save, and restore are analyzed. Another section proposes a facility for protection against damage to the auxiliary storage itself. It is shown how such protection can be obtained by copying on a tape (checkpoint) only those pages that have been modified since the last checkpoint.","author":["Raymond A.

Existing systems stream 360\u00b0 videos in a similar way as regular videos, where all data of the panoramic view is transmitted. This is wasteful since a user only views a small portion of the 360\u00b0 view. To save bandwidth, recent works propose the tile-based streaming, which divides the panoramic view to multiple smaller sized tiles and streams only the tiles within a user's field of view (FoV) predicted based on the recent head position. Interestingly, the tile-based streaming has only been simulated or implemented on desktops. We find that it cannot run in real-time even on the latest smartphone (e.g., Samsung S7, Samsung S8 and Huawei Mate 9) due to hardware and software limitations. Moreover, it results in significant video quality degradation due to head movement prediction error, which is hard to avoid. Motivated by these observations, we develop a novel tile-based layered approach to stream 360\u00b0 content on smartphones to avoid bandwidth wastage while maintaining high video quality. Through real system experiments, we show our approach can achieve up to 69% improvement in user QoE and 49% in bandwidth savings over existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 360\u00b0 streaming framework that takes into account the practical limitations of Android based smartphones.","author":["Jian He","Mubashir Adnan Qureshi","Lili Qiu","Jin Li","Feng Li","Lei Han"],"issue":["MobiSys '18: Proceedings of the 16th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services","June 2018","Pages   482\u2013494","https://doi.org/10.1145/3210240.3210323"],"date":"10 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"2017. 360-Degree Football Game Video.

The current practice only investigate stand-alone compression schemes even though each compression technique may be well suited only for certain types of DNN layers. Also, these compression techniques are optimized merely for the inference accuracy of DNNs, without explicitly considering other application-driven system performance (e.g. latency and energy cost) and the varying resource availabilities across platforms (e.g. storage and processing capability). In this paper, we explore the desirable tradeoff between performance and resource constraints by user-specified needs, from a holistic system-level viewpoint. Specifically, we develop a usage-driven selection framework, referred to as AdaDeep, to automatically select a combination of compression techniques for a given DNN, that will lead to an optimal balance between user-specified performance goals and resource constraints. With an extensive evaluation on five public datasets and across twelve mobile devices, experimental results show that AdaDeep enables up to 9.8x latency reduction, 4.3x energy efficiency improvement, and 38x storage reduction in DNNs while incurring negligible accuracy loss. AdaDeep also uncovers multiple effective combinations of compression techniques unexplored in existing literature.","author":["Sicong Liu","Yingyan Lin","Zimu Zhou","Kaiming Nan","Hui Liu","Junzhao Du"],"issue":["MobiSys '18: Proceedings of the 16th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services","June 2018","Pages   389\u2013400","https://doi.org/10.1145/3210240.3210337"],"date":"10 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Joshua Achiam, David Held, Aviv Tamar, and Pieter Abbeel. 2017.

Compared with HDD arrays, SSD arrays drastically enhance storage density and I/O performance, and reduce power and rack space. Nevertheless, SSDs suffer aging issues. Though prior studies have been conducted to address this disadvantage, effective techniques of RAID/SSD controllers are urgently needed to extend the lifetime of SSD arrays.  In this paper, we for the first time apply approximate storage via the interplay of RAID and SSD controllers to optimize the lifespan of SSD arrays. Our basic idea is to reuse faulty blocks (those contain pages with uncorrectable errors) to store approximate data (which can tolerate more errors). By relaxing the integrity of flash blocks, we observed that the endurance of NAND flash memory can be significantly boosted, thereby providing huge potentials to significantly extend the lifetime of SSDs. Based on this observation, we propose the use of an efficient space management scheme for data allocation and FTL strategies by coordinating the interplay of RAID and SSD controllers to optimize the lifetime of SSD arrays. We implemented a prototype, called FreeRAID, based on an SSD array simulator. Our experiments show that we can significantly increase the lifetime by up to 2.17\u00d7 compared with conventional SSD-based RAID arrays.","author":["Lei Han","Zhaoyan Shen","Zili Shao","Tao Li"],"issue":["LCTES 2018: Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems","June 2018","Pages   44\u201354","https://doi.org/10.1145/3211332.3211338"],"date":"19 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Rodolfo Azevedo, John D Davis, Karin Strauss, Parikshit Gopalan, Mark Manasse, and Sergey Yekhanin. 2013.

However, most of existing heterogenous information network embedding models adopt the dot product to measure the proximity in the low dimensional space, and thus they can only preserve the first-order proximity and are insufficient to capture the global structure. Compared with homogenous information networks, there are multiple types of links (i.e., multiple relations) in HINs, and the link distribution w.r.t relations is highly skewed. To address the above challenging issues, we propose a novel heterogenous information network embedding model PME based on the metric learning to capture both first-order and second-order proximities in a unified way. To alleviate the potential geometrical inflexibility of existing metric learning approaches, we propose to build object and relation embeddings in separate object space and relation spaces rather than in a common space. Afterwards, we learn embeddings by firstly projecting vertices from object space to corresponding relation space and then calculate the proximity between projected vertices. To overcome the heavy skewness of the link distribution w.r.t relations and avoid \"over-sampling'' or \"under-sampling'' for each relation, we propose a novel loss-aware adaptive sampling approach for the model optimization. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a large-scale HIN dataset, and the experimental results show superiority of our proposed PME model in terms of prediction accuracy and scalability.","author":["Hongxu Chen","Hongzhi Yin","Weiqing Wang","Hao Wang","Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen","Xue Li"],"issue":["KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2018","Pages   1177\u20131186","https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3219986"],"date":"19 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Amr Ahmed, Nino Shervashidze, Shravan Narayanamurthy, Vanja Josifovski, and Alexander J Smola. 2013.

The performance challenge is in their irregular memory access patterns, especially on architectures with high memory latency, such as GPUs. Previous work has proposed multi-pass scatter and gather schemes to optimize their performance on earlier GPUs; on newer GPUs, nevertheless, anecdotal evidence showed that such schemes had little performance benefit on small datasets, and few studies have been conducted on larger datasets. Therefore, we propose a systematic study to re-evaluate the performance of multi-pass scatter and gather on three newer GPUs with various data sizes. Specifically, we micro-benchmark the undocumented Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs) on these GPUs to quantitatively analyze their performance impact. We then develop an analytical model to analyze the execution of irregular memory accesses and estimate the multi-pass performance. Our evaluation on the newer GPUs shows that (1) TLB caching can affect the performance of irregular memory accesses more significantly than data caching; (2) on datasets larger than the L3 TLB size, the multi-pass schemes, with a suitable number of passes, can reduce up to 87.8% of the execution time over the single-pass version due to better TLB locality. Our model can predict the multipass performance on various GPUs, with an average accuracy of 92.9%. It can further suggest a suitable number of passes for the best performance.","author":["Zhuohang Lai","Qiong Luo","Xiaoying Jia"],"issue":["ICPP 2018: Proceedings of the 47th International Conference on Parallel Processing","August 2018","Article No.: 25","Pages   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/3225058.3225095"],"date":"13 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"Thomas W Barr, Alan L Cox, and Scott Rixner. 2010.

Running DNNs on resource-constrained mobile devices is, however, by no means trivial, since it incurs high performance and energy overhead. While offloading DNNs to the cloud for execution suffers unpredictable performance, due to the uncontrolled long wide-area network latency. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose Edgent, a collaborative and on-demand DNN co-inference framework with device-edge synergy. Edgent pursues two design knobs: (1) DNN partitioning that adaptively partitions DNN computation between device and edge, in order to leverage hybrid computation resources in proximity for real-time DNN inference. (2) DNN right-sizing that accelerates DNN inference through early-exit at a proper intermediate DNN layer to further reduce the computation latency. The prototype implementation and extensive evaluations based on Raspberry Pi demonstrate Edgent's effectiveness in enabling on-demand low-latency edge intelligence.","author":["En Li","Zhi Zhou","Xu Chen"],"issue":["MECOMM'18: Proceedings of the 2018 Workshop on Mobile Edge Communications","August 2018","Pages   31\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/3229556.3229562"],"date":"07 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"K.

PLoRa takes ambient LoRa transmissions as the excitation signals, conveys data by modulating an excitation signal into a new standard LoRa \"chirp\" signal, and shifts this new signal to a different LoRa channel to be received at a gateway faraway. PLoRa achieves this by a holistic RF front-end hardware and software design, including a low-power packet detection circuit, a blind chirp modulation algorithm and a low-power energy management circuit. To form a complete ambient LoRa backscatter network, we integrate a light-weight backscatter signal decoding algorithm with a MAC-layer protocol that work together to make coexistence of PLoRa tags and active LoRa nodes possible in the network. We prototype PLoRa on a four-layer printed circuit board, and test it in various outdoor and indoor environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that our prototype PCB PLoRa tag can backscatter an ambient LoRa transmission sent from a nearby LoRa node (20 cm away) to a gateway up to 1.1 km away, and deliver 284 bytes data every 24 minutes indoors, or every 17 minutes outdoors. We also simulate a 28-nm low-power FPGA based prototype whose digital baseband processor achieves 220 \u03bcW power consumption.","author":["Yao Peng","Longfei Shangguan","Yue Hu","Yujie Qian","Xianshang Lin","Xiaojiang Chen","Dingyi Fang","Kyle Jamieson"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '18: Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication","August 2018","Pages   147\u2013160","https://doi.org/10.1145/3230543.3230567"],"date":"07 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"2N7000 MOSFET.

Deep learning uses multiple layers to represent the abstractions of data to build computational models. Some key enabler deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and model transfers have completely changed our perception of information processing. However, there exists an aperture of understanding behind this tremendously fast-paced domain, because it was never previously represented from a multiscope perspective. The lack of core understanding renders these powerful methods as black-box machines that inhibit development at a fundamental level. Moreover, deep learning has repeatedly been perceived as a silver bullet to all stumbling blocks in machine learning, which is far from the truth. This article presents a comprehensive review of historical and recent state-of-the-art approaches in visual, audio, and text processing; social network analysis; and natural language processing, followed by the in-depth analysis on pivoting and groundbreaking advances in deep learning applications. It was also undertaken to review the issues faced in deep learning such as unsupervised learning, black-box models, and online learning and to illustrate how these challenges can be transformed into prolific future research avenues.","author":["Samira Pouyanfar","Saad Sadiq","Yilin Yan","Haiman Tian","Yudong Tao","Maria Presa Reyes","Mei-Ling Shyu","Shu-Ching Chen","S.

With the increasing size and complexity of software, bug fixing becomes increasingly more difficult. Bug and commit data of open source projects, Q&A documents and other software resources contain a sea of bug knowledge which can be utilized to help developers understand and fix bugs. Existing work focuses on data mining from a certain software resource in isolation to assist in bug fixing, which may reduce the efficiency of bug fixing.  How to obtain, organize and understand bug knowledge from multi-source software data is an urgent problem to be solved. In order to solve this problem, we utilize knowledge graph (KG) technology to explore the deep semantic and structural relationships in the multi-source software data, propose effective search and recommendation techniques based on the knowledge graph, and design a bug-fix knowledge question & answering system to assist developers in intelligent software bug fixing. At present, we have designed a bug knowledge graph construction framework, proposed the identification principles and methods for bug knowledge entities and relationships, constructed a preliminary knowledge graph based on the bug repository. In the following work, we will further improve the knowledge graph, complete the knowledge graph fusion of multi-source database, comprehend bug knowledge through knowledge reasoning, utilize the collaborative search and recommendation technology for bug-fixing knowledge question and answering.","author":["Cheng Zhou"],"issue":["ESEC/FSE 2018: Proceedings of the 2018 26th ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering","October 2018","Pages   944\u2013947","https://doi.org/10.1145/3236024.3275428"],"date":"26 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Karan Aggarwal, Finbarr Timbers, Tanner Rutgers, Abram Hindle, Eleni Stroulia, and Russell Greiner. 2017.

However, with the advent of MPI+CUDA applications and dense multi-GPU systems, it has become important to design efficient communication schemes. This coupled with new application workloads brought forward by Deep Learning frameworks like Caffe and Microsoft CNTK pose additional design constraints due to very large message communication of GPU buffers during the training phase. In this context, special-purpose libraries like NCCL have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a pipelined chain (ring) design for the MPI_Bcast collective operation along with an enhanced collective tuning framework in MVAPICH2-GDR that enables efficient intra-/internode multi-GPU communication. We present an in-depth performance landscape for the proposed MPI_Bcast schemes along with a comparative analysis of NCCL Broadcast and NCCL-based MPI_Bcast. The proposed designs for MVAPICH2-GDR enable up to 14X and 16.6X improvement, compared to NCCL-based solutions, for intra- and internode broadcast latency, respectively. In addition, the proposed designs provide up to 7% improvement over NCCL-based solutions for data parallel training of the VGG network on 128 GPUs using Microsoft CNTK. The proposed solutions outperform the recently introduced NCCL2 library for small and medium message sizes and offer comparable/better performance for very large message sizes.","author":["Ammar Ahmad Awan","Ching-Hsiang Chu","Hari Subramoni","Dhabaleswar K.

The query language SPARQL has become the standard language for querying RDF since its W3C standardization in 2008. However, the 2008 version of this language missed some important functionalities: reasoning capabilities to deal with RDFS and OWL vocabularies, navigational capabilities to exploit the graph structure of RDF data, and a general form of recursion much needed to express some natural queries. To overcome these limitations, a new version of SPARQL, called SPARQL 1.1, was released in 2013, which includes entailment regimes for RDFS and OWL vocabularies, and a mechanism to express navigation patterns through regular expressions. Unfortunately, there are a number of useful navigation patterns that cannot be expressed in SPARQL 1.1, and the language lacks a general mechanism to express recursive queries. To the best of our knowledge, no efficient RDF query language that combines the above functionalities is known. It is the aim of this work to fill this gap. To this end, we focus on a core fragment of the OWL 2 QL profile of OWL 2 and show that every SPARQL query enriched with the above features can be naturally translated into a query expressed in a language that is based on an extension of Datalog, which allows for value invention and stratified negation. However, the query evaluation problem for this language is highly intractable, which is not surprising since it is expressive enough to encode some inherently hard queries. We identify a natural fragment of it, and we show it to be tractable and powerful enough to define SPARQL queries enhanced with the desired functionalities.","author":["Marcelo Arenas","Georg Gottlob","Andreas Pieris"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Database Systems","Volume 43","Issue 3","November 2018","Article No.: 13","pp   1\u201345","https://doi.org/10.1145/3238304"],"date":"16 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"Serge Abiteboul, Richard Hull, and Victor Vianu. 1995.

However, programmers now need to deal with ensuring the atomicity of transactions on Persistent Memory resident data and maintaining consistency between the order in which processors perform stores and that in which the updated values become durable. The problem is specially challenging when high-performance isolation mechanisms like Hardware Transactional Memory (htm) are used for concurrency control. This work shows how htm transactions can be ordered correctly and atomically into PM by the use of a novel software protocol combined with a Persistent Memory Controller, without requiring changes to processor cache hardware or htm protocols. In contrast, previous approaches require significant changes to existing processor microarchitectures. Our approach, evaluated using both micro-benchmarks and the stamp suite compares well with standard (volatile) htm transactions. It also yields significant gains in throughput and latency in comparison with persistent transactional locking.","author":["Ellis Giles","Kshitij Doshi","Peter Varman"],"issue":["MEMSYS '18: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Memory Systems","October 2018","Pages   190\u2013205","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240302.3240305"],"date":"01 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"F.

The design of motion classifier observes significant challenges due to the large number of channels and stringent communication latency requirement. This paper proposes an edge-computing distributed neural processor to effectively reduce the data traffic and physical wiring congestion. A special local and global networking architecture is introduced to significantly reduce traffic among multi-chips in edge computing. To optimize the design space of the features selected, a systematic design methodology is proposed. A novel mixed-signal feature extraction approach with assistance of neural network distortion recovery is also provided to significantly reduce the silicon area. A 12-channel 55nm CMOS test chip was implemented to demonstrate the proposed systematic design methodology. The measurement shows the test chip consumes only 20uW power, more than 10,000X less power than the current clinically used microprocessor and can perform edge-computing networking operation within 5ms time.","author":["Kofi Otseidu","Tianyu Jia","Joshua Bryne","Levi Hargrove","Jie Gu"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 120","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240794"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"D.

The proliferation of user-generated web content such as blogs, discussion forums and online review sites has made it possible to perform large-scale mining of public opinion. Sentiment modeling is thus becoming a critical component of market intelligence and social media technologies that aim to tap into the collective wisdom of crowds. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning high-quality sentiment models with minimal manual supervision. We propose a novel approach to learn from lexical prior knowledge in the form of domain-independent sentiment-laden terms, in conjunction with domain-dependent unlabeled data and a few labeled documents. Our model is based on a constrained non-negative tri-factorization of the term-document matrix which can be implemented using simple update rules. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of real-world sentiment prediction tasks.","author":["Tao Li","Yi Zhang","Vikas Sindhwani"],"issue":["ACL '09: Proceedings of the Joint Conference of the 47th Annual Meeting of the ACL and the 4th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing of the AFNLP: Volume 1 - Volume 1","August 2009","Pages   244\u2013252"],"date":"02 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"J.

However, the required massive data collection raises privacy concerns during both training and prediction stages. In this paper, we design and implement a general framework for privacy-preserving machine learning and use it to obtain new solutions for training linear regression, logistic regression and neural network models. Our protocols are in a three-server model wherein data owners secret share their data among three servers who train and evaluate models on the joint data using three-party computation (3PC). Our main contribution is a new and complete framework ($\\textABY ^3$) for efficiently switching back and forth between arithmetic, binary, and Yao 3PC which is of independent interest. Many of the conversions are based on new techniques that are designed and optimized for the first time in this paper. We also propose new techniques for fixed-point multiplication of shared decimal values that extends beyond the three-party case, and customized protocols for evaluating piecewise polynomial functions. We design variants of each building block that is secure against \\em malicious adversaries who deviate arbitrarily. We implement our system in C++. Our protocols are up to \\em four orders of magnitude faster than the best prior work, hence significantly reducing the gap between privacy-preserving and plaintext training.","author":["Payman Mohassel","Peter Rindal"],"issue":["CCS '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2018","Pages   35\u201352","https://doi.org/10.1145/3243734.3243760"],"date":"15 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Azure machine learning studio. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning-studio/.","order":1},{"text":"Eigen library. http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/.","order":2},{"text":"Google cloud ai. https://cloud.google.com/products/machine-learning/.","order":3},{"text":"Machine learning on aws. https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/.","order":4},{"text":"MNIST database. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

However, the heavy computational cost of mining valuable pair or triplet of training data and updating models frequently in existing deep metric learning approaches becomes a barrier to apply such methods to a large-scale real-world context in a distributed environment. Moreover, existing distributed deep learning framework is not designed for deep metric learning tasks, because it is difficult to implement a smart mining policy of valuable training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel distributed framework to speed up the training process of the deep metric learning using multiple machines. Specifically, we first design a distributed sampling method to find the hard-negative samples from a broader scope of candidate samples compared to the single-machine solution. Then, we design a hybrid communication pattern and implement a decentralized data-parallel framework to reduce the communication workload while the quality of the trained deep metric models is preserved. In experiments, we show excellent performance gain compared to a full spectrum of state-of-the-art deep metric learning models on multiple datasets in terms of image clustering and image retrieval tasks.","author":["Yuxin Su","Michael Lyu","Irwin King"],"issue":["CIKM '18: Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2018","Pages   1463\u20131472","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271807"],"date":"17 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mart'i n Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, Manjunath Kudlur, Josh Levenberg, Rajat Monga, Sherry Moore, Derek Gordon Murray, Benoit Steiner, Paul A.

A camera that could \u201csee around corners\u201d could help improve navigation and mapping capabilities of autonomous vehicles or make search and rescue missions more effective. Time-resolved single-photon imaging systems have recently been demonstrated to record optical information of a scene that can lead to an estimation of the shape and reflectance of objects hidden from the line of sight of a camera. However, existing non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reconstruction algorithms have been constrained in the types of light transport effects they model for the hidden scene parts. We introduce a factored NLOS light transport representation that accounts for partial occlusions and surface normals. Based on this model, we develop a factorization approach for inverse time-resolved light transport and demonstrate high-fidelity NLOS reconstructions for challenging scenes both in simulation and with an experimental NLOS imaging system.","author":["Felix Heide","Matthew O\u2019Toole","Kai Zang","David B.

The ability to compute gradients is crucial to optimization, inverse problems, and deep learning. In rendering, the gradient is required with respect to variables such as camera parameters, light sources, scene geometry, or material appearance. However, computing the gradient of rendering is challenging because the rendering integral includes visibility terms that are not differentiable. Previous work on differentiable rendering has focused on approximate solutions. They often do not handle secondary effects such as shadows or global illumination, or they do not provide the gradient with respect to variables other than pixel coordinates.We introduce a general-purpose differentiable ray tracer, which, to our knowledge, is the first comprehensive solution that is able to compute derivatives of scalar functions over a rendered image with respect to arbitrary scene parameters such as camera pose, scene geometry, materials, and lighting parameters. The key to our method is a novel edge sampling algorithm that directly samples the Dirac delta functions introduced by the derivatives of the discontinuous integrand. We also develop efficient importance sampling methods based on spatial hierarchies. Our method can generate gradients in times running from seconds to minutes depending on scene complexity and desired precision.We interface our differentiable ray tracer with the deep learning library PyTorch and show prototype applications in inverse rendering and the generation of adversarial examples for neural networks.","author":["Tzu-Mao Li","Miika Aittala","Fr\u00e9do Durand","Jaakko Lehtinen"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 37","Issue 6","December 2018","Article No.: 222","pp   1\u201311","https://doi.org/10.1145/3272127.3275109"],"date":"04 December 2018","ref":[{"text":"Miika Aittala, Timo Aila, and Jaakko Lehtinen. 2016.

Absence of adequate representation for an input introduces the problem of data sparsity, and it poses a great challenge to solve the underlying problem. The problem is more intensified with resource-poor languages due to the absence of a sufficiently large corpus required to train a word embedding model. In this work, we propose an effective method to improve the word embedding coverage in less-resourced languages by leveraging bilingual word embeddings learned from different corpora. We train and evaluate deep Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based architecture and show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for two aspect-level sentiment analysis tasks (i.e., aspect term extraction and sentiment classification). The neural network architecture is further assisted by hand-crafted features for prediction. We apply the proposed model in two experimental setups: multi-lingual and cross-lingual. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art methods.","author":["Md Shad Akhtar","Palaash Sawant","Sukanta Sen","Asif Ekbal","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing","Volume 18","Issue 2","February 2019","Article No.: 15","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/3273931"],"date":"17 December 2018","ref":[{"text":"Md Shad Akhtar, Deepak, Asif Ekbal, and Pushpak Bhattacharyya. 2017.

In HD, input symbols are mapped to a hypervector and an associative search is performed for reasoning and classification. An associative memory, which finds the closest match between a set of learned hypervectors and a query hypervector, uses simple Hamming distance metric for similarity check. However, we observe that, in order to provide acceptable classification accuracy HD needs to store non-binarized model in associative memory and uses costly similarity metrics such as cosine to perform a reasoning task. This makes the HD computationally expensive when it is used for realistic classification problems. In this paper, we propose a FPGA-based acceleration of HD (FACH) which significantly improves the computation efficiency by removing majority of multiplications during the reasoning task. FACH identifies representative values in each class hypervector using clustering algorithm. Then, it creates a new HD model with hardware-friendly operations, and accordingly propose an FPGA-based implementation to accelerate such tasks. Our evaluations on several classification problems show that FACH can provide 5.9X energy efficiency improvement and 5.1X speedup as compared to baseline FPGA-based implementation, while ensuring the same quality of classification.","author":["Mohsen Imani","Sahand Salamat","Saransh Gupta","Jiani Huang","Tajana Rosing"],"issue":["ASPDAC '19: Proceedings of the 24th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2019","Pages   493\u2013498","https://doi.org/10.1145/3287624.3287667"],"date":"21 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"K.

Since its first on-chip experimental demonstration, it has attracted more and more research interests due to the advantages of ultra-high speed inference with low power consumption. In this work, we design a novel slimmed architecture for realizing optical neural network considering both its software and hardware implementations. Different from the originally proposed ONN architecture based on singular value decomposition which results in two implementation-expensive unitary matrices, we show a more area-efficient architecture which uses a sparse tree network block, a single unitary block and a diagonal block for each neural network layer. In the experiments, we demonstrate that by leveraging the training engine, we are able to find a comparable accuracy to that of the previous architecture, which brings about the flexibility of using the slimmed implementation. The area cost in terms of the Mach-Zehnder interferometers, the core optical components of ONN, is 15%-38% less for various sizes of optical neural networks.","author":["Zheng Zhao","Derong Liu","Meng Li","Zhoufeng Ying","Lu Zhang","Biying Xu","Bei Yu","Ray T.

The success of using such devices in the healthcare industry depends strongly on secured and reliable medical data transmission. Physicians diagnose that data and prescribe medicines and/or give guidelines/instructions/treatment plans for the patients. Therefore, a physician is always concerned about the medical data trustworthiness, because if it is not guaranteed, a savior can become an involuntary foe! This paper analyses two different scenarios to understand the real-life consequences in IoT-based healthcare (IoT-Health) application. Appropriate sequence diagrams for both scenarios show data movement as a basis for determining necessary security requirements in each layer of IoT-Health. We analyse the individual entities of the overall system and develop a system-wide view of trust in IoT-Health. The security analysis pinpoints the research gap in end-to-end trust and indicates the necessity to treat the whole IoT-Health system as an integrated entity. This study highlights the importance of integrated cross-layer security solutions that can deal with the heterogeneous security architectures of IoT healthcare system and finally identifies a possible solution for the open question raised in the security analysis with appropriate future research directions.","author":["Fariha Tasmin Jaigirdar","Carsten Rudolph","Chris Bain"],"issue":["ACSW 2019: Proceedings of the Australasian Computer Science Week Multiconference","January 2019","Article No.: 27","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3290688.3290731"],"date":"29 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Mohammed Riyadh Abdmeziem and Djamel Tandjaoui. 2015.

On the other hand, in recent years Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has become more widespread in which a client uses cloud services for analyzing its data. However, the client's data may be sensitive which raises privacy concerns. In this paper, we address the issue of privacy preserving classification in a Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) settings and focus on convolutional neural networks (CNN). To achieve this goal, we develop new techniques to run CNNs over encrypted data. First, we design methods to approximate commonly used activation functions in CNNs (i.e. ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) with low degree polynomials which is essential for a practical and efficient solution. Then, we train CNNs with approximation polynomials instead of original activation functions and implement CNNs classification over encrypted data. We evaluate the performance of our modified models at each step. The results of our experiments using several CNNs with a varying number of layers and structures are promising. When applied to the MNIST optical character recognition tasks, our approach achieved 99.25% accuracy which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions and is close to the accuracy of the best non-private version. Furthermore, it can make up to 164000 predictions per hour. These results show that our approach provides accurate, efficient, and scalable privacy-preserving predictions in CNNs.","author":["Ehsan Hesamifard","Hassan Takabi","Mehdi Ghasemi"],"issue":["CODASPY '19: Proceedings of the Ninth ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy","March 2019","Pages   97\u2013108","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292006.3300044"],"date":"13 March 2019","ref":[{"text":"Louis J.

A grand challenge on data mining research is to develop effective and scalable methods that may transform unstructured text into structured knowledge. Based on our vision, it is highly beneficial to transform such text into structured heterogeneous information networks, on which actionable knowledge can be generated based on the user's need. In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive overview on recent research and development in this direction. First, we introduce a series of effective methods that construct heterogeneous information networks from massive, domain-specific text corpora. Then we discuss methods that mine such text-rich networks based on the user's need. Specifically, we focus on scalable, effective, weakly supervised, language-agnostic methods that work on various kinds of text. We further demonstrate, on real datasets (including news articles, scientific publications, and product reviews), how information networks can be constructed and how they can assist further exploratory analysis.","author":["Jingbo Shang","Jiaming Shen","Liyuan Liu","Jiawei Han"],"issue":["KDD '19: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2019","Pages   3191\u20133192","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292500.3332275"],"date":"25 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"David M.

Existing quantum programming languages and compilers use a quantum assembly language composed of 1- and 2-qubit (quantum bit) gates. Quantum compiler frameworks translate this quantum assembly to electric signals (called control pulses) that implement the specified computation on specific physical devices. However, there is a mismatch between the operations defined by the 1- and 2-qubit logical ISA and their underlying physical implementation, so the current practice of directly translating logical instructions into control pulses results in inefficient, high-latency programs. To address this inefficiency, we propose a universal quantum compilation methodology that aggregates multiple logical operations into larger units that manipulate up to 10 qubits at a time. Our methodology then optimizes these aggregates by (1) finding commutative intermediate operations that result in more efficient schedules and (2) creating custom control pulses optimized for the aggregate (instead of individual 1- and 2-qubit operations). Compared to the standard gate-based compilation, the proposed approach realizes a deeper vertical integration of high-level quantum software and low-level, physical quantum hardware. We evaluate our approach on important near-term quantum applications on simulations of superconducting quantum architectures. Our proposed approach provides a mean speedup of $5\\times$, with a maximum of $10\\times$. Because latency directly affects the feasibility of quantum computation, our results not only improve performance but also have the potential to enable quantum computation sooner than otherwise possible.","author":["Yunong Shi","Nelson Leung","Pranav Gokhale","Zane Rossi","David I.

As we accumulate, mostly automatically, data at unprecedented volumes and speed, our datasets have become complex and hard to understand. In this context exploratory search provides a handy tool for progressively gather the necessary knowledge by starting from a tentative query that hopefully leads to answers at least partially relevant and that can provide cues about the next queries to issue. Recently, we have witnessed a rediscovery of the so-called example-based methods, in which the user or the analyst circumvent query languages by using examples as input. This shift in semantics has led to a number of methods receiving as query a set of example members of the answer set. The search system then infers the entire answer set based on the given examples and any additional information provided by the underlying database. In this tutorial, we present an excursus over the main example-based methods for exploratory analysis, show techniques tailored to different data types, and provide a unifying view of the problem. We show how different data types require different techniques, and present algorithms that are specifically designed for relational, textual, and graph data.","author":["Davide Mottin","Matteo Lissandrini","Yannis Velegrakis","Themis Palpanas"],"issue":["SIGMOD '19: Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Management of Data","June 2019","Pages   2031\u20132035","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299869.3314031"],"date":"25 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"Bogdan Alexe, Balder Ten Cate, Phokion G Kolaitis, and Wang-Chiew Tan. 2011.

Approximate memory is a sub-branch of general approximate computing focusing on memory systems that trade off perfect data fidelity for increased storage density and reduced energy consumption for both memory and IO. This paper presents a new way to achieve approximate memory for natural sampled data (sound, sensor data, image and video frames) by applying the well known discrete cosine transformation (DCT) in one dimension between the last level cache and main memory to reduce memory traffic while maintaining acceptable quality degradations. By using state-of-the-art approximate DCT transformations, the proposed scheme achieves 20.3% of storage area at 37dB PSNR and SSIM = 0.99. If further quality degradation up to SSIM \u2248 0.9 is allowed, the storage saving can be up to 40%. The critical path of the circuit is comparable to state of the art approximate memory schemes, with only 3 levels of 8-bit adders (14 adders per 8-byte data block).","author":["Shenghou Ma","Paul Ampadu"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '19: Proceedings of the 2019 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2019","Pages   355\u2013358","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299874.3318036"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Wen-Hsiung Chen, C.

However, CNER is very challenging since Chinese entity names are highly context-dependent. In addition, Chinese texts lack delimiters to separate words, making it difficult to identify the boundary of entities. Besides, the training data for CNER in many domains is usually insufficient, and annotating enough training data for CNER is very expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a neural approach for CNER. First, we introduce a CNN-LSTM-CRF neural architecture to capture both local and long-distance contexts for CNER. Second, we propose a unified framework to jointly train CNER and word segmentation models in order to enhance the ability of CNER model in identifying entity boundaries. Third, we introduce an automatic method to generate pseudo labeled samples from existing labeled data which can enrich the training data. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our approach can effectively improve the performance of Chinese named entity recognition, especially when training data is insufficient.","author":["Fangzhao Wu","Junxin Liu","Chuhan Wu","Yongfeng Huang","Xing Xie"],"issue":["WWW '19: The World Wide Web Conference","May 2019","Pages   3342\u20133348","https://doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313743"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Aitao Chen, Fuchun Peng, Roy Shan, and Gordon Sun. 2006.

Therefore, multiple versions of the same knowledge graph exist, each of which represents a snapshot of the knowledge graph at some point in time. Entities within the knowledge graph undergo evolution as new facts are added or removed. The problem of automatically generating a summary out of different versions of a knowledge graph is a long-studied problem. However, most of the existing approaches are limited to a pairwise version comparison. This limitation makes it difficult to capture a complete evolution out of several versions of the same knowledge graph. To overcome this limitation, we envision an approach to create a summary graph capturing temporal evolution of entities across different versions of a knowledge graph. The entity summary graphs may then be used for documentation generation, profiling or visualization purposes. First, we take different temporal versions of a knowledge graph and convert them into RDF molecules. Secondly, we perform Formal Concept Analysis on these molecules to generate summary information. Finally, we apply a summary fusion policy in order to generate a compact summary graph which captures the evolution of entities.","author":["Mayesha Tasnim","Diego Collarana","Damien Graux","Fabrizio Orlandi","Maria-Esther Vidal"],"issue":["WWW '19: Companion Proceedings of The 2019 World Wide Web Conference","May 2019","Pages   961\u2013965","https://doi.org/10.1145/3308560.3316521"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Diego Collarana, Mikhail Galkin, Ignacio\u00a0Traverso Rib\u00f3n, Maria-Esther Vidal, Christoph Lange, and S\u00f6ren Auer. 2017.

In this paper, we propose ApproxLP, an Approximate Multiplier based on Linear Planes. We introduce an iterative method for approximating the product of two operands using fitted linear functions with two inputs, referred to as linear planes. The linearization of multiplication allows multiplication operations to be completely replaced with weighted addition. The proposed technique is used to find the significand of the product of two floating point numbers, decreasing the high energy cost of floating point arithmetic. Our method fully exploits the trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption by offering various degrees of approximation at different energy costs. As the level of approximation increases, the approximated product asymptotically approaches the exact product in an iterative manner. The performance of ApproxLP is evaluated over a range of multimedia and machine learning applications. A GPU enhanced by ApproxLP yields significant energy-delay product (EDP) improvement. For multimedia, neural network, and hyperdimensional computing applications, ApproxLP offers on average 2.4\u00d7, 2.7\u00d7, and 4.3\u00d7 EDP improvement respectively with sufficient computational quality for the application. ApproxLP also provides up to 4.5\u00d7 EDP improvement and has 2.3\u00d7 lower chip area than other state-of-the-art approximate multipliers.","author":["Mohsen Imani","Alice Sokolova","Ricardo Garcia","Andrew Huang","Fan Wu","Baris Aksanli","Tajana Rosing"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 159","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317774"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"M.

GAN combines a generative model and a discriminative model to oppose each other in an adversarial situation to refine their abilities. Existing nonvolatile memory based machine learning accelerators, however, could not support the computational needs required by GAN training. Specifically, the generator utilizes a new operator, called transposed convolution, which introduces significant resource underutilization when executed on conventional neural network accelerators as it inserts massive zeros in its input before a convolution operation. In this work, we propose a novel computational deformation technique that synergistically optimizes the forward and backward functions in transposed convolution to eliminate the large resource underutilization. In addition, we present dedicated control units - a dataflow mapper and an operation scheduler, to support the proposed execution model with high parallelism and low energy consumption. ZARA is implemented with commodity ReRAM chips, and experimental results show that our design can improve GAN's training performance by averagely 1.6\u00d7 ~23\u00d7 over CMOS-based GAN accelerators. Compared to state-of-the-art ReRAM-based accelerator designs, ZARA also provides 1.15 \u00d7 ~2.1\u00d7 performance improvement.","author":["Fan Chen","Linghao Song","Hai Helen Li","Yiran Chen"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 133","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317936"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"F.

ARIES offers important features like support for arbitrary workloads, fuzzy checkpoints, and transparent index recovery. Nevertheless, many modern in-memory database systems use more lightweight approaches that have less overhead and better multi-core scalability but only work well for the in-memory setting. Recently, a new class of high-performance storage engines has emerged, which exploit fast SSDs to achieve performance close to pure in-memory systems but also allow out-of-memory workloads. For these systems, ARIES is too slow whereas in-memory logging proposals are not applicable. In this work, we propose a new logging and recovery design that supports incremental and fuzzy checkpointing, index recovery, out-of-memory workloads, and low-latency transaction commits. Our continuous checkpointing algorithm guarantees bounded recovery time. Using per-thread logging with minimal synchronization, our implementation achieves near-linear scalability on multi-core CPUs. We implemented and evaluated these techniques in our LeanStore storage engine. For working sets that fit in main memory, we achieve performance close to that of an in-memory approach, even with logging, checkpointing, and dirty page writing enabled. For the out-of-memory scenario, we outperform a state-of-the-art ARIES implementation by a factor of two.","author":["Michael Haubenschild","Caetano Sauer","Thomas Neumann","Viktor Leis"],"issue":["SIGMOD '20: Proceedings of the 2020 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","June 2020","Pages   877\u2013892","https://doi.org/10.1145/3318464.3389716"],"date":"11 June 2020","ref":[{"text":"Divyakant Agrawal, Amr El Abbadi, Richard Jeffers, and Lijing Lin. 1995.

Compared to Infrastructure-as-a-Service or Platform-as-a-Service, this enables providers even more aggressive and rigorous resource sharing and liberates customers from tedious maintenance tasks. However, as a crucial factor of cloud adoption, FaaS clouds need to provide security and privacy guarantees in order to allow sensitive data processing. In this paper, we investigate securing FaaS clouds for sensitive data processing, while respecting their new features, capabilities and benefits in a technology-aware manner. We start with the proposal of a generic approach for a JavaScript-based secure FaaS platform, then get more specific and discuss the implementation of two distinct approaches based on (a) a lightweight and (b) a high performance JavaScript engine. Our prototype implementation shows promising performance while efficiently utilising resources, thereby keeping the penalties of the added security low.","author":["Stefan Brenner","R\u00fcdiger Kapitza"],"issue":["SYSTOR '19: Proceedings of the 12th ACM International Conference on Systems and Storage","May 2019","Pages   33\u201343","https://doi.org/10.1145/3319647.3325825"],"date":"22 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"2017.

To enable both programmability and flexibility in the heterogeneous computing era, we propose a novel complex network inspired model of computation and efficient optimization algorithms for determining the optimal degree of parallelization from old software code. This mathematical framework allows us to determine the required number and type of processing elements, the amount and type of deep memory hierarchy, and the degree of reconfiguration for the communication infrastructure, thus opening new avenues to performance and energy efficiency. Our framework enables heterogeneous manycore systems to autonomously adapt from traditional switching techniques to network coding strategies in order to sustain on-chip communication in the order of terabytes. While this new programming model enables the design of self-programmable autonomous heterogeneous manycore systems, a number of open challenges will be discussed.","author":["Paul Bogdan","Fan Chen","Aryan Deshwal","Janardhan Rao Doppa","Biresh Kumar Joardar","Hai (Helen) Li","Shahin Nazarian","Linghao Song","Yao Xiao"],"issue":["CODES/ISSS '19: Proceedings of the International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis Companion","October 2019","Article No.: 21","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3349567.3357376"],"date":"13 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"J.

Existing work in outlier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a degree of being an outlier. This degree is called the local outlier factor (LOF) of an object. It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers can be practical.","author":["Markus M.

However, with the wide adoption of the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, 'DNA Alignment', as the crucial step in computational genomics, is becoming more and more challenging due to the booming bio-data. Consequently, various hardware approaches have been explored to accelerate DNA seeding - the core and most time consuming step in DNA alignment. Most previous hardware approaches leverage multi-core, GPU, and FPGA to accelerate DNA seeding. However, DNA seeding is bounded by memory and above hardware approaches focus on computation. For this reason, Near Data Processing (NDP) is a better solution for DNA seeding. Unfortunately, existing NDP accelerators for DNA seeding face two grand challenges, i.e., fine-grained random memory access and scalability demand for booming bio-data. To address those challenges, we propose a practical, energy efficient, Dual-Inline Memory Module (DIMM) based, NDP Accelerator for DNA Seeding Algorithm (MEDAL), which is based on off-the-shelf DRAM components. For small databases that can be fitted within a single DRAM rank, we propose the intra-rank design, together with an algorithm-specific address mapping, bandwidth-aware data mapping, and Individual Chip Select (ICS) to address the challenge of fine-grained random memory access, improving parallelism and bandwidth utilization. Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of scalability for large databases, we propose three inter-rank designs (polling-based communication, interrupt-based communication, and Non-Volatile DIMM (NVDIMM)-based solution). In addition, we propose an algorithm-specific data compression technique to reduce memory footprint, introduce more space for the data mapping, and reduce the communication overhead. Experimental results show that for three proposed designs, on average, MEDAL can achieve 30.50x/8.37x/3.43x speedup and 289.91x/6.47x/2.89x energy reduction when compared with a 16-thread CPU baseline and two state-of-the-art NDP accelerators, respectively.","author":["Wenqin Huangfu","Xueqi Li","Shuangchen Li","Xing Hu","Peng Gu","Yuan Xie"],"issue":["MICRO '52: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","October 2019","Pages   587\u2013599","https://doi.org/10.1145/3352460.3358329"],"date":"12 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"2019. 28nm Technology Libraries. https://www.faraday-tech.com/cn/category/BrowseByTechnology?method=browserCategory&tech=28nm&master.ipSearchForm.technology=28nm.","order":1},{"text":"Nauman Ahmed, Koen Bertels, and Zaid Al-Ars. 2016.

Previous research has shown that FPGAs can outcompete software-based graph processing in shared memory contexts, but it remains an open question if this advantage can be maintained in distributed systems.In this work, we present GraVF-M, a framework designed to ease the implementation of FPGA-based graph processing accelerators for multi-FPGA platforms with distributed memory. Based on a lightweight description of the algorithm kernel, the framework automatically generates optimized RTL code for the whole multi-FPGA design. We exploit an aspect of the programming model to present a familiar message-passing paradigm to the user, while under the hood implementing a more efficient architecture that can reduce the necessary inter-FPGA network traffic by a factor equal to the average degree of the input graph. A performance model based on a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing performance serves to evaluate the efficiency of our implementation. With a throughput of up to 5.8GTEPS (billions of traversed edges per second) on a 4-FPGA system, the designs generated by GraVF-M compare favorably to state-of-the-art frameworks from the literature and reach 94% of the projected performance limit of the system.","author":["Nina Engelhardt","Hayden K.-H.

Hence, there is an emerging need for low-cost, high-quality self-test methodologies, which can be used by processors to test themselves at-speed. Currently, Built-In Self-Test (BIST) is the primary self-test methodology available and is widely used for testing embedded memory cores. In this paper, we report our experiences in applying a commercial BIST methodology to two processor cores and analyze the problems associated with the current hardware-based BIST methodologies. We propose a new software-based self-testing methodology for processors, which uses a software tester embedded in the processor memory as a vehicle for applying structural tests. The software tester consists of programs for test generation and test application. Prior to the test, structural tests are prepared for processor components in the form of self-test signatures. During the process of self-test, the test generation program expands the self-test signatures into test sets, and the test application program applies the tests to the components-under-test at the speed of the processor. Application of the novel software-based self-test method demonstrates its significant cost/fault coverage benefits and its ability to apply at-speed test while alleviating the need for high-speed testers.","author":["Li Chen","Sujit Dey","Pablo Sanchez","Krishna Sekar","Ying Cheng"],"issue":["DAC '00: Proceedings of the 37th Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2000","Pages   625\u2013630","https://doi.org/10.1145/337292.337599"],"date":"01 June 2000","ref":[{"text":"The National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, Semiconductor Industry Association, 1997.","order":1},{"text":"V.D.

There is nearly an order of magnitude difference in bandwidth between successive references to different columns within a row and different rows within a bank. This paper introduces memory access scheduling, a technique that improves the performance of a memory system by reordering memory references to exploit locality within the 3-D memory structure. Conservative reordering, in which the first ready reference in a sequence is performed, improves bandwidth by 40% for traces from five media benchmarks. Aggressive reordering, in which operations are scheduled to optimize memory bandwidth, improves bandwidth by 93% for the same set of applications. Memory access scheduling is particularly important for media processors where it enables the processor to make the most efficient use of scarce memory bandwidth.","author":["Scott Rixner","William J.

They have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy on many artificial intelligence tasks. For this high accuracy to occur, deep neural networks require the right parameter values. This is achieved by a process known as training. The training of large amounts of data via many iterations comes at a high cost in regard to computation time and energy. Optimal resource allocation would therefore reduce the training time. TensorFlow, a computational graph library developed by Google, alleviates the development of neural network models and provides the means to train these networks. In this article, we propose Adaptive HTF-MPR to carry out the resource allocation, or mapping, on TensorFlow. Adaptive HTF-MPR searches for the best mapping in a hybrid approach. We applied the proposed methodology on two well-known image classifiers: VGG-16 and AlexNet. We also performed a full analysis of the solution space of MNIST Softmax. Our results demonstrate that Adaptive HTF-MPR outperforms the default homogeneous TensorFlow mapping. In addition to the speed up, Adaptive HTF-MPR can react to changes in the state of the system and adjust to an improved mapping.","author":["Ahmad Albaqsami","Maryam S.

GPU- and FPGA-based clouds have already been deployed to accelerate compute-intensive workloads. ASIC-based clouds are a natural evolution as cloud services expand across the planet. ASIC Clouds are purpose-built datacenters comprised of large arrays of ASIC accelerators that optimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) of large, high-volume scale-out computations. On the surface, ASIC Clouds may seem improbable due to high NREs and ASIC inflexibility, but large-scale ASIC Clouds have already been deployed for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency system. This paper distills lessons from these Bitcoin ASIC Clouds and applies them to other large scale workloads such as YouTube-style video-transcoding and Deep Learning, showing superior TCO versus CPU and GPU. It derives Pareto-optimal ASIC Cloud servers based on accelerator properties, by jointly optimizing ASIC architecture, DRAM, motherboard, power delivery, cooling, and operating voltage. Finally, the authors examine the impact of ASIC NRE and when it makes sense to build an ASIC Cloud.","author":["Michael Bedford Taylor","Luis Vega","Moein Khazraee","Ikuo Magaki","Scott Davidson","Dustin Richmond"],"issue":["Communications of the ACM","Volume 63","Issue 7","July 2020","pp   103\u2013109","https://doi.org/10.1145/3399734"],"date":"18 June 2020","ref":[{"text":"ASIC clouds: Specializing the datacenter.","order":1},{"text":"Esmaeilzadeh, H., Blem, E., Amant, R.S., Sankaralingam, K., Burger, D.

This makes them preferable for approximate computing as they have the ability to tolerate computations and data errors along with producing acceptable outputs. From the technology perspective, emerging technologies with inherent non-determinism and high failure rates are candidates for the realization of approximate computing. Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memories (STT-MRAM) is an emerging non-volatile memory technology and a potential candidate to replace SRAM due to its high density, scalability, and zero-leakage. The write operation in this technology is inherently stochastic and increases the rate of write errors. Moreover, this technology is associated with other failure mechanisms such as read-disturb and failures due to data retention. These errors are highly dependent on the STT-MRAM parameters (i.e., thermal stability, read/write current, and read/write latency), which varies with the operating temperature and the process variation effects. Fast and energy-efficient STT-MRAM designed for on-chip memories can be easily achieved by relaxing the device parameters at the cost of increased error rate, which can be addressed by approximating memory accesses. In this work, a detailed study of reliability and gains (i.e., performance and energy) tradeoff at the device and system-level of the STT-MRAM-based data cache system is presented in the scope of approximate memories.","author":["Nour Sayed","Rajendra Bishnoi","Mehdi B.

This added functionality comes primarily with the addition of short SIMD instructions.  Unfortunately, access to these instructions is limited to in-line assembly and library calls. Generally, it has been assumed that vector compilers provide the most promising means of exploiting multimedia instructions. Although vectorization technology is well understood, it is inherently complex and fragile. In addition, it is incapable of locating SIMD-style parallelism within a basic block.In this paper we introduce the concept of Superword Level Parallelism (SLP) ,a novel way of viewing parallelism in multimedia and scientific applications. We believe SLPP is  fundamentally different from the loop level parallelism exploited by traditional vector processing, and therefore demands a new method of extracting it.  We have developed a simple and robust compiler for detecting SLPP that targets basic blocks rather than loop nests.  As with techniques designed to extract ILP, ours is able to exploit parallelism both across loop iterations and within basic blocks. The result is an algorithm that provides excellent performance in several application domains. In our experiments, dynamic instruction counts were reduced by 46%. Speedups ranged from 1.24 to 6.70.","author":["Samuel Larsen","Saman Amarasinghe"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 35","Issue 5","May 2000","pp   145\u2013156","https://doi.org/10.1145/358438.349320"],"date":"01 May 2000","ref":[{"text":"E.

The standard technique for storing such tables is hashing, but hashing has poor worst-case performance. We propose a good worst-case method for storing a static table of n entries, each an integer between 0 and N - 1. The method requires O(n) words of storage and allows O(logn N) access time. Although our method is a little complicated to use in practice, our analysis shows why a simpler algorithm used for compressing LR parsing tables works so well.","author":["Robert Endre Tarjan","Andrew Chi-Chih Yao"],"issue":["Communications of the ACM","Volume 22","Issue 11","Nov. 1979","pp   606\u2013611","https://doi.org/10.1145/359168.359175"],"date":"01 November 1979","ref":[{"text":"Alto, A.V., Hopcroft, J.E., and Ullman, J.D.

The packet transport mechanism provided by Ethernet has been used to build systems which can be viewed as either local computer networks or loosely coupled multiprocessors. An Ethernet's shared communication facility, its Ether, is a passive broadcast medium with no central control. Coordination of access to the Ether for packet broadcasts is distributed among the contending transmitting stations using controlled statistical arbitration. Switching of packets to their destinations on the Ether is distributed among the receiving stations using packet address recognition. Design principles and implementation are described based on experience with an operating Ethernet of 100 nodes along a kilometer of coaxial cable. A model for estimating performance under heavy loads and a packet protocol for error controlled communication are included for completeness.","author":["Robert M. Metcalfe","David R.

These engines return, as the query's result, a list of Web pages whose contents matches the query. For broad-topic queries, such searches often result in a huge set of retrieved documents, many of which are irrelevant to the user. However, much information is contained in the link-structure of the WWW. Information such as which pages are linked to others can be used to augment search algorithms. In this context, Jon Kleinberg introduced the notion of two distinct types of Web pages: hubs and authorities. Kleinberg argued that hubs and authorities exhibit a mutually reinforcing relationship: a good hub will point to many  authorities, and a good authority will be pointed at by many hubs. In light of this, he dervised an algoirthm aimed at finding authoritative pages. We present SALSA, a new stochastic approach for link-structure analysis, which examines random walks on graphs derived from the link-structure. We show that both SALSA and Kleinberg's Mutual Reinforcement approach employ the same metaalgorithm.  We then prove that SALSA is quivalent to a weighted in degree analysis of the link-sturcutre of WWW subgraphs, making it computationally more efficient than the Mutual reinforcement approach. We compare that results of applying SALSA to the results derived through Kleinberg's approach. These comparisions reveal a topological Phenomenon called the TKC effectwhich, in certain cases,  prevents the Mutual reinforcement approach from identifying meaningful authorities.","author":["R.

It has long been recognized that the primary obstacle to effective performance of classical models is the need to estimate arelevance model: probabilities of words in the relevant class. We propose a novel technique for estimating these probabilities using the query alone. We demonstrate that our technique can produce highly accurate relevance models, addressing important notions of synonymy and polysemy. Our experiments show relevance models outperforming baseline language modeling systems on TREC retrieval and TDT tracking tasks. The main contribution of this work is an effective formal method for estimating a relevance model with no training data.","author":["Victor Lavrenko","W.

In this paper, we look at quantifying the optimal scalability, in terms of network load, (in messages per second, with messages having a size limit) of distributed, complete failure detectors as a function of application-specified requirements. These requirements are 1) quick failure detection by some non-faulty process, and 2) accuracy of failure detection. We assume a crash-recovery (non-Byzantine) failure model, and a network model that is probabilistically unreliable (w.r.t. message deliveries and process failures). First, we characterize, under certain independence assumptions, the optimum worst-case network load imposed by any failure detector that achieves an application's requirements. We then discuss why traditional heart beating schemes are inherently unscalable according to the optimal load. We also present a randomized, distributed, failure detector algorithm that imposes an equal expected load per group member. This protocol satisfies the application defined constraints of completeness and accuracy, and speed of detection on an average. It imposes a network load that differs frown the optimal by a sub-optimality factor that is much lower than that for traditional distributed heartbeating schemes. Moreover, this sub-optimality factor does not vary with group size (for large groups).","author":["Indranil Gupta","Tushar D. Chandra","Germ\u00e1n S.

We describe new simple hardware features for a VLIW machine we call DAISY (Dynamically Architected Instruction Set from Yorktown). DAISY is specifically intended to emulate existing architectures, so that all existing software for an old architecture (including operating system kernel code) runs without changes on the VLIW. Each time a new fragment of code is executed for the first time, the code is translated to VLIW primitives, parallelized and saved in a portion of main memory not visible to the old architecture, by a Virtual Machine Monitor (software) residing in read only memory. Subsequent executions of the same fragment do not require a translation (unless cast out). We discuss the architectural requirements for such a VLIW, to deal with issues including self-modifying code, precise exceptions, and aggressive reordering of memory references in the presence of strong MP consistency and memory mapped I/O. We have implemented the dynamic parallelization algorithms for the PowerPC architecture. The initial results show high degrees of instruction level parallelism with reasonable translation overhead and memory usage.","author":["Kemal Ebcio\u011flu","Erik R.

In this paper we address the recovery problem in the context of such a system. We argue that existing database recovery schemes fall short of meeting the requirements of such a system, and we present a new recovery mechanism which is designed to overcome their shortcomings. The proposed mechanism takes advantage of a few megabytes of reliable memory in order to organize recovery information on a per \u201cobject\u201d basis. As a result, it is able to amortize the cost of checkpoints over a controllable number of updates, and it is also able to separate post-crash recovery into two phases\u2014high-speed recovery of data which is needed immediately by transactions, and background recovery of the remaining portions of the database. A simple performance analysis is undertaken, and the results suggest our mechanism should perform well in a high-performance, memory-resident database environment.","author":["Tobin J.

The bounds hold both in the worst case and in the average case, and in several situations the constant factors match. Secondary storage is modeled as a magnetic disk capable of transferring P blocks each containing B records in a single time unit; the records in each block must be input from or output to B contiguous locations on the disk. We give two optimal algorithms for the problems, which are variants of merge sorting and distribution sorting. In particular we show for P = 1 that the standard merge sorting algorithm is an optimal external sorting method, up to a constant factor in the number of I/Os. Our sorting algorithms use the same number of I/Os as does the permutation phase of key sorting, except when the internal memory size is extremely small, thus affirming the popular adage that key sorting is not faster. We also give a simpler and more direct derivation of Hong and Kung's lower bound for the FFT for the special case B = P = O(1).","author":["Alok Aggarwal","Jeffrey,S.

The development and maintenance of libraries for these architectures is simply too complex to be amenable to conventional approaches to implementation. Attempts to employ traditional methodology have led, in our opinion, to the production of an abundance of anfractuous code that is difficult to maintain and almost impossible to upgrade.Having struggled with these issues for more than a decade, we have concluded that a solution is to apply a technique from theoretical computer science, formal derivation, to the development of high-performance linear algebra libraries. We think the resulting approach results in aesthetically pleasing, coherent code that greatly facilitates intelligent modularity and high performance while enhancing confidence in its correctness. Since the technique is language-independent, it lends itself equally well to a wide spectrum of programming languages (and paradigms) ranging from C and Fortran to C++ and Java. In this paper, we illustrate our observations by looking at the Formal Linear Algebra Methods Environment (FLAME), a framework that facilitates the derivation and implementation of linear algebra algorithms on sequential architectures. This environment demonstrates that lessons learned in the distributed-memory world can guide us toward better approaches even in the sequential world.We present performance experiments on the Intel (R) Pentium (R) III processor that demonstrate that high performance can be attained by coding at a high level of abstraction.","author":["John A.

Although large caches can significantly improve performance, they have the potential to increase power consumption. As feature sizes shrink, the dominant component of this power loss will be leakage. However, during a fixed period of time the activity in a cache is only centered on a small subset of the lines. This behavior can be exploited to cut the leakage power of large caches by putting the cold cache lines into a state preserving, low-power drowsy mode. Moving lines into and out of drowsy state incurs a slight performance loss. In this paper we investigate policies and circuit techniques for implementing drowsy caches. We show that with simple architectural techniques, about 80%-90% of the cache lines can be maintained in a drowsy state without affecting performance by more than 1%. According to our projections, in a 0.07um CMOS process, drowsy caches will be able to reduce the total energy (static and dynamic) consumed in the caches by 50%-75%. We also argue that the use of drowsy caches can simplify the design and control of low-leakage caches, and avoid the need to completely turn off selected cache lines and lose their state.","author":["Kriszti\u00e1n Flautner","Nam Sung Kim","Steve Martin","David Blaauw","Trevor Mudge"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 30","Issue 2","May 2002","pp   148\u2013157","https://doi.org/10.1145/545214.545232"],"date":"01 May 2002","ref":[{"text":"M.

A strict time hierarchy of explicit Boolean functions of n bits on such machines that holds up to \u039f(log n/log log n) time is also exhibited. That is, for every time bound T within this range a function is exhibited that can be easily computed using polynomial resources in time T but requires more than polynomial resources to be computed in time T - 1. Finally, it is shown that almost all Boolean functions of n bits require log n - log log n + \u03a9(1) time when the number of processors is at most polynomial in n. The bounds do not place restrictions on the uniformity of the algorithms nor on the instruction sets of the machines.","author":["Paul Beame","Johan Hastad"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 36","Issue 3","July 1989","pp   643\u2013670","https://doi.org/10.1145/65950.65958"],"date":"01 July 1989","ref":[{"text":"AJTAI, M. ~ }-Formulae on finite structures.

This vision is characterized by two major paradigm changes. The first is that SoC design will become divided into four mostly non-overlapping distinct abstraction levels. Very different competences and design automation tools will be needed at each level.The second paradigm change is the emergence of domain-specific S/W programmable SoC platforms consisting of large, heterogeneous sets of embedded processors. These will be complemented by embedded reconfigurable hardware and networks-on-chip. A key enabler for the effective us of these flexible SoC platforms, is a high-level parallel programming model supporting automatic specification-to-platform mapping.","author":["Philippe Magarshack","Pierre G.

We present a programming language and a supporting system that are designed for programming these stream processors. The language follows the philosophy of C, in that it is a hardware-oriented, general-purpose language, rather than an application-specific shading language. The language includes a variety of facilities designed to support the key architectural features of programmable graphics processors, and is designed to support multiple generations of graphics architectures with different levels of functionality. The system supports both of the major 3D graphics APIs: OpenGL and Direct3D. This paper identifies many of the choices that we faced as we designed the system, and explains why we made the decisions that we did.","author":["William R. Mark","R.

Our ultimate goal is to track changes over time in such communities. For such temporal tracking, we require a clustering algorithm that is relatively stable under small perturbations of the input data. We have developed an efficient, scalable agglomerative strategy and applied it to the citation graph of the NEC CiteSeer database (250,000 papers; 4.5 million citations). Agglomerative clustering techniques are known to be unstable on data in which the community structure is not strong. We find that some communities are essentially random and thus unstable while others are natural and will appear in most clusterings. These natural communities will enable us to track the evolution of communities over time.","author":["John Hopcroft","Omar Khan","Brian Kulis","Bart Selman"],"issue":["KDD '03: Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2003","Pages   541\u2013546","https://doi.org/10.1145/956750.956816"],"date":"24 August 2003","ref":[{"text":"W.

Although literature abounds with various flavors of sorting algorithms, different architectures call for customized implementations to achieve faster sorting times.This paper presents an efficient implementation and detailed analysis of MergeSort on current CPU architectures. Our SIMD implementation with 128-bit SSE is 3.3X faster than the scalar version. In addition, our algorithm performs an efficient multiway merge, and is not constrained by the memory bandwidth. Our multi-threaded, SIMD implementation sorts 64 million floating point numbers in less than0.5 seconds on a commodity 4-core Intel processor. This measured performance compares favorably with all previously published results.Additionally, the paper demonstrates performance scalability of the proposed sorting algorithm with respect to certain salient architectural features of modern chip multiprocessor (CMP) architectures, including SIMD width and core-count. Based on our analytical models of various architectural configurations, we see excellent scalability of our implementation with SIMD width scaling up to 16X wider than current SSE width of 128-bits, and CMP core-count scaling well beyond 32 cores. Cycle-accurate simulation of Intel's upcoming x86 many-core Larrabee architecture confirms scalability of our proposed algorithm.","author":["Jatin Chhugani","Anthony D. Nguyen","Victor W.

Unfortunately, methods and tools for the computation of accurate early results are currently not supported in MapReduce-oriented systems although these are intended for 'big data'. Therefore, we proposed and implemented a non-parametric extension of Hadoop which allows the incremental computation of early results for arbitrary work-flows, along with reliable on-line estimates of the degree of accuracy achieved so far in the computation. These estimates are based on a technique called bootstrapping that has been widely employed in statistics and can be applied to arbitrary functions and data distributions. In this paper, we describe our Early Accurate Result Library (EARL) for Hadoop that was designed to minimize the changes required to the MapReduce framework. Various tests of EARL of Hadoop are presented to characterize the frequent situations where EARL can provide major speed-ups over the current version of Hadoop.","author":["Nikolay Laptev","Kai Zeng","Carlo Zaniolo"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 5","Issue 10","June 2012","pp   1028\u20131039","https://doi.org/10.14778/2336664.2336675"],"date":"01 June 2012","ref":[{"text":"Earl release website: http://yellowstone.cs.ucla.edu/wis/.","order":1},{"text":"Hadoop: Open-source implementation of mapreduce: http://hadoop.apache.org.","order":2},{"text":"V.

Adding SSDs to a storage system not only raises the question of how to manage the SSDs, but also raises the question of whether current buffer pool algorithms will still work effectively. We are interested in the use of hybrid storage systems, consisting of SSDs and hard disk drives (HDDs), for database management. We present cost-aware replacement algorithms, which are aware of the difference in performance between SSDs and HDDs, for both the DBMS buffer pool and the SSDs. In hybrid storage systems, the physical access pattern to the SSDs depends on the management of the DBMS buffer pool. We studied the impact of buffer pool caching policies on SSD access patterns. Based on these studies, we designed a cost-adjusted caching policy to effectively manage the SSD. We implemented these algorithms in MySQL's InnoDB storage engine and used the TPC-C workload to demonstrate that these cost-aware algorithms outperform previous algorithms.","author":["Xin Liu","Kenneth Salem"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 8","June 2013","pp   541\u2013552","https://doi.org/10.14778/2536354.2536355"],"date":"01 June 2013","ref":[{"text":"M.

At the same time, the rise of social media motivates recent uptake in large scale graph processing. Both categories of algorithms are dominated by iterative subtasks, i.e., processing steps which are executed repetitively until a convergence condition is met. Optimizing cluster resource allocations among multiple workloads of iterative algorithms motivates the need for estimating their runtime, which in turn requires: i) predicting the number of iterations, and ii) predicting the processing time of each iteration. As both parameters depend on the characteristics of the dataset and on the convergence function, estimating their values before execution is difficult.This paper proposes PREDIcT, an experimental methodology for predicting the runtime of iterative algorithms. PREDIcT uses sample runs for capturing the algorithm's convergence trend and per-iteration key input features that are well correlated with the actual processing requirements of the complete input dataset. Using this combination of characteristics we predict the runtime of iterative algorithms, including algorithms with very different runtime patterns among subsequent iterations. Our experimental evaluation of multiple algorithms on scale-free graphs shows a relative prediction error of 10%-30% for predicting runtime, including algorithms with up to 100\u00d7 runtime variability among consecutive iterations.","author":["Adrian Daniel Popescu","Andrey Balmin","Vuk Ercegovac","Anastasia Ailamaki"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 14","September 2013","pp   1678\u20131689","https://doi.org/10.14778/2556549.2556553"],"date":"01 September 2013","ref":[{"text":"F.

The declarative specification of ML algorithms enables---in contrast to existing large-scale machine learning libraries---automatic optimization. SystemML's primary focus is on data parallelism but many ML algorithms inherently exhibit opportunities for task parallelism as well. A major challenge is how to efficiently combine both types of parallelism for arbitrary ML scripts and workloads. In this paper, we present a systematic approach for combining task and data parallelism for large-scale machine learning on top of MapReduce. We employ a generic Parallel FOR construct (ParFOR) as known from high performance computing (HPC). Our core contributions are (1) complementary parallelization strategies for exploiting multi-core and cluster parallelism, as well as (2) a novel cost-based optimization framework for automatically creating optimal parallel execution plans. Experiments on a variety of use cases showed that this achieves both efficiency and scalability due to automatic adaptation to ad-hoc workloads and unknown data characteristics.","author":["Matthias Boehm","Shirish Tatikonda","Berthold Reinwald","Prithviraj Sen","Yuanyuan Tian","Douglas R.

Still, there are limited efforts towards extending RDF stores to efficiently support spatial queries, such as range selections (e.g., find entities within a given range) and spatial joins (e.g., find pairs of entities whose locations are close to each other). In this paper, we propose an extension for RDF stores that supports efficient spatial data management. Our contributions include an effective encoding scheme for entities having spatial locations, the introduction of on-the-fly spatial filters and spatial join algorithms, and several optimizations that minimize the overhead of geometry and dictionary accesses. We implemented the proposed techniques as an extension to the opensource RDF-3X engine and we experimentally evaluated them using real RDF knowledge bases. The results show that our system offers robust performance for spatial queries, while introducing little overhead to the original query engine.","author":["John Liagouris","Nikos Mamoulis","Panagiotis Bouros","Manolis Terrovitis"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 12","August 2014","pp   1271\u20131282","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732977.2733000"],"date":"01 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"Linkedgeodata. http://linkedgeodata.org/About.","order":1},{"text":"Owlim-se. http://owlim.ontotext.com/display/OWLIMv43/OWLIM-SE.","order":2},{"text":"Parliament. http://parliament.semwebcentral.org.","order":3},{"text":"Virtuoso. http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com.","order":4},{"text":"D.

This has resulted in a wealth of data about the movements of individuals and populations, which can be analyzed for useful information to aid in city and traffic planning, disaster preparedness and so on. However, the places that people go can disclose extremely sensitive information about them, and thus their use needs to be filtered through privacy preserving mechanisms. This turns out to be a highly challenging task: raw trajectories are highly detailed, and typically no pair is alike. Previous attempts fail either to provide adequate privacy protection, or to remain sufficiently faithful to the original behavior.This paper presents DPT, a system to synthesize mobility data based on raw GPS trajectories of individuals while ensuring strong privacy protection in the form of \u03b5-differential privacy. DPT makes a number of novel modeling and algorithmic contributions including (i) discretization of raw trajectories using hierarchical reference systems (at multiple resolutions) to capture individual movements at differing speeds, (ii) adaptive mechanisms to select a small set of reference systems and construct prefix tree counts privately, and (iii) use of direction-weighted sampling for improved utility. While there have been prior attempts to solve the subproblems required to generate synthetic trajectories, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first system that provides an end-to-end solution. We show the efficacy of our synthetic trajectory generation system using an extensive empirical evaluation.","author":["Xi He","Graham Cormode","Ashwin Machanavajjhala","Cecilia M.

This task is challenging as in today's knowledge-, service-, and cloud-based economy, businesses accumulate massive amounts of raw data from a variety of sources. Data Lakes introduced as a storage repository to organize this raw data in its native format (supporting from relational to NoSQL DBs) until it is needed. The rationale behind a Data Lake is to store raw data and let the data analyst decide how to cook/curate them later. In this paper, we present the notion of Knowledge Lake, i.e. a contextualized Data Lake. The Knowledge Lake will provide the foundation for big data analytics by automatically curating the raw data in the Data Lake and to prepare them for deriving insights. We present CoreKG-an open source Data and Knowledge Lake service- which offers researchers and developers a single REST API to organize, curate, index and query their data and metadata in the Lake and over time. CoreKG manages multiple database technologies (from Relational to NoSQL) and offers a built-in design for data curation, security and provenance.","author":["Amin Beheshti","Boualem Benatallah","Reza Nouri","Alireza Tabebordbar"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 12","August 2018","pp   1942\u20131945","https://doi.org/10.14778/3229863.3236230"],"date":"01 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"S.

The past decade has seen a flurry of research and commercial activities around the WebTables project itself, as well as the broad topic of informal online structured data. In this paper, we1 will review the WebTables project, and try to place it in the broader context of the decade of work that followed. We will also show how the progress over the past ten years sets up an exciting agenda for the future, and will draw upon many corners of the data management community.","author":["Michael Cafarella","Alon Halevy","Hongrae Lee","Jayant Madhavan","Cong Yu","Daisy Zhe Wang","Eugene Wu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 12","August 2018","pp   2140\u20132149","https://doi.org/10.14778/3229863.3240492"],"date":"01 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"Common crawl. http://commoncrawl.org/.","order":1},{"text":"S.

Addressing this challenge brings up questions familiar from classical distributed systems: how to combine multiple steps into a single atomic action, how to recover from failures, and how to synchronize concurrent access to data. Nevertheless, each of these issues requires rethinking when participants are autonomous and potentially adversarial.We propose the notion of a cross-chain deal, a new way to structure complex distributed computations that manage assets in an adversarial setting. Deals are inspired by classical atomic transactions, but are necessarily different, in important ways, to accommodate the decentralized and untrusting nature of the exchange. We describe novel safety and liveness properties, along with two alternative protocols for implementing cross-chain deals in a system of independent blockchain ledgers. One protocol, based on synchronous communication, is fully decentralized, while the other, based on semi-synchronous communication, requires a globally shared ledger.","author":["Maurice Herlihy","Barbara Liskov","Liuba Shrira"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 13","Issue 2","October 2019","pp   100\u2013113","https://doi.org/10.14778/3364324.3364326"],"date":"01 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"I.

The classification of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs. A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., \"subtle nuances\") and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., \"very cavalier\"). In this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word \"excellent\" minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word \"poor\". A review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive. The algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74% when evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions, sampled from four different domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations). The accuracy ranges from 84% for automobile reviews to 66% for movie reviews.","author":["Peter D.

Indeed, its performance of 86.36% (LP/LR F1) is better than that of early lexicalized PCFG models, and surprisingly close to the current state-of-the-art. This result has potential uses beyond establishing a strong lower bound on the maximum possible accuracy of unlexicalized models: an unlexicalized PCFG is much more compact, easier to replicate, and easier to interpret than more complex lexical models, and the parsing algorithms are simpler, more widely understood, of lower asymptotic complexity, and easier to optimize.","author":["Dan Klein","Christopher D.

There have been many attempts to solve this problem; however, these techniques are often computationally burdensome, especially for real-time implementation. Recently, Hermansy et al. [1] and Hirsch et al. [2] have suggested a simple technique that removes slow-moving linear channel variation with little adverse effect on speech recognition performance. In this paper we examine this technique, known as RASTA filtering, and evaluate its performance when applied to SRI's DECIPHER\u2122 speech recognition system [3]. We show that RASTA filtering succeeds in reducing DECIPHER\u2122's dependence on the channel.","author":["Hy Murveit","John Butzberger","Mitch Weintraub"],"issue":["HLT '91: Proceedings of the workshop on Speech and Natural Language","February 1992","Pages   280\u2013284","https://doi.org/10.3115/1075527.1075593"],"date":"23 February 1992","ref":[{"text":"H.

The problem with using the predominant, or first sense heuristic, aside from the fact that it does not take surrounding context into account, is that it assumes some quantity of hand-tagged data. Whilst there are a few hand-tagged corpora available for some languages, one would expect the frequency distribution of the senses of words, particularly topical words, to depend on the genre and domain of the text under consideration. We present work on the use of a thesaurus acquired from raw textual corpora and the WordNet similarity package to find predominant noun senses automatically. The acquired predominant senses give a precision of 64% on the nouns of the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words task. This is a very promising result given that our method does not require any hand-tagged text, such as SemCor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method discovers appropriate predominant senses for words from two domain-specific corpora.","author":["Diana McCarthy","Rob Koeling","Julie Weeds","John Carroll"],"issue":["ACL '04: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics","July 2004","Pages   279\u2013es","https://doi.org/10.3115/1218955.1218991"],"date":"21 July 2004","ref":[{"text":"Satanjeev Banerjee and Ted Pedersen. 2002.

However, these tasks have mostly involved very small label sets. When deployed on tasks with larger label sets, the requirements for computational resources mean that training becomes intractable.This paper describes a method for training CRFs on such tasks, using error correcting output codes (ECOC). A number of CRFs are independently trained on the separate binary labelling tasks of distinguishing between a subset of the labels and its complement. During decoding, these models are combined to produce a predicted label sequence which is resilient to errors by individual models.Error-correcting CRF training is much less resource intensive and has a much faster training time than a standardly formulated CRF, while decoding performance remains quite comparable. This allows us to scale CRFs to previously impossible tasks, as demonstrated by our experiments with large label sets.","author":["Trevor Cohn","Andrew Smith","Miles Osborne"],"issue":["ACL '05: Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics","June 2005","Pages   10\u201317","https://doi.org/10.3115/1219840.1219842"],"date":"25 June 2005","ref":[{"text":"Adam Berger. 1999.

This algorithm plays a key role in post-processing the output of a character or speech recognizer in determining the proper word sequence corresponding to an input line of character images or a speech waveform. To support this algorithm, a text corpus of over 63 millions characters is employed to enrich an 80,000-words lexicon in terms of its word entries and word binding forces. As it stands now, given an input line of text, the word segmentor can process on the average 210,000 characters per second when running on an IBM RISC System/6000 3BT workstation with a correct word identification rate of 99.74%.","author":["Pak-kwong Wong","Chorkin Chan"],"issue":["COLING '96: Proceedings of the 16th conference on Computational linguistics - Volume 1","August 1996","Pages   200\u2013203","https://doi.org/10.3115/992628.992665"],"date":"05 August 1996","ref":[{"text":"Jay L.

We found that the proposed subword-based tagging outperformed the character-based tagging in all comparative experiments. In addition, we proposed a confidence measure approach to combine the results of a dictionary-based and a subword-tagging-based segmentation. This approach can produce an ideal tradeoff between the in-vocaulary rate and out-of-vocabulary rate. Our techniques were evaluated using the test data from Sighan Bakeoff 2005.

We previously proposed an iterative training selection algorithm [1], which sought to improve speech recognition by automatically selecting a subset of the available humanly transcribed training data, thereby improving error rates without incurring additional transcription cost. We suggest one improvement to that \"selective sampling\" algorithm and show that we are able to reduce the error rate on a particular alphadigit recognition problem from 10.3% to 9.5%. We then extend the iterative training selection algorithm to work with untranscribed speech, guiding selection of speech that is then transcribed. We show, on a particular alphadigit recognition problem, that it is possible to match the baseline error rate while only incurring 25% of the transcription cost.","author":["Teresa M.

In this context, ageing societies would benefit from the design of intelligent homes that provide assistance. The choice of interfaces between the assistive environment and the user is of great importance and determines the degree of user acceptance of this technology. Socially assistive robots are one of the most promising interfaces. Their embodiment and multimodal communication channels could potentially provide a large number of services that otherwise would have to be carried out by a variety of dedicated systems. Furthermore, evidence suggests that people perceive robots more as companions and social actors than tools and this is likely to steer user acceptance positively. This paper presents the authors' work related to the EU-FP7 project KSERA, a project that aims at introducing a socially assistive robot that acts as a proactive communication interface in smart home environments. In particular, it gives an overview of (1) human--robot interaction studies conducted in Eindhoven (The Netherlands) whose general aim was to preliminary assess the added value of socially assistive robots in intelligent homes and (2) the KSERA project field trials in Schwechat (Vienna) and Tel Aviv (Israel) that tested an integrated smart-home/robot system with real end users (N=16) in three real-world scenarios. Overall, results show that socially assistive robots positively affect user experience and motivation compared to standard smart environment interfaces such as touch screens. However, people still tend to prefer conventional interfaces for receiving information.","author":["Elena Torta","Johannes Oberzaucher","Franz Werner","Raymond H. Cuijpers","James F.

While a growing body of work is focused on human-robot communication and human perceptions thereof, there is currently little work on human perceptions of robot-robot communication. Understanding how robots should communicate information to each other in the presence of human teammates is an important open question for human-robot teaming. In this paper, we present two human-robot interaction (HRI) experiments investigating the human perception of verbal and silent robot-robot communication as part of a human-robot team task. The results suggest that silent communication of task-dependent, human-understandable information among robots is perceived as creepy by cooperative, co-located human teammates. Hence, we propose that, absent specific evidence to the contrary, robots in cooperative human-robot team settings need to be sensitive to human expectations about overt communication, and we encourage future work to investigate possible ways to modulate such expectations.","author":["Tom Williams","Priscilla Briggs","Matthias Scheutz"],"issue":["Journal of Human-Robot Interaction","Volume 4","Issue 2","September 2015","pp   24\u201349","https://doi.org/10.5898/JHRI.4.2.Williams"],"date":"01 September 2015","ref":[{"text":"Balch, T., & Arkin, R.
