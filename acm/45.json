When faced with massive quantities of data, traditional duplicate detection techniques relying on direct inter-document similarity computation (e.g., using the cosine measure) are often not feasible given the time and memory performance constraints. On the other hand, fingerprint-based methods, such as I-Match, are very attractive computationally but may be brittle with respect to small changes to document content. We focus on approaches to near-replica detection that are based upon large-collection statistics and present a general technique of increasing their robustness via multiple lexicon randomization. In experiments with large web-page and spam-email datasets the proposed method is shown to consistently outperform traditional I-Match, with the relative improvement in duplicate-document recall reaching as high as 40-60%. The large gains in detection accuracy are offset by only small increases in computational requirements.","author":["Aleksander Ko\u0142cz","Abdur Chowdhury","Joshua Alspector"],"issue":["KDD '04: Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2004","Pages   605\u2013610","https://doi.org/10.1145/1014052.1014127"],"date":"22 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"P.

Directly handling free-form surfaces such as spline or subdivision surfaces instead of first tesselating them offers many advantages such as higher precision results, reduced memory requirements, and faster preprocessing due to less primitives. However, existing algorithms for ray tracing free-form surfaces are much too slow for interactive use. In this paper we present a simple and generic approach for ray tracing free-form surfaces together with specific implementations for cubic B\u00e9zier and Loop subdivision surfaces. We show that our approach allows to increase the performance by more than an order of magnitude, requires only constant memory, and is largely independent on the total number of free-form primitives in a scene. Examples demonstrate that even scene with over one hundred thousand free-form surfaces can be rendered interactively on a single processor at video resolution.","author":["Carsten Benthin","Ingo Wald","Philipp Slusallek"],"issue":["AFRIGRAPH '04: Proceedings of the 3rd international conference on Computer graphics, virtual reality, visualisation and interaction in Africa","November 2004","Pages   99\u2013106","https://doi.org/10.1145/1029949.1029968"],"date":"03 November 2004","ref":[{"text":"S.

The patterns and causes of loss are important in the design of routing and error-correction protocols, as well as in network planning.The paper makes the following observations. The distribution of inter-node loss rates is relatively uniform over the whole range of loss rates; there is no clear threshold separating \"in range\" and \"out of range.\" Most links have relatively stable loss rates from one second to the next, though a small minority have very bursty losses at that time scale. Signal-to-noise ratio and distance have little predictive value for loss rate. The large number of links with intermediate loss rates is probably due to multi-path fading rather than attenuation or interference.The phenomena discussed here are all well-known. The contributions of this paper are an understanding of their relative importance, of how they interact, and of the implications for MAC and routing protocol design.","author":["Daniel Aguayo","John Bicket","Sanjit Biswas","Glenn Judd","Robert Morris"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 34","Issue 4","October 2004","pp   121\u2013132","https://doi.org/10.1145/1030194.1015482"],"date":"30 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"ISL3873: Wireless LAN Integrated Medium Access Controller with Baseband Processor Inersil Corporation, 2000.

Standard machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machines and related large margin methods have been successfully applied for this task, albeit the fact that they ignore the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical classification method that generalizes Support Vector Machine learning and that is based on discriminant functions that are structured in a way that mirrors the class hierarchy. Our method can work with arbitrary, not necessarily singly connected taxonomies and can deal with task-specific loss functions. All parameters are learned jointly by optimizing a common objective function corresponding to a regularized upper bound on the empirical loss.

In our design, we leverage recent lessons learned from design vulnerabilities in security protocols for other wireless networks such as 802.11b and GSM. Conventional security protocols tend to be conservative in their security guarantees, typically adding 16--32 bytes of overhead. With small memories, weak processors, limited energy, and 30 byte packets, sensor networks cannot afford this luxury. TinySec addresses these extreme resource constraints with careful design; we explore the tradeoffs among different cryptographic primitives and use the inherent sensor network limitations to our advantage when choosing parameters to find a sweet spot for security, packet overhead, and resource requirements. TinySec is portable to a variety of hardware and radio platforms. Our experimental results on a 36 node distributed sensor network application clearly demonstrate that software based link layer protocols are feasible and efficient, adding less than 10% energy, latency, and bandwidth overhead.","author":["Chris Karlof","Naveen Sastry","David Wagner"],"issue":["SenSys '04: Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on Embedded networked sensor systems","November 2004","Pages   162\u2013175","https://doi.org/10.1145/1031495.1031515"],"date":"03 November 2004","ref":[{"text":"Crossbow technology inc. http://www.xbow.com.]]","order":1},{"text":"Moteiv. http://www.moteiv.com/.]]","order":2},{"text":"OpenSSL. http://www.openssl.org.]]","order":3},{"text":"Security architecture for the Internet Protocol.

Shear employs a set of controlled algorithms combined with statistical techniques to automatically determine the important properties of a RAID system, including the number of disks, chunk size, level of redundancy, and layout scheme. We illustrate the correctness of Shear by running it upon numerous simulated configurations, and then verify its real-world applicability by running Shear on both software-based and hardware-based RAID systems. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of Shear through three case studies. First, we show how Shear can be used in a storage management environment to verify RAID construction and detect failures. Second, we demonstrate how Shear can be used to extract detailed characteristics about the individual disks within an array. Third, we show how an operating system can use Shear to automatically tune its storage subsystems to specific RAID configurations.","author":["Timothy E. Denehy","John Bent","Florentina I.

A wide repertoire of heuristic algorithms exists in the literature for efficiently arranging the logic cells on a VLSI chip. The objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive survey of the various cell placement techniques, with emphasis on standard cell and macro placement. Five major algorithms for placement are discussed: simulated annealing, force-directed placement, min-cut placement, placement by numerical optimization, and evolution-based placement. The first two classes of algorithms owe their origin to physical laws, the third and fourth are analytical techniques, and the fifth class of algorithms is derived from biological phenomena. In each category, the basic algorithm is explained with appropriate examples. Also discussed are the different implementations done by researchers.","author":["K. Shahookar","P.

This architecture features a novel adaptive logic module (ALM) that is based on a 6-LUT, but can be partitioned into two smaller LUTs to efficiently implement circuits containing a range of LUT sizes that arises in conventional synthesis flows. This provides a performance increase of 15% in the Stratix II architecture while reducing area by 2%. The ALM also includes a more powerful arithmetic structure that can perform two bits of arithmetic per ALM, and perform a sum of up to three inputs. The routing fabric adds a new set of fast inputs to the routing multiplexers for another 3% improvement in performance, while other improvements in routing efficiency cause another 6% reduction in area. These changes in combination with other circuit and architecture changes in Stratix II contribute 27% of an overall 51% performance improvement (including architecture and process improvement).

We present a physically aware hardware-software (HW-SW) scheme for minimizing application execution time under HW resource constraints, where the HW is a reconfigurable architecture with partial dynamic reconfiguration capability. Such architectures impose strict placement constraints that lead to implementation infeasibility of even optimal scheduling formulations that ignore the nature of these constraints. We propose an exact and a heuristic formulation that simultaneously partition, schedule, and do linear placement of tasks on such architectures. With our exact formulation, we prove the critical nature of placement constraints. We demonstrate that our heuristic generates high-quality schedules by comparing the results with the exact formulation for small tests and a popular, but placement-uanaware scheduling heuristic for larger tests. With a case study, we demonstrate extension of our approach to handle heterogenous architectures with specialized resources distributed between general purpose programmable logic columns. The execution time of our heuristic is very reasonable- task graphs with hundreds of nodes are processed in a couple of minutes.","author":["Sudarshan Banerjee","Elaheh Bozorgzadeh","Nikil Dutt"],"issue":["DAC '05: Proceedings of the 42nd annual Design Automation Conference","June 2005","Pages   335\u2013340","https://doi.org/10.1145/1065579.1065667"],"date":"13 June 2005","ref":[{"text":"P-H Yuh, C-L Yang, Y-W Chang, H-L Chen, \"Temporal floorplanning using the T-tree formulation\", ICCAD, 2004","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382590","order":1},{"text":"S.

The data points in each partition are transformed into a single dimensional value based on their similarity with respect to the reference point. This allows the points to be indexed using a B+-tree structure and KNN search to be performed using one-dimensional range search. The choice of partition and reference points adapts the index structure to the data distribution.We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the iDistance technique, and report results demonstrating its effectiveness. We also present a cost model for iDistance KNN search, which can be exploited in query optimization.","author":["H. V.

In this paper, we describe a unique array of 100 custom video cameras that we have built, and we summarize our experiences using this array in a range of imaging applications. Our goal was to explore the capabilities of a system that would be inexpensive to produce in the future. With this in mind, we used simple cameras, lenses, and mountings, and we assumed that processing large numbers of images would eventually be easy and cheap. The applications we have explored include approximating a conventional single center of projection video camera with high performance along one or more axes, such as resolution, dynamic range, frame rate, and/or large aperture, and using multiple cameras to approximate a video camera with a large synthetic aperture. This permits us to capture a video light field, to which we can apply spatiotemporal view interpolation algorithms in order to digitally simulate time dilation and camera motion. It also permits us to create video sequences using custom non-uniform synthetic apertures.","author":["Bennett Wilburn","Neel Joshi","Vaibhav Vaish","Eino-Ville Talvala","Emilio Antunez","Adam Barth","Andrew Adams","Mark Horowitz","Marc Levoy"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 24","Issue 3","July 2005","pp   765\u2013776","https://doi.org/10.1145/1073204.1073259"],"date":"01 July 2005","ref":[{"text":"Anderson, D. 1999.

While the co-clustering algorithms for two types of heterogeneous data (denoted by pair-wise co-clustering), such as documents and terms, have been well studied in the literature, the work on more types of heterogeneous data (denoted by high-order co-clustering) is still very limited. As an attempt in this direction, in this paper, we worked on a specific case of high-order co-clustering in which there is a central type of objects that connects the other types so as to form a star structure of the inter-relationships. Actually, this case could be a very good abstract for many real-world applications, such as the co-clustering of categories, documents and terms in text mining. In our philosophy, we treated such kind of problems as the fusion of multiple pair-wise co-clustering sub-problems with the constraint of the star structure. Accordingly, we proposed the concept of consistent bipartite graph co-partitioning, and developed an algorithm based on semi-definite programming (SDP) for efficient computation of the clustering results. Experiments on toy problems and real data both verified the effectiveness of our proposed method.","author":["Bin Gao","Tie-Yan Liu","Xin Zheng","Qian-Sheng Cheng","Wei-Ying Ma"],"issue":["KDD '05: Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery in data mining","August 2005","Pages   41\u201350","https://doi.org/10.1145/1081870.1081879"],"date":"21 August 2005","ref":[{"text":"Bach, F.R., and Jordan, M.I.

Unlike other recent work that relies on Markov assumptions or discretization of time, here each topic is associated with a continuous distribution over timestamps, and for each generated document, the mixture distribution over topics is influenced by both word co-occurrences and the document's timestamp. Thus, the meaning of a particular topic can be relied upon as constant, but the topics' occurrence and correlations change significantly over time.

While a large number of methods has been established for numerous problems, many challenges remain to be solved. New tasks emerge requiring the development of new methods or processing schemes. Like in software development, the development of such solutions demands for careful analysis, specification, implementation, and testing. Rapid prototyping is an approach which allows crucial design decisions as early as possible. A rapid prototyping system should support maximal re-use and innovative combinations of existing methods, as well as simple and quick integration of new ones.This paper describes Yale, a free open-source environment forKDD and machine learning. Yale provides a rich variety of methods whichallows rapid prototyping for new applications and makes costlyre-implementations unnecessary. Additionally, Yale offers extensive functionality for process evaluation and optimization which is a crucial property for any KDD rapid prototyping tool. Following the paradigm of visual programming eases the design of processing schemes. While the graphical user interface supports interactive design, the underlying XML representation enables automated applications after the prototyping phase.After a discussion of the key concepts of Yale, we illustrate the advantages of rapid prototyping for KDD on case studies ranging from data pre-processing to result visualization. These case studies cover tasks like feature engineering, text mining, data stream mining and tracking drifting concepts, ensemble methods and distributed data mining. This variety of applications is also reflected in a broad user base, we counted more than 40,000 downloads during the last twelve months.","author":["Ingo Mierswa","Michael Wurst","Ralf Klinkenberg","Martin Scholz","Timm Euler"],"issue":["KDD '06: Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2006","Pages   935\u2013940","https://doi.org/10.1145/1150402.1150531"],"date":"20 August 2006","ref":[{"text":"S.

We present a compiler and runtime system that abstracts and virtualizes many aspects of graphics hardware. In addition, we present an analysis of the effectiveness of the GPU as a compute engine compared to the CPU, to determine when the GPU can outperform the CPU for a particular algorithm. We evaluate our system with five applications, the SAXPY and SGEMV BLAS operators, image segmentation, FFT, and ray tracing. For these applications, we demonstrate that our Brook implementations perform comparably to hand-written GPU code and up to seven times faster than their CPU counterparts.","author":["Ian Buck","Tim Foley","Daniel Horn","Jeremy Sugerman","Kayvon Fatahalian","Mike Houston","Pat Hanrahan"],"issue":["SIGGRAPH '04: ACM SIGGRAPH 2004 Papers","August 2004","Pages   777\u2013786","https://doi.org/10.1145/1186562.1015800"],"date":"01 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"ATI, 2004.

How to provide efficient roll back and quick mounting for flash-memory file systems has become an important research topic in recent years, in addition to the work on effective garbage collection and superb runtime performance. Such an observation motivates our work on the investigation of efficient initialization and crash recovery of flash-memory file systems based on log structures. A methodology is proposed for the acceleration of mounting and crash recovery for log-based file systems. A system prototype based on a well-known flash-memory file system, YAFFS, was implemented with performance evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology can reduce mounting time significantly, regardless of whether the file system is properly unmounted.","author":["Chin-Hsien Wu","Tei-Wei Kuo","Li-Pin Chang"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 2","Issue 4","November 2006","pp   449\u2013467","https://doi.org/10.1145/1210596.1210600"],"date":"01 November 2006","ref":[{"text":"Association CompactFlash. 1998. compact flashTM 1.4 specification. http://www.compactflash.org/.","order":1},{"text":"Bez, R., Camerlenghi, E., Modelli, A., and Visconti, A. 2003.

In particular, we examine its parallelization potential and characterize its behavior on a chip multiprocessor (CMP). Applications in this domain model and simulate natural phenomena, and often direct visual components of motion pictures. We study a set of three workloads that exemplify the span and complexity of physical simulation applications used in a production environment: fluid dynamics, facial animation, and cloth simulation. They are computationally demanding, requiring from a few seconds to several minutes to simulate a single frame; therefore, they can benefit greatly from the acceleration possible with large scale CMPs.Starting with serial versions of these applications, we parallelize code accounting for at least 96% of the serial execution time, targeting a large number of threads.We then study the most expensive modules using a simulated 64-core CMP.For the code representing key modules, we achieve parallel scaling of 45x, 50x, and 30x for fluid, face, and cloth simulations, respectively. The modules have a spectrum of parallel task granularity and locking behavior, and all but one are dominated by loop-level parallelism. Many modules operate on streams of data. In some cases, modules iterate over their data, leading to significant temporal locality. This streaming behavior leads to very high on-die and main memory bandwidth requirements. Finally, most modules have little inter-thread communication since they are data-parallel, but a few require heavy communication between data-parallel operations.","author":["Christopher J.

Users of these sites form a social network, which provides a powerful means of sharing, organizing, and finding content and contacts. The popularity of these sites provides an opportunity to study the characteristics of online social network graphs at large scale. Understanding these graphs is important, both to improve current systems and to design new applications of online social networks. This paper presents a large-scale measurement study and analysis of the structure of multiple online social networks. We examine data gathered from four popular online social networks: Flickr, YouTube, LiveJournal, and Orkut. We crawled the publicly accessible user links on each site, obtaining a large portion of each social network's graph. Our data set contains over 11.3 million users and 328 million links. We believe that this is the first study to examine multiple online social networks at scale. Our results confirm the power-law, small-world, and scale-free properties of online social networks. We observe that the indegree of user nodes tends to match the outdegree; that the networks contain a densely connected core of high-degree nodes; and that this core links small groups of strongly clustered, low-degree nodes at the fringes of the network. Finally, we discuss the implications of these structural properties for the design of social network based systems.","author":["Alan Mislove","Massimiliano Marcon","Krishna P.

Several past solutions have individually evaluated different techniques to address separate aspects of this problem, in hardware and software, and at local and global levels. Unfortunately, there has been no corresponding work on coordinating all these solutions. In the absence of such coordination, these solutions are likely to interfere with one another, in unpredictable (and potentially dangerous) ways. This paper seeks to address this problem. We make two key contributions. First, we propose and validate a power management solution that coordinates different individual approaches. Using simulations based on 180 server traces from nine different real-world enterprises, we demonstrate the correctness, stability, and efficiency advantages of our solution. Second, using our unified architecture as the base, we perform a detailed quantitative sensitivity analysis and draw conclusions about the impact of different architectures, implementations, workloads, and system design choices.","author":["Ramya Raghavendra","Parthasarathy Ranganathan","Vanish Talwar","Zhikui Wang","Xiaoyun Zhu"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 43","Issue 3","March 2008","pp   48\u201359","https://doi.org/10.1145/1353536.1346289"],"date":"01 March 2008","ref":[{"text":"L.

In this study the use of sentiment analysis methodologies is proposed for classification of Web forum opinions in multiple languages. The utility of stylistic and syntactic features is evaluated for sentiment classification of English and Arabic content. Specific feature extraction components are integrated to account for the linguistic characteristics of Arabic. The entropy weighted genetic algorithm (EWGA) is also developed, which is a hybridized genetic algorithm that incorporates the information-gain heuristic for feature selection. EWGA is designed to improve performance and get a better assessment of key features. The proposed features and techniques are evaluated on a benchmark movie review dataset and U.S. and Middle Eastern Web forum postings. The experimental results using EWGA with SVM indicate high performance levels, with accuracies of over 91% on the benchmark dataset as well as the U.S. and Middle Eastern forums. Stylistic features significantly enhanced performance across all testbeds while EWGA also outperformed other feature selection methods, indicating the utility of these features and techniques for document-level classification of sentiments.","author":["Ahmed Abbasi","Hsinchun Chen","Arab Salem"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 26","Issue 3","June 2008","Article No.: 12","pp   1\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/1361684.1361685"],"date":"20 June 2008","ref":[{"text":"Abbasi, A. and Chen, H. 2005.

Through this work, we show the practicality of analytical model-driven automatic transformation in the polyhedral model -- far beyond what is possible by current production compilers. Unlike previous works, our approach is an end-to-end fully automatic one driven by an integer linear optimization framework that takes an explicit view of finding good ways of tiling for parallelism and locality using affine transformations. The framework has been implemented into a tool to automatically generate OpenMP parallel code from C program sections. Experimental results from the tool show very high speedups for local and parallel execution on multi-cores over state-of-the-art compiler frameworks from the research community as well as the best native production compilers. The system also enables the easy use of powerful empirical/iterative optimization for general arbitrarily nested loop sequences.","author":["Uday Bondhugula","Albert Hartono","J. Ramanujam","P.

These services are described using machine-readable metadata, which enables consumer applications to automatically discover and provision suitable services for their workflows at run-time. However, current approaches have typically assumed service descriptions are accurate and deterministic, and so have neglected to account for the fact that services in these open systems are inherently unreliable and uncertain. Specifically, network failures, software bugs and competition for services may regularly lead to execution delays or even service failures. To address this problem, the process of provisioning services needs to be performed in a more flexible manner than has so far been considered, in order to proactively deal with failures and to recover workflows that have partially failed. To this end, we devise and present a heuristic strategy that varies the provisioning of services according to their predicted performance. Using simulation, we then benchmark our algorithm and show that it leads to a 700% improvement in average utility, while successfully completing up to eight times as many workflows as approaches that do not consider service failures.","author":["Sebastian Stein","Terry R.

Due to the very large number of parameters involved, a general purpose least-squares algorithm incurs high computational and memory storage costs when applied to bundle adjustment. Fortunately, the lack of interaction among certain subgroups of parameters results in the corresponding Jacobian being sparse, a fact that can be exploited to achieve considerable computational savings. This article presents sba, a publicly available C/C++ software package for realizing generic bundle adjustment with high efficiency and flexibility regarding parameterization.","author":["Manolis I.

The nodes of a DB-sharing system are locally coupled via a high-speed interconnect and share a common database at the disk level. This is also known as a \u201cshared disk\u201d approach. We compare database sharing with the database partitioning (shared nothing) approach and discuss the functional DBMS components that require new and coordinated solutions for DB-sharing. The performance of DB-sharing systems critically depends on the protocols used for concurrency and coherency control. The frequency of communication required for these functions has to be kept as low as possible in order to achieve high transation rates and short response times. A trace-driven simulation system for DB-sharing complexes has been developed that allows a realistic performance comparison of four different concurrency and coherency control protocols. We consider two locking and two optimistic schemes which operate either under central or distributed control. For coherency control, we investigate so-called on-request and broadcast invalidation schemes, and employ buffer-to-buffer communication to exchange modified pages directly between different nodes. The performance impact of random routing versus affinity-based load distribution and different communication costs is also examined. In addition, we analyze potential performance bottlenecks created by hot spot pages.","author":["Erhard Rahm"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Database Systems","Volume 18","Issue 2","June 1993","pp   333\u2013377","https://doi.org/10.1145/151634.151639"],"date":"01 June 1993","ref":[{"text":"AGARWAL, A., HENNESSY, J, ANn HOROWITZ, M.

Until recently, however, a computer contained only a few single-core CPUs, and therefore only a few transactions could simultaneously access the storage manager's internal structures. This allowed storage managers to use non-scalable approaches without any penalty. With the arrival of multicore chips, however, this situation is rapidly changing. More and more threads can run in parallel, stressing the internal scalability of the storage manager. Systems optimized for high performance at a limited number of cores are not assured similarly high performance at a higher core count, because unanticipated scalability obstacles arise. We benchmark four popular open-source storage managers (Shore, BerkeleyDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL) on a modern multicore machine, and find that they all suffer in terms of scalability. We briefly examine the bottlenecks in the various storage engines. We then present Shore-MT, a multithreaded and highly scalable version of Shore which we developed by identifying and successively removing internal bottlenecks. When compared to other DBMS, Shore-MT exhibits superior scalability and 2--4 times higher absolute throughput than its peers. We also show that designers should favor scalability to single-thread performance, and highlight important principles for writing scalable storage engines, illustrated with real examples from the development of Shore-MT.","author":["Ryan Johnson","Ippokratis Pandis","Nikos Hardavellas","Anastasia Ailamaki","Babak Falsafi"],"issue":["EDBT '09: Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology","March 2009","Pages   24\u201335","https://doi.org/10.1145/1516360.1516365"],"date":"24 March 2009","ref":[{"text":"Oracle BerkeleyDB. http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/berkeley-db/index.html","order":1},{"text":"MySQL. http://www.mysql.com.","order":2},{"text":"A.

We describe a general framework for cluster labeling that extracts candidate labels from Wikipedia in addition to important terms that are extracted directly from the text. The \"labeling quality\" of each candidate is then evaluated by several independent judges and the top evaluated candidates are recommended for labeling. Our experimental results reveal that the Wikipedia labels agree with manual labels associated by humans to a cluster, much more than with significant terms that are extracted directly from the text. We show that in most cases even when human's associated label appears in the text, pure statistical methods have difficulty in identifying them as good descriptors. Furthermore, our experiments show that for more than 85% of the clusters in our test collection, the manual label (or an inflection, or a synonym of it) appears in the top five labels recommended by our system.","author":["David Carmel","Haggai Roitman","Naama Zwerdling"],"issue":["SIGIR '09: Proceedings of the 32nd international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval","July 2009","Pages   139\u2013146","https://doi.org/10.1145/1571941.1571967"],"date":"19 July 2009","ref":[{"text":"20 News Group (20NG) data. http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20newsgroups.","order":1},{"text":"T.

In these networks, receivers can experience a drastic reduction in application throughput when simultaneously requesting data from many servers using TCP. Inbound data overfills small switch buffers, leading to TCP timeouts lasting hundreds of milliseconds. For many datacenter workloads that have a barrier synchronization requirement (e.g., filesystem reads and parallel data-intensive queries), throughput is reduced by up to 90%. For latency-sensitive applications, TCP timeouts in the datacenter impose delays of hundreds of milliseconds in networks with round-trip-times in microseconds.Our practical solution uses high-resolution timers to enable microsecond-granularity TCP timeouts. We demonstrate that this technique is effective in avoiding TCP incast collapse in simulation and in real-world experiments. We show that eliminating the minimum retransmission timeout bound is safe for all environments, including the wide-area.","author":["Vijay Vasudevan","Amar Phanishayee","Hiral Shah","Elie Krevat","David G.

The challenge is to develop policies and mechanisms that enable multiple applications to efficiently and fairly share the network, to improve system performance. Existing local packet scheduling policies in the routers fail to fully achieve this goal, because they treat every packet equally, regardless of which application issued the packet. This paper proposes prioritization policies and architectural extensions to NoC routers that improve the overall application-level throughput, while ensuring fairness in the network. Our prioritization policies are application-aware, distinguishing applications based on the stall-time criticality of their packets. The idea is to divide processor execution time into phases, rank applications within a phase based on stall-time criticality, and have all routers in the network prioritize packets based on their applications' ranks. Our scheme also includes techniques that ensure starvation freedom and enable the enforcement of system-level application priorities. We evaluate the proposed prioritization policies on a 64-core CMP with an 8x8 mesh NoC, using a suite of 35 diverse applications. For a representative set of case studies, our proposed policy increases average system throughput by 25.6% over age-based arbitration and 18.4% over round-robin arbitration. Averaged over 96 randomly-generated multiprogrammed workload mixes, the proposed policy improves system throughput by 9.1% over the best existing prioritization policy, while also reducing application-level unfairness.","author":["Reetuparna Das","Onur Mutlu","Thomas Moscibroda","Chita R.

Resistive memories, such as phase-change memory (PCM), already scale well beyond DRAM and are a promising DRAM replacement. Unfortunately, PCM is write-limited, and current approaches to managing writes must de- commission pages of PCM when the first bit fails.This paper presents dynamically replicated memory (DRM), the first hardware and operating system interface designed for PCM that allows continued operation through graceful degradation when hard faults occur. DRM reuses memory pages that con- tain hard faults by dynamically forming pairs of complementary pages that act as a single page of storage. No changes are required to the processor cores, the cache hierarchy, or the operating sys- tem's page tables. By changing the memory controller, the TLBs, and the operating system to be DRM-aware, we can improve the lifetime of PCM by up to 40x over conventional error-detection techniques.","author":["Engin Ipek","Jeremy Condit","Edmund B.

However, recent design methodologies do not always satisfy these assumptions. For instance, third-party IP blocks used in a system-on-chip are often overdesigned for the requirements at hand. By focusing only on the input combinations occurring in a specific application, one could resynthesize the system to greatly reduce its area and power consumption. Therefore we extend modern digital synthesis with a novel technique, called SWEDE, that makes use of extensive external don't-cares. In addition, we utilize such don't-cares present implicitly in existing simulation-based verification environments for circuit customization. Experiments indicate that SWEDE scales to large ICs with half-million input vectors and handles practical cases well.","author":["Kai-Hui Chang","Valeria Bertacco","Igor L.

With it, substantial subsets of nodes in the storage cluster can be turned off to save power during periods of low utilization. Rabbit is a distributed file system that arranges its data-layout to provide ideal power-proportionality down to very low minimum number of powered-up nodes (enough to store a primary replica of available datasets). Rabbit addresses the node failure rates of large-scale clusters with data layouts that minimize the number of nodes that must be powered-up if a primary fails. Rabbit also allows different datasets to use different subsets of nodes as a building block for interference avoidance when the infrastructure is shared by multiple tenants. Experiments with a Rabbit prototype demonstrate its power-proportionality, and simulation experiments demonstrate its properties at scale.","author":["Hrishikesh Amur","James Cipar","Varun Gupta","Gregory R.

Unfortunately, current error correction techniques are poorly suited to this emerging class of memory technologies. Unlike DRAM, PCM and other resistive memories have wear lifetimes, measured in writes, that are sufficiently short to make cell failures common during a system's lifetime. However, resistive memories are much less susceptible to transient faults than DRAM. The Hamming-based ECC codes used in DRAM are designed to handle transient faults with no effective lifetime limits, but ECC codes applied to resistive memories would wear out faster than the cells they are designed to repair. This paper evaluates Error-Correcting Pointers (ECP), a new approach to error correction optimized for memories in which errors are the result of permanent cell failures that occur, and are immediately detectable, at write time. ECP corrects errors by permanently encoding the locations of failed cells into a table and assigning cells to replace them. ECP provides longer lifetimes than previously proposed solutions with equivalent overhead. What's more, as the level of variance in cell lifetimes increases -- a likely consequence of further scalaing -- ECP's margin of improvement over existing schemes increases.","author":["Stuart Schechter","Gabriel H.

Conventional solutions to these problems perform poorly because of synchronization bottlenecks and high memory contention.Motivated by observations on the behavior of sorting networks, we offer a new approach to solving such problems, by introducing counting networks, a new class of networks that can be used to count. We give two counting network constructions, one of depth log n(1 + log n)/2 using n log (1 + log    n)/4 \u201cgates,\u201d and a second of depth log2 n using n log2 n/2 gates. These networks avoid the sequential bottlenecks inherent to earlier solutions and substantially lower the memory contention.Finally, to show that counting networks are not merely mathematical creatures, we provide experimental evidence that they outperform conventional synchronization techniques under a variety of circumstances.","author":["James Aspnes","Maurice Herlihy","Nir Shavit"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 41","Issue 5","Sept. 1994","pp   1020\u20131048","https://doi.org/10.1145/185675.185815"],"date":"01 September 1994","ref":[{"text":"~AGARWAL, A, AND CHERIAN, M 1989.

In this article, we propose an approach for solving large 3-SAT problems on FPGA using a WSAT algorithm. In hardware solvers, it is important to solve large problems efficiently. In WSAT algorithms, an assignment of binary values to the variables that satisfy all clauses is searched by repeatedly choosing a variable in an unsatisfied clause using a heuristic, and flipping its value. In our solver, (1) only the clauses that may be unsatisfied by the flipping are evaluated in parallel to minimize the circuit size, and (2) several independent tries are executed at the same time on the pipelined circuit to achieve high performance. Our FPGA solver can solve larger problems than previous works with less hardware resources, and shows higher performance.","author":["Kenji Kanazawa","Tsutomu Maruyama"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 4","Issue 1","December 2010","Article No.: 10","pp   1\u201321","https://doi.org/10.1145/1857927.1857937"],"date":"01 December 2010","ref":[{"text":"2005.

In many applications, this method has proved advantageous compared to the traditional Monte Carlo simulation method, which uses pseudo-random numbers, thanks to its faster convergence and higher level of accuracy. This article presents the design and implementation of a massively parallelized Quasi-Monte Carlo simulation engine on an FPGA-based supercomputer, called Maxwell. It also compares this implementation with equivalent graphics processing units (GPUs) and general purpose processors (GPP)-based implementations. The detailed comparison between these three implementations (FPGA vs. GPP vs. GPU) is done in the context of financial derivatives pricing based on our Quasi-Monte Carlo simulation engine. Real hardware implementations on the Maxwell machine show that FPGAs outperform equivalent GPP-based software implementations by 2 orders of magnitude, with the speed-up figure scaling linearly with the number of processing nodes used (FPGAs/GPPs). The same implementations show that FPGAs achieve a ~ 3x speedup compared to equivalent GPU-based implementations. Power consumption measurements also show FPGAs to be 336x more energy efficient than CPUs, and 16x more energy efficient than GPUs.","author":["Xiang Tian","Khaled Benkrid"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 3","Issue 4","November 2010","Article No.: 26","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/1862648.1862656"],"date":"01 November 2010","ref":[{"text":"2007.

In this article, we perform two types of travel recommendations by mining multiple users' GPS traces. The first is a generic one that recommends a user with top interesting locations and travel sequences in a given geospatial region. The second is a personalized recommendation that provides an individual with locations matching her travel preferences. To achieve the first recommendation, we model multiple users' location histories with a tree-based hierarchical graph (TBHG). Based on the TBHG, we propose a HITS (Hypertext Induced Topic Search)-based model to infer the interest level of a location and a user's travel experience (knowledge). In the personalized recommendation, we first understand the correlation between locations, and then incorporate this correlation into a collaborative filtering (CF)-based model, which predicts a user's interests in an unvisited location based on her locations histories and that of others. We evaluated our system based on a real-world GPS trace dataset collected by 107 users over a period of one year. As a result, our HITS-based inference model outperformed baseline approaches like rank-by-count and rank-by-frequency. Meanwhile, we achieved a better performance in recommending travel sequences beyond baselines like rank-by-count. Regarding the personalized recommendation, our approach is more effective than the weighted Slope One algorithm with a slightly additional computation, and is more efficient than the Pearson correlation-based CF model with the similar effectiveness.","author":["Yu Zheng","Xing Xie"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology","Volume 2","Issue 1","January 2011","Article No.: 2","pp   1\u201329","https://doi.org/10.1145/1889681.1889683"],"date":"24 January 2011","ref":[{"text":"Abowd, G.

It runs on a commodity 802.11n NIC, and records Channel State Information (CSI) based on the 802.11 standard. Unlike Receive Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values, which merely capture the total power received at the listener, the CSI contains information about the channel between sender and receiver at the level of individual data subcarriers, for each pair of transmit and receive antennas.Our toolkit uses the Intel WiFi Link 5300 wireless NIC with 3 antennas. It works on up-to-date Linux operating systems: in our testbed we use Ubuntu 10.04 LTS with the 2.6.36 kernel. The measurement setup comprises our customized versions of Intel's close-source firmware and open-source iwlwifi wireless driver, userspace tools to enable these measurements, access point functionality for controlling both ends of the link, and Matlab (or Octave) scripts for data analysis. We are releasing the binary of the modified firmware, and the source code to all the other components.","author":["Daniel Halperin","Wenjun Hu","Anmol Sheth","David Wetherall"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 41","Issue 1","January 2011","pp   53","https://doi.org/10.1145/1925861.1925870"],"date":"22 January 2011","ref":[{"text":"IEEE Std. 802.11n-2009: Enhancements for higher throughput. http://www.ieee802.org, 2009.","order":1},{"text":"D.Halperin, W.Hu, A.Sheth, and D.Wetherall. 802.11 with multiple antennas for dummies.

In this paper we address the fluency of robot-human hand-overs. From an observational study with our robot HERB, we identify the key problems with a baseline hand-over action. We find that the failure to convey the intention of handing over causes delays in the transfer, while the lack of an intuitive signal to indicate timing of the hand-over causes early, unsuccessful attempts to take the object. We propose to address these problems with the use of spatial contrast, in the form of distinct hand-over poses, and temporal contrast, in the form of unambiguous transitions to the hand-over pose. We conduct a survey to identify distinct hand-over poses, and determine variables of the pose that have most communicative potential for the intent of handing over. We present an experiment that analyzes the effect of the two types of contrast on the fluency of hand-overs. We find that temporal contrast is particularly useful in improving fluency by eliminating early attempts of the human.","author":["Maya Cakmak","Siddhartha S.

Several databases are available and are frequently used by many services and web sites in the Internet. Contrary to widespread belief, geolocation databases are far from being as reliable as they claim. In this paper, we conduct a comparison of several current geolocation databases -both commercial and free- to have an insight of the limitations in their usability.First, the vast majority of entries in the databases refer only to a few popular countries (e.g., U.S.). This creates an imbalance in the representation of countries across the IP blocks of the databases. Second, these entries do not reflect the original allocation of IP blocks, nor BGP announcements. In addition, we quantify the accuracy of geolocation databases on a large European ISP based on ground truth information. This is the first study using a ground truth showing that the overly fine granularity of database entries makes their accuracy worse, not better. Geolocation databases can claim country-level accuracy, but certainly not city-level.","author":["Ingmar Poese","Steve Uhlig","Mohamed Ali Kaafar","Benoit Donnet","Bamba Gueye"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 41","Issue 2","April 2011","pp   53\u201356","https://doi.org/10.1145/1971162.1971171"],"date":"15 April 2011","ref":[{"text":"B.

However, the role of refactorings has not been systematically investigated using fine-grained evolution history. We quantitatively and qualitatively studied API-level refactorings and bug fixes in three large open source projects, totaling 26523 revisions of evolution. The study found several surprising results: One, there is an increase in the number of bug fixes after API-level refactorings. Two, the time taken to fix bugs is shorter after API-level refactorings than before. Three, a large number of refactoring revisions include bug fixes at the same time or are related to later bug fix revisions. Four, API-level refactorings occur more frequently before than after major software releases. These results call for re-thinking refactoring's true benefits. Furthermore, frequent floss refactoring mistakes observed in this study call for new software engineering tools to support safe application of refactoring and behavior modifying edits together.","author":["Miryung Kim","Dongxiang Cai","Sunghun Kim"],"issue":["ICSE '11: Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Software Engineering","May 2011","Pages   151\u2013160","https://doi.org/10.1145/1985793.1985815"],"date":"21 May 2011","ref":[{"text":"J.

The distinguishing feature of SkimpyStash is the design goal of extremely low RAM footprint at about 1 (\u00b1 0.5) byte per key-value pair, which is more aggressive than earlier designs. SkimpyStash uses a hash table directory in RAM to index key-value pairs stored in a log-structured manner on flash. To break the barrier of a flash pointer (say, 4 bytes) worth of RAM overhead per key, it \"moves\" most of the pointers that locate each key-value pair from RAM to flash itself. This is realized by (i) resolving hash table collisions using linear chaining, where multiple keys that resolve (collide) to the same hash table bucket are chained in a linked list, and (ii) storing the linked lists on flash itself with a pointer in each hash table bucket in RAM pointing to the beginning record of the chain on flash, hence incurring multiple flash reads per lookup. Two further techniques are used to improve performance: (iii) two-choice based load balancing to reduce wide variation in bucket sizes (hence, chain lengths and associated lookup times), and a bloom filter in each hash table directory slot in RAM to disambiguate the choice during lookup, and (iv) compaction procedure to pack bucket chain records contiguously onto flash pages so as to reduce flash reads during lookup. The average bucket size is the critical design parameter that serves as a powerful knob for making a continuum of tradeoffs between low RAM usage and low lookup latencies. Our evaluations on commodity server platforms with real-world data center applications show that SkimpyStash provides throughputs from few 10,000s to upwards of 100,000 get-set operations/sec.","author":["Biplob Debnath","Sudipta Sengupta","Jin Li"],"issue":["SIGMOD '11: Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data","June 2011","Pages   25\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/1989323.1989327"],"date":"12 June 2011","ref":[{"text":"C# System.Threading. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.aspx.","order":1},{"text":"Fusion-IO Drive Datasheet. http://www.fusionio.com/PDFs/Data_Sheet_ioDrive_2.pdf.","order":2},{"text":"Iometer. http://www.iometer.org/.","order":3},{"text":"MurmurHash Fuction. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash.","order":4},{"text":"MySpace Uses Fusion Powered I/O to Drive Greener and Better Data Centers. http://www.fusionio.com/case-studies/myspace-case-study.pdf.","order":5},{"text":"Releasing Flashcache. http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=388112370932.","order":6},{"text":"Xbox LIVE Primetime game. http://www.xboxprimetime.com/.","order":7},{"text":"Agrawal, D., Ganesan, D., Sitaraman, R., Diao, Y., and Singh, S.

The new algorithm is both faster and more memory efficient, removing the need for temporary storage of geometry data for intermediate computations. Finally, the same pipeline has been extended to parallelize the construction of the top-level SAH optimized tree on the GPU, eliminating round-trips to the CPU, accelerating the overall construction speed by a factor of 5 to 10x.","author":["Kirill Garanzha","Jacopo Pantaleoni","David McAllister"],"issue":["HPG '11: Proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on High Performance Graphics","August 2011","Pages   59\u201364","https://doi.org/10.1145/2018323.2018333"],"date":"05 August 2011","ref":[{"text":"Ernst, M., and Greiner, G. 2007.

The significant silicon areas occupied by TSVs bring critical challenges for 3D IC placement. Unlike most published 3D placement works that only minimize the number of TSVs during placement due to the limitations in their techniques, this paper proposes a new 3D cell placement algorithm which can additionally consider the sizes of TSVs and the physical positions for TSV insertion during placement. The algorithm consists of three stages: (1) 3D analytical global placement with density optimization and whitespace reservation for TSVs, (2) TSV insertion and TSV-aware legalization, and (3) layer-by-layer detailed placement. In particular, the global placement is based on a novel weighted-average wirelength model, giving the first model in the literature that can outperform the well-known log-sum-exp wirelength model theoretically and empirically. Further, 3D routing can easily be accomplished by traditional 2D routers since the physical positions of TSVs are determined during placement. Compared with state-of-the-art 3D cell placement works, our algorithm can achieve the best routed wirelength, TSV counts, and total silicon area, in shortest running time.","author":["Meng-Kai Hsu","Yao-Wen Chang","Valeriy Balabanov"],"issue":["DAC '11: Proceedings of the 48th Design Automation Conference","June 2011","Pages   664\u2013669","https://doi.org/10.1145/2024724.2024875"],"date":"05 June 2011","ref":[{"text":". http://www.cadence.com.","order":1},{"text":". http://er.cs.ucla.edu/benchmarks/ibm-place.","order":2},{"text":". http://iwls.org/iwls2005/benchmarks.html.","order":3},{"text":"T.

Workloads exhibit a diverse set of IO behaviors and varying IO load that makes it difficult to estimate the IO performance on shared storage. As a result, system administrators often resort to gross overprovisioning or static partitioning of storage to meet application demands. In this paper, we introduce Pesto, a unified storage performance management system for heterogeneous virtualized datacenters. Pesto is the first system that completely automates storage performance management for virtualized datacenters, providing IO load balancing with cost-benefit analysis, per-device congestion management, and initial placement of new workloads. At its core, Pesto constructs and adapts approximate black-box performance models of storage devices automatically, leveraging our analysis linking device throughput and latency to outstanding IOs.Experimental results for a wide range of devices and configurations validate the accuracy of these models. We implemented Pesto in a commercial product and tested its performance on tens of devices, running hundreds of test cases over the past year. End-to-end experiments demonstrate that Pesto is efficient, adapts to changes quickly and can improve workload performance by up to 19%, achieving our objective of lowering storage management costs through automation.","author":["Ajay Gulati","Ganesha Shanmuganathan","Irfan Ahmad","Carl Waldspurger","Mustafa Uysal"],"issue":["SOCC '11: Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing","October 2011","Article No.: 19","Pages   1\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/2038916.2038935"],"date":"26 October 2011","ref":[{"text":"Filebench. http://solarisinternals.com/si/tools/filebench/index.php.","order":1},{"text":"Iometer. http://www.iometer.org.","order":2},{"text":"G.

The Collection is widely used by the numerical linear algebra community for the development and performance evaluation of sparse matrix algorithms. It allows for robust and repeatable experiments: robust because performance results with artificially generated matrices can be misleading, and repeatable because matrices are curated and made publicly available in many formats. Its matrices cover a wide spectrum of domains, include those arising from problems with underlying 2D or 3D geometry (as structural engineering, computational fluid dynamics, model reduction, electromagnetics, semiconductor devices, thermodynamics, materials, acoustics, computer graphics/vision, robotics/kinematics, and other discretizations) and those that typically do not have such geometry (optimization, circuit simulation, economic and financial modeling, theoretical and quantum chemistry, chemical process simulation, mathematics and statistics, power networks, and other networks and graphs). We provide software for accessing and managing the Collection, from MATLAB\u2122, Mathematica\u2122, Fortran, and C, as well as an online search capability. Graph visualization of the matrices is provided, and a new multilevel coarsening scheme is proposed to facilitate this task.","author":["Timothy A.

However, a single flash-based SSD cannot satisfy the capacity, performance and reliability requirements of the modern storage systems that support increasingly demanding data-intensive computing applications. Applying RAID schemes to SSDs to meet these requirements, while a logical and viable solution, faces many challenges. In this article, we propose a Hybrid Parity-based Disk Array architecture (short for HPDA), which combines a group of SSDs and two hard disk drives (HDDs) to improve the performance and reliability of SSD-based storage systems. In HPDA, the SSDs (data disks) and part of one HDD (parity disk) compose a RAID4 disk array. Meanwhile, a second HDD and the free space of the parity disk are mirrored to form a RAID1-style write buffer that temporarily absorbs the small write requests and acts as a surrogate set during recovery when a disk fails. The write data is reclaimed to the data disks during the lightly loaded or idle periods of the system. Reliability analysis shows that the reliability of HPDA, in terms of MTTDL (Mean Time To Data Loss), is better than that of either pure HDD-based or SSD-based disk array. Our prototype implementation of HPDA and the performance evaluations show that HPDA significantly outperforms either HDD-based or SSD-based disk array.","author":["Bo Mao","Hong Jiang","Suzhen Wu","Lei Tian","Dan Feng","Jianxi Chen","Lingfang Zeng"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Storage","Volume 8","Issue 1","February 2012","Article No.: 4","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/2093139.2093143"],"date":"24 February 2012","ref":[{"text":"Agrawal, N., Bolosky, W.

Zebra also writes parity information in each stripe in the style of RAID disk arrays; this increases storage costs slightly, but allows the system to continue operation while a single storage server is unavailable.

However, the large development cost and short life span for FPGA designs have limited their adoption by the scientific computing community. FPGA-based scientific computing and many kinds of embedded computing could become more practical if there were hardware libraries that were portable to any FPGA-based system with performance that scaled with the size of the FPGA. To illustrate this idea we have implemented one common super-computing library function: the LU factorization method for solving systems of linear equations. This paper describes a method for making the design both portable and scalable that should be illustrative if such libraries are to be built in the future. The design is a software-based generator that leverages both the flexibility of a software programming language and the parameters inherent in an hardware description language. The generator accepts parameters that describe the FPGA capacity and external memory capabilities. We compare the performance of our engine executing on the largest FPGA available at the time of this work (an Altera Stratix III 3S340) to a single processor core fabricated in the same 65nm IC process running a highly optimized software implementation from the processor vendor. For single precision matrices on the order of 10,000 \u00d7 10,000 elements, the FPGA implementation is 2.2 times faster and the energy dissipated per useful GFLOP operation is a factor of 5 times less. For double precision, the FPGA implementation is 1.7 times faster and 3.5 times more energy efficient.","author":["Wei Zhang","Vaughn Betz","Jonathan Rose"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 5","Issue 1","March 2012","Article No.: 6","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/2133352.2133358"],"date":"23 March 2012","ref":[{"text":"Agility Design Solutions, Inc. 2008.

The compiler proves statically that all approximate computation is properly isolated from precise computation. The hardware is then free to selectively apply approximate storage and approximate computation with no need to perform dynamic correctness checks.In this paper, we propose an efficient mapping of disciplined approximate programming onto hardware. We describe an ISA extension that provides approximate operations and storage, which give the hardware freedom to save energy at the cost of accuracy. We then propose Truffle, a microarchitecture design that efficiently supports the ISA extensions. The basis of our design is dual-voltage operation, with a high voltage for precise operations and a low voltage for approximate operations. The key aspect of the microarchitecture is its dependence on the instruction stream to determine when to use the low voltage. We evaluate the power savings potential of in-order and out-of-order Truffle configurations and explore the resulting quality of service degradation. We evaluate several applications and demonstrate energy savings up to 43%.","author":["Hadi Esmaeilzadeh","Adrian Sampson","Luis Ceze","Doug Burger"],"issue":["ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News","Volume 40","Issue 1","March 2012","pp   301\u2013312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2189750.2151008"],"date":"03 March 2012","ref":[{"text":"Alpha Architecture Handbook, Version 3.

There exist many heuristics and ad-hoc methods for protection, but the problem as a whole has not received the theoretical treatment it deserves. In this paper, we provide theoretical treatment of software protection. We reduce the problem of software protection to the problem of efficient simulation on oblivious RAM.A machine is oblivious if thhe sequence in which it accesses memory locations is equivalent for any two inputs with the same running time. For example, an oblivious Turing Machine is one for which the movement of the heads on the tapes is identical for each computation. (Thus, the movement is independent of the actual input.) What is the slowdown in the running time of a machine, if it is required to be oblivious? In 1979, Pippenger and Fischer showed how a two-tape oblivious Turing Machine can simulate, on-line, a one-tape Turing Machine, with a logarithmic slowdown in the running time. We show an analogous result for the random-access machine (RAM) model of computation. In particular, we show how to do an on-line simulation of an arbitrary RAM by a probabilistic oblivious RAM with a polylogaithmic slowdown in the running time. On the other hand, we show that a logarithmic slowdown is a lower bound.","author":["Oded Goldreich","Rafail Ostrovsky"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 43","Issue 3","May 1996","pp   431\u2013473","https://doi.org/10.1145/233551.233553"],"date":"01 May 1996","ref":[{"text":"AHO, A.

Application-controlled file caching and prefetching can apply application-specific knowledge to improve file cache management.  However, supporting application-controlled file caching and prefetching is nontrivial because caching and prefetching need to be integrated carefully, and the kernel needs to allocate cache blocks among processes appropriately. This article presents the design, implementation, and performance of a file system that integrates application-controlled caching, prefetching, and disk scheduling. We use a two-level cache management strategy. The kernel uses the LRU-SP (Least-Recently-Used with Swapping and   Placeholders) policy to allocate blocks to processes, and each process integrates application-specific caching and prefetching based on the controlled-aggressive policy, an algorithm previously shown in a theoretical sense to be nearly optimal. Each process also improves its disk access latency by submittint its prefetches in batches so that the requests can be scheduled to optimize disk access performance. Our measurements show that this combination of techniques greatly improves the performance of the file system. We measured that the running time is reduced by 3% to 49% (average 26%) for single-process workloads and by 5% to 76% (average 32%) for multiprocess workloads.","author":["Pei Cao","Edward W.

PyDEC facilitates inquiry into both physical problems on manifolds as well as purely topological problems on abstract complexes. We describe efficient algorithms for constructing the operators and objects that arise in discrete exterior calculus, lowest-order finite element exterior calculus, and in related topological problems. Our algorithms are formulated in terms of high-level matrix operations which extend to arbitrary dimension. As a result, our implementations map well to the facilities of numerical libraries such as NumPy and SciPy. The availability of such libraries makes Python suitable for prototyping numerical methods. We demonstrate how PyDEC is used to solve physical and topological problems through several concise examples.","author":["Nathan Bell","Anil N.

For higher performance or larger problems, it is necessary to distribute the problem across multiple GPUs, increasing the already high programming complexity.In this article, we focus on abstracting the complexity of multi-GPU programming for stencil computation. We show that the best strategy depends not only on the stencil operator, problem size, and GPU, but also on the PCI express layout. This adds nonuniform characteristics to a seemingly homogeneous setup, causing up to 23% performance loss.

Recent work has improved efficiency, but still requires time-steps that are impractical for real-time applications. In this work we present an iterative density solver integrated into the Position Based Dynamics framework (PBD). By formulating and solving a set of positional constraints that enforce constant density, our method allows similar incompressibility and convergence to modern smoothed particle hydro-dynamic (SPH) solvers, but inherits the stability of the geometric, position based dynamics method, allowing large time steps suitable for real-time applications. We incorporate an artificial pressure term that improves particle distribution, creates surface tension, and lowers the neighborhood requirements of traditional SPH. Finally, we address the issue of energy loss by applying vorticity confinement as a velocity post process.","author":["Miles Macklin","Matthias M\u00fcller"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 32","Issue 4","July 2013","Article No.: 104","pp   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2461912.2461984"],"date":"21 July 2013","ref":[{"text":"Akinci, N., Ihmsen, M., Akinci, G., Solenthaler, B., and Teschner, M. 2012.

Although progress in cortical simulations using modern digital computers has been rapid, the essential disparity between the classical von Neumann computer architecture and the computational fabric of the nervous system makes large-scale simulations expensive, power hungry, and time consuming. Over the last three decades, CMOS-based neuromorphic implementations of \u201celectronic cortex\u201d have emerged as an energy efficient alternative for modeling neuronal behavior. However, the key ingredient for electronic implementation of any self-learning system\u2014programmable, plastic Hebbian synapses scalable to biological densities\u2014has remained elusive. We demonstrate the viability of implementing such electronic synapses using nanoscale phase change devices. We introduce novel programming schemes for modulation of device conductance to closely mimic the phenomenon of Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) observed biologically, and verify through simulations that such plastic phase change devices should support simple correlative learning in networks of spiking neurons. Our devices, when arranged in a crossbar array architecture, could enable the development of synaptronic systems that approach the density (\u223c1011 synapses per sq cm) and energy efficiency (consuming \u223c1pJ per synaptic programming event) of the human brain.","author":["Bryan L.

It comprises many layers or \"stages\" with opaque interfaces between them. This makes it hard to enforce end-to-end policies that dictate a storage IO flow's performance (e.g., guarantee a tenant's IO bandwidth) and routing (e.g., route an untrusted VM's traffic through a sanitization middlebox). These policies require IO differentiation along the flow path and global visibility at the control plane. We design IOFlow, an architecture that uses a logically centralized control plane to enable high-level flow policies. IOFlow adds a queuing abstraction at data-plane stages and exposes this to the controller. The controller can then translate policies into queuing rules at individual stages. It can also choose among multiple stages for policy enforcement. We have built the queue and control functionality at two key OS stages-- the storage drivers in the hypervisor and the storage server. IOFlow does not require application or VM changes, a key strength for deployability. We have deployed a prototype across a small testbed with a 40 Gbps network and storage devices. We have built control applications that enable a broad class of multi-point flow policies that are hard to achieve today.","author":["Eno Thereska","Hitesh Ballani","Greg O'Shea","Thomas Karagiannis","Antony Rowstron","Tom Talpey","Richard Black","Timothy Zhu"],"issue":["SOSP '13: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","November 2013","Pages   182\u2013196","https://doi.org/10.1145/2517349.2522723"],"date":"03 November 2013","ref":[{"text":"M.

Running these applications at ever-larger scales requires parallel platforms that automatically handle faults and stragglers. Unfortunately, current distributed stream processing models provide fault recovery in an expensive manner, requiring hot replication or long recovery times, and do not handle stragglers. We propose a new processing model, discretized streams (D-Streams), that overcomes these challenges. D-Streams enable a parallel recovery mechanism that improves efficiency over traditional replication and backup schemes, and tolerates stragglers. We show that they support a rich set of operators while attaining high per-node throughput similar to single-node systems, linear scaling to 100 nodes, sub-second latency, and sub-second fault recovery. Finally, D-Streams can easily be composed with batch and interactive query models like MapReduce, enabling rich applications that combine these modes. We implement D-Streams in a system called Spark Streaming.","author":["Matei Zaharia","Tathagata Das","Haoyuan Li","Timothy Hunter","Scott Shenker","Ion Stoica"],"issue":["SOSP '13: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles","November 2013","Pages   423\u2013438","https://doi.org/10.1145/2517349.2522737"],"date":"03 November 2013","ref":[{"text":"T.

For increasingly diverse companies, Hadoop has become the data and computational agor\u00e1---the de facto place where data and computational resources are shared and accessed. This broad adoption and ubiquitous usage has stretched the initial design well beyond its intended target, exposing two key shortcomings: 1) tight coupling of a specific programming model with the resource management infrastructure, forcing developers to abuse the MapReduce programming model, and 2) centralized handling of jobs' control flow, which resulted in endless scalability concerns for the scheduler. In this paper, we summarize the design, development, and current state of deployment of the next generation of Hadoop's compute platform: YARN. The new architecture we introduced decouples the programming model from the resource management infrastructure, and delegates many scheduling functions (e.g., task fault-tolerance) to per-application components. We provide experimental evidence demonstrating the improvements we made, confirm improved efficiency by reporting the experience of running YARN on production environments (including 100% of Yahoo! grids), and confirm the flexibility claims by discussing the porting of several programming frameworks onto YARN viz.

The lack of network guarantees prevents tenants from predicting lower bounds on the performance of their applications. The research community has recognized this limitation but, unfortunately, prior solutions have significant limitations: either they are inefficient, because they are not work-conserving, or they are impractical, because they require expensive switch support or congestion-free network cores.In this paper, we propose ElasticSwitch, an efficient and practical approach for providing bandwidth guarantees. ElasticSwitch is efficient because it utilizes the spare bandwidth from unreserved capacity or underutilized reservations. ElasticSwitch is practical because it can be fully implemented in hypervisors, without requiring a specific topology or any support from switches. Because hypervisors operate mostly independently, there is no need for complex coordination between them or with a central controller. Our experiments, with a prototype implementation on a 100-server testbed, demonstrate that ElasticSwitch provides bandwidth guarantees and is work-conserving, even in challenging situations.","author":["Lucian Popa","Praveen Yalagandula","Sujata Banerjee","Jeffrey C.

While still in the early stage of research, PCMOS has shown potential to drastically reduce energy consumption at a cost of increased errors. Recently, a methodology has been proposed which could predict the error rates of cascade structures of blocks in PCMOS. This methodology requires error rates of unique blocks to predict the error rates of multiblock cascade structures composed of these unique blocks. In this article we present a new model for characterization of probabilistic circuits/blocks and present a procedure to find and characterize unique circuits/blocks. Unlike prior approaches, our new model distinguishes distinct filtering effects per output, thereby improving prediction accuracy by an average of 95% over the prior art by Palem and coauthors. Furthermore, we show two models where our new model with three stages is 18% more accurate, on average, than our simpler two-stage model. We apply our proposed models to Ripple Carry Adders and Wallace Tree Multipliers and show that using our models, the methodology of cascade structures can predict error rates of PCMOS circuits with reasonable accuracy (within 9%) in PCMOS for uniform voltages as well as multiple voltages. Finally, our approach takes seconds of simulation time whereas using HSPICE would take days of simulation time.","author":["Anshul Singh","Arindam Basu","Keck-Voon Ling","Vincent J.

However, these emerging SSD arrays are facing enormous challenges, which are not observed in disk-based arrays. Specifically, we observe that the performance of SSD arrays can significantly degrade due to various array-level resource contentions. In addition, their maintenance costs exponentially increase over time, which renders them difficult to deploy widely in HPC systems. To address these challenges, we propose Triple-A, a non-SSD based Autonomic All-Flash Array, which is a self-optimizing, from-scratch NAND flash cluster. Triple-A can detect two different types of resource contentions and autonomically alleviate them by reshaping the physical data-layout on its flash array network. Our experimental evaluation using both real workloads and a micro-benchmark show that Triple-A can offer a 53% higher sustained throughput and a 80% lower I/O latency than non-autonomic SSD arrays.","author":["Myoungsoo Jung","Wonil Choi","John Shalf","Mahmut Taylan Kandemir"],"issue":["ASPLOS '14: Proceedings of the 19th international conference on Architectural support for programming languages and operating systems","February 2014","Pages   441\u2013454","https://doi.org/10.1145/2541940.2541953"],"date":"24 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"http://www.dramexchange.com/.","order":1},{"text":"SNIA IOTTA repository.

At the same time, a small set of machine-learning algorithms (especially Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks, i.e., CNNs and DNNs) are proving to be state-of-the-art across many applications. As architectures evolve towards heterogeneous multi-cores composed of a mix of cores and accelerators, a machine-learning accelerator can achieve the rare combination of efficiency (due to the small number of target algorithms) and broad application scope. Until now, most machine-learning accelerator designs have focused on efficiently implementing the computational part of the algorithms. However, recent state-of-the-art CNNs and DNNs are characterized by their large size. In this study, we design an accelerator for large-scale CNNs and DNNs, with a special emphasis on the impact of memory on accelerator design, performance and energy. We show that it is possible to design an accelerator with a high throughput, capable of performing 452 GOP/s (key NN operations such as synaptic weight multiplications and neurons outputs additions) in a small footprint of 3.02 mm2 and 485 mW; compared to a 128-bit 2GHz SIMD processor, the accelerator is 117.87x faster, and it can reduce the total energy by 21.08x. The accelerator characteristics are obtained after layout at 65 nm. Such a high throughput in a small footprint can open up the usage of state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms in a broad set of systems and for a broad set of applications.","author":["Tianshi Chen","Zidong Du","Ninghui Sun","Jia Wang","Chengyong Wu","Yunji Chen","Olivier Temam"],"issue":["ASPLOS '14: Proceedings of the 19th international conference on Architectural support for programming languages and operating systems","February 2014","Pages   269\u2013284","https://doi.org/10.1145/2541940.2541967"],"date":"24 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"R.

It is typically not possible to write a single application that can run efficiently in different environments, leading to multiple versions and increased complexity. Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) are a promising avenue to enable programmers to use high-level abstractions and still achieve good performance on a variety of hardware. This is possible because DSLs have higher-level semantics and restrictions than general-purpose languages, so DSL compilers can perform higher-level optimization and translation. However, the cost of developing performance-oriented DSLs is a substantial roadblock to their development and adoption. In this article, we present an overview of the Delite compiler framework and the DSLs that have been developed with it. Delite simplifies the process of DSL development by providing common components, like parallel patterns, optimizations, and code generators, that can be reused in DSL implementations. Delite DSLs are embedded in Scala, a general-purpose programming language, but use metaprogramming to construct an Intermediate Representation (IR) of user programs and compile to multiple languages (including C++, CUDA, and OpenCL). DSL programs are automatically parallelized and different parts of the application can run simultaneously on CPUs and GPUs. We present Delite DSLs for machine learning, data querying, graph analysis, and scientific computing and show that they all achieve performance competitive to or exceeding C++ code.","author":["Arvind K.

As a result, the existing approaches for plan-driven parallelism run into load balancing and context-switching bottlenecks, and therefore no longer scale. A third problem faced by many-core architectures is the decentralization of memory controllers, which leads to Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA). In response, we present the morsel-driven query execution framework, where scheduling becomes a fine-grained run-time task that is NUMA-aware. Morsel-driven query processing takes small fragments of input data (morsels) and schedules these to worker threads that run entire operator pipelines until the next pipeline breaker. The degree of parallelism is not baked into the plan but can elastically change during query execution, so the dispatcher can react to execution speed of different morsels but also adjust resources dynamically in response to newly arriving queries in the workload. Further, the dispatcher is aware of data locality of the NUMA-local morsels and operator state, such that the great majority of executions takes place on NUMA-local memory. Our evaluation on the TPC-H and SSB benchmarks shows extremely high absolute performance and an average speedup of over 30 with 32 cores.","author":["Viktor Leis","Peter Boncz","Alfons Kemper","Thomas Neumann"],"issue":["SIGMOD '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","June 2014","Pages   743\u2013754","https://doi.org/10.1145/2588555.2610507"],"date":"18 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"M.-C.

The quality (randomness) of TRNGs depends on sensitivity to random noise, environmental conditions, and aging. Random sources of noise improve TRNG quality. In older or more mature technologies, the random sources are limited resulting in low TRNG quality. Prior work has also shown that attackers can manipulate voltage supply and temperature to bias the TRNG output. In this paper, we propose bias detection mechanisms and a technology independent TRNG (TI-TRNG) architecture. The TI-TRNG enhances power supply noise for older technologies and uses a self-calibration mechanism that reduces bias in TRNG output due to aging and attacks. Experiment results on 130nm, 90nm, and 45nm FPGAs demonstrate the quality of random sequences from the TI-TRNG across aging and different environmental conditions.","author":["Md.

Memories are susceptible to degradation and failures from a wide range of manufacturing, operational and environmental effects, requiring a multi-layer hardware/software approach that can tolerate, adapt and even opportunistically exploit such effects. The overall memory hierarchy is also highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of variability and operational stress. After reviewing the major memory degradation and failure modes, this paper describes the challenges for dependability across the memory hierarchy, and outlines research efforts to achieve multi-layer memory resilience using a hardware/software approach. Two specific exemplars are used to illustrate multilayer memory resilience: first we describe static and dynamic policies to achieve energy savings in caches using aggressive voltage scaling combined with disabling faulty blocks; and second we show how software characteristics can be exposed to the architecture in order to mitigate the aging of large register files in GPGPUs. These approaches can further benefit from semantic retention of application intent to enhance memory dependability across multiple abstraction levels, including applications, compilers, run-time systems, and hardware platforms.","author":["Nikil Dutt","Puneet Gupta","Alex Nicolau","Abbas BanaiyanMofrad","Mark Gottscho","Majid Shoushtari"],"issue":["DAC '14: Proceedings of the 51st Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2014","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2593069.2596684"],"date":"01 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"A.

Not all data need to be refreshed with the same frequency, though, and thus some refresh operations can safely be delayed. Tracking such information allows the memory controller to reduce refresh costs by judiciously choosing when to refresh different rows Solutions that store imprecise information miss opportunities to avoid unnecessary refresh operations, but the storage for tracking complete information scales with memory capacity. We therefore propose a flexible approach to refresh management that tracks complete refresh information within the DRAM itself, where it incurs negligible storage costs (0.006% of total capacity) and can be managed easily in hardware or software. Completely tracking multiple types of refresh information (e.g., row retention time and data validity) maximizes refresh reduction and lets us choose the most effective refresh schemes. Our evaluations show that our approach saves 25-82% of the total DRAM energy over prior refresh-reduction mechanisms.","author":["Zehan Cui","Sally A.

In this paper, we present a scalable compiler for large-scale quantum applications, and show the opportunities for reducing compilation and analysis time, as well as output code size. We discuss the similarities and differences between compiling for a quantum computer as opposed to a classical computer, and present a state-of-the-art approach for compilation of classical circuits into quantum circuits. Our work also highlights the importance of high-level quantum compilation for logical circuit translation, quantitative analysis of algorithms, and optimization of circuit lengths.","author":["Ali JavadiAbhari","Shruti Patil","Daniel Kudrow","Jeff Heckey","Alexey Lvov","Frederic T.

At the same time, the use of typefaces is ubiquitous; there are many users who, while not experts, would like to be more involved in tweaking or changing existing fonts without suffering the learning curve of professional typography packages.Given the wealth of fonts that are available today, we would like to exploit the expertise used to produce these fonts, and to enable everyday users to create, explore, and edit fonts. To this end, we build a generative manifold of standard fonts. Every location on the manifold corresponds to a unique and novel typeface, and is obtained by learning a non-linear mapping that intelligently interpolates and extrapolates existing fonts. Using the manifold, we can smoothly interpolate and move between existing fonts. We can also use the manifold as a constraint that makes a variety of new applications possible. For instance, when editing a single character, we can update all the other glyphs in a font simultaneously to keep them compatible with our changes.","author":["Neill D. F.

In this paper, we present an activity-edge centric multi-label classification framework for analyzing heterogeneous information networks with three unique features. First, we model a heterogeneous information network in terms of a collaboration graph and multiple associated activity graphs. We introduce a novel concept of vertex-edge homophily in terms of both vertex labels and edge labels and transform a general collaboration graph into an activity-based collaboration multigraph by augmenting its edges with class labels from each activity graph through activity-based edge classification. Second, we utilize the label vicinity to capture the pairwise vertex closeness based on the labeling on the activity-based collaboration multigraph. We incorporate both the structure affinity and the label vicinity into a unified classifier to speed up the classification convergence. Third, we design an iterative learning algorithm, AEClass, to dynamically refine the classification result by continuously adjusting the weights on different activity-based edge classification schemes from multiple activity graphs, while constantly learning the contribution of the structure affinity and the label vicinity in the unified classifier. Extensive evaluation on real datasets demonstrates that AEClass outperforms existing representative methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.","author":["Yang Zhou","Ling Liu"],"issue":["KDD '14: Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2014","Pages   1276\u20131285","https://doi.org/10.1145/2623330.2623737"],"date":"24 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"Q.

The KLA paradigm enables the level of asynchrony in parallel graph algorithms to be parametrically varied from none (level-synchronous) to full (asynchronous). The motivation is to improve execution times through an appropriate trade-off between the use of fewer, but more expensive global synchronizations, as in level-synchronous algorithms, and more, but less expensive local synchronizations (and perhaps also redundant work), as in asynchronous algorithms. We show how common patterns in graph algorithms can be expressed in the KLA pardigm and provide techniques for determining k, the number of asynchronous steps allowed between global synchronizations. Results of an implementation of KLA in the STAPL Graph Library show excellent scalability on up to 96K cores and improvements of 10x or more over level-synchronous and asynchronous versions for graph algorithms such as breadth-first search, PageRank, k-core decomposition and others on certain classes of real-world graphs.","author":["Harshvardhan","Adam Fidel","Nancy M.

We set out to explore the literature, and code, from the earliest days of the Internet to today, to try and find out what had gone wrong, and to find ways to fix it. A result of that effort (so far!) has been a renaissance in interest in congestion control, and huge - orders of magnitude - improvements in network latency along the edge of the Internet, with deployable new algorithms and code. Surprisingly, we also made large improvements in simultaneous bidirectional goodput on asymmetric networks.

It also provides a classification of these techniques on the basis of their main research idea. Further, it attempts to synthesize research works that compare the energy efficiency of GPUs with other computing systems (e.g., FPGAs and CPUs). The aim of this survey is to provide researchers with knowledge of the state of the art in GPU power management and motivate them to architect highly energy-efficient GPUs of tomorrow.","author":["Sparsh Mittal","Jeffrey S.

The luminaires-modified to allow rapid, on-off keying-transmit their identifiers and/or locations encoded in human-imperceptible optical pulses. A camera-equipped smartphone, using just a single image frame capture, can detect the presence of the luminaires in the image, decode their transmitted identifiers and/or locations, and determine the smartphone's location and orientation relative to the luminaires. Continuous image capture and processing enables continuous position updates. The key insights underlying this work are (i) the driver circuits of emerging LED lighting systems can be easily modified to transmit data through on-off keying; (ii) the rolling shutter effect of CMOS imagers can be leveraged to receive many bits of data encoded in the optical transmissions with just a single frame capture, (iii) a camera is intrinsically an angle-of-arrival sensor, so the projection of multiple nearby light sources with known positions onto a camera's image plane can be framed as an instance of a sufficiently-constrained angle-of-arrival localization problem, and (iv) this problem can be solved with optimization techniques. We explore the feasibility of the design through an analytical model, demonstrate the viability of the design through a prototype system, discuss the challenges to a practical deployment including usability and scalability, and demonstrate decimeter-level accuracy in both carefully controlled and more realistic human mobility scenarios.","author":["Ye-Sheng Kuo","Pat Pannuto","Ko-Jen Hsiao","Prabal Dutta"],"issue":["MobiCom '14: Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking","September 2014","Pages   447\u2013458","https://doi.org/10.1145/2639108.2639109"],"date":"07 September 2014","ref":[{"text":"J.

Especially, in the domain of image processing on mobile devices, among numerous design challenges, a very stringent energy budget is of utmost importance, making embedded GPUs and FPGAs ideal targets for implementation. Recently, the HIPAcc framework was proposed as a means for automatic code generation of image processing algorithms for embedded GPUs, based on a Domain-Specific Language (DSL). Despite of huge advancements in High-Level Synthesis (HLS) for FPGAs, designers are still required to have detailed knowledge about coding techniques and the targeted architecture to achieve efficient solutions. As a remedy, in this work, we propose code generation techniques for C-based HLS from a common high-level DSL description targeting FPGAs. Our approach includes FPGA-specific memory architectures for handling point and local operators, numerous high-level transformations, and automatic test bench generation. We evaluate our approach by comparing the resulting hardware accelerators to existing frameworks in terms of performance and resource requirements. Moreover, we assess the achieved energy efficiency in contrast to software implementations, generated by HIPAcc from the same code base, executed on GPUs.","author":["Oliver Reiche","Moritz Schmid","Frank Hannig","Richard Membarth","J\u00fcrgen Teich"],"issue":["CODES '14: Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis","October 2014","Article No.: 17","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2656075.2656081"],"date":"12 October 2014","ref":[{"text":"G.

The cooling solution is designed to dissipate this power level. But because TDP is not necessarily the maximum power that can be applied, chips are operated with Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) techniques. To avoid excessive triggers of DTM, usually, system designers also use TDP as power constraint. However, using a single and constant value as power constraint, e.g., TDP, can result in big performance losses in many-core systems. Having better power budgeting techniques is a major step towards dealing with the dark silicon problem. This paper presents a new power budget concept, called Thermal Safe Power (TSP), which is an abstraction that provides safe power constraint values as a function of the number of simultaneously operating cores. Executing cores at any power consumption below TSP ensures that DTM is not triggered. TSP can be computed offline for the worst cases, or online for a particular mapping of cores. Our simulations show that using TSP as power constraint results in 50.5% and 14.2% higher average performance, compared to using constant power budgets (both per-chip and per-core) and a boosting technique, respectively. Moreover, TSP results in dark silicon estimations which are more optimistic than estimations using constant power budgets.","author":["Santiago Pagani","Heba Khdr","Waqaas Munawar","Jian-Jia Chen","Muhammad Shafique","Minming Li","J\u00f6rg Henkel"],"issue":["CODES '14: Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis","October 2014","Article No.: 10","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/2656075.2656103"],"date":"12 October 2014","ref":[{"text":"C.

We first present a systematization of the design space of web applications and highlight the advantages and limitations of current proposals. Next, we present ShadowCrypt, a previously unexplored design point that enables encrypted input/output without trusting any part of the web applications. ShadowCrypt allows users to transparently switch to encrypted input/output for text-based web applications. ShadowCrypt runs as a browser extension, replacing input elements in a page with secure, isolated shadow inputs and encrypted text with secure, isolated cleartext. ShadowCrypt's key innovation is the use of Shadow DOM, an upcoming primitive that allows low-overhead isolation of DOM trees. Evaluation results indicate that ShadowCrypt has low overhead and of practical use today. Finally, based on our experience with ShadowCrypt, we present a study of 17 popular web applications, across different domains, and the functionality impact and security advantages of encrypting the data they handle.","author":["Warren He","Devdatta Akhawe","Sumeet Jain","Elaine Shi","Dawn Song"],"issue":["CCS '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","November 2014","Pages   1028\u20131039","https://doi.org/10.1145/2660267.2660326"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"6WUNDERKINDER.

Partial commutative monoids enable us to express---and invariants enable us to enforce---user-defined *protocols* on shared state, which are at the conceptual core of most recent program logics for concurrency. Furthermore, through a novel extension of the concept of a *view shift*, Iris supports the encoding of *logically atomic specifications*, i.e., Hoare-style specs that permit the client of an operation to treat the operation essentially as if it were atomic, even if it is not.","author":["Ralf Jung","David Swasey","Filip Sieczkowski","Kasper Svendsen","Aaron Turon","Lars Birkedal","Derek Dreyer"],"issue":["POPL '15: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages","January 2015","Pages   637\u2013650","https://doi.org/10.1145/2676726.2676980"],"date":"14 January 2015","ref":[{"text":"Appendix and Coq development. http://plv.mpi-sws.org/iris.","order":1},{"text":"M.

GhostRider ensures all programs satisfy a property called memory-trace obliviousness (MTO): Even an adversary that observes memory, bus traffic, and access times while the program executes can learn nothing about the program's sensitive inputs and outputs. One way to achieve MTO is to employ Oblivious RAM (ORAM), allocating all code and data in a single ORAM bank, and to also disable caches or fix the rate of memory traffic. This baseline approach can be inefficient, and so GhostRider's compiler uses a program analysis to do better, allocating data to non-oblivious, encrypted RAM (ERAM) and employing a scratchpad when doing so will not compromise MTO. The compiler can also allocate to multiple ORAM banks, which sometimes significantly reduces access times.We have formalized our approach and proved it enjoys MTO. Our FPGA-based hardware prototype and simulation results show that GhostRider significantly outperforms the baseline strategy.","author":["Chang Liu","Austin Harris","Martin Maas","Michael Hicks","Mohit Tiwari","Elaine Shi"],"issue":["ASPLOS '15: Proceedings of the Twentieth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","March 2015","Pages   87\u2013101","https://doi.org/10.1145/2694344.2694385"],"date":"14 March 2015","ref":[{"text":"Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Summary. http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/trusted_platform_module_tpm_summary.","order":1},{"text":"J.

In the case of multimedia data, such as images and videos, fast querying and processing of the available information requires the annotation of the multimedia data with semantic descriptors, that is, labels. However, only a small proportion of the available data are labeled. The rest should undergo an annotation-labeling process. The necessity for the creation of automatic annotation algorithms gave birth to label propagation and semi-supervised learning. In this study, basic concepts in graph-based label propagation methods are discussed. Methods for proper graph construction based on the structure of the available data and label inference methods for spreading label information from a few labeled data to a larger set of unlabeled data are reviewed. Applications of label propagation algorithms in digital media, as well as evaluation metrics for measuring their performance, are presented.","author":["Olga Zoidi","Eftychia Fotiadou","Nikos Nikolaidis","Ioannis Pitas"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 47","Issue 3","April 2015","Article No.: 48","pp   1\u201335","https://doi.org/10.1145/2700381"],"date":"01 April 2015","ref":[{"text":"M.

However, almost all popular signature schemes are either based on the factoring assumption (RSA) or the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem (DSA/ECDSA). In the case of classical cryptanalytic advances or progress on the development of quantum computers, the hardness of these closely related problems might be seriously weakened. A potential alternative approach is the construction of signature schemes based on the hardness of certain lattice problems that are assumed to be intractable by quantum computers. Due to significant research advancements in recent years, lattice-based schemes have now become practical and appear to be a very viable alternative to number-theoretic cryptography. In this article, we focus on recent developments and the current state of the art in lattice-based digital signatures and provide a comprehensive survey discussing signature schemes with respect to practicality. Additionally, we discuss future research areas that are essential for the continued development of lattice-based cryptography.","author":["James Howe","Thomas P\u00f6ppelmann","M\u00e1ire O'neill","Elizabeth O'sullivan","Tim G\u00fcneysu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 14","Issue 3","May 2015","Article No.: 41","pp   1\u201324","https://doi.org/10.1145/2724713"],"date":"21 April 2015","ref":[{"text":"Michel Abdalla, Jee Hea An, Mihir Bellare, and Chanathip Namprempre. 2002.

Existing methods only focus on defining event-specific concepts for a small number of pre-defined events, but cannot handle novel unseen events. This motivates us to build a large scale event-specific concept library that covers as many real-world events and their concepts as possible. Specifically, we choose WikiHow, an online forum containing a large number of how-to articles on human daily life events. We perform a coarse-to-fine event discovery process and discover 500 events from WikiHow articles. Then we use each event name as query to search YouTube and discover event-specific concepts from the tags of returned videos. After an automatic filter process, we end up with 95,321 videos and 4,490 concepts. We train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on the 95,321 videos over the 500 events, and use the model to extract deep learning feature from video content. With the learned deep learning feature, we train 4,490 binary SVM classifiers as the event-specific concept library. The concepts and events are further organized in a hierarchical structure defined by WikiHow, and the resultant concept library is called EventNet. Finally, the EventNet concept library is used to generate concept based representation of event videos. To the best of our knowledge, EventNet represents the first video event ontology that organizes events and their concepts into a semantic structure. It offers great potential for event retrieval and browsing. Extensive experiments over the zero-shot event retrieval task when no training samples are available show that the proposed EventNet concept library consistently and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (such as the 20K ImageNet concepts trained with CNN) by a large margin up to 207%. We will also show that EventNet structure can help users find relevant concepts for novel event queries that cannot be well handled by conventional text based semantic analysis alone. The unique two-step approach of first applying event detection models followed by detection of event-specific concepts also provides great potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of Event Recounting since only a very small number of event-specific concept classifiers need to be fired after event detection.","author":["Guangnan Ye","Yitong Li","Hongliang Xu","Dong Liu","Shih-Fu Chang"],"issue":["MM '15: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2015","Pages   471\u2013480","https://doi.org/10.1145/2733373.2806221"],"date":"13 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/med.cfm.","order":1},{"text":"http://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page.","order":2},{"text":"T.

Recent results make a promising case for augmenting an oversubscribed network with reconfigurable inter-rack wireless or optical links. Inspired by the promise of reconfigurability, this paper presents FireFly, an inter-rack network solution that pushes DC network design to the extreme on three key fronts: (1) all links are reconfigurable; (2) all links are wireless; and (3) non top-of-rack switches are eliminated altogether. This vision, if realized, can offer significant benefits in terms of increased flexibility, reduced equipment cost, and minimal cabling complexity. In order to achieve this vision, we need to look beyond traditional RF wireless solutions due to their interference footprint which limits range and data rates. Thus, we make the case for using free-space optics (FSO). We demonstrate the viability of this architecture by (a) building a proof-of-concept prototype of a steerable small form factor FSO device using commodity components and (b) developing practical heuristics to address algorithmic and system-level challenges in network design and management.","author":["Navid Hamedazimi","Zafar Qazi","Himanshu Gupta","Vyas Sekar","Samir R.

It implements arithmetic operations by extremely simple and low-power hardware. Despite major new applications, SC's theory and design requirements are poorly understood. We observe that the Boolean functions used in SC take the form f(X) = f(Xv;Xc), where Xv and Xc are inputs with variable and constant probabilities, respectively. Different functions can be equivalent in the sense of implying the same stochastic behavior. We define stochastic equivalence classes (SECs), and investigate their properties and applications. Suitably interpreted, SECs describe all realizable arithmetic functions of interest. While conventional synthesis focuses on finding the best circuit to implement a known function, stochastic circuit optimization first requires finding the best function. We present an SEC-based approach to this problem, which demonstrates the computational richness of SC and leads to significant cost reductions compared to prior designs.","author":["Te-Hsuan Chen","John P.

However, moving powerful processing unit into the CMOS-incompatible DRAM chips is not cost-effective for large capacity memory. In this work, we observe that Non-Volatile Memory is often naturally incorporated with basic logics like Data Comparison Write or Flip-n-Write modules that are essential for cell SET/REST operation. In contrast to other conventional PIM or Near Data Computing (NDC) architectures, ProPRAM, as a typical Active NVM, abandons the design approach of moving accelerators or customized processors into memory devices, but begins with exploiting the existing resources inside the memory chips to accelerate the key non-compute-intensive functions for emerging big data applications. With slight hardware and architectural modification, we succeed to expose the transparent peripheral logics to the application layer through instruction set extension and exploit them for in-field bulk data processing with limited hardware cost. Compared to conventional CPU-centric systems, ProPRAM achieves an excellent optimization on energy-efficiency (15x) for important data-intensive micro-benchmarks and kernels.","author":["Ying Wang","Yinhe Han","Lei Zhang","Huawei Li","Xiaowei Li"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 47","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744896"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"M.

We observe that the inherent classification difficulty varies widely across inputs in real-world datasets; only a small fraction of the inputs truly require the full computational effort of the classifier, while the large majority can be classified correctly with very low effort. Yet, state-of-the-art classification algorithms expend equal effort on all inputs, irrespective of their difficulty. To address this inefficiency, we introduce the concept of scalable-effort classifiers, or classifiers that dynamically adjust their computational effort depending on the difficulty of the input data, while maintaining the same level of accuracy. Scalable effort classifiers are constructed by utilizing a chain of classifiers with increasing levels of complexity (and accuracy). Scalable effort execution is achieved by modulating the number of stages used for classifying a given input. Every stage in the chain contains an ensemble of biased classifiers, where each biased classifier is trained to detect a single class more accurately. The degree of consensus between the biased classifiers' outputs is used to decide whether classification can be terminated at the current stage or not. Our methodology thus allows us to transform any given classification algorithm into a scalable-effort chain. We build scalable-effort versions of 8 popular recognition applications using 3 different classification algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that scalable-effort classifiers yield 2.79x reduction in average operations per input, which translates to 2.3x and 1.5x improvement in energy for hardware and software implementations, respectively.","author":["Swagath Venkataramani","Anand Raghunathan","Jie Liu","Mohammed Shoaib"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 67","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744904"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"P.

In this paper, we propose a just-in-time GC technique, called JIT-GC, which invokes background GC operations only when necessary depending on future write demands. JIT-GC was motivated by our measurement study, which strongly suggested that deciding when to invoke background GC operations is a key parameter for efficient GC. By accurately estimating the amount of future SSD writes, JIT-GC can choose the best time to invoke a background GC operation. JIT-GC reserves necessary free space in advance so that high write performance can be achieved while it extends the SSD lifetime by preventing premature block erasures. Our evaluations on real SSDs show that JIT-GC can achieve both high performance and long lifetimes, thus overcoming the shortcomings of existing background GC invocation heuristics.","author":["Sangwook Shane Hahn","Jihong Kim","Sungjin Lee"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 191","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2744918"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"H.

However, frequent unpredictable power failures from energy harvesters bring performance and reliability challenges to traditional processors. Nonvolatile processors are promising to solve such a problem due to their advantage of zero leakage and efficient backup and restore operations. To optimize the nonvolatile processor design, this paper proposes new metrics of nonvolatile processors to consider energy harvesting factors for the first time. Furthermore, we explore the nonvolatile processor design from circuit to system level. A prototype of energy harvesting nonvolatile processor is set up and experimental results show that the proposed performance metric meets the measured results by less than 6.27% average errors. Finally, the energy consumption of nonvolatile processor is analyzed under different benchmarks.","author":["Yongpan Liu","Zewei Li","Hehe Li","Yiqun Wang","Xueqing Li","Kaisheng Ma","Shuangchen Li","Meng-Fan Chang","Sampson John","Yuan Xie","Jiwu Shu","Huazhong Yang"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 150","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2747910"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"S.

The focus is on dark silicon from a thermal perspective: we show that it is not simply the chip's total power budget, e.g., the Thermal Design Power (TDP), that leads to the dark silicon problem, but instead it is the power density and related thermal effects. We therefore propose to use Thermal Safe Power (TSP) as a more efficient power budget. It is also shown that sophisticated spatio-temporal mapping decisions result in improved thermal profiles with reduced peak temperatures. Moreover, we discuss the implications of Near-Threshold Computing (NTC) and employment of Boosting techniques in dark silicon systems.","author":["J\u00f6rg Henkel","Heba Khdr","Santiago Pagani","Muhammad Shafique"],"issue":["DAC '15: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2015","Article No.: 119","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2744769.2747938"],"date":"07 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"M.

In contrast to LDPC codes, good sparse quantum codes are not known, and even to encode a single qubit, the best known distance is O(\u221a{n log(n)}), due to Freedman, Meyer and Luo. We construct a new family of sparse quantum subsystem codes with minimum distance d=n1-\u03b5 for \u03b5=O(1/\u221a{log n}). A variant of these codes exists in D spatial dimensions and has d = n1-\u03b5-1/D, nearly saturating a bound due to Bravyi and Terhal. Our construction is based on a new general method for turning quantum circuits into sparse quantum subsystem codes. Using this prescription, we can map an arbitrary stabilizer code into a new subsystem code with the same distance and number of encoded qubits but where all the generators have constant weight, at the cost of adding some ancilla qubits. With an additional overhead of ancilla qubits, the new code can also be made spatially local.","author":["Dave Bacon","Steven T. Flammia","Aram W.

Reusing those resources for other tasks is rarely done in production services since the contention for shared resources can cause latency spikes that violate the service-level objectives of latency-sensitive tasks. The resulting under-utilization hurts both the affordability and energy-efficiency of large-scale datacenters. With technology scaling slowing down, it becomes important to address this opportunity. We present Heracles, a feedback-based controller that enables the safe colocation of best-effort tasks alongside a latency-critical service. Heracles dynamically manages multiple hardware and software isolation mechanisms, such as CPU, memory, and network isolation, to ensure that the latency-sensitive job meets latency targets while maximizing the resources given to best-effort tasks. We evaluate Heracles using production latency-critical and batch workloads from Google and demonstrate average server utilizations of 90% without latency violations across all the load and colocation scenarios that we evaluated.","author":["David Lo","Liqun Cheng","Rama Govindaraju","Parthasarathy Ranganathan","Christos Kozyrakis"],"issue":["ISCA '15: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2015","Pages   450\u2013462","https://doi.org/10.1145/2749469.2749475"],"date":"13 June 2015","ref":[{"text":"\"Iperf - The TCP/UDP Bandwidth Measurement Tool,\" https://iperf.fr/.","order":1},{"text":"\"memcached,\" http://memcached.org/.","order":2},{"text":"\"Intel\u00ae 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual,\" vol. 3B: System Programming Guide, Part 2, Sep 2014.","order":3},{"text":"Mohammad Al-Fares","doi":"10.1145/1402958.1402967","order":4},{"text":"Mohammad Alizadeh","doi":"10.1145/1851182.1851192","order":5},{"text":"Luiz Barroso","doi":"10.1109/MC.2007.443","order":6},{"text":"Luiz Andr\u00e9 Barroso","doi":"10.5555/2534500","order":7},{"text":"Adam Belay","doi":"10.5555/2685048.2685053","order":8},{"text":"Sergey Blagodurov","doi":"10.5555/2002181.2002182","order":9},{"text":"Eric Boutin","doi":"10.5555/2685048.2685071","order":10},{"text":"Bob Briscoe, \"Flow Rate Fairness: Dismantling a Religion,\"","doi":"10.1145/1232919.1232926","order":11},{"text":"Martin A.

However, because users only check in a few POIs in an LBSN, the user-POI check-in interaction is highly sparse, which renders a big challenge for POI recommendations. To tackle this challenge, in this study we propose a new POI recommendation approach called GeoSoCa through exploiting geographical correlations, social correlations and categorical correlations among users and POIs. The geographical, social and categorical correlations can be learned from the historical check-in data of users on POIs and utilized to predict the relevance score of a user to an unvisited POI so as to make recommendations for users. First, in GeoSoCa we propose a kernel estimation method with an adaptive bandwidth to determine a personalized check-in distribution of POIs for each user that naturally models the geographical correlations between POIs. Then, GeoSoCa aggregates the check-in frequency or rating of a user's friends on a POI and models the social check-in frequency or rating as a power-law distribution to employ the social correlations between users. Further, GeoSoCa applies the bias of a user on a POI category to weigh the popularity of a POI in the corresponding category and models the weighed popularity as a power-law distribution to leverage the categorical correlations between POIs. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation for GeoSoCa using two large-scale real-world check-in data sets collected from Foursquare and Yelp. Experimental results show that GeoSoCa achieves significantly superior recommendation quality compared to other state-of-the-art POI recommendation techniques.","author":["Jia-Dong Zhang","Chi-Yin Chow"],"issue":["SIGIR '15: Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2015","Pages   443\u2013452","https://doi.org/10.1145/2766462.2767711"],"date":"09 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"J.

The tweets from the corpus are represented by two vectors: a bag-of-words vector and a semantic vector based on word-clusters. We propose a distributional representation for words by treating them as the centroids of the tweet vectors in which they appear. The lexicon generation is conducted by training a word-level classifier using these centroids to form the instance space and a seed lexicon to label the training instances. Experimental results show that the two types of tweet vectors complement each other in a statistically significant manner and that our generated lexicon produces significant improvements for tweet-level polarity classification.","author":["Felipe Bravo-Marquez","Eibe Frank","Bernhard Pfahringer"],"issue":["SIGIR '15: Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2015","Pages   743\u2013746","https://doi.org/10.1145/2766462.2767770"],"date":"09 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"L.

However, memory reclamation for lock-free data structures is a significant challenge. Automatic techniques such as garbage collection are inefficient or use locks, and non-automatic techniques either have high overhead, or do not work for many reasonably simple data structures. For example, subtle problems can arise when hazard pointers, one of the most common non-automatic techniques, are applied to many natural lock-free data structures. Epoch based reclamation (EBR), which is by far the most efficient non-automatic technique, allows the number of unreclaimed objects to grow without bound, because one slow or crashed process can prevent all other processes from reclaiming memory. We develop a more efficient, distributed variant of EBR that solves this problem. It is based on signaling, which is provided by many operating systems, such as Linux and UNIX. Our new scheme takes O(1) amortized steps per high-level operation on the lock-free data structure and O(1) steps in the worst case each time an object is removed from the data structure. At any point, O(mn2) objects are waiting to be freed, where $n$ is the number of processes and m is a small constant for most data structures. Experiments show that our scheme has very low overhead: on average 10%, and at worst 28%, for a balanced binary search tree over many thread counts, operation mixes and contention levels. Our scheme also outperforms a highly efficient implementation of hazard pointers by an average of 75%. Typically, memory reclamation code is tightly woven into lock-free data structure code. To improve modularity and facilitate the comparison of different memory reclamation schemes, we also introduce a highly flexible abstraction. It allows a programmer to easily interchange schemes for reclamation, object pooling, allocation and deallocation with virtually no overhead, by changing a single line of code.","author":["Trevor Alexander Brown"],"issue":["PODC '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing","July 2015","Pages   261\u2013270","https://doi.org/10.1145/2767386.2767436"],"date":"21 July 2015","ref":[{"text":"Z.

ESNs can provide employees with various professional services to help them deal with daily work issues. Meanwhile, employees in companies are usually organized into different hierarchies according to the relative ranks of their positions. The company internal management structure can be outlined with the organizational chart visually, which is normally confidential to the public out of the privacy and security concerns. In this paper, we want to study the IOC (Inference of Organizational Chart) problem to identify company internal organizational chart based on the heterogeneous online ESN launched in it. IOC is very challenging to address as, to guarantee smooth operations, the internal organizational charts of companies need to meet certain structural requirements (about its depth and width). To solve the IOC problem, a novel unsupervised method Create (ChArT REcovEr) is proposed in this paper, which consists of 3 steps: (1) social stratification of ESN users into different social classes, (2) supervision link inference from managers to subordinates, and (3) consecutive social classes matching to prune the redundant supervision links. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world online ESN dataset demonstrate that Create can perform very well in addressing the IOC problem.","author":["Jiawei Zhang","Philip S.

Most recent efforts have proposed several efficient methods to learn word embeddings from context such that they can encode both semantic and syntactic relationships between words. However, it is quite challenging to handle unseen or rare words with insufficient context. Inspired by the study on the word recognition process in cognitive psychology, in this article, we propose to take advantage of seemingly less obvious but essentially important morphological knowledge to address these challenges. In particular, we introduce a novel neural network architecture called KNET that leverages both words\u2019 contextual information and morphological knowledge to learn word embeddings. Meanwhile, this new learning architecture is also able to benefit from noisy knowledge and balance between contextual information and morphological knowledge. Experiments on an analogical reasoning task and a word similarity task both demonstrate that the proposed KNET framework can greatly enhance the effectiveness of word embeddings.","author":["Qing Cui","Bin Gao","Jiang Bian","Siyu Qiu","Hanjun Dai","Tie-Yan Liu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 34","Issue 1","October 2015","Article No.: 4","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/2797137"],"date":"24 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"Y.

The first one is \u03b5 -insensitive loss is utilized as the loss function to optimize. Compared to squared loss function, which is the most widely used loss function for dimension emotion recognition, \u03b5 -insensitive loss is more robust for the label noises and it can ignore small errors to get stronger correlation between predictions and labels. The other one is temporal pooling. This technique enables temporal modeling in the input features and increases the diversity of the features fed into the forward prediction architecture.

The concept of network centrality deals with the assessment of the relative importance of a particular node within the network. Most of the traditional network centrality definitions have a high computational cost and require full knowledge of network topological structure. On the one hand, in many applications we are only interested in detecting the top-k central nodes of the network with the largest values considering a specific centrality metric. On the other hand, it is not feasible to efficiently identify central nodes in a large real-world social network via calculation of centrality values for all nodes. As a result, recent years have witnessed increased attention toward the challenging problem of detecting top k central nodes in social networks with high accuracy and without full knowledge of network topology. To this end, we in this paper present a compressive sensing approach, called CS-TopCent, to efficiently identify such central nodes as a sparsity specification of social networks. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our method would converge to an accurate solution for a wide range of social networks.","author":["Hamidreza Mahyar"],"issue":["ASONAM '15: Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining 2015","August 2015","Pages   902\u2013909","https://doi.org/10.1145/2808797.2808811"],"date":"25 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"S.

This paper proposes, for the first time, a framework for modeling the implications of DRAM failures and DRAM error protection techniques on the TCO of a datacenter. The framework captures the Effects and interactions of several key parameters including: the choice of DRAM protection technique (e.g. single vs dual channel Chipkill), device width (x4 or x8), memory size, power, FITs for various failure modes, the performance, power and temperature overheads of a protection technique for a given service and mixes of collocated services. The usefulness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through several case studies that identify the best DRAM protection technique in each case, in terms of TCO. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that among the three DRAM protection techniques considered, there is no one that is always superior to all the others. Moreover, each technique is better than the others for some cases. This underlines the importance and the need of the proposed framework for making optimal memory protection datacenter design decisions. As part of this work, we analyze and report the performance and power with single channel and dual channel Chipkill on real hardware when running a web search benchmark alone and collocated with benchmarks of varying memory intensity. This analysis reveals that the choice of memory protection can have serious performance and TCO ramifications depending on the memory characteristics of collocated services. Other analysis reveals that, for the datacenter and services assumed in this study, when using Chipkill protection it can be beneficial for TCO to use DRAM with 100x the failure rate of a baseline DRAM as long as the cost per DIMM is at least a dollar less compared to the baseline.","author":["Panagiota Nikolaou","Yiannakis Sazeides","Lorena Ndreu","Marios Kleanthous"],"issue":["MICRO-48: Proceedings of the 48th International Symposium on Microarchitecture","December 2015","Pages   572\u2013584","https://doi.org/10.1145/2830772.2830804"],"date":"05 December 2015","ref":[{"text":"J.

Since then, high-performance computing (HPC) system architectures have increasingly incorporated both discrete and fused multi-core and many-core processors. The TOP500 list illustrates this trend: heterogeneous systems grew from a 3.4% to 18.0% share of the list between June 2010 and June 2015. Not only are there more heterogeneous systems on the TOP500 list today, those machines are responsible for a disproportionately large percentage of list's aggregate performance: as of June 2015, the performance share for heterogeneous systems has grown to 33.7%. Part of this shift toward heterogeneous architectures has stemmed from new products in the hardware accelerator market, such as Intel's Xeon Phi coprocessor, and improvements in the approaches for programming such accelerators. Existing approaches such as CUDA and OpenCL have become more powerful and easy to use, and directive-based programming models such as OpenACC, OpenMP 4.0, and Intel's Language Extensions for Offload (LEO) are rapidly gaining user acceptance. The benefits of these hardware and software advances are not limited to HPC; other problem domains such as \"big data\" are reaping the rewards also. The original SHOC benchmarks had adequate support for CUDA and OpenCL for graphics processing units, but did not support more recent programming models and devices. We extended SHOC to support evaluation of recent heterogeneous architectures and programming models such as OpenACC and LEO, and we added new benchmarks to increase SHOC's application domain coverage. In this paper, we describe our modifications to the stock SHOC distribution and present several examples of using our augmented version of SHOC for evaluation of recent heterogeneous architectures and programming models.","author":["M.

Parallel languages offer the benefit of parallelism extraction at multiple levels of granularity, offering effective design space exploration to select efficient single core implementations, and easy scaling of parallelism through multiple core instantiations. However, study of high level synthesis for parallel languages has concentrated on optimization of core and on-chip communications, while neglecting platform integration, which can have a significant impact on achieved performance. In this paper, we create an automated flow to perform efficient platform integration for an existing CUDA-to-RTL throughput oriented HLS, and we open source the FCUDA tool, platform integration, and benchmark applications. We demonstrate platform integration of 16 benchmarks on two Zynq-based systems in bare-metal and OS mode. We study implementation optimization for platform integration, compare to an embedded GPU (Tegra TK1) and verify designs on a Zedboard Zynq 7020 (bare-metal) and Omnitek Zynq 7045 (OS).","author":["Tan Nguyen","Swathi Gurumani","Kyle Rupnow","Deming Chen"],"issue":["FPGA '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2016","Pages   5\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/2847263.2847344"],"date":"21 February 2016","ref":[{"text":"M.

In this paper, we examine two different spatial representations of search results: knowledge graphs and hierarchical trees. Through interaction logs we show that knowledge graphs can effectively reduce the need to read source content with no reduction in the quality of the information gathered by the user. Through qualitative interviews and thinkalounds we explore factors that influence user perception of different search results representations including biases, task, perceived structure of the data, and problem-solving approach. Overall, these results enhance our understanding of the role each of these representations can play in information seeking.","author":["Bahareh Sarrafzadeh","Alexandra Vtyurina","Edward Lank","Olga Vechtomova"],"issue":["CHIIR '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM on Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval","March 2016","Pages   91\u2013100","https://doi.org/10.1145/2854946.2854958"],"date":"13 March 2016","ref":[{"text":"J.

The more conventional approach is to define policies by using logical formulas involving attribute values. Examples in this category include ABAC, HGABAC and XACML. The alternate technique for expressing policies is by enumeration. Policy Machine (PM) and 2-sorted-RBAC fall into the later category. In this paper, we present an ABAC model named LaBAC (Label-Based Access Control) which adopts the enumerated style for expressing authorization policies. LaBAC can be viewed as a particularly simple instance of the PolicyMachine. LaBAC uses one user attribute (uLabel) and one object attribute (oLabel). An authorization policy in LaBAC for an action is an enumeration using these two attributes. Thus, LaBAC can be considered as a bare minimum ABAC model. We show equivalence of LaBAC and 2-sorted-RBAC with respect to theoretical expressive power. Furthermore, we show how to configure the traditional RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and LBAC (Lattice-Based Access Control) models in LaBAC to illustrate its expressiveness.","author":["Prosunjit Biswas","Ravi Sandhu","Ram Krishnan"],"issue":["ABAC '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM International Workshop on Attribute Based Access Control","March 2016","Pages   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2875491.2875498"],"date":"11 March 2016","ref":[{"text":"Information technology - Next Generation Access Control - Generic Operations and Data Structures.

Achieving higher performance on emerging many-core systems is difficult. Previous research has shown that timestamp management is the key scalability bottleneck in concurrency control algorithms. This prevents the system from scaling to large numbers of cores. In this paper we present TicToc, a new optimistic concurrency control algorithm that avoids the scalability and concurrency bottlenecks of prior T/O schemes. TicToc relies on a novel and provably correct data-driven timestamp management protocol. Instead of assigning timestamps to transactions, this protocol assigns read and write timestamps to data items and uses them to lazily compute a valid commit timestamp for each transaction. TicToc removes the need for centralized timestamp allocation, and commits transactions that would be aborted by conventional T/O schemes. We implemented TicToc along with four other concurrency control algorithms in an in-memory, shared-everything OLTP DBMS and compared their performance on different workloads. Our results show that TicToc achieves up to 92% better throughput while reducing the abort rate by 3.3x over these previous algorithms.","author":["Xiangyao Yu","Andrew Pavlo","Daniel Sanchez","Srinivas Devadas"],"issue":["SIGMOD '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data","June 2016","Pages   1629\u20131642","https://doi.org/10.1145/2882903.2882935"],"date":"26 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"DBx1000. https://github.com/yxymit/DBx1000.","order":1},{"text":"Tile-gx family of multicore processors. http://www.tilera.com.","order":2},{"text":"M.

The state of the art in query compiler construction is lagging behind that in the compilers field. We attempt to remedy this by exploring the key causes of technical challenges in need of well founded solutions, and by gathering the most relevant ideas and approaches from the PL and compilers communities for easy digestion by database researchers. All query compilers known to us are more or less monolithic template expanders that do the bulk of the compilation task in one large leap. Such systems are hard to build and maintain. We propose to use a stack of multiple DSLs on different levels of abstraction with lowering in multiple steps to make query compilers easier to build and extend, ultimately allowing us to create more convincing and sustainable compiler-based data management systems. We attempt to derive our advice for creating such DSL stacks from widely acceptable principles. We have also re-created a well-known query compiler following these ideas and report on this effort.","author":["Amir Shaikhha","Yannis Klonatos","Lionel Parreaux","Lewis Brown","Mohammad Dashti","Christoph Koch"],"issue":["SIGMOD '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data","June 2016","Pages   1907\u20131922","https://doi.org/10.1145/2882903.2915244"],"date":"26 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"SC - Systems Compiler. http://data.epfl.ch/sc.","order":1},{"text":"Y.

The proposed STLG can operate at a small terminal voltage of ~50mV, resulting in ultra-low energy consumption. The device-circuit simulation results for common benchmarks show that the proposed STLG circuit can achieve 87.5% and 11.1% energy reduction compared with state-of-the-art CMOS look-up-table (LUT) and Memristive Threshold Logic Gate (MTLG) respectively. The ultra-low programming energy of spintronic weight device also leads to three orders lower reconfiguration energy of STLG compared with MTLG design.","author":["Deliang Fan"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '16: Proceedings of the 26th edition on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2016","Pages   385\u2013388","https://doi.org/10.1145/2902961.2902994"],"date":"18 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"V.

There are many different technologies that can be considered SCM, at different stages of maturity. Examples of such technologies include NVDIMM-N, PCM, SttRAM, Racetrack, FeRAM, and others. Currently, applications rely on storage technologies such as Flash memory and hard disks as the physical media for persistency. SCM behaves differently and has significantly different characteristics than these existing technologies. That means there is a need for a fundamental change in the way we program data persistency in applications to fully realize the potential of this new class of device. Previous work such as [1] focuses on designing a filesystem optimized to run over SCM memory. Other projects such as Mnemosyne [4] provide a general purpose API for applications to use SCM memory. Mnemosyne however, does not provide a transaction mechanism flexible enough to allow different SCM updates spanning different parts of the code to be considered one transaction. Our work is focused on employing minimal changes needed to retrofit an existing key-value store to take advantage of SCM technology. We demonstrate these changes on Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) [3], which is a popular key-value store. We show how Redis can be modified to take advantage of these new abilities by allowing the application to manage its own storage in a unique way. Our approach is to use two types of memory technologies (DRAM and SCM) for different purposes in a single application. To optimize the system data capacity, we keep a minimal dataset in persistent memory, while keeping metadata (such as indexing) in DRAM, which can be rebuilt upon failures. Persistency in Redis is currently performed by logging all transactions to an append-only log file (AOF). These transactions can then be replayed to recover from a failure. The transactions are not made persistent until the AOF file is flushed to disk, which is very slow. Flushing after every transaction has a performance impact, but flushing periodically creates a risk of lost data. By using SCM instead of a disk, we can effectively flush every transaction without impacting performance. In order to change Redis to store data objects on the SCM, we must ensure consistency of persistent data even after an unexpected shutdown. To ensure consistency, a modified version of dlmalloc [2] is used for all allocations done on the SCM, and mfence commands are used to overcome unexpected reordering. We model the SCM using a memory mapped file backed on a ramdisk. We compared our changes to Redis using an AOF backed on a ramdisk. Although we don't take into account the latency overheads of accessing the SCM, this comparison gives us a good upper bound of performance benefits of using SCM memory. Our results demonstrate an average latency reduction of 43% and average throughput increase of 75%.","author":["Yonatan Gottesman","Joel Nider","Ronen Kat","Yaron Weinsberg","Michael Factor"],"issue":["SYSTOR '16: Proceedings of the 9th ACM International on Systems and Storage Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 21","Pages   1","https://doi.org/10.1145/2928275.2933273"],"date":"06 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"J.

But they also pose a significant risk to the privacy of the user, since a curious database operator can follow the user's queries and infer what the user is after. Indeed, in cases where the users' intentions are to be kept secret, users are often cautious about accessing the database. It can be shown that when accessing a single database, to completely guarantee the privacy of the user, the whole database should be down-loaded; namely n bits should be communicated (where n is the number of bits in the database).In this work, we investigate whether by replicating the database, more efficient solutions to the private retrieval problem can be  obtained. We describe schemes that enable a user to access k replicated copies of a database (k\u22652) and privately retrieve information stored in the database. This means that each individual server (holding a replicated copy of the database) gets no information on the identity of the item retrieved by the user. Our schemes use the replication to gain substantial saving. In particular, we present a two-server scheme with communication complexity O(n1/3).","author":["Benny Chor","Eyal Kushilevitz","Oded Goldreich","Madhu Sudan"],"issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 45","Issue 6","Nov. 1998","pp   965\u2013981","https://doi.org/10.1145/293347.293350"],"date":"01 November 1998","ref":[{"text":"ABADI, M., FEIGENBAUM, J., AND KILIAN, J. 1989.

It uses a digital micromirror device (DMD) and mirror assembly combination as a transmitter and a photodetector on top of the rack as a receiver (Figure 1). Our approach enables all pairs of racks to establish direct links, and we can reconfigure such links (i.e., connect different rack pairs) within 12 us. To carry traffic from a source to a destination rack, transmitters and receivers in our interconnect can be dynamically linked in millions of ways. We develop topology construction and routing methods to exploit this flexibility, including a flow scheduling algorithm that is a constant factor approximation to the offline optimal solution. Experiments with a small prototype point to the feasibility of our approach. Simulations using realistic data center workloads show that, compared to the conventional folded-Clos interconnect, our approach can improve mean flow completion time by 30-95% and reduce cost by 25-40%.","author":["Monia Ghobadi","Ratul Mahajan","Amar Phanishayee","Nikhil Devanur","Janardhan Kulkarni","Gireeja Ranade","Pierre-Alexandre Blanche","Houman Rastegarfar","Madeleine Glick","Daniel Kilper"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGCOMM Conference","August 2016","Pages   216\u2013229","https://doi.org/10.1145/2934872.2934911"],"date":"22 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"Collimation lens. http://www.thorlabs.us/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=CFS18-1550-APC.","order":1},{"text":"DLP discovery 4100 development kit. http://www.ti.com/tool/dlpd4x00kit.","order":2},{"text":"Multirate 80km SFP+ optical transceiver. https://www.finisar.com/optical-transceivers/ftlx1871m3bcl.","order":3},{"text":"Optical table with active isolator legs. http://www.thorlabs.us/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=5930.","order":4},{"text":"ProjecToR home page. http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/projector.","order":5},{"text":"SFP+ 10km reach transceiver. http://www.robofiber.com/content/datasheets/SFP-1010-LR-datasheet.pdf.","order":6},{"text":"Sr 300m multi-mode 10g transceiver. http://www.robofiber.com/sfp-1000-sr.","order":7},{"text":"Texas Instruments DLP technology overview. http://www.ti.com/lsds/ti/analog/dlp/overview.page.","order":8},{"text":"Texas instruments store. https://store.ti.com/Search.aspx?k=dlp&pt=-1.","order":9},{"text":"M.

Several recent studies present methodologies to implement M3D designs, but most, if not all of these studies implement top and bottom tier separately after partitioning, which results in inaccurate buffer insertion. In this paper, we present a new methodology called 'Cascade2D' that utilizes design and micro-architecture insight to partition and implement an M3D design using 2D commercial tools. By modeling MIVs with sets of anchor cells and dummy wires, we implement and optimize both top and bottom tier simultaneously in a single 2D design. M3D designs of a commercial, in-order, 32-bit application processor at the foundry 28nm, 14/16nm and predictive 7nm technology nodes are implemented using this new methodology and we investigate the power, performance and area improvements over 2D designs. Our new methodology consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art M3D design flow with up to 4X better power savings. In the best case scenario, M3D designs from the Cascade2D flow show 25% better performance at iso-power and 20% lower power at iso-performance.","author":["Kyungwook Chang","Saurabh Sinha","Brian Cline","Raney Southerland","Michael Doherty","Greg Yeric","Sung Kyu Lim"],"issue":["ICCAD '16: Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2016","Article No.: 130","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967013"],"date":"07 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"S.

To make matters worse, DRAM bandwidth is increasing much slower than per CPU core count, while DRAM latency has been virtually stagnant. Parallel applications that are bound by memory bandwidth fail to scale, while applications bound by memory latency draw a small fraction of much-needed bandwidth. While expert programmers may be able to tune important applications by hand through heroic effort, traditional compiler cache optimizations have not been sufficiently aggressive to overcome the growing DRAM gap. In this paper, we introduce milk - a C/C++ language extension that allows programmers to annotate memory-bound loops concisely. Using optimized intermediate data structures, random indirect memory references are transformed into batches of efficient sequential DRAM accesses. A simple semantic model enhances programmer productivity for efficient parallelization with OpenMP. We evaluate the MILK compiler on parallel implementations of traditional graph applications, demonstrating performance gains of up to 3x.","author":["Vladimir Kiriansky","Yunming Zhang","Saman Amarasinghe"],"issue":["PACT '16: Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation","September 2016","Pages   299\u2013312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2967938.2967948"],"date":"11 September 2016","ref":[{"text":"Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual. http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.html.","order":1},{"text":"Intel Core i7--4790K Processor (8M Cache, up to 4.40 GHz). http://ark.intel.com/products/80807/Intel-Core-i7-4790K-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-4_40-GHz.","order":2},{"text":"OpenMP Application Program Interface 4.0. http://openmp.org/wp/openmp-specifications/, 2013.","order":3},{"text":"M.

Swapping data from DRAM out to NVM, however, can cause large performance/energy penalty and deplete the lifetime of NVM. Traditional swap mechanisms may need to be re-studied. Even through there are several swap mechanisms proposed for the hybrid DRAM-NVM systems, most of them have limited performance without considering the data access features of applications. In this paper, we analyze the data accesses features of different applications. Then, a swap mechanism, called Refinery Swap, is proposed to improve the performance of the system, reduce energy consumption, and increase the lifetime of NVM simultaneously. Refinery Swap presented two algorithms to exploit the data access features of applications and the characteristics of different kinds of memory medias. The swap operations in the system and the writes upon NVM are reduced using Refinery Swap. Extensive experiments are conducted with standard benchmarks. The experimental results show that the lifetime of NVM for the system with Refinery Swap can be 83 times that of Linux Swap. The performance of the system with Refinery Swap can be 17 times that of DR.Swap, the state-of-the-art swap mechanism for hybrid memory embedded systems. Moreover, the energy consumption of the system achieves 17 times lower.","author":["Xianzhang Chen","Edwin H.-M.

However, existing visible light localization systems require customized light hardware, which increases deployment cost and hinders near term adoption. In this paper, we propose LiTell, a simple and robust localization scheme that employs unmodified fluorescent lights (FLs) as location landmarks and commodity smartphones as light sensors. LiTell builds on the key observation that each FL has an inherent characteristic frequency which can serve as a discriminative feature. It incorporates a set of sampling, signal amplification and camera optimization mechanisms, that enable a smartphone to capture the extremely weak and high frequency ( > 80 kHz) features. We have implemented LiTell as a real-time localization and navigation system on Android. Our experiments demonstrate LiTell's high reliability in discriminating different FLs, and its potential to achieve sub-meter location granularity. Our user study in a multi-storey office building, parking lot and grocery store further validates LiTell as an accurate, robust and ready-to-use indoor localization system.","author":["Chi Zhang","Xinyu Zhang"],"issue":["MobiCom '16: Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking","October 2016","Pages   230\u2013242","https://doi.org/10.1145/2973750.2973767"],"date":"03 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"ABI Research, \"Indoor Location in Retail: Where Is the Money?\" 2013.","order":1},{"text":"D.

In this article, we present the hardware implementation of two accelerators for two alternative imaging algorithms that we obtain entirely from SystemC specifications via high-level synthesis. The two algorithms present opposite characteristics that stress the design process and the capabilities of commercial HLS tools in different ways: the first is communication bound and requires overlapping and pipelining of communication and computation in order to maximize the application throughput; the second is computation bound and uses complex mathematical functions that HLS tools do not directly support. Despite these difficulties, thanks to HLS, in the span of only 4 months we were able to explore a large design space and derive about 100 implementations with different cost-performance profiles, targeting both a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform and a 32-nm standard-cell Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) library. In addition, we could obtain results that outperform a previous Register-Transfer Level (RTL) implementation, which confirms the remarkable progress of HLS tools.","author":["Daniele Jahier Pagliari","Mario R.

The accuracy gains these approaches offer make them attractive for the next generation of mobile, wearable and embedded sensory applications. However, state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms typically require a significant amount of device and processor resources, even just for the inference stages that are used to discriminate high-level classes from low-level data. The limited availability of memory, computation, and energy on mobile and embedded platforms thus pose a significant challenge to the adoption of these powerful learning techniques. In this paper, we propose SparseSep, a new approach that leverages the sparsification of fully connected layers and separation of convolutional kernels to reduce the resource requirements of popular deep learning algorithms. As a result, SparseSep allows large-scale DNNs and CNNs to run efficiently on mobile and embedded hardware with only minimal impact on inference accuracy. We experiment using SparseSep across a variety of common processors such as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, ARM Cortex M0 and M3, and Nvidia Tegra K1, and show that it allows inference for various deep models to execute more efficiently; for example, on average requiring 11.3 times less memory and running 13.3 times faster on these representative platforms.","author":["Sourav Bhattacharya","Nicholas D.

In this talk, we demonstrate how the costs for protecting digital circuits against passive physical attacks can be lowered significantly. We introduce a novel masking approach called domain-oriented masking (DOM). Our approach provides the same level of security as threshold implementations (TI), while it requires less chip area and less randomness. DOM can also be scaled easily to arbitrary protection orders for any circuit. To demonstrate the flexibility of our scheme, we apply DOM to a hardware design of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The presented AES implementation is built in a way that it can be synthesized for any protection order. Although our AES design is scalable, it is smaller, faster, and less randomness demanding than other side-channel protected AES implementations. Our first-order secure AES design, for example, requires only 18 bits of randomness per S-box operation and 6 kGE of chip area. We demonstrate the flexibility of our AES implementation by synthesizing it up to the 15th protection order. Beside our theoretical security analysis, we also evaluate the security of the AES implementation with a t-test based side-channel leakage assessments up to the second protection order.

Various network embedding methods have been proposed, but they are only designed for a single network scenario. In the era of big data, different types of related information can be fused together to form a coupled heterogeneous network, which consists of two different but related sub-networks connected by inter-network edges. In this scenario, the inter-network edges can act as comple- mentary information in the presence of intra-network ones. This complementary information is important because it can make latent features more comprehensive and accurate. And it is more important when the intra-network edges are ab- sent, which can be referred to as the cold-start problem. In this paper, we thus propose a method named embedding of embedding (EOE) for coupled heterogeneous networks. In the EOE, latent features encode not only intra-network edges, but also inter-network ones. To tackle the challenge of heterogeneities of two networks, the EOE incorporates a harmonious embedding matrix to further embed the em- beddings that only encode intra-network edges. Empirical experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the EOE outperforms consistently single network embedding methods in applications including visualization, link prediction multi-class classification, and multi-label classification.","author":["Linchuan Xu","Xiaokai Wei","Jiannong Cao","Philip S.

Data partitioning is expensive, in some cases up to 90% of the cost of, e.g., a parallel hash join. In this paper we explore the use of an FPGA to accelerate data partitioning. We do so in the context of new hybrid architectures where the FPGA is located as a co-processor residing on a socket and with coherent access to the same memory as the CPU residing on the other socket. Such an architecture reduces data transfer overheads between the CPU and the FPGA, enabling hybrid operator execution where the partitioning happens on the FPGA and the build and probe phases of a join happen on the CPU. Our experiments demonstrate that FPGA-based partitioning is significantly faster and more robust than CPU-based partitioning. The results open interesting options as FPGAs are gradually integrated tighter with the CPU.","author":["Kaan Kara","Jana Giceva","Gustavo Alonso"],"issue":["SIGMOD '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data","May 2017","Pages   433\u2013445","https://doi.org/10.1145/3035918.3035946"],"date":"09 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"I.

In many applications, such as social networks and RDF-based knowledge bases, information can be modeled as HINs. To enrich its information content, objects (as represented by nodes) in an HIN are typically associated with additional attributes. We call such an HIN an Attributed HIN or AHIN. We study the problem of clustering objects in an AHIN, taking into account objects' similarities with respect to both object attribute values and their structural connectedness in the network. We show how supervision signal, expressed in the form of a must-link set and a cannot-link set, can be leveraged to improve clustering results. We put forward the SCHAIN algorithm to solve the clustering problem. We conduct extensive experiments comparing SCHAIN with other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms and show that SCHAIN outperforms the others in clustering quality.","author":["Xiang Li","Yao Wu","Martin Ester","Ben Kao","Xin Wang","Yudian Zheng"],"issue":["WWW '17: Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web","April 2017","Pages   1621\u20131629","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052576"],"date":"03 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"S.

Can cascades be predicted? While many believe that they are inherently unpredictable, recent work has shown that some key properties of information cascades, such as size, growth, and shape, can be predicted by a machine learning algorithm that combines many features. These predictors all depend on a bag of hand-crafting features to represent the cascade network and the global network structures. Such features, always carefully and sometimes mysteriously designed, are not easy to extend or to generalize to a different platform or domain. Inspired by the recent successes of deep learning in multiple data mining tasks, we investigate whether an end-to-end deep learning approach could effectively predict the future size of cascades. Such a method automatically learns the representation of individual cascade graphs in the context of the global network structure, without hand-crafted features or heuristics. We find that node embeddings fall short of predictive power, and it is critical to learn the representation of a cascade graph as a whole. We present algorithms that learn the representation of cascade graphs in an end-to-end manner, which significantly improve the performance of cascade prediction over strong baselines including feature based methods, node embedding methods, and graph kernel methods. Our results also provide interesting implications for cascade prediction in general.","author":["Cheng Li","Jiaqi Ma","Xiaoxiao Guo","Qiaozhu Mei"],"issue":["WWW '17: Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web","April 2017","Pages   577\u2013586","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052643"],"date":"03 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

Many PUF implementations have been proposed to generate these unique n-bit binary strings. However, they often offer insufficient uniqueness and reliability when implemented on FPGAs and can consume excessive resources. To address these problems, in this article we present an efficient, lightweight, and scalable PUF identification (ID) generator circuit that offers a compact design with good uniqueness and reliability properties and is specifically designed for FPGAs. A novel post-characterisation methodology is also proposed that improves the reliability of a PUF without the need for any additional hardware resources. Moreover, the proposed post-characterisation method can be generally used for any FPGA-based PUF designs. The PUF ID generator consumes 8.95% of the hardware resources of a low-cost Xilinx Spartan-6 LX9 FPGA and 0.81% of a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA. Experimental results show good uniqueness, reliability, and uniformity with no occurrence of bit-aliasing. In particular, the reliability of the PUF is close to 100% over an environmental temperature range of 25\u00b0C to 70\u00b0C with \u00b1 10% variation in the supply voltage.","author":["Chongyan Gu","Neil Hanley","M\u00e1ire O'neill"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 10","Issue 3","July 2017","Article No.: 20","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3053681"],"date":"27 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"Georg T.

An upcoming and especially biocompatible realization are Networked Labs-on-Chips (NLoCs). In NLoCs, small volumes of reagents, so-called droplets, flow in an immiscible fluid in closed channels. An external pump applies a force to this immiscible fluid driving the droplets through the channels of the NLoC. However, the exact flow behavior of droplets in NLoCs physically depends on many factors and interdependencies. This makes it cumbersome to manually determine the taken path of a droplet and the time it needs to pass the NLoC. For the same reason, also almost no automated design solutions exist for NLoCs yet. In this work, we present a discrete model enabling designers and design automation tools to efficiently determine the droplets' path and positions. The precision of the proposed model is evaluated by a systematic examination for basic building blocks of NLoCs as well as for a complete architecture. The resulting model can be used for manual inspections of the droplets' behavior in an NLoC and, additionally, provides the basis for automated design solutions.","author":["Andreas Grimmer","Werner Haselmayr","Andreas Springer","Robert Wille"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 50","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062186"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"D.

However, when inferring primitive-type arrays in HLS designs into on-chip memory buffers, commercial HLS tools fail to effectively organize FPGAs' on-chip BRAM building blocks to realize high-bandwidth data communication; this often leads to sub-optimal quality of results. This paper addresses this issue via automated on-chip buffer restructuring. Specifically, we present three buffer restructuring approaches and develop an analytical model for each approach to capture its impact on performance and resource consumption. With the proposed model, we formulate the process of identifying the optimal design choice into an integer non-linear programming (INLP) problem and demonstrate that it can be solved efficiently with the help of a one-time C-to-HDL (hardware description language) synthesis. The experimental results show that our automated source-to-source code transformation tool improves the performance of a broad class of HLS designs by averagely 4.8x.","author":["Jason Cong","Peng Wei","Cody Hao Yu","Peipei Zhou"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 43","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062208"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"A.

Optimizing memory hierarchy performance requires GPU designers to draw design insights based on the cache & memory behavior of end-user applications. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to get access to end-user workloads due to the confidential or proprietary nature of the software/data. Furthermore, the efficiency of early design space exploration of cache & memory systems is often limited due to either the slow speed of detailed simulation techniques or limited scope of state-of-the-art cache analytical models. To enable efficient GPU memory system exploration, we present a novel methodology and framework that statistically models the GPU memory access stream locality. The proposed G-MAP (GPU Memory Access Proxy) framework models the regularity in code-localized memory access patterns of GPGPU applications and the parallelism in GPU's execution model to create miniaturized memory proxies. We evaluate G-MAP using 18 GPGPU benchmarks and show that G-MAP proxies can replicate cache/memory performance of original applications with over 90% accuracy across over 5000 different L1/L2 cache, prefetcher and memory configurations.","author":["Reena Panda","Xinnian Zheng","Jiajun Wang","Andreas Gerstlauer","Lizy K.

Previous research, however, still follows the traditional computing model with a dedicated storage unit, which actually becomes a bottleneck of the performance of biochips. In this paper, we propose the first architectural synthesis framework considering distributed storage constructed temporarily from transportation channels to cache fluid samples. Since distributed storage can be accessed more efficiently than a dedicated storage unit and channels can switch between the roles of transportation and storage easily, biochips with this distributed computing architecture can achieve a higher execution efficiency even with fewer resources. Experimental results confirm that the execution efficiency of a bioassay can be improved by up to 28% while the number of valves in the biochip can be reduced effectively.","author":["Chunfeng Liu","Bing Li","Hailong Yao","Paul Pop","Tsung-Yi Ho","Ulf Schlichtmann"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 49","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062334"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"E.

Recently, there has been strong momentum to adopt ray tracing--based rendering techniques on consumer-level platforms due to the inability of further enhancing user experience by increasing display resolution. On the other hand, the computing workload of ray tracing is still overwhelming. A 10-fold performance gap has to be narrowed for real-time applications, even on the latest graphics processing units (GPUs). As a result, hardware acceleration techniques are critical to delivering a satisfying level performance while at the same time meeting an acceptable power budget. A large body of research on ray-tracing hardware has been proposed over the past decade. This article is aimed at providing a timely survey on hardware techniques to accelerate the ray-tracing algorithm. First, a quantitative profiling on the ray-tracing workload is presented. We then review hardware techniques for the main functional blocks in a ray-tracing pipeline. On such a basis, the ray-tracing microarchitectures for both ASIC and processors are surveyed by following a systematic taxonomy.","author":["Yangdong Deng","Yufei Ni","Zonghui Li","Shuai Mu","Wenjun Zhang"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 50","Issue 4","November 2017","Article No.: 58","pp   1\u201341","https://doi.org/10.1145/3104067"],"date":"30 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Timo Aila and Tero Karras. 2010.

Since then, each of the major cloud computing infrastructure providers has released services supporting a similar style of deployment and operation, where rather than deploying and running monolithic services, or dedicated virtual machines, users are able to deploy individual functions, and pay only for the time that their code is actually executing. These technologies are gathered together under the marketing term \"serverless\" and the providers suggest that they have the potential to significantly change how client/server applications are designed, developed and operated.  This paper presents two case industrial studies of early adopters, showing how migrating an application to the Lambda deployment architecture reduced hosting costs - by between 66% and 95% - and discusses how further adoption of this trend might influence common software architecture design practices.","author":["Gojko Adzic","Robert Chatley"],"issue":["ESEC/FSE 2017: Proceedings of the 2017 11th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering","August 2017","Pages   884\u2013889","https://doi.org/10.1145/3106237.3117767"],"date":"21 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Gojko Adzic. 2017.

Its success is due to a combination of recent algorithmic breakthroughs, increasingly powerful computers, and access to significant amounts of data. Researchers have also considered privacy implications of deep learning. Models are typically trained in a centralized manner with all the data being processed by the same training algorithm. If the data is a collection of users' private data, including habits, personal pictures, geographical positions, interests, and more, the centralized server will have access to sensitive information that could potentially be mishandled. To tackle this problem, collaborative deep learning models have recently been proposed where parties locally train their deep learning structures and only share a subset of the parameters in the attempt to keep their respective training sets private. Parameters can also be obfuscated via differential privacy (DP) to make information extraction even more challenging, as proposed by Shokri and Shmatikov at CCS'15. Unfortunately, we show that any privacy-preserving collaborative deep learning is susceptible to a powerful attack that we devise in this paper. In particular, we show that a distributed, federated, or decentralized deep learning approach is fundamentally broken and does not protect the training sets of honest participants. The attack we developed exploits the real-time nature of the learning process that allows the adversary to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that generates prototypical samples of the targeted training set that was meant to be private (the samples generated by the GAN are intended to come from the same distribution as the training data). Interestingly, we show that record-level differential privacy applied to the shared parameters of the model, as suggested in previous work, is ineffective (i.e., record-level DP is not designed to address our attack).","author":["Briland Hitaj","Giuseppe Ateniese","Fernando Perez-Cruz"],"issue":["CCS '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2017","Pages   603\u2013618","https://doi.org/10.1145/3133956.3134012"],"date":"30 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Andy Chu, Ian Goodfellow, H Brendan McMahan, Ilya Mironov, Kunal Talwar, and Li Zhang 2016.

The objectives of feature selection include building simpler and more comprehensible models, improving data-mining performance, and preparing clean, understandable data. The recent proliferation of big data has presented some substantial challenges and opportunities to feature selection. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of recent advances in feature selection research. Motivated by current challenges and opportunities in the era of big data, we revisit feature selection research from a data perspective and review representative feature selection algorithms for conventional data, structured data, heterogeneous data and streaming data. Methodologically, to emphasize the differences and similarities of most existing feature selection algorithms for conventional data, we categorize them into four main groups: similarity-based, information-theoretical-based, sparse-learning-based, and statistical-based methods. To facilitate and promote the research in this community, we also present an open source feature selection repository that consists of most of the popular feature selection algorithms (http://featureselection.asu.edu/). Also, we use it as an example to show how to evaluate feature selection algorithms. At the end of the survey, we present a discussion about some open problems and challenges that require more attention in future research.","author":["Jundong Li","Kewei Cheng","Suhang Wang","Fred Morstatter","Robert P.

To accelerate the experimentation and development of CNNs, several software frameworks have been released, primarily targeting power-hungry CPUs and GPUs. In this context, reconfigurable hardware in the form of FPGAs constitutes a potential alternative platform that can be integrated in the existing deep-learning ecosystem to provide a tunable balance between performance, power consumption, and programmability. In this article, a survey of the existing CNN-to-FPGA toolflows is presented, comprising a comparative study of their key characteristics, which include the supported applications, architectural choices, design space exploration methods, and achieved performance. Moreover, major challenges and objectives introduced by the latest trends in CNN algorithmic research are identified and presented. Finally, a uniform evaluation methodology is proposed, aiming at the comprehensive, complete, and in-depth evaluation of CNN-to-FPGA toolflows.","author":["Stylianos I.

However, while these techniques can significantly reduce shading costs, they also reduce shading quality. In this paper we extend coarse pixel shading with a temporal supersampling scheme that notably improves image quality. We derive multiple shading and visibility samples by jittering each frame using a novel sequence that produces a suitable distribution of samples in both the shading and visibility domain, and temporally resolve these samples to enhance the shading resolution and reduce aliasing. We demonstrate a substantial reduction in shading cost compared to checkerboard rendering, which is another temporal supersampling technique widely used in games today.","author":["Kai Xiao","Gabor Liktor","Karthik Vaidyanathan"],"issue":["I3D '18: Proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games","May 2018","Article No.: 1","Pages   1\u20137","https://doi.org/10.1145/3190834.3190850"],"date":"15 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"Kurt Akeley. 1993.

Along this direction, tracking the body movement in 3D space is desirable to further facilitate behavior recognition in various scenarios. Existing solutions attempt to track the body movement based on computer version or wearable sensors, but they are either dependent on the light or incurring high energy consumption. This paper presents RF-Kinect, a training-free system which tracks the body movement in 3D space by analyzing the phase information of wearable RFID tags attached on the limb. Instead of locating each tag independently in 3D space to recover the body postures, RF-Kinect treats each limb as a whole, and estimates the corresponding orientations through extracting two types of phase features, Phase Difference between Tags (PDT) on the same part of a limb and Phase Difference between Antennas (PDA) of the same tag. It then reconstructs the body posture based on the determined orientation of limbs grounded on the human body geometric model, and exploits Kalman filter to smooth the body movement results, which is the temporal sequence of the body postures. The real experiments with 5 volunteers show that RF-Kinect achieves 8.7\u00b0 angle error for determining the orientation of limbs and 4.4cm relative position error for the position estimation of joints compared with Kinect 2.0 testbed.","author":["Chuyu Wang","Jian Liu","Yingying Chen","Lei Xie","Hong Bo Liu","Sanclu Lu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies","Volume 2","Issue 1","March 2018","Article No.: 41","pp   1\u201328","https://doi.org/10.1145/3191773"],"date":"26 March 2018","ref":[{"text":"2017.

The logarithmic multiplier (LM) converts multiplication into addition and has inherent approximate characteristics. A method combining the Mitchell's approximation and a dynamic range operand truncation scheme is proposed in this paper to design non-iterative and iterative approximate LMs. The accuracy and the circuit requirements of these designs are assessed to select the best approximate scheme according to different metrics. Compared with conventional non-iterative and iterative 16-bit LMs with exact operands, the normalized mean error distance (NMED) of the best proposed approximate non-iterative and iterative LMs is decreased up to 24.1% and 18.5%, respectively, while the power-delay product (PDP) is decreased up to 51.7% and 45.3%, respectively. Case studies for two error-tolerant applications show the validity of the proposed approximate LMs.","author":["Peipei Yin","Chenghua Wang","Weiqiang Liu","Fabrizio Lombardi"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '18: Proceedings of the 2018 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2018","Pages   423\u2013426","https://doi.org/10.1145/3194554.3194628"],"date":"30 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"Venkataramani, S., Chakradhar, S.T., Roy, K., and Raghunathan, A. 2015.

Solving this task using only audio as input is extremely challenging and does not provide an association of the separated speech signals with speakers in the video. In this paper, we present a deep network-based model that incorporates both visual and auditory signals to solve this task. The visual features are used to \"focus\" the audio on desired speakers in a scene and to improve the speech separation quality. To train our joint audio-visual model, we introduce AVSpeech, a new dataset comprised of thousands of hours of video segments from the Web. We demonstrate the applicability of our method to classic speech separation tasks, as well as real-world scenarios involving heated interviews, noisy bars, and screaming children, only requiring the user to specify the face of the person in the video whose speech they want to isolate. Our method shows clear advantage over state-of-the-art audio-only speech separation in cases of mixed speech. In addition, our model, which is speaker-independent (trained once, applicable to any speaker), produces better results than recent audio-visual speech separation methods that are speaker-dependent (require training a separate model for each speaker of interest).","author":["Ariel Ephrat","Inbar Mosseri","Oran Lang","Tali Dekel","Kevin Wilson","Avinatan Hassidim","William T.

This graphical data space is viewed through a color raster-scan display which enables users to traverse the GDS surface or zoom into the image to obtain greater detail. In contrast to conventional database management systems, in which users access data by asking questions in a formal query language, a spatial data management system (SDMS) presents the information graphically in a form that seems to encourage browsing and to require less prior knowledge of the contents and organization of the database.This paper presents an overview of the SDMS concept and describes its implementation in a prototype system for retrieving information from both a symbolic database management system and an optical videodisk.","author":["Christopher F.

The designs of state of the art MPI collectives heavily rely on synchronizations; these designs magnify noise across the participating processes, resulting in significant performance slowdown. Therefore, such design philosophy must be reconsidered to efficiently and robustly run on the large-scale heterogeneous platforms. In this paper, we present ADAPT, a new collective communication framework in Open MPI, using event-driven techniques to morph collective algorithms to heterogeneous environments. The core concept of ADAPT is to relax synchronizations, while mamtaining the minimal data dependencies of MPI collectives. To fully exploit the different bandwidths of data movement lanes in heterogeneous systems, we extend the ADAPT collective framework with a topology-aware communication tree. This removes the boundaries of different hardware topologies while maximizing the speed of data movements. We evaluate our framework with two popular collective operations: broadcast and reduce on both CPU and GPU clusters. Our results demonstrate drastic performance improvements and a strong resistance against noise compared to other state of the art MPI libraries. In particular, we demonstrate at least 1.3X and 1.5X speedup for CPU data and 2X and 10X speedup for GPU data using ADAPT event-based broadcast and reduce operations.","author":["Xi Luo","Wei Wu","George Bosilca","Thananon Patinyasakdikul","Linnan Wang","Jack Dongarra"],"issue":["HPDC '18: Proceedings of the 27th International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing","June 2018","Pages   118\u2013130","https://doi.org/10.1145/3208040.3208054"],"date":"11 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"A.

However, the key limitation of prior WiFi based gesture recognition systems is that they cannot recognize the gestures of multiple users performing them simultaneously. In this paper, we address this limitation and propose WiMU, a WiFi based Multi-User gesture recognition system. The key idea behind WiMU is that when it detects that some users have performed some gestures simultaneously, it first automatically determines the number of simultaneously performed gestures (Na) and then, using the training samples collected from a single user, generates virtual samples for various plausible combinations of Na gestures. The key property of these virtual samples is that the virtual samples for any given combination of gestures are identical to the real samples that would result from real users performing that combination of gestures. WiMU compares the detected sample against these virtual samples and recognizes the simultaneously performed gestures. We implemented and extensively evaluated WiMU using commodity WiFi devices. Our results show that WiMU recognizes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 simultaneously performed gestures with accuracies of 95.0, 94.6, 93.6, 92.6, and 90.9%, respectively.","author":["Raghav H.

Hilbert, noting that all of classical mathematics could be formalized within quantification theory, declared that the problem of finding an algorithm for determining whether or not a given formula of quantification theory is valid was the central problem of mathematical logic. And indeed, at one time it seemed as if investigations of this \u201cdecision\u201d problem were on the verge of success. However, it was shown by Church and by Turing that such an algorithm can not exist. This result led to considerable pessimism regarding the possibility of using modern digital computers in deciding significant mathematical questions. However, recently there has been a revival of interest in the whole question. Specifically, it has been realized that while no decision procedure exists for quantification theory there are many proof procedures available\u2014that is, uniform procedures which will ultimately locate a proof for any formula of quantification theory which is valid but which will usually involve seeking \u201cforever\u201d in the case of a formula which is not valid\u2014and that some of these proof procedures could well turn out to be feasible for use with modern computing machinery.Hao Wang [9] and P. C. Gilmore [3] have each produced working programs which employ proof procedures in quantification theory. Gilmore's program employs a form of a basic theorem of mathematical logic due to Herbrand, and Wang's makes use of a formulation of quantification theory related to those studied by Gentzen. However, both programs encounter decisive difficulties with any but the simplest formulas of quantification theory, in connection with methods of doing propositional calculus. Wang's program, because of its use of Gentzen-like methods, involves exponentiation on the total number of truth-functional connectives, whereas Gilmore's program, using normal forms, involves exponentiation on the number of clauses present. Both methods are superior in many cases to truth table methods which involve exponentiation on the total number of variables present, and represent important initial contributions, but both run into difficulty with some fairly simple examples.In the present paper, a uniform proof procedure for quantification theory is given which is feasible for use with some rather complicated formulas and which does not ordinarily lead to exponentiation. The superiority of the present procedure over those previously available is indicated in part by the fact that a formula on which Gilmore's routine for the IBM 704 causes the machine to computer for 21 minutes without obtaining a result was worked successfully by hand computation using the present method in 30 minutes. Cf. \u00a76, below.It should be mentioned that, before it can be hoped to employ proof procedures for quantification theory in obtaining proofs of theorems belonging to \u201cgenuine\u201d mathematics, finite axiomatizations, which are \u201cshort,\u201d must be obtained for various branches of mathematics.

However, this approach poses privacy concerns. The users or service providers with the key have exclusive rights on the data. Especially with popular cloud services, control over the privacy of the sensitive data is lost. Even when the keys are not shared, the encrypted material is shared with a third party that does not necessarily need to access the content. Moreover, untrusted servers, providers, and cloud operators can keep identifying elements of users long after users end the relationship with the services. Indeed, Homomorphic Encryption (HE), a special kind of encryption scheme, can address these concerns as it allows any third party to operate on the encrypted data without decrypting it in advance. Although this extremely useful feature of the HE scheme has been known for over 30 years, the first plausible and achievable Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme, which allows any computable function to perform on the encrypted data, was introduced by Craig Gentry in 2009. Even though this was a major achievement, different implementations so far demonstrated that FHE still needs to be improved significantly to be practical on every platform. Therefore, this survey focuses on HE and FHE schemes. First, we present the basics of HE and the details of the well-known Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) and Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SWHE), which are important pillars for achieving FHE. Then, the main FHE families, which have become the base for the other follow-up FHE schemes, are presented. Furthermore, the implementations and recent improvements in Gentry-type FHE schemes are also surveyed. Finally, further research directions are discussed. This survey is intended to give a clear knowledge and foundation to researchers and practitioners interested in knowing, applying, and extending the state-of-the-art HE, PHE, SWHE, and FHE systems.","author":["Abbas Acar","Hidayet Aksu","A.

Nevertheless, the complete temporal formation process of networks characterized by sequential interactive events between nodes has yet seldom been modeled in the existing studies, which calls for further research on the so-called temporal network embedding problem. In light of this, in this paper, we introduce the concept of neighborhood formation sequence to describe the evolution of a node, where temporal excitation effects exist between neighbors in the sequence, and thus we propose a Hawkes process based Temporal Network Embedding (HTNE) method. HTNE well integrates the Hawkes process into network embedding so as to capture the influence of historical neighbors on the current neighbors. In particular, the interactions of low-dimensional vectors are fed into the Hawkes process as base rate and temporal influence, respectively. In addition, attention mechanism is also integrated into HTNE to better determine the influence of historical neighbors on current neighbors of a node. Experiments on three large-scale real-life networks demonstrate that the embeddings learned from the proposed HTNE model achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods in various tasks including node classification, link prediction, and embedding visualization. In particular, temporal recommendation based on arrival rate inferred from node embeddings shows excellent predictive power of the proposed model.","author":["Yuan Zuo","Guannan Liu","Hao Lin","Jia Guo","Xiaoqian Hu","Junjie Wu"],"issue":["KDD '18: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2018","Pages   2857\u20132866","https://doi.org/10.1145/3219819.3220054"],"date":"19 July 2018","ref":[{"text":"Amr Ahmed, Nino Shervashidze, Shravan Narayanamurthy, Vanja Josifovski, and Alexander J.

Existing approaches usually define the similarity by direct links or common neighborhoods between nodes, i.e. structural equivalence. However, vertexes which reside in different parts of the network may have similar roles or positions, i.e. regular equivalence, which is largely ignored by the literature of network embedding. Regular equivalence is defined in a recursive way that two regularly equivalent vertexes have network neighbors which are also regularly equivalent. Accordingly, we propose a new approach named Deep Recursive Network Embedding (DRNE) to learn network embeddings with regular equivalence. More specifically, we propose a layer normalized LSTM to represent each node by aggregating the representations of their neighborhoods in a recursive way. We theoretically prove that some popular and typical centrality measures which are consistent with regular equivalence are optimal solutions of our model. This is also demonstrated by empirical results that the learned node representations can well predict the indexes of regular equivalence and related centrality scores. Furthermore, the learned node representations can be directly used for end applications like structural role classification in networks, and the experimental results show that our method can consistently outperform centrality-based methods and other state-of-the-art network embedding methods.","author":["Ke Tu","Peng Cui","Xiao Wang","Philip S.

Previously, they are done with heuristics relying on operators' understanding of the workload and environment. Designing and implementing proper TO algorithms thus take at least weeks. Encouraged by recent successes in applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to solve complex online control problems, we study if DRL can be used for automatic TO without human-intervention. However, our experiments show that the latency of current DRL systems cannot handle flow-level TO at the scale of current datacenters, because short flows (which constitute the majority of traffic) are usually gone before decisions can be made. Leveraging the long-tail distribution of datacenter traffic, we develop a two-level DRL system, AuTO, mimicking the Peripheral & Central Nervous Systems in animals, to solve the scalability problem. Peripheral Systems (PS) reside on end-hosts, collect flow information, and make TO decisions locally with minimal delay for short flows. PS's decisions are informed by a Central System (CS), where global traffic information is aggregated and processed. CS further makes individual TO decisions for long flows. With CS&PS, AuTO is an end-to-end automatic TO system that can collect network information, learn from past decisions, and perform actions to achieve operator-defined goals. We implement AuTO with popular machine learning frameworks and commodity servers, and deploy it on a 32-server testbed. Compared to existing approaches, AuTO reduces the TO turn-around time from weeks to ~100 milliseconds while achieving superior performance. For example, it demonstrates up to 48.14% reduction in average flow completion time (FCT) over existing solutions.","author":["Li Chen","Justinas Lingys","Kai Chen","Feng Liu"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '18: Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication","August 2018","Pages   191\u2013205","https://doi.org/10.1145/3230543.3230551"],"date":"07 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mohammad Al-Fares, Sivasankar Radhakrishnan, Barath Raghavan, Nelson Huang, and Amin Vahdat. {n. d.}.

It requires no sensors on the body, and works with multiple people and across walls and occlusions. Further, it generates dynamic skeletons that follow the people as they move, walk or sit. As such, RF-Pose3D provides a significant leap in RF-based sensing and enables new applications in gaming, healthcare, and smart homes. RF-Pose3D is based on a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that performs high-dimensional convolutions by decomposing them into low-dimensional operations. This property allows the network to efficiently condense the spatio-temporal information in RF signals. The network first zooms in on the individuals in the scene, and crops the RF signals reflected off each person. For each individual, it localizes and tracks their body parts - head, shoulders, arms, wrists, hip, knees, and feet. Our evaluation results show that RF-Pose3D tracks each keypoint on the human body with an average error of 4.2 cm, 4.0 cm, and 4.9 cm along the X, Y, and Z axes respectively. It maintains this accuracy even in the presence of multiple people, and in new environments that it has not seen in the training set.

Feature alignment of two domains is the key issue which should be addressed to achieve this objective. Inspired by the recent study of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in domain adaptation, this paper proposes a new model based on Generative Adversarial Network, named Hierarchical Adversarial Deep Network (HADN), which jointly optimizes the feature-level and pixel-level adversarial adaptation within a hierarchical network structure. Specifically, the hierarchical network structure ensures that the knowledge from pixel-level adversarial adaptation can be back propagated to facilitate the feature-level adaptation, which achieves a better feature alignment under the constraint of pixel-level adversarial adaptation. Extensive experiments on various visual recognition tasks show that the proposed method performs favorably against or better than competitive state-of-the-art methods.","author":["Rui Shao","Xiangyuan Lan","Pong C.

However, the electrical properties and crossbar structure of memristors make these accelerators error-prone. To enable reliable memristor-based accelerators, a simulation platform is needed to precisely analyze the impact of non-ideal circuit and device properties on the inference accuracy. In this paper, we propose a flexible simulation framework, DL-RSIM, to tackle this challenge. DL-RSIM simulates the error rates of every sum-of-products computation in the memristor-based accelerator and injects the errors in the targeted TensorFlow-based neural network model. A rich set of reliability impact factors are explored by DL-RSIM, and it can be incorporated with any deep learning neural network implemented by TensorFlow. Using three representative convolutional neural networks as case studies, we show that DL-RSIM can guide chip designers to choose a reliability-friendly design option and develop reliability optimization techniques.","author":["Meng-Yao Lin","Hsiang-Yun Cheng","Wei-Ting Lin","Tzu-Hsien Yang","I-Ching Tseng","Chia-Lin Yang","Han-Wen Hu","Hung-Sheng Chang","Hsiang-Pang Li","Meng-Fan Chang"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 31","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3240800"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"P.

The increased popularity of DL applications deployed on a wide-spectrum of platforms (from mobile devices to datacenters) have resulted in a plethora of design challenges related to the constraints introduced by the hardware itself. \"What is the latency or energy cost for an inference made by a Deep Neural Network (DNN)?\" \"Is it possible to predict this latency or energy consumption before a model is even trained?\" \"If yes, how can machine learners take advantage of these models to design the hardware-optimal DNN for deployment?\" From lengthening battery life of mobile devices to reducing the runtime requirements of DL models executing in the cloud, the answers to these questions have drawn significant attention. One cannot optimize what isn't properly modeled. Therefore, it is important to understand the hardware efficiency of DL models during serving for making an inference, before even training the model. This key observation has motivated the use of predictive models to capture the hardware performance or energy efficiency of ML applications. Furthermore, ML practitioners are currently challenged with the task of designing the DNN model, i.e., of tuning the hyper-parameters of the DNN architecture, while optimizing for both accuracy of the DL model and its hardware efficiency. Therefore, state-of-the-art methodologies have proposed hardwareaware hyper-parameter optimization techniques. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive assessment of state-of-the-art work and selected results on the hardware-aware modeling and optimization for ML applications. We also highlight several open questions that are poised to give rise to novel hardware-aware designs in the next few years, as DL applications continue to significantly impact associated hardware systems and platforms.","author":["Diana Marculescu","Dimitrios Stamoulis","Ermao Cai"],"issue":["ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2018","Article No.: 137","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240765.3243479"],"date":"05 November 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, et al. 2016.

Existing device free human activity recognition approaches and systems, though yielding reasonably good performance in certain cases, are faced with a major challenge. The wireless signals arriving at the receiving devices usually carry substantial information that is specific to the environment where the activities are recorded and the human subject who conducts the activities. Due to this reason, an activity recognition model that is trained on a specific subject in a specific environment typically does not work well when being applied to predict another subject's activities that are recorded in a different environment. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose EI, a deep-learning based device free activity recognition framework that can remove the environment and subject specific information contained in the activity data and extract environment/subject-independent features shared by the data collected on different subjects under different environments. We conduct extensive experiments on four different device free activity recognition testbeds: WiFi, ultrasound, 60 GHz mmWave, and visible light. The experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed EI framework.","author":["Wenjun Jiang","Chenglin Miao","Fenglong Ma","Shuochao Yao","Yaqing Wang","Ye Yuan","Hongfei Xue","Chen Song","Xin Ma","Dimitrios Koutsonikolas","Wenyao Xu","Lu Su"],"issue":["MobiCom '18: Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking","October 2018","Pages   289\u2013304","https://doi.org/10.1145/3241539.3241548"],"date":"15 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Heba Abdelnasser, Moustafa Youssef, and Khaled A Harras. 2015.

These groups work in parallel to maximize performance while requiring significantly smaller communication, computation, and storage per node, allowing the system to scale to large networks. However, existing sharding-based blockchain protocols still require a linear amount of communication (in the number of participants) per transaction, and hence, attain only partially the potential benefits of sharding. We show that this introduces a major bottleneck to the throughput and latency of these protocols. Aside from the limited scalability, these protocols achieve weak security guarantees due to either a small fault resiliency (e.g., 1/8 and 1/4) or high failure probability, or they rely on strong assumptions (e.g., trusted setup) that limit their applicability to mainstream payment systems. We propose RapidChain, the first sharding-based public blockchain protocol that is resilient to Byzantine faults from up to a 1/3 fraction of its participants, and achieves complete sharding of the communication, computation, and storage overhead of processing transactions without assuming any trusted setup. RapidChain employs an optimal intra-committee consensus algorithm that can achieve very high throughputs via block pipelining, a novel gossiping protocol for large blocks, and a provably-secure reconfiguration mechanism to ensure robustness. Using an efficient cross-shard transaction verification technique, our protocol avoids gossiping transactions to the entire network. Our empirical evaluations suggest that RapidChain can process (and confirm) more than 7,300 tx/sec with an expected confirmation latency of roughly 8.7 seconds in a network of 4,000 nodes with an overwhelming time-to-failure of more than 4,500 years.","author":["Mahdi Zamani","Mahnush Movahedi","Mariana Raykova"],"issue":["CCS '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2018","Pages   931\u2013948","https://doi.org/10.1145/3243734.3243853"],"date":"15 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Ittai Abraham, Dahlia Malkhi, Kartik Nayak, Ling Ren, and Alexander Spiegelman. 2017.

Rosetta makes it easy for people to find the information for which they are looking even when using short, imprecise queries. Rosetta indexes research articles based on the way they have been described when cited in other documents. The concise descriptions that occur in citations are similar to the short queries people typically form when searching; therefore, citations make a better basis for indexing than do the words used within a research article itself.

The reservoir network approach is analyzed using a number of metrics, such as kernel quality, generalization rank, and performance on simple benchmarks and is also compared to a deterministic design. A novel re-seeding method is introduced to reduce the adverse effects of stochastic noise, which may also be implemented in other stochastic logic reservoir computing designs, such as echo state networks. Benchmark results indicate that the proposed design performs well on noise-tolerant classification problems, but more work needs to be done to improve the stochastic logic time delay reservoir's robustness for regression problems. In addition, we show that the stochastic design can significantly reduce area cost if the conversion between binary and stochastic representations is implemented efficiently.","author":["Lisa Loomis","Nathan McDonald","Cory Merkel"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 14","Issue 4","December 2018","Article No.: 46","pp   1\u201315","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269984"],"date":"01 December 2018","ref":[{"text":"H.

However, with the emergence of network slicing as a key feature of 5G, creating larger scale infrastructures capable of supporting virtualized end-to-end mobile network services is of paramount importance for experimentation. In this work, we describe our experience in building such a prototype cross-domain testbed targeting 5G use cases, by enabling multi-tenancy through the virtualization of the underlying infrastructure. The capabilities of the testbed are demonstrated through the use case of neutral-host indoor small-cell deployments, followed by a discussion on the challenges we faced while building the testbed, which open up new research opportunities in this space.","author":["Xenofon Foukas","Fragkiskos Sardis","Fox Foster","Mahesh K.

While many recent works have studied homogeneous, heterogeneous, and attributed networks embedding, there are few works that have collectively solved these challenges in heterogeneous networks. In this paper, we address them by developing a Semantic-aware Heterogeneous Network Embedding model (SHNE). SHNE performs joint optimization of heterogeneous SkipGram and deep semantic encoding for capturing both heterogeneous structural closeness and unstructured semantic relations among all nodes, as function of node content, that exist in the network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHNE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various heterogeneous network mining tasks, such as link prediction, document retrieval, node recommendation, relevance search, and class visualization.","author":["Chuxu Zhang","Ananthram Swami","Nitesh V.

However, capturing such affinities is of great importance to the success of many real-world attributed network applications, such as attribute inference and user profiling. Accordingly, in this paper, we introduce a Co-embedding model for Attributed Networks (CAN), which learns low-dimensional representations of both attributes and nodes in the same semantic space such that the affinities between them can be effectively captured and measured. To obtain high-quality embeddings, we propose a variational auto-encoder that embeds each node and attribute with means and variances of Gaussian distributions. Experimental results on real-world networks demonstrate that our model yields excellent performance in a number of applications compared with state-of-the-art techniques.","author":["Zaiqiao Meng","Shangsong Liang","Hongyan Bao","Xiangliang Zhang"],"issue":["WSDM '19: Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","January 2019","Pages   393\u2013401","https://doi.org/10.1145/3289600.3291015"],"date":"30 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Mart'in Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, et almbox. 2016.

Unlike previous works that present the equivalence for the approaches from a skip-gram model perspective, we provide a more fundamental connection from an optimization (objective function) perspective. We demonstrate that matrix factorization is equivalent to optimizing two objectives: one is for bringing together the embeddings of similar nodes; the other is for separating the embeddings of distant nodes. The matrix to be factorized has a general form: S-\u03b2. The elements of $\\mathbfS $ indicate pairwise node similarities. They can be based on any user-defined similarity/distance measure or learned from random walks on networks. The shift number \u03b2 is related to a parameter that balances the two objectives. More importantly, the resulting embeddings are sensitive to \u03b2 and we can improve the embeddings by tuning \u03b2. Experiments show that matrix factorization based on a new proposed similarity measure and \u03b2-tuning strategy significantly outperforms existing matrix factorization approaches on a range of benchmark networks.","author":["Xin Liu","Tsuyoshi Murata","Kyoung-Sook Kim","Chatchawan Kotarasu","Chenyi Zhuang"],"issue":["WSDM '19: Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","January 2019","Pages   375\u2013383","https://doi.org/10.1145/3289600.3291029"],"date":"30 January 2019","ref":[{"text":"Amr Ahmed, Nino Shervashidze, Shravan Narayanamurthy, Vanja Josifovski, and Alexander J Smola. 2013.

Unlike the standard convolutional neural network, graph convolutional neural networks perform the convolutional operation on the graph data. Compared with the generic data, the graph data possess the similarity information between different nodes. Thus, it is important to preserve this kind of similarity information in the hidden layers of graph convolutional neural networks. However, existing works fail to do that. On the other hand, it is challenging to enforce the hidden layers to preserve the similarity relationship. To address this issue, we propose a novel CRF layer for graph convolutional neural networks to encourage similar nodes to have similar hidden features. In this way, the similarity information can be preserved explicitly. In addition, the proposed CRF layer is easy to compute and optimize. Therefore, it can be easily inserted into existing graph convolutional neural networks to improve their performance. At last, extensive experimental results have verified the effectiveness of our proposed CRF layer.","author":["Hongchang Gao","Jian Pei","Heng Huang"],"issue":["KDD '19: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining","July 2019","Pages   276\u2013284","https://doi.org/10.1145/3292500.3330888"],"date":"25 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"Rie K Ando and Tong Zhang. 2007.

Coded computation techniques leverage coding theory to inject computational redundancy and mitigate stragglers in distributed computations. In this paper, we propose a dynamic workload distribution strategy for coded computation called Slack Squeeze Coded Computation (S2C2). S2C2 squeezes the compute slack (i.e., overhead) that is built into the coded computing frameworks by efficiently assigning work for all fast and slow nodes according to their speeds and without needing to re-distribute data. We implement an LSTM-based speed prediction algorithm to predict speeds of compute nodes. We evaluate S2C2 on linear algebraic algorithms, gradient descent, graph ranking, and graph filtering algorithms. We demonstrate 19% to 39% reduction in total computation latency using S2C2 compared to job replication and coded computation. We further show how S2C2 can be applied beyond matrix-vector multiplication.","author":["Krishna Giri Narra","Zhifeng Lin","Mehrdad Kiamari","Salman Avestimehr","Murali Annavaram"],"issue":["SC '19: Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2019","Article No.: 14","Pages   1\u201316","https://doi.org/10.1145/3295500.3356170"],"date":"17 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"2000.

In this paper, we present a novel Multi-objective Indoor Localization Service (MILoS) that provides a fine-grained, energy-efficient indoor localization using only a subset of WiFi-based localization data on the client-side, maintaining user's privacy at the same time. MILoS follows a fingerprinting-based indoor localization model that concurrently optimizes several conflicting objectives (i.e., minimizes the smartphone's energy consumption and maximizes the area coverage induced by WiFi fingerprints importance), using a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D). To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the WiFi fingerprinting approach is used in a Multi-Objective Optimization setting for indoor localization. We assess our proposed model using real datasets and realistic mobility scenarios.","author":["Andreas Konstantinidis","Aphrodite Demetriades","Savvas Pericleous"],"issue":["SAC '19: Proceedings of the 34th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing","April 2019","Pages   1174\u20131181","https://doi.org/10.1145/3297280.3297395"],"date":"08 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"A.

One of the principles in designing cloud-native applications is called Single Concern Principle, which suggests that each container should handle a single responsibility well. In this paper, we propose X-Containers as a new security paradigm for isolating single-concerned cloud-native containers. Each container is run with a Library OS (LibOS) that supports multi-processing for concurrency and compatibility. A minimal exokernel ensures strong isolation with small kernel attack surface. We show an implementation of the X-Containers architecture that leverages Xen paravirtualization (PV) to turn Linux kernel into a LibOS. Doing so results in a highly efficient LibOS platform that does not require hardware-assisted virtualization, improves inter-container isolation, and supports binary compatibility and multi-processing. By eliminating some security barriers such as seccomp and Meltdown patch, X-Containers have up to 27X higher raw system call throughput compared to Docker containers, while also achieving competitive or superior performance on various benchmarks compared to recent container platforms such as Google's gVisor and Intel's Clear Containers.","author":["Zhiming Shen","Zhen Sun","Gur-Eyal Sela","Eugene Bagdasaryan","Christina Delimitrou","Robbert Van Renesse","Hakim Weatherspoon"],"issue":["ASPLOS '19: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","April 2019","Pages   121\u2013135","https://doi.org/10.1145/3297858.3304016"],"date":"04 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"2005.

Current QC implementations are prone to noise and variability which affect their reliability, and yet with less than 80 quantum bits (qubits) total, they are too resource-constrained to implement error correction. The term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) refers to these current and near-term systems of 1000 qubits or less. Given NISQ's severe resource constraints, low reliability, and high variability in physical characteristics such as coherence time or error rates, it is of pressing importance to map computations onto them in ways that use resources efficiently and maximize the likelihood of successful runs. This paper proposes and evaluates backend compiler approaches to map and optimize high-level QC programs to execute with high reliability on NISQ systems with diverse hardware characteristics. Our techniques all start from an LLVM intermediate representation of the quantum program (such as would be generated from high-level QC languages like Scaffold) and generate QC executables runnable on the IBM Q public QC machine. We then use this framework to implement and evaluate several optimal and heuristic mapping methods. These methods vary in how they account for the availability of dynamic machine calibration data, the relative importance of various noise parameters, the different possible routing strategies, and the relative importance of compile-time scalability versus runtime success. Using real-system measurements, we show that fine grained spatial and temporal variations in hardware parameters can be exploited to obtain an average 2.9x (and up to 18x) improvement in program success rate over the industry standard IBM Qiskit compiler. Despite small qubit counts, NISQ systems will soon be large enough to demonstrate \"quantum supremacy\", i.e., an advantage over classical computing. Tools like ours provide significant improvements in program reliability and execution time, and offer high leverage in accelerating progress towards quantum supremacy.","author":["Prakash Murali","Jonathan M.

This work leverages this unique feature and presents a method to increase the search space of fault-tolerant hardware accelerators. The proposed method is based on a two-stage approach that automatically generates Pareto-optimal configurations for the hardware accelerators with different area, performance and reliability to mitigate the effect of soft errors. The first stage performs a source-to-source transformation on the behavioral description to annotate the N-modular redundancy directly at the source code including the voter, while the second stage then performs a HLS design space exploration (DSE) on this newly obtained behavioral description. Compared to performing the exploration on a single module and then replicating the accelerator N times, the proposed exploration strategy leads to a much richer search space. Experiments show that our proposed method leads to better results compared to the state-of-the-art by expanding the search space considerably.","author":["Zhiqi Zhu","Farah Naz Taher","Benjamin Carrion Schafer"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '19: Proceedings of the 2019 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2019","Pages   291\u2013294","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299874.3318020"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Agoston E Eiben, P-E Raue, and Zs Ruttkay. 1994.

Would DL help push physical design toward a more intelligent paradigm to meet the post-Moore era design automation challenges? We will discuss several supervised deep learning models and our works applying these models in physical design and related EDA domains. In addition to supervised learning, we will also illustrate that reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning with deep learning can be applied to design automation tasks. Furthermore, we will show the potential of GPU accelerated physical design with an example of placement engines implemented with deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. With deep learning and GPU accelerated algorithms, we could make physical design more intelligent.","author":["Haoxing Ren"],"issue":["ISPD '19: Proceedings of the 2019 International Symposium on Physical Design","April 2019","Pages   91\u201392","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299902.3311066"],"date":"04 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"Irwan Bello, Hieu Pham, Quoc V.

Among various graph embedding models, random walk (RW)-based is one of the most popular and successful groups. However, it is challenged by two issues when applied on graphs with rich texts: (i) sampling efficiency: deriving from the training objective of RW-based models (e.g., DeepWalk and node2vec), we show that RW-based models are likely to generate large amounts of redundant training samples due to three main drawbacks. (ii) text utilization: these models have difficulty in dealing with zero-shot scenarios where graph embedding models have to infer graph structures directly from texts. To solve these problems, we propose a novel framework, namely Text-driven Graph Embedding with Pairs Sampling (TGE-PS). TGE-PS uses Pairs Sampling (PS) to improve the sampling strategy of RW, being able to reduce ~ 99% training samples while preserving competitive performance. TGE-PS uses Text-driven Graph Embedding (TGE), an inductive graph embedding approach, to generate node embeddings from texts. Since each node contains rich texts, TGE is able to generate high-quality embeddings and provide reasonable predictions on existence of links to unseen nodes. We evaluate TGE-PS on several real-world datasets, and experiment results demonstrate that TGE-PS produces state-of-the-art results on both traditional and zero-shot link prediction tasks.","author":["Liheng Chen","Yanru Qu","Zhenghui Wang","Lin Qiu","Weinan Zhang","Ken Chen","Shaodian Zhang","Yong Yu"],"issue":["WWW '19: The World Wide Web Conference","May 2019","Pages   2644\u20132651","https://doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313520"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Amr Ahmed, Nino Shervashidze, Shravan Narayanamurthy, Vanja Josifovski, and Alexander J Smola. 2013.

Recently, Montgomery and Edwards elliptic curves have been used to implement cryptosystems. In particular, the elliptic curves Curve25519 and Curve448 were used for instantiating Diffie-Hellman protocols named X25519 and X448. Mapping these curves to twisted Edwards curves allowed deriving two new signature instances, called Ed25519 and Ed448, of the Edwards Digital Signature Algorithm. In this work, we focus on the secure and efficient software implementation of these algorithms using SIMD parallel processing. We present software techniques that target the Intel AVX2 vector instruction set for accelerating prime field arithmetic and elliptic curve operations. Our contributions result in a high-performance software library for AVX2-ready processors. For example, our library computes digital signatures 19% (for Ed25519) and 29% (for Ed448) faster than previous optimized implementations. Also, our library improves by 10% and 20% the execution time of X25519 and X448, respectively.","author":["Armando Faz-Hern\u00e1ndez","Julio L\u00f3pez","Ricardo Dahab"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software","Volume 45","Issue 3","August 2019","Article No.: 25","pp   1\u201335","https://doi.org/10.1145/3309759"],"date":"30 July 2019","ref":[{"text":"ANSI. 1998.

This poses a severe challenge to the engineer designing the corresponding microfluidic networks. In today\u2019s design processes, the engineer relies on calculations, assumptions, simplifications, as well as his/her experiences and intuitions. To validate the obtained specification of the microfluidic network, usually a prototype is fabricated and physical experiments are conducted thus far. In case the design does not implement the desired functionality, this prototyping iteration is repeated\u2014obviously resulting in an expensive and time-consuming design process. To avoid unnecessary debugging loops involving fabrication and testing, simulation methods could help to initially validate the specification of the microfluidic network before any prototype is fabricated. However, state-of-the-art simulation tools come with severe limitations, which prevent their utilization for practically relevant applications. More precisely, they are often not dedicated to droplet microfluidics, cannot handle the required physical phenomena, are not publicly available, and can hardly be extended. In this work, we present an advanced simulation approach for droplet microfluidics that addresses these shortcomings and, eventually, allows simulating practically relevant applications. To this end, we propose a simulation framework at the one-dimensional analysis model, which directly works on the specification of the design, supports essential physical phenomena, is publicly available, and is easy to extend. Evaluations and case studies demonstrate the benefits of the proposed simulator: While current state-of-the-art tools were not applicable for practically relevant microfluidic networks, the proposed simulator allows reducing the design time and costs, e.g., of a drug screening device from one person month and USD 1200, respectively, to just a fraction of that.","author":["Andreas Grimmer","Medina Hamidovi\u0107","Werner Haselmayr","Robert Wille"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 15","Issue 3","June 2019","Article No.: 26","pp   1\u201316","https://doi.org/10.1145/3313867"],"date":"25 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"Mehran Djalali Behzad, Hamed Seyed-Allaei, and Mohammad Reza Ejtehadi. 2010.

Existing centralized exchange designs are vulnerable to theft of funds, while decentralized exchanges cannot offer real-time cross-chain trades. All currently deployed exchanges are also vulnerable to frontrunning attacks. Tesseract overcomes these flaws and achieves a best-of-both-worlds design by using a trusted execution environment. The task of committing the recent trade data to independent cryptocurrency systems presents an all-or-nothing fairness problem, to which we present ideal theoretical solutions, as well as practical solutions. Tesseract supports not only real-time cross-chain cryptocurrency trades, but also secure tokenization of assets pegged to cryptocurrencies. For instance, Tesseract-tokenized bitcoins can circulate on the Ethereum blockchain for use in smart contracts. We provide a demo implementation of Tesseract that supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and similar cryptocurrencies.","author":["Iddo Bentov","Yan Ji","Fan Zhang","Lorenz Breidenbach","Philip Daian","Ari Juels"],"issue":["CCS '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","November 2019","Pages   1521\u20131538","https://doi.org/10.1145/3319535.3363221"],"date":"06 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"Hamza Abusalah, Jo\u00ebl Alwen, Bram Cohen, Danylo Khilko, Krzysztof Pietrzak, and Leonid Reyzin. 2017.

It relies on fast quadrature with sum factorization on quadrilateral and hexahedral meshes, targeting general weak forms of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations. Different algorithms and data structures are compared in an in-depth performance analysis. The implementations of the local integrals are optimized by vectorization over several cells and faces and an even-odd decomposition of the one-dimensional interpolations. Up to 60% of the arithmetic peak on Intel Haswell, Broadwell, and Knights Landing processors is reached when running from caches and up to 40% of peak when also considering the access to vectors from main memory. On 2\u00d714 Broadwell cores, the throughput is up to 2.2 billion unknowns per second for the 3D Laplacian and up to 4 billion unknowns per second for the 3D advection on affine geometries, close to a simple copy operation at 4.7 billion unknowns per second. Our experiments show that MPI ghost exchange has a considerable impact on performance and we present strategies to mitigate this effect. Finally, various options for evaluating geometry terms and their performance are discussed. Our implementations are publicly available through the deal.II finite element library.","author":["Martin Kronbichler","Katharina Kormann"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software","Volume 45","Issue 3","August 2019","Article No.: 29","pp   1\u201340","https://doi.org/10.1145/3325864"],"date":"08 August 2019","ref":[{"text":"Daniel S.

The proposed Graph-RISE outperforms state-of-the-art image embedding algorithms on several evaluation tasks, including kNN search and triplet ranking: the accuracy is improved by approximately 2X on the ImageNet dataset and by more than 5X on the iNaturalist dataset. Qualitatively, image retrieval from one billion images based on the proposed Graph-RISE effectively captures semantics and, compared to the state-of-the-art, differentiates nuances at levels that are closer to human-perception.","author":["Da-Cheng Juan","Chun-Ta Lu","Zhen Li","Futang Peng","Aleksei Timofeev","Yi-Ting Chen","Yaxi Gao","Tom Duerig","Andrew Tomkins","Sujith Ravi"],"issue":["WSDM '20: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","January 2020","Pages   277\u2013285","https://doi.org/10.1145/3336191.3371784"],"date":"22 January 2020","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, et al. 2016.

The high value of changing this trade-off decision at runtime fueled a decade of combined efforts by industry and research to develop elastic applications. Despite these efforts, the development of elastic applications still demands significant time and expertise from application providers. To address this demand, FaaS platforms shift responsibilities associated with elasticity from the application developer to the cloud provider. While this shift is highly promising, FaaS platforms do not quantify elasticity; thus, application developers are unaware of how elastic FaaS platforms are. This lack of knowledge significantly impairs effective objective-driven design of serverless applications. In this paper, we present an experiment design and corresponding toolkit for quantifying elasticity and its associated trade-offs with latency, reliability, and execution costs. We present results for the evaluation of four popular FaaS platforms by AWS, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and show significant differences between the service offers. Based on our results, we assess the applicability of the individual FaaS platforms in three scenarios under different objectives: web serving, online data analysis, and offline batch processing.","author":["J\u00f6rn Kuhlenkamp","Sebastian Werner","Maria C.

The most popular solution to this task follows the tracking-by-detection strategy that relies on human detection and data association. While human detection has been boosted by deep learning, existing works mainly exploit several separated stages with hand-crafted metrics to realize data association, leading to great uncertainty and feeble adaption in complex scenes. To handle these problems, we propose an end-to-end pose-guided ovonic insight network (POINet) for the data association in multi-person pose tracking, which jointly learns feature extraction, similarity estimation, and identity assignment. Specifically, we design a pose-guided representation network to integrate pose information into hierarchical convolutional features, generating a pose-aligned person representation for person, which helps handle partial occlusions. Moreover, we propose an ovonic insight network to adaptively encode the cross-frame identity transformation, which can cope with the tough tracking cases of person leaving and entering the scene. In general, the proposed POINet provides a new insight to realize multi-person pose tracking in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments conducted on the PoseTrack benchmark demonstrate that our POINet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.","author":["Weijian Ruan","Wu Liu","Qian Bao","Jun Chen","Yuhao Cheng","Tao Mei"],"issue":["MM '19: Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Multimedia","October 2019","Pages   284\u2013292","https://doi.org/10.1145/3343031.3350984"],"date":"15 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Umar Iqbal, Anton Milan, and Juergen Gall.

However, stochastic computing arithmetic requires random bit streams generated by stochastic number generators (SNGs), which account for significant area and energy consumption. Moreover, SNGs' numerical precision needs improvement to reduce errors in stochastic computations [1]. Thus, low numerical precision and high implementation overheads of SNGs can offset the benefits of adopting stochastic computing in PIM architectures. In this paper, we exploit the inherent stochasticity of Phase Change Memory (PCM) cells to design a scalable and area-energy efficient SNG for PCM-based stochastic PIM architectures. Our designed SNG can achieve up to ~300x lower area and up to ~250x lower energy consumption with better numerical precision, compared to the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) based conventional SNG from [2].","author":["Supreeth Mysore Shivanandamurthy","Ishan G Thakkar","Sayed Ahmad Salehi"],"issue":["CODES/ISSS '19: Proceedings of the International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis Companion","October 2019","Article No.: 6","Pages   1\u20132","https://doi.org/10.1145/3349567.3351717"],"date":"13 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"S.

Recent machine learning work has reduced CNNs' compute and data volumes by exploiting the naturally-occurring and actively-transformed zeros in the feature maps and filters. While previous semi-sparse architectures exploit one-sided sparsity either in the feature maps or the filters, but not both, a recent fully-sparse architecture, called Sparse CNN (SCNN), exploits two-sided sparsity to improve performance and energy over dense architectures. However, sparse vector-vector dot product, a key primitive in sparse CNNs, would be inefficient using the representation adopted by SCNN. The dot product requires finding and accessing non-zero elements in matching positions in the two sparse vectors -- an inner join using the position as the key with a single value field. SCNN avoids the inner join by performing a Cartesian product capturing the relevant multiplications. However, SCNN's approach incurs several considerable overheads and is not applicable to non-unit-stride convolutions. Further, exploiting reuse in sparse CNNs fundamentally causes systematic load imbalance not addressed by SCNN. We propose SparTen which achieves efficient inner join by providing support for native two-sided sparse execution and memory storage. To tackle load imbalance, SparTen employs a software scheme, called greedy balancing, which groups filters by density via two variants, a software-only one which uses whole-filter density and a software-hardware hybrid which uses finer-grain density. Our simulations show that, on average, SparTen performs 4.7x, 1.8x, and 3x better than a dense architecture, one-sided sparse architecture, and SCNN, respectively. An FPGA implementation shows that SparTen performs 4.3x and 1.9x better than a dense architecture and a one-sided sparse architecture, respectively.","author":["Ashish Gondimalla","Noah Chesnut","Mithuna Thottethodi","T.

With the development of smart grids, power quality monitoring data, as a key indicator for analyzing and regulating the stable transmission of power grids, is exponentially explosive. In recent years, the performance of deep learning methods in large-scale data fitting has been better and better than that of traditional methods. In this paper, based on the strict time series dependence of power quality data, combined with the Long Short-Term Memory neural network (LSTM) of deep learning algorithm, the prediction performance of several LSTM variants (Stacked LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Encoder-Decoder LSTM) on power quality time series data is researched and analyzed. Different LSTM variants are used for training and modeling. The performance comparison and analysis are carried out on the power quality data collected by a State Grid company. From the verification results, the variants have higher prediction accuracy compared with the standard LSTM network variant structure.","author":["Chen Zhang","Jun Fang"],"issue":["AIPR '19: Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition","August 2019","Pages   171\u2013175","https://doi.org/10.1145/3357254.3357269"],"date":"16 August 2019","ref":[{"text":"Wang ChongQing, Xia Qing, Liu Mei.

FPGA-based DNN accelerators have demonstrated both superior flexibility and performance; in addition, for real-time inference with low batch size, FPGA is expected to achieve further performance improvement. However, the performance gain from the single-FPGA design is obstructed by the limited on-chip resource. In this paper, we employ multiple FPGAs to cooperatively run DNNs with the objective of achieving super-linear speed-up against single-FPGA design. In implementing such systems, we found two barriers that hinder us from achieving the design goal: (1) the lack of a clear partition scheme for each DNN layer to fully exploit parallelism, and (2) the insufficient bandwidth between the off-chip memory and the accelerator due to the growing size of DNNs. To tackle these issues, we propose a general framework, \u201cSuper-LIP\u201d, which can support different kinds of DNNs. In this paper, we take Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a vehicle to illustrate Super-LIP. We first formulate an accurate system-level model to support the exploration of best partition schemes. Then, we develop a novel design methodology to effectively alleviate the heavy loads on memory bandwidth by moving traffic from memory bus to inter-FPGA links. We implement Super-LIP based on ZCU102 FPGA boards. Results demonstrate that Super-LIP with 2 FPGAs can achieve 3.48\u00d7 speedup, compared to the state-of-the-art single-FPGA design. What is more, as the number of FPGAs scales up, the system latency can be further reduced while maintaining high energy efficiency.","author":["Weiwen Jiang","Edwin H.-M.

The proposed bitwise logic-in-memory (BLiM) is targeted at data intensive applications, such as database, data encryption. This work proposes a low-power BLiM approach using the emerging nonvolatile ferroelectric FETs with direct write-back and data-adaptive dynamic sensing interface. Apart from general-purpose random-access memory, it also supports BLiM operations such as copy, not, nand, xor, and full adder (FA). The novel features of the proposed architecture include: (i) direct result-write-back based on the remnant bitline BLiM charge that avoids bitline sensing and charging operations; (ii) a fully dynamic sensing interface that needs no static reference current, but adopts data-adaptive voltage references for certain multi-operand operations, and (iii) selective bitline charging from wordline (instead of pre-charging all bitlines) to save power and also enable direct write-back. Detailed BLiM operations and benchmarking against conventional approaches show the promise of low-power computing with the FeFET-based circuit techniques.","author":["Mingyen Lee","Wenjun Tang","Bowen Xue","Juejian Wu","Mingyuan Ma","Yu Wang","Yongpan Liu","Deliang Fan","Vijaykrishnan Narayanan","Huazhong Yang","Xueqing Li"],"issue":["ISLPED '20: Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","August 2020","Pages   127\u2013132","https://doi.org/10.1145/3370748.3406572"],"date":"10 August 2020","ref":[{"text":"J.

Control flow integrity (CFI) is proposed to repel this threat. However, former implementations of CFI suffer from two major drawbacks: complex offline processing on programs and high overheads at runtime. Therefore, it is impractical for performance-constrained devices to adopt the technology, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation.In this article, we develop a cross-layer approach named basic-block-boundary-based control flow integrity (BBB-CFI) to minimize the overheads of both offline analysis and runtime checking. Our approach employs basic block information inside the binary code and read-only data to enforce CFI. We identify a key binary-level property called basic block boundary, and based on it we propose the code-inspired method where short code sequences can endorse a control flow transition. Our solution enables quick application launching because it does not require control flow graph construction at the offline stage. We only demand a lightweight analysis on read-only data and a small amount of code of the application. According to the experiments, our approach incurs a negligible 0.11% runtime performance overhead with a minor processor extension, whereas it achieves an order of magnitude speedup in pre-preprocessing compared to a baseline approach. Without control flow analysis or recompilation, BBB-CFI still effectively reduces 90% of the attack surface in terms of gadget numbers. Besides this, we show that the Turing-completeness in the libc is unsustainable. Our approach also demonstrates high applicability to many programs, and it is capable of protecting striped binaries.","author":["Wenjian He","Sanjeev Das","Wei Zhang","Yang Liu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 19","Issue 1","February 2020","Article No.: 7","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/3371151"],"date":"07 February 2020","ref":[{"text":"Scoding.de.

People routinely use machine translation for various applications, such as describing symptoms to a foreign doctor and reading political news in a foreign language. However, the complexity and intractability of neural machine translation (NMT) models that power modern machine translation make the robustness of these systems difficult to even assess, much less guarantee. Machine translation systems can return inferior results that lead to misunderstanding, medical misdiagnoses, threats to personal safety, or political conflicts. Despite its apparent importance, validating the robustness of machine translation systems is very difficult and has, therefore, been much under-explored. To tackle this challenge, we introduce structure-invariant testing (SIT), a novel metamorphic testing approach for validating machine translation software. Our key insight is that the translation results of \"similar\" source sentences should typically exhibit similar sentence structures. Specifically, SIT (1) generates similar source sentences by substituting one word in a given sentence with semantically similar, syntactically equivalent words; (2) represents sentence structure by syntax parse trees (obtained via constituency or dependency parsing); (3) reports sentence pairs whose structures differ quantitatively by more than some threshold. To evaluate SIT, we use it to test Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator with 200 source sentences as input, which led to 64 and 70 buggy issues with 69.5% and 70% top-1 accuracy, respectively. The translation errors are diverse, including under-translation, over-translation, incorrect modification, word/phrase mistranslation, and unclear logic.","author":["Pinjia He","Clara Meister","Zhendong Su"],"issue":["ICSE '20: Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering","June 2020","Pages   961\u2013973","https://doi.org/10.1145/3377811.3380339"],"date":"01 October 2020","ref":[{"text":"Uri Alon, Meital Zilberstein, Omer Levy, and Eran Yahav. 2019. code2vec: Learning Distributed Representations of Code.","doi":"10.1145/3290353","order":1},{"text":"Moustafa Alzantot, Yash Sharma, Ahmed Elgohary, Bo-Jhang Ho, Mani Srivastava, and Kai-Wei Chang. 2018.

However, latency, throughput and flexibility of existing hardware implemented SNNs are limited. The conventional rate coding is inefficient in terms of accuracy and latency. Oversimplified SNN models adopted by neuromorphic hardware discard characteristics such as neuron dynamics and filter effects etc., which are critical for neural information processing. Recent research advancements show that the potential of SNN can be better utilized by moving beyond rate-based model and considering temporal information embedded in the spike sequences. However, these works employ complex biologically realistic SNN models, posing challenges to hardware complexity. Furthermore, most existing neuromorphic hardware are developed for specific SNN models, or aiming at replicating biological behaviors. There is a lack of general methodology for SNN design optimization. Novel hardware architecture and systematic optimization techniques are required for efficient FPGA implementation and support flexible SNN models. To address above issues, in this work we proposed a holistic optimization framework for encoder, model, and architecture design of FPGA based neuromorphic hardware. We present an efficient neural coding scheme and training algorithm, which can optimize encoder parameters to enable fast inference. A flexible and hardware-friendly model is proposed, in which SNNs are represented as a network of Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters. Finally, an end-to-end framework is developed to optimize and deploy FPGA implementation. Experimental results show our work achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in various classification tasks, and outperforms various platforms including CPU, GPU and dedicated neuromorphic processors in terms of latency and throughput.","author":["Haowen Fang","Zaidao Mei","Amar Shrestha","Ziyi Zhao","Yilan Li","Qinru Qiu"],"issue":["ICCAD '20: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2020","Article No.: 62","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/3400302.3415608"],"date":"02 November 2020","ref":[{"text":"Anthony Bagnall, Hoang Anh Dau, Jason Lines, Michael Flynn, James Large, Aaron Bostrom, Paul Southam, and Eamonn Keogh. 2018.

It can be very time-consuming to successfully route all the signals of large circuits that utilize many FPGA resources. Attempts have been made to shorten the routing runtime for efficient design exploration while expecting high-quality implementations. In this work, we elaborate on the connection-based routing strategy and algorithmic enhancements to improve the serial FPGA routing. We also explore a recursive partitioning-based parallelization technique to further accelerate the routing process. To exploit more parallelism by a finer granularity in both spatial partitioning and routing, a connection-aware routing bounding box model is proposed for the source-sink connections of the nets. It is built upon the location information of each connection\u2019s source, sink, and the geometric center of the net that the connection belongs to, different from the existing net-based routing bounding box that covers all the pins of the entire net. We present that the proposed connection-aware routing bounding box is more beneficial for parallel routing than the existing net-based routing bounding box. The quality and runtime of the serial and multi-threaded routers are compared to the router in VPR 7.0.7. The large heterogeneous Titan23 designs that are targeted to a detailed representation of the Stratix IV FPGA are used for benchmarking. With eight threads, the parallel router using the connection-aware routing bounding box model reaches a speedup of 6.1\u00d7 over the serial router in VPR 7.0.7, which is 1.24\u00d7 faster than the one using the existing net-based routing bounding box model, while reducing the total wire-length by 10% and the critical path delay by 7%.","author":["Yun Zhou","Dries Vercruyce","Dirk Stroobandt"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 13","Issue 4","October 2020","Article No.: 18","pp   1\u201326","https://doi.org/10.1145/3406959"],"date":"25 August 2020","ref":[{"text":"Vaughn Betz and Jonathan Rose. 1997.

The current article aims to tackle the increased hardware cost of floating-point multiplication units, which prohibits their usage in embedded computing. We introduce AFMU (Approximate Floating-point MUltiplier), an area/power-efficient family of multipliers, which apply two approximation techniques in the resource-hungry mantissa multiplication and can be seamlessly extended to support dynamic configuration of the approximation levels via gating signals. AFMU offers large accuracy configuration margins, provides negligible logic overhead for dynamic configuration, and detects unexpected results that may arise due to the approximations. Our evaluation shows that AFMU delivers energy gains in the range 3.6%\u201353.5% for half-precision and 37.2%\u201382.4% for single-precision, in exchange for mean relative error around 0.05%\u20133.33% and 0.01%\u20132.20%, respectively. In comparison with state-of-the-art multipliers, AFMU exhibits up to 4\u20136\u00d7 smaller error on average while delivering more energy-efficient computing. The evaluation in image processing shows that AFMU provides sufficient quality of service, i.e., more than 50db PSNR and near 1 SSIM values, and up to 57.4% power reduction. When used in floating-point CNNs, the accuracy loss is small (or zero), i.e., up to 5.4% for MNIST and CIFAR-10, in exchange for up to 63.8% power gain.","author":["Vasileios Leon","Theodora Paparouni","Evangelos Petrongonas","Dimitrios Soudris","Kiamal Pekmestzi"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 20","Issue 5","July 2021","Article No.: 39","pp   1\u201321","https://doi.org/10.1145/3448980"],"date":"09 July 2021","ref":[{"text":"IEEE. 2019.

However, new privacy concerns have also emerged during the aggregation of the distributed intermediate results. The emerging privacy-preserving FL (PPFL) has been heralded as a solution to generic privacy-preserving machine learning. However, the challenge of protecting data privacy while maintaining the data utility through machine learning still remains. In this article, we present a comprehensive and systematic survey on the PPFL based on our proposed 5W-scenario-based taxonomy. We analyze the privacy leakage risks in the FL from five aspects, summarize existing methods, and identify future research directions.","author":["Xuefei Yin","Yanming Zhu","Jiankun Hu"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 54","Issue 6","July 2022","Article No.: 131","pp   1\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/3460427"],"date":"13 July 2021","ref":[{"text":"M.

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing","author":["Martin A. Fischler","Robert C.

This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be \u201csigned\u201d using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in \u201celectronic mail\u201d and \u201celectronic funds transfer\u201d systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d \u2261 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.","author":["R. L. Rivest","A. Shamir","L.

The difficulty arises from the mismatch between the synchronous, concurrent processing capability of the hardware and the expressiveness of the lan?guage-the so-called \"semantic gap.\" We attack this problem by using a programming model matched to the hardware's capabilities that can be implemented in any (unmodified) object-oriented lan?guage, and building a corresponding compiler. The result is appli?cation code that can be developed, compiled, debugged and executed on a personal computer using conventional tools (such as Visual C++ or Visual Cafe), and then recompiled without modifi?cation to the configurable hardware target. A straightforward C++ implementation of the Serpent encryption algorithm compiled with our compiler onto a Virtex XCV1000 FPGA yielded an implemen?tation that was smaller (3200 vs. 4502 CLBs) and faster (77 MHz vs. 38 MHz) than an independent VHDL implementation with the same degree of pipelining. A tuned version of the source yielded an implementation that ran at 95 MHz.","author":["Greg Snider","Barry Shackleford","Richard J.

In a system which uses segmentation as a memory addressing scheme, protection can be achieved in part by associating concentric rings of decreasing access privilege with a computation. This paper describes hardware processor mechanisms for implementing these rings of protection. The mechanisms allow cross-ring calls and subsequent returns to occur without trapping to the supervisor. Automatic hardware validation of references across ring boundaries is also performed. Thus, a call by a user procedure to a protected subsystem (including the the supervisor) is identical to a call to a companion user procedure.

But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the \"animator.\" The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.","author":["Craig W.

Image analogies are based on a simple multi-scale autoregression, inspired primarily by recent results in texture synthesis. By choosing different types of source image pairs as input, the framework supports a wide variety of \u201cimage filter\u201d effects, including traditional image filters, such as blurring or embossing; improved texture synthesis, in which some textures are synthesized with higher quality than by previous approaches; super-resolution, in which a higher-resolution image is inferred from a low-resolution source; texture transfer, in which images are \u201ctexturized\u201d with some arbitrary source texture; artistic filters, in which various drawing and painting styles are synthesized based on scanned real-world examples; and texture-by-numbers, in which realistic scenes, composed of a variety of textures, are created using a simple painting interface.","author":["Aaron Hertzmann","Charles E.

VISA was built to evaluate the performance impact on the host operating system of using IP to communicate with peripherals, especially storage devices. We have built and benchmarked file systems on VISA-attached emulated disk drives using UDP/IP. By using IP, we expect to take advantage of its scaling characteristics and support for heterogeneous media to build large, long-lived systems. Detailed file system and network CPU utilization and performance data indicate that it is possible for UDP/IP to reach more than 80% of SCSI's maximum throughput without the use of network coprocessors. We conclude that IP is a viable alternative to special-purpose storage network protocols, and presents numerous advantages.","author":["Rodney Van Meter","Gregory G.

CFS does this with a completely decentralized architecture that can scale to large systems. CFS servers provide a distributed hash table (DHash) for block storage. CFS clients interpret DHash blocks as a file system. DHash distributes and caches blocks at a fine granularity to achieve load balance, uses replication for robustness, and decreases latency with server selection. DHash finds blocks using the Chord location protocol, which operates in time logarithmic in the number of servers.CFS is implemented using the SFS file system toolkit and runs on Linux, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD. Experience on a globally deployed prototype shows that CFS delivers data to clients as fast as FTP. Controlled tests show that CFS is scalable: with 4,096 servers, looking up a block of data involves contacting only seven servers. The tests also demonstrate nearly perfect robustness and unimpaired performance even when as many as half the servers fail.","author":["Frank Dabek","M.

This process is crucial for search engines based on question-answering. Because of the short lengths of queries, approaches based on keywords are not suitable for query clustering. This paper describes a new query clustering method that makes use of user logs which allow us to identify the documents the users have selected for a query. The similarity between two queries may be deduced from the common documents the users selected for them. Our experiments show that a combination of both keywords and user logs is better than using either method alone.","issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 20","Issue 1","January 2002","pp   59\u201381","https://doi.org/10.1145/503104.503108"],"date":"01 January 2002","ref":[{"text":"BEEFERMAN,D.AND BERGER, A. 2000.

These cells are designed to consume extremely low and predictable leakage currents in standby mode. For each cell in a standard cell library, we design two low-leakage variants of the cell. If the inputs of a cell during the standby mode of operation are such that the output has a high value, we minimize the leakage in the pull-down network, and vice versa. While technology mapping a circuit, we determine the particular variant to utilize in each instance, so as to minimize leakage of the final mapped design.We have designed and laid out our modified standard cells, and have performed experiments to compare placed-and-routed area, leakage and delays of our method against MTCMOS and a straightforward ASIC flow. Each design style we compare utilizes the same base standard cell library.Our results show that designs obtained using our methodology have better speed and area characteristics than designs implemented in MTCMOS. The exact leakage current obtained for MTCMOS is highly unpredictable, while our method exhibits leakage currents which are precisely estimable. The leakage current for HL designs can be dramatically lower than the worst-case leakage of MTCMOS based designs, and two orders of magnitude compared to traditional standard cells. Also, a design implemented in MTCMOS would require the use of separate power and ground supplies for latches and combinational logic, while our methodology does away with such a requirement.","author":["Nikhil Jayakumar","Sunil P.

Two energy-aware architectures, Ensemble of Point Solutions method and Reuse of Point Solutions method, are described and evaluated.

At least two reasons account for this trend: the first is the wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications, and the second is the availability of feasible technologies after 30 years of research. Even though current machine recognition systems have reached a certain level of maturity, their success is limited by the conditions imposed by many real applications. For example, recognition of face images acquired in an outdoor environment with changes in illumination and/or pose remains a largely unsolved problem. In other words, current systems are still far away from the capability of the human perception system.This paper provides an up-to-date critical survey of still- and video-based face recognition research. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the studies of machine recognition of faces. To provide a comprehensive survey, we not only categorize existing recognition techniques but also present detailed descriptions of representative methods within each category. In addition, relevant topics such as psychophysical studies, system evaluation, and issues of illumination and pose variation are covered.","author":["W. Zhao","R. Chellappa","P. J. Phillips","A.

The basic idea of these approaches is to estimate a language model for each document, and to then rank documents by the likelihood of the query according to the estimated language model. A central issue in language model estimation is smoothing, the problem of adjusting the maximum likelihood estimator to compensate for data sparseness. In this article, we study the problem of language model smoothing and its influence on retrieval performance. We examine the sensitivity of retrieval performance to the smoothing parameters and compare several popular smoothing methods on different test collections. Experimental results show that not only is the retrieval performance generally sensitive to the smoothing parameters, but also the sensitivity pattern is affected by the query type, with performance being more sensitive to smoothing for verbose queries than for keyword queries. Verbose queries also generally require more aggressive smoothing to achieve optimal performance. This suggests that smoothing plays two different role---to make the estimated document language model more accurate and to \"explain\" the noninformative words in the query. In order to decouple these two distinct roles of smoothing, we propose a two-stage smoothing strategy, which yields better sensitivity patterns and facilitates the setting of smoothing parameters automatically. We further propose methods for estimating the smoothing parameters automatically. Evaluation on five different databases and four types of queries indicates that the two-stage smoothing method with the proposed parameter estimation methods consistently gives retrieval performance that is close to---or better than---the best results achieved using a single smoothing method and exhaustive parameter search on the test data.","author":["Chengxiang Zhai","John Lafferty"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 22","Issue 2","April 2004","pp   179\u2013214","https://doi.org/10.1145/984321.984322"],"date":"01 April 2004","ref":[{"text":"Berger, A. and Lafferty, J. 1999.

However, OMI presents non-trivial challenges to data extraction technology. Sophisticated and highly parameterized navigation and extraction tasks are required. On-the-fly data cleansing is necessary in order two identify identical products from different suppliers. It must be possible to smoothly define data flow scenarios that merge and filter streams of extracted data stemming from several Web sites and store the resulting data into a data warehouse, where the data is subjected to market intelligence analytics. Finally, the system must be highly scalable, in order to be able to extract and process massive amounts of data in a short time. Lixto (www.lixto.com), a company offering data extraction tools and services, has been providing OMI solutions for several customers. In this paper we show how Lixto has tackled each of the above challenges by improving and extending its original data extraction software. Most importantly, we show how high scalability is achieved through cloud computing. This paper also features a case study from the computers and electronics market.","author":["Robert Baumgartner","Georg Gottlob","Marcus Herzog"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 2","Issue 2","August 2009","pp   1512\u20131523","https://doi.org/10.14778/1687553.1687580"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"V.

Graph clustering techniques are very useful for detecting densely connected groups in a large graph. Many existing graph clustering methods mainly focus on the topological structure for clustering, but largely ignore the vertex properties which are often heterogenous. In this paper, we propose a novel graph clustering algorithm, SA-Cluster, based on both structural and attribute similarities through a unified distance measure. Our method partitions a large graph associated with attributes into k clusters so that each cluster contains a densely connected subgraph with homogeneous attribute values. An effective method is proposed to automatically learn the degree of contributions of structural similarity and attribute similarity. Theoretical analysis is provided to show that SA-Cluster is converging. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SA-Cluster through comparison with the state-of-the-art graph clustering and summarization methods.","author":["Yang Zhou","Hong Cheng","Jeffrey Xu Yu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 2","Issue 1","August 2009","pp   718\u2013729","https://doi.org/10.14778/1687627.1687709"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"R.

However, this co-processing requires the data transfer between the main memory and the GPU memory via a low-bandwidth PCI-E bus. The overhead of such data transfer becomes an important factor, even a bottleneck, for query co-processing performance on the GPU. In this paper, we propose to use compression to alleviate this performance problem. Specifically, we implement nine lightweight compression schemes on the GPU and further study the combinations of these schemes for a better compression ratio. We design a compression planner to find the optimal combination. Our experiments demonstrate that the GPU-based compression and decompression achieved a processing speed up to 45 and 56 GB/s respectively. Using partial decompression, we were able to significantly improve GPU-based query co-processing performance. As a side product, we have integrated our GPU-based compression into MonetDB, an open source column-oriented DBMS, and demonstrated the feasibility of offloading compression and decompression to the GPU.","author":["Wenbin Fang","Bingsheng He","Qiong Luo"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   670\u2013680","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920927"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"D.

The traditional notions of graph homomorphism and isomorphism often fall short of capturing the structural similarity in these applications. This paper studies revisions of these notions, providing a full treatment from complexity to algorithms. (1) We propose p-homomorphism (p-hom) and 1-1 p-hom, which extend graph homomorphism and subgraph isomorphism, respectively, by mapping edges from one graph to paths in another, and by measuring the similarity of nodes. (2) We introduce metrics to measure graph similarity, and several optimization problems for p-hom and 1-1 p-hom. (3) We show that the decision problems for p-hom and 1-1 p-hom are NP-complete even for DAGs, and that the optimization problems are approximation-hard. (4) Nevertheless, we provide approximation algorithms with provable guarantees on match quality. We experimentally verify the effectiveness of the revised notions and the efficiency of our algorithms in Web site matching, using real-life and synthetic data.","author":["Wenfei Fan","Jianzhong Li","Shuai Ma","Hongzhi Wang","Yinghui Wu"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   1161\u20131172","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920986"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"Chemistry development kit (cdk). http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdk/.","order":1},{"text":"Stanford webbase. http://diglib.stanford.edu:8091/testbed/doc2/WebBase.","order":2},{"text":"M.

Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) based methods have become a very popular approach for this problem. However, most such methods only use LSH for the first phase of similarity search - i.e. efficient indexing for candidate generation. In this paper, we present BayesLSH, a principled Bayesian algorithm for the subsequent phase of similarity search - performing candidate pruning and similarity estimation using LSH. A simpler variant, BayesLSH-Lite, which calculates similarities exactly, is also presented. Our algorithms are able to quickly prune away a large majority of the false positive candidate pairs, leading to significant speedups over baseline approaches. For BayesLSH, we also provide probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the output, both in terms of accuracy and recall. Finally, the quality of BayesLSH's output can be easily tuned and does not require any manual setting of the number of hashes to use for similarity estimation, unlike standard approaches. For two state-of-the-art candidate generation algorithms, AllPairs and LSH, BayesLSH enables significant speedups, typically in the range 2x-20x for a wide variety of datasets.","author":["Venu Satuluri","Srinivasan Parthasarathy"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 5","Issue 5","January 2012","pp   430\u2013441","https://doi.org/10.14778/2140436.2140440"],"date":"01 January 2012","ref":[{"text":"S.

To help fill this critical void, we introduced the GraphLab abstraction which naturally expresses asynchronous, dynamic, graph-parallel computation while ensuring data consistency and achieving a high degree of parallel performance in the shared-memory setting. In this paper, we extend the GraphLab framework to the substantially more challenging distributed setting while preserving strong data consistency guarantees.We develop graph based extensions to pipelined locking and data versioning to reduce network congestion and mitigate the effect of network latency. We also introduce fault tolerance to the GraphLab abstraction using the classic Chandy-Lamport snapshot algorithm and demonstrate how it can be easily implemented by exploiting the GraphLab abstraction itself. Finally, we evaluate our distributed implementation of the GraphLab abstraction on a large Amazon EC2 deployment and show 1-2 orders of magnitude performance gains over Hadoop-based implementations.","author":["Yucheng Low","Danny Bickson","Joseph Gonzalez","Carlos Guestrin","Aapo Kyrola","Joseph M.

Most approaches that aim at extracting event information from such sources typically use the temporal context of messages. However, exploiting the location information of georeferenced messages, too, is important to detect localized events, such as public events or emergency situations. Users posting messages that are close to the location of an event serve as human sensors to describe an event. In this demonstration, we present a novel framework to detect localized events in real-time from a Twitter stream and to track the evolution of such events over time. For this, spatio-temporal characteristics of keywords are continuously extracted to identify meaningful candidates for event descriptions. Then, localized event information is extracted by clustering keywords according to their spatial similarity. To determine the most important events in a (recent) time frame, we introduce a scoring scheme for events. We demonstrate the functionality of our system, called Even-Tweet, using a stream of tweets from Europe during the 2012 UEFA European Football Championship.","author":["Hamed Abdelhaq","Christian Sengstock","Michael Gertz"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 12","August 2013","pp   1326\u20131329","https://doi.org/10.14778/2536274.2536307"],"date":"01 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"H.

A recent survey [20] has provided a detailed comparison of various fusion methods on Deep Web data. In this paper, we study the applicability and limitations of different fusion techniques on a more challenging problem: knowledge fusion. Knowledge fusion identifies true subject-predicate-object triples extracted by multiple information extractors from multiple information sources. These extractors perform the tasks of entity linkage and schema alignment, thus introducing an additional source of noise that is quite different from that traditionally considered in the data fusion literature, which only focuses on factual errors in the original sources. We adapt state-of-the-art data fusion techniques and apply them to a knowledge base with 1.6B unique knowledge triples extracted by 12 extractors from over 1B Web pages, which is three orders of magnitude larger than the data sets used in previous data fusion papers. We show great promise of the data fusion approaches in solving the knowledge fusion problem, and suggest interesting research directions through a detailed error analysis of the methods.","author":["Xin Luna Dong","Evgeniy Gabrilovich","Geremy Heitz","Wilko Horn","Kevin Murphy","Shaohua Sun","Wei Zhang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 10","June 2014","pp   881\u2013892","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732951.2732962"],"date":"01 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"Z.

Most existing subgraph isomorphism algorithms are based on a backtracking framework which computes the solutions by incrementally matching all query vertices to candidate data vertices. However, we observe that extensive duplicate computation exists in these algorithms, and such duplicate computation can be avoided by exploiting relationships between data vertices. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach, BoostIso, to reduce duplicate computation. Our extensive experiments with real datasets show that, after integrating our approach, most existing subgraph isomorphism algorithms can be speeded up significantly, especially for some graphs with intensive vertex relationships, where the improvement can be up to several orders of magnitude.","author":["Xuguang Ren","Junhu Wang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 5","January 2015","pp   617\u2013628","https://doi.org/10.14778/2735479.2735493"],"date":"01 January 2015","ref":[{"text":"A.

At the same time, consumers of these datasets have evolved sophisticated requirements, such as event-time ordering and windowing by features of the data themselves, in addition to an insatiable hunger for faster answers. Meanwhile, practicality dictates that one can never fully optimize along all dimensions of correctness, latency, and cost for these types of input. As a result, data processing practitioners are left with the quandary of how to reconcile the tensions between these seemingly competing propositions, often resulting in disparate implementations and systems.We propose that a fundamental shift of approach is necessary to deal with these evolved requirements in modern data processing. We as a field must stop trying to groom unbounded datasets into finite pools of information that eventually become complete, and instead live and breathe under the assumption that we will never know if or when we have seen all of our data, only that new data will arrive, old data may be retracted, and the only way to make this problem tractable is via principled abstractions that allow the practitioner the choice of appropriate tradeoffs along the axes of interest: correctness, latency, and cost.In this paper, we present one such approach, the Dataflow Model, along with a detailed examination of the semantics it enables, an overview of the core principles that guided its design, and a validation of the model itself via the real-world experiences that led to its development.","author":["Tyler Akidau","Robert Bradshaw","Craig Chambers","Slava Chernyak","Rafael J.

These systems employ a user-friendly \"think like a vertex\" programming model, and exhibit good scalability for tasks where the majority of graph vertices participate in computation. However, the design of these systems can seriously under-utilize the resources in a cluster for processing light-workload graph queries, where only a small fraction of vertices need to be accessed. In this work, we develop a new open-source system, called Quegel, for querying big graphs. Quegel treats queries as first-class citizens in its design: users only need to specify the Pregel-like algorithm for a generic query, and Quegel processes light-workload graph queries on demand, using a novel superstep-sharing execution model to effectively utilize the cluster resources. Quegel further provides a convenient interface for constructing graph indexes, which significantly improve query performance but are not supported by existing graph-parallel systems. Our experiments verified that Quegel is highly efficient in answering various types of graph queries and is up to orders of magnitude faster than existing systems.","author":["Da Yan","James Cheng","M.

However, neural network inference is computationally expensive at scale: applying a state-of-the-art object detector in real time (i.e., 30+ frames per second) to a single video requires a $4000 GPU. In response, we present NoScope, a system for querying videos that can reduce the cost of neural network video analysis by up to three orders of magnitude via inference-optimized model search. Given a target video, object to detect, and reference neural network, NoScope automatically searches for and trains a sequence, or cascade, of models that preserves the accuracy of the reference network but is specialized to the target video and are therefore far less computationally expensive. NoScope cascades two types of models: specialized models that forego the full generality of the reference model but faithfully mimic its behavior for the target video and object; and difference detectors that highlight temporal differences across frames. We show that the optimal cascade architecture differs across videos and objects, so NoScope uses an efficient cost-based optimizer to search across models and cascades. With this approach, NoScope achieves two to three order of magnitude speed-ups (265-15,500x real-time) on binary classification tasks over fixed-angle webcam and surveillance video while maintaining accuracy within 1--5% of state-of-the-art neural networks.","author":["Daniel Kang","John Emmons","Firas Abuzaid","Peter Bailis","Matei Zaharia"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 10","Issue 11","August 2017","pp   1586\u20131597","https://doi.org/10.14778/3137628.3137664"],"date":"01 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Typical cnn architecture.

We present Apache Samza, a distributed system for stateful and fault-tolerant stream processing. Samza utilizes a partitioned local state along with a low-overhead background changelog mechanism, allowing it to scale to massive state sizes (hundreds of TB) per application. Recovery from failures is sped up by re-scheduling based on Host Affinity. In addition to processing infinite streams of events, Samza supports processing a finite dataset as a stream, from either a streaming source (e.g., Kafka), a database snapshot (e.g., Databus), or a file system (e.g. HDFS), without having to change the application code (unlike the popular Lambda-based architectures which necessitate maintenance of separate code bases for batch and stream path processing).Samza is currently in use at LinkedIn by hundreds of production applications with more than 10, 000 containers. Samza is an open-source Apache project adopted by many top-tier companies (e.g., LinkedIn, Uber, Netflix, TripAdvisor, etc.). Our experiments show that Samza: a) handles state efficiently, improving latency and throughput by more than 100X compared to using a remote storage; b) provides recovery time independent of state size; c) scales performance linearly with number of containers; and d) supports reprocessing of the data stream quickly and with minimal interference on real-time traffic.","author":["Shadi A.

We present Snorkel, a first-of-its-kind system that enables users to train state-of-the-art models without hand labeling any training data. Instead, users write labeling functions that express arbitrary heuristics, which can have unknown accuracies and correlations. Snorkel denoises their outputs without access to ground truth by incorporating the first end-to-end implementation of our recently proposed machine learning paradigm, data programming. We present a flexible interface layer for writing labeling functions based on our experience over the past year collaborating with companies, agencies, and research labs. In a user study, subject matter experts build models 2.8X faster and increase predictive performance an average 45.5% versus seven hours of hand labeling. We study the modeling tradeoffs in this new setting and propose an optimizer for automating tradeoff decisions that gives up to 1.8X speedup per pipeline execution. In two collaborations, with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and on four open-source text and image data sets representative of other deployments, Snorkel provides 132% average improvements to predictive performance over prior heuristic approaches and comes within an average 3.60% of the predictive performance of large hand-curated training sets.","author":["Alexander Ratner","Stephen H.

A fundamental problem in a DSDPS is the scheduling problem (i.e., assigning workload to workers/machines) with the objective of minimizing average end-to-end tuple processing time. A widely-used solution is to distribute workload evenly over machines in the cluster in a round-robin manner, which is obviously not efficient due to lack of consideration for communication delay. Model-based approaches (such as queueing theory) do not work well either due to the high complexity of the system environment.We aim to develop a novel model-free approach that can learn to well control a DSDPS from its experience rather than accurate and mathematically solvable system models, just as a human learns a skill (such as cooking, driving, swimming, etc). Specifically, we, for the first time, propose to leverage emerging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for enabling model-free control in DSDPSs; and present design, implementation and evaluation of a novel and highly effective DRL-based control framework, which minimizes average end-to-end tuple processing time by jointly learning the system environment via collecting very limited runtime statistics data and making decisions under the guidance of powerful Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). To validate and evaluate the proposed framework, we implemented it based on a widely-used DSDPS, Apache Storm, and tested it with three representative applications: continuous queries, log stream processing and word count (stream version). Extensive experimental results show 1) Compared to Storm's default scheduler and the state-of-the-art model-based method, the proposed framework reduces average tuple processing by 33.5% and 14.0% respectively on average. 2) The proposed framework can quickly reach a good scheduling solution during online learning, which justifies its practicability for online control in DSDPSs.","author":["Teng Li","Zhiyuan Xu","Jian Tang","Yanzhi Wang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 6","February 2018","pp   705\u2013718","https://doi.org/10.14778/3199517.3199521"],"date":"01 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,","order":1},{"text":"A.M.

We model the likely contexts of all words in an ASR system vocabulary by performing a lexical co-occurrence analysis using a large corpus of output from the speech system. We then identify regions in the data that contain likely contexts for a given query word. Finally, we detect words or sequences of words in the contextual regions that are unlikely to appear in the context and that are phonetically similar to the query word. Initial experiments indicate that this technique can produce high-precision targeted detection and correction of misrecognized query words.","author":["Arup Sarma","David D.

We introduce an approach of exploiting the semantic structure of a sentence, anchored to an opinion bearing verb or adjective. This method uses semantic role labeling as an intermediate step to label an opinion holder and topic using data from FrameNet. We decompose our task into three phases: identifying an opinion-bearing word, labeling semantic roles related to the word in the sentence, and then finding the holder and the topic of the opinion word among the labeled semantic roles. For a broader coverage, we also employ a clustering technique to predict the most probable frame for a word which is not defined in FrameNet. Our experimental results show that our system performs significantly better than the baseline.","author":["Soo-Min Kim","Eduard Hovy"],"issue":["SST '06: Proceedings of the Workshop on Sentiment and Subjectivity in Text","July 2006","Pages   1\u20138"],"date":"22 July 2006","ref":[{"text":"Baker, Collin F. and Hiroaki Sato. 2003.
