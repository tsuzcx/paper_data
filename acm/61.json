For a given extent measure \u03bc and a parameter \u03b5 > 0, it computes in time O(n + 1/\u03b5O(1)) a subset Q \u2286 P of size 1/\u03b5O(1), with the property that (1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03bc(P) \u2264 \u03bc(Q) \u2264 \u03bc(P). The specific applications of our technique include \u03b5-approximation algorithms for (i) computing diameter, width, and smallest bounding box, ball, and cylinder of P, (ii) maintaining all the previous measures for a set of moving points, and (iii) fitting spheres and cylinders through a point set P. Our algorithms are considerably simpler, and faster in many cases, than previously known algorithms.","author":["Pankaj K. Agarwal","Sariel Har-Peled","Kasturi R.

Given a set of comparable text collections, the task of comparative text mining is to discover any latent common themes across all collections as well as summarize the similarity and differences of these collections along each common theme. This general problem subsumes many interesting applications, including business intelligence and opinion summarization. We propose a generative probabilistic mixture model for comparative text mining. The model simultaneously performs cross-collection clustering and within-collection clustering, and can be applied to an arbitrary set of comparable text collections. The model can be estimated efficiently using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We evaluate the model on two different text data sets (i.e., a news article data set and a laptop review data set), and compare it with a baseline clustering method also based on a mixture model. Experiment results show that the model is quite effective in discovering the latent common themes across collections and performs significantly better than our baseline mixture model.","author":["ChengXiang Zhai","Atulya Velivelli","Bei Yu"],"issue":["KDD '04: Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2004","Pages   743\u2013748","https://doi.org/10.1145/1014052.1014150"],"date":"22 August 2004","ref":[{"text":"D.

We contribute two novel techniques. The first is to use a single Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). The contribution here is to show that the DFA can be used effectively for this problem: in our experiments we achieve a constant throughput, independently of the number of XPath expressions. The major issue is the size of the DFA, which, in theory, can be exponential in the number of XPath expressions. We provide a series of theoretical results and experimental evaluations that show that the lazy DFA has a small number of states, for all practical purposes. These results are of general interest in XPath processing, beyond stream processing. The second technique is the Streaming IndeX (SIX), which consists of adding a small amount of binary data to each XML packet that allows the query processor to achieve significant speedups. As an application of these techniques we describe the XML Toolkit (XMLTK), a collection of command-line tools providing highly scalable XML data processing.","author":["Todd J.

It can amplify subtle motions in a video sequence, allowing for visualization of deformations that would otherwise be invisible. To achieve motion magnification, we need to accurately measure visual motions, and group the pixels to be modified. After an initial image registration step, we measure motion by a robust analysis of feature point trajectories, and segment pixels based on similarity of position, color, and motion. A novel measure of motion similarity groups even very small motions according to correlation over time, which often relates to physical cause. An outlier mask marks observations not explained by our layered motion model, and those pixels are simply reproduced on the output from the original registered observations.The motion of any selected layer may be magnified by a user-specified amount; texture synthesis fills-in unseen \"holes\" revealed by the amplified motions. The resulting motion-magnified images can reveal or emphasize small motions in the original sequence, as we demonstrate with deformations in load-bearing structures, subtle motions or balancing corrections of people, and \"rigid\" structures bending under hand pressure.","author":["Ce Liu","Antonio Torralba","William T.

It handles arbitrary geometry, non-diffuse materials, and illumination from a wide variety of sources including point lights, area lights, HDR environment maps, sun/sky models, and indirect illumination. At its core is a new algorithm for accurately approximating illumination from many point lights with a strongly sublinear cost. We show how a group of lights can be cheaply approximated while bounding the maximum approximation error. A binary light tree and perceptual metric are then used to adaptively partition the lights into groups to control the error vs. cost tradeoff.We also introduce reconstruction cuts that exploit spatial coherence to accelerate the generation of anti-aliased images with complex illumination. Results are demonstrated for five complex scenes and show that lightcuts can accurately approximate hundreds of thousands of point lights using only a few hundred shadow rays. Reconstruction cuts can reduce the number of shadow rays to tens.","author":["Bruce Walter","Sebastian Fernandez","Adam Arbree","Kavita Bala","Michael Donikian","Donald P.

The interaction technique is derived from an analogy with methods seen in spreadsheet pivot tables and in online analytical processing (OLAP).

The scheme is based on the segmented virtual grounding (SVGND) of the SRAM cells. Substantial leakage reduction is achieved by increasing the threshold voltage of the cell transistors through body effect. The write and read energy consumptions are reduced significantly by decreasing the bitline voltage swing and the number of bitlines affected in each transaction. Unlike recently reported low-power schemes, SVGND allows multiple words to be placed in each row while keeping the dynamic power low. This feature is achieved by introducing an additional operation mode to the SRAM cells. The architecture is implemented in a 130nm CMOS technology. Using this scheme, the read and write array energy consumption can be saved by 44% and 84% respectively. Measurement results portraits 15 times leakage reduction compared to the conventional scheme.","author":["Mohammad Sharifkhani","Manoj Sachdev"],"issue":["ISLPED '06: Proceedings of the 2006 international symposium on Low power electronics and design","October 2006","Pages   256\u2013261","https://doi.org/10.1145/1165573.1165635"],"date":"04 October 2006","ref":[{"text":"K.

A log-structured file system writes all modifications to disk sequentially in a log-like structure, thereby speeding up both file writing and crash recovery. The log is the only structure on disk; it contains indexing information so that files can be read back from the log efficiently. In order to maintain large free areas on disk for fast writing, we divide the log into segments and use a segment cleaner to compress the live information from heavily fragmented segments. We present a series of simulations that demonstrate the efficiency of a simple cleaning policy based on cost and benefit. We have implemented a prototype log-structured file system called Sprite LFS; it outperforms current Unix file systems by an order of magnitude for small-file writes while matching or exceeding Unix performance for reads and large writes. Even when the overhead for cleaning is included, Sprite LFS can use 70% of the disk bandwidth for writing, whereas Unix file systems typically can use only 5--10%.","author":["Mendel Rosenblum","John K.

In this work, a new generation of Predictive Technology Model (PTM) is developed, covering emerging physical effects and alternative structures, such as the double-gate device (i.e., FinFET). Based on physical models and early stage silicon data, PTM of bulk and double-gate devices are successfully generated from 130nm to 32nm technology nodes, with effective channel length down to 13nm. By tuning only ten primary parameters, PTM can be easily customized to cover a wide range of process uncertainties. The accuracy of PTM predictions is comprehensively verified with published silicon data: the error of the current is below 10% for both NMOS and PMOS. Furthermore, the new PTM correctly captures process sensitivities in the nanometer regime.

Contrary to the majority of earlier methods, it needs no user-defined parameters. Moreover, it is designed to operate on large graphs, in a streaming fashion. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our GraphScope on real datasets from several diverse domains.

Designed for high performance, routability, and ease-of-use, it supports variable-granularity logic blocks, dedicated wide multiplexers, and variable-length bypassing interconnects with a symmetrical structure. Due to its many unconventional architectural features, the amorphous FPGA requires several major modifications to be made in the standard VPR placement/routing CAD flow, which include a new placement algorithm and a modified delay-based routing procedure. It is shown that, on average, an FPGA with the amorphous architecture can achieve a 1.35 times improvement in logic density, 9% improvement in average net delay, and 4% improvement in the critical-path delay for the largest 20 MCNC benchmark circuits over an island-style baseline","author":["Mingjie Lin"],"issue":["FPGA '08: Proceedings of the 16th international ACM/SIGDA symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2008","Pages   191\u2013200","https://doi.org/10.1145/1344671.1344700"],"date":"24 February 2008","ref":[{"text":"A.

Mash Maker adds a toolbar to the browser that shows buttons representing enhancements that Mash Maker believes the user might want to apply to the current page. An enhancement might combine the data on the page with data from another source, or visualize data in a new way. Mash Maker is intended to be an integral part of the way the user browses information, rather than being a special tool that a user uses when they want to create mashups.In order to create mashups from normal websites, Mash Maker must first extract structured data from them.

Caches aware of content-duplication can have lower miss rates by allowing only blocks with unique content to enter a cache. This work examines the potential of CCD for instruction caches. We show that CCD is a frequent phenomenon and that an idealized duplication-detection mechanism for instruction caches has the potential to increase performance of an out-of-order processor, with a 2-way eight instruction per block 16KB instruction cache, often by more than 5% and up to 20%. This work also proposes CATCH, a hardware based mechanism for dynamically detecting CCD. Experimental results for an out-of-order processor show that a CATCH with a 2.32KB cost usually captures 60% or more of the CCD's idealized potential.","author":["Marios Kleanthous","Yiannakis Sazeides"],"issue":["DATE '08: Proceedings of the conference on Design, automation and test in Europe","March 2008","Pages   1426\u20131431","https://doi.org/10.1145/1403375.1403720"],"date":"10 March 2008","ref":[{"text":"M.

Due to the recent advances in VLSI technology, interconnect has become a dominant factor of the overall performance of a circuit. In order to optimize interconnect cost, we need a good congestion estimation method to predict routability in the early designing stages. Many congestion models have been proposed but there's still a lot of room for improvement. Besides, routers will perform rip-up and reroute operations to prevent overflow, but most models do not consider this case. The outcome is that the existing models will usually underestimate the routability. In this paper, we have a comprehensive study on our proposed congestion models. Results show that the estimation results of our approaches are always more accurate than the previous congestion models.","author":["Chiu-Wing Sham","Evangeline F. Y.

The designer of an elliptic curve hardware accelerator is faced with many choices at design time, each of which can impact the performance of the accelerator in different ways. There are many examples in the literature of how these design choices can effect the area and/or speed of an elliptic curve hardware accelerator. The effect of design choices on power and energy consumption in elliptic curve hardware has been less well studied. This article studies the effect of design choices on the power and energy consumption of an FPGA-based reconfigurable elliptic curve hardware accelerator. A reconfigurable processor has been used for different system parameters and the power and energy consumption measured.

This work explores an alternative approach of using a soft vector processor as a general-purpose accelerator. The approach has the benefits of a purely software-oriented development model, a fixed ISA allowing parallel software and hardware development, a single accelerator that can accelerate multiple applications, and scalable performance from the same source code. With no hardware design experience needed, a software programmer can make area-versus-performance trade-offs by scaling the number of functional units and register file bandwidth with a single parameter. A soft vector processor can be further customized by a number of secondary parameters to add or remove features for a specific application to optimize resource utilization. This article introduces VIPERS, a soft vector processor architecture that maps efficiently into an FPGA and provides a scalable amount of performance for a reasonable amount of area. Compared to a Nios II/s processor, instances of VIPERS with 32 processing lanes achieve up to 44\u00d7 speedup using up to 26\u00d7 the area.","author":["Jason Yu","Christopher Eagleston","Christopher Han-Yu Chou","Maxime Perreault","Guy Lemieux"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems","Volume 2","Issue 2","June 2009","Article No.: 12","pp   1\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/1534916.1534922"],"date":"01 June 2009","ref":[{"text":"2008a.","order":1},{"text":"2008b.","order":2},{"text":"2008c.","order":3},{"text":". 2008.

Our focus is on NVIDIA GPUs, but some of the observations should be valid for other wide machines as well. While several fast GPU tracing methods have been published, very little is actually understood about their performance. Nobody knows whether the methods are anywhere near the theoretically obtainable limits, and if not, what might be causing the discrepancy. We study this question by comparing the measurements against a simulator that tells the upper bound of performance for a given kernel. We observe that previously known methods are a factor of 1.5--2.5X off from theoretical optimum, and most of the gap is not explained by memory bandwidth, but rather by previously unidentified inefficiencies in hardware work distribution. We then propose a simple solution that significantly narrows the gap between simulation and measurement. This results in the fastest GPU ray tracer to date. We provide results for primary, ambient occlusion and diffuse interreflection rays.","author":["Timo Aila","Samuli Laine"],"issue":["HPG '09: Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Graphics 2009","August 2009","Pages   145\u2013149","https://doi.org/10.1145/1572769.1572792"],"date":"01 August 2009","ref":[{"text":"Blelloch, G. 1990.

We propose ESKIMO, a scheme where when the program or operating systems memory manager allocates or frees up a memory region, this information is used by the architecture to optimize the working of the DRAM system, particularly to save energy and power. In this work we attempt to have the architecture work hand in hand with information about allocated and freed space provided by the program. We discuss multiple ways to use this information to reduce the energy and power consumption of the memory and present results of this optimization. We evaluate the energy and power benefits of our technique using a publicly available, hardware-validated, DRAM simulator, DRAMsim [1].

This paper describes RVM, an efficient, portable, and easily used implementation of recoverable virtual memory for Unix environments. A unique characteristic of RVM is that it allows independent control over the transactional properties of atomicity, permanence, and serializability. This leads to considerable flexibility in the use of RVM, potentially enlarging the range of applications than can benefit from transactions. It also simplifies the layering of functionality such as nesting and distribution. The paper shows that RVM performs well over its intended range of usage even though it does not benefit from specialized operating system support. It also demonstrates the importance of intra- and intertransaction optimizations.","author":["M. Satyanarayanan","Henry H. Mashburn","Puneet Kumar","David C. Steere","James J.

However, their effect on datacenter energy efficiency has not been scrutinized. Moreover, the filesystem component of these frameworks effectively precludes scale-down of clusters deploying these frameworks (i.e. operating at reduced capacity). This paper presents our early work on modifying Hadoop to allow scale-down of operational clusters. We find that running Hadoop clusters in fractional configurations can save between 9% and 50% of energy consumption, and that there is a tradeoff between performance energy consumption. We also outline further research into the energy-efficiency of these frameworks.","author":["Jacob Leverich","Christos Kozyrakis"],"issue":["ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","Volume 44","Issue 1","January 2010","pp   61\u201365","https://doi.org/10.1145/1740390.1740405"],"date":"12 March 2010","ref":[{"text":"Lustre: A Scalable, High Performance File System. http://lustre.org/.","order":1},{"text":"Apache.

The OptiX engine builds on the key observation that most ray tracing algorithms can be implemented using a small set of programmable operations. Consequently, the core of OptiX is a domain-specific just-in-time compiler that generates custom ray tracing kernels by combining user-supplied programs for ray generation, material shading, object intersection, and scene traversal. This enables the implementation of a highly diverse set of ray tracing-based algorithms and applications, including interactive rendering, offline rendering, collision detection systems, artificial intelligence queries, and scientific simulations such as sound propagation. OptiX achieves high performance through a compact object model and application of several ray tracing-specific compiler optimizations. For ease of use it exposes a single-ray programming model with full support for recursion and a dynamic dispatch mechanism similar to virtual function calls.","author":["Steven G.

In-memory sorts are now feasible; sort performance is limited by compute flops and main memory bandwidth rather than I/O. In this paper, we present a competitive analysis of comparison and non-comparison based sorting algorithms on two modern architectures - the latest CPU and GPU architectures. We propose novel CPU radix sort and GPU merge sort implementations which are 2X faster than previously published results. We perform a fair comparison of the algorithms using these best performing implementations on both architectures. While radix sort is faster on current architectures, the gap narrows from CPU to GPU architectures. Merge sort performs better than radix sort for sorting keys of large sizes - such keys will be required to accommodate the increasing cardinality of future databases. We present analytical models for analyzing the performance of our implementations in terms of architectural features such as core count, SIMD and bandwidth. Our obtained performance results are successfully predicted by our models. Our analysis points to merge sort winning over radix sort on future architectures due to its efficient utilization of SIMD and low bandwidth utilization. We simulate a 64-core platform with varying SIMD widths under constant bandwidth per core constraints, and show that large data sizes of 240 (one trillion records), merge sort performance on large key sizes is up to 3X better than radix sort for large SIMD widths on future architectures. Therefore, merge sort should be the sorting method of choice for future databases.","author":["Nadathur Satish","Changkyu Kim","Jatin Chhugani","Anthony D. Nguyen","Victor W.

Cache policies have focused on anticipating the CPU's data needs, and are mostly oblivious to the main memory. In this paper, we demonstrate that the era of many-core architectures has created new main memory bottlenecks, and mandates a new approach: coordination of cache policy with main memory characteristics. Using the cache for memory optimization purposes, we propose a Virtual Write Queue which dramatically expands the memory controller's visibility of processor behavior, at low implementation overhead. Through memory-centric modification of existing policies, such as scheduled writebacks, this paper demonstrates that performance limiting effects of highly-threaded architectures can be overcome. We show that through awareness of the physical main memory layout and by focusing on writes, both read and write average latency can be shortened, memory power reduced, and overall system performance improved. Through full-system cycle-accurate simulations of SPEC cpu2006, we demonstrate that the proposed Virtual Write Queue achieves an average 10.9% system-level throughput improvement on memory-intensive workloads, along with an overall reduction of 8.7% in memory power across the whole suite.","author":["Jeffrey Stuecheli","Dimitris Kaseridis","David Daly","Hillery C.

Given a square linear matrix (i.e. a matrix whose entries are k-variate linear forms) of size n and an integer r, the problem is to find points such that the evaluation of the matrix has rank less than r + 1. The aim of the paper is to obtain the most efficient algorithm to solve this problem. To this end, we give the theoretical and practical complexity of computing Gr\u00f6bner bases of two algebraic formulations of the MinRank problem. Both modelings lead to structured algebraic systems. The first modeling, proposed by Kipnis and Shamir generates bi-homogeneous equations of bi-degree (1, 1). The second one is classically obtained by the vanishing of the (r + 1)-minors of the given matrix, giving rise to a determinantal ideal. In both cases, under genericity assumptions on the entries of the considered matrix, we give new bounds on the degree of regularity of the considered ideal which allows us to estimate the complexity of the whole Gr\u00f6bner bases computations. For instance, the exact degree of regularity of the determinantal ideal formulation of a generic well-defined MinRank problem is r(n - r) + 1. We also give optimal degree bounds of the loci of rank defect which are reached under genericity assumptions; the new bounds are much lower than the standard multi-homogeneous B\u00e9zout bounds (or mixed volume of Newton polytopes). TAs a by-product, we prove that the generic MinRank problem could be solved in polynomial time in n (when n - r is fixed) as announced in a previous paper of Faug\u00e8re, Levy-dit-Vehel and Perret. Moreover, using the determinantal ideal formulation, these results are used to break a cryptographic challenge (which was untractable so far) and allow us to evaluate precisely the security of the cryptosystem w.r.t. n, r and k. Our practical results suggest that, up to the software state of the art, this latter formulation is more adapted in the context of Gr\u00f6bner bases computations.","author":["Jean-Charles Faug\u00e8re","Mohab Safey El Din","Pierre-Jean Spaenlehauer"],"issue":["ISSAC '10: Proceedings of the 2010 International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation","July 2010","Pages   257\u2013264","https://doi.org/10.1145/1837934.1837984"],"date":"25 July 2010","ref":[{"text":"B.

This article assesses the major existing technologies for crowd modeling and simulation. We first propose a two-dimensional categorization mechanism to classify existing work depending on the size of crowds and the time-scale of the crowd phenomena of interest. Four evaluation criteria have also been introduced to evaluate existing crowd simulation systems from the point of view of both a modeler and an end-user.We have discussed some influential existing work in crowd modeling and simulation regarding their major features, performance as well as the technologies used in this work. We have also discussed some open problems in the area.

Such a controller is a single point of failure, and its performance limits the maximum number of disks to which the array can scale. We describe TickerTAIP, a parallel architecture for disk arrays that distributes the controller functions across several loosely coupled processors. The result is better scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility.This article presents the TickerTAIP architecture and an evaluation of its behavior. We demonstrate the feasibility by a working example, describe a family of distributed algorithms for calculating RAID parity, discuss techniques for establishing request atomicity, sequencing, and recovery, and evaluate the performance of the TickerTAIP design in both absolute terms and by comparison to a centralized RAID implementation. We also analyze the effects of including disk-level request-scheduling algorithms inside the array. We conclude that the Ticker TAIP architectural approach is feasible, useful, and effective.","author":["Pei Cao","Swee Boon Lin","Shivakumar Venkataraman","John Wilkes"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Computer Systems","Volume 12","Issue 3","Aug. 1994","pp   236\u2013269","https://doi.org/10.1145/185514.185517"],"date":"01 August 1994","ref":[{"text":"AT &amp; T. 1989.

We believe that extracting maximum performance will require compilation to highly heterogeneous architectures that include reconfigurable hardware. We present a new language, Lime, which is designed to be executable across a broad range of architectures, from FPGAs to conventional CPUs. We present the language as a whole, focusing on its novel features for limiting side-effects and integration of the streaming paradigm into an object- oriented language. We conclude with some initial results demonstrating applications running either on a CPU or co- executing on a CPU and an FPGA.","author":["Joshua Auerbach","David F.

The model generates probabilistic proofs of possession by sampling random sets of blocks from the server, which drastically reduces I/O costs. The client maintains a constant amount of metadata to verify the proof. The challenge/response protocol transmits a small, constant amount of data, which minimizes network communication. Thus, the PDP model for remote data checking is lightweight and supports large data sets in distributed storage systems. The model is also robust in that it incorporates mechanisms for mitigating arbitrary amounts of data corruption.We present two provably-secure PDP schemes that are more efficient than previous solutions. In particular, the overhead at the server is low (or even constant), as opposed to linear in the size of the data. We then propose a generic transformation that adds robustness to any remote data checking scheme based on spot checking. Experiments using our implementation verify the practicality of PDP and reveal that the performance of PDP is bounded by disk I/O and not by cryptographic computation. Finally, we conduct an in-depth experimental evaluation to study the tradeoffs in performance, security, and space overheads when adding robustness to a remote data checking scheme.","author":["Giuseppe Ateniese","Randal Burns","Reza Curtmola","Joseph Herring","Osama Khan","Lea Kissner","Zachary Peterson","Dawn Song"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information and System Security","Volume 14","Issue 1","May 2011","Article No.: 12","pp   1\u201334","https://doi.org/10.1145/1952982.1952994"],"date":"06 June 2011","ref":[{"text":"Abe, M. and Fehr, S. 2007.

The idea of the library OS is that the personality of the OS on which an application depends runs in the address space of the application. A small, fixed set of abstractions connects the library OS to the host OS kernel, offering the promise of better system security and more rapid independent evolution of OS components.We describe a working prototype of a Windows 7 library OS that runs the latest releases of major applications such as Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, and Internet Explorer. We demonstrate that desktop sharing across independent, securely isolated, library OS instances can be achieved through the pragmatic reuse of net-working protocols. Each instance has significantly lower overhead than a full VM bundled with an application: a typical application adds just 16MB of working set and 64MB of disk footprint. We contribute a new ABI below the library OS that enables application mobility. We also show that our library OS can address many of the current uses of hardware virtual machines at a fraction of the overheads. This paper describes the first working prototype of a full commercial OS redesigned as a library OS capable of running significant applications. Our experience shows that the long-promised benefits of the library OS approach better protection of system integrity and rapid system evolution are readily obtainable.","author":["Donald E.

Fast and scalable simulations are therefore needed to allow for sufficient exploration of large multi-core systems within a limited simulation time budget. By bringing together accurate high-abstraction analytical models with fast parallel simulation, architects can trade off accuracy with simulation speed to allow for longer application runs, covering a larger portion of the hardware design space. Interval simulation provides this balance between detailed cycle-accurate simulation and one-IPC simulation, allowing long-running simulations to be modeled much faster than with detailed cycle-accurate simulation, while still providing the detail necessary to observe core-uncore interactions across the entire system. Validations against real hardware show average absolute errors within 25% for a variety of multi-threaded workloads; more than twice as accurate on average as one-IPC simulation. Further, we demonstrate scalable simulation speed of up to 2.0 MIPS when simulating a 16-core system on an 8-core SMP machine.","author":["Trevor E.

Among them, a very accurate and general method is due to Talbot: this method approximates the value of the inverse Laplace transform f(t), for t fixed, using the complex values of the Laplace transform F(s) sampled on a suitable contour of the complex plane. On the basis of the interest raised by Talbot's method implementation, the author has been induced to investigate more deeply the possibilities of this method and has been able to generalize Talbot's method, to approximate simultaneously several values of f(t) using the same sampling values of the Laplace transform. In this way, the only unfavorable  aspect of the classical Talbot method, that is, that of recomputing all of the samples of F(s) for each t, has been eliminated.","author":["Mariarosaria Rizzardi"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software","Volume 21","Issue 4","Dec. 1995","pp   347\u2013371","https://doi.org/10.1145/212066.212068"],"date":"01 December 1995","ref":[{"text":"MURLI, A.

A promising use of stacked DRAM is as a cache, since its capacity is insufficient to be all of main memory (for all but some embedded systems). However, a 1GB DRAM cache with 64-byte blocks requires 96MB of tag storage. Placing these tags on-chip is impractical (larger than on-chip L3s) while putting them in DRAM is slow (two full DRAM accesses for tag and data). Larger blocks and sub-blocking are possible, but less robust due to fragmentation. This work efficiently enables conventional block sizes for very large die-stacked DRAM caches with two innovations. First, we make hits faster than just storing tags in stacked DRAM by scheduling the tag and data accesses as a compound access so the data access is always a row buffer hit. Second, we make misses faster with a MissMap that eschews stacked-DRAM access on all misses. Like extreme sub-blocking, our implementation of the MissMap stores a vector of block-valid bits for each \"page\" in the DRAM cache. Unlike conventional sub-blocking, the MissMap (a) points to many more pages than can be stored in the DRAM cache (making the effects of fragmentation rare) and (b) does not point to the \"way\" that holds a block (but defers to the off-chip tags). For the evaluated large-footprint commercial workloads, the proposed cache organization delivers 92.9% of the performance benefit of an ideal 1GB DRAM cache with an impractical 96MB on-chip SRAM tag array.","author":["Gabriel H.

In this context, this paper has two goals. One is to quantitatively characterize the SPLASH-2 programs in terms of fundamental properties and architectural interactions that are important to understand them well. The properties we study include the computational load balance, communication to computation ratio and traffic needs, important working set sizes, and issues related to spatial locality, as well as how these properties scale with problem size and the number of processors. The other, related goal is methodological: to assist people who will use the programs in architectural evaluations to prune the space of application and machine parameters in an informed and meaningful way. For example, by characterizing the working sets of the applications, we describe which operating points in terms of cache size and problem size are representative of realistic situations, which are not, and which re redundant. Using SPLASH-2 as an example, we hope to convey the importance of understanding the interplay of problem size, number of processors, and working sets in designing experiments and interpreting their results.","author":["Steven Cameron Woo","Moriyoshi Ohara","Evan Torrie","Jaswinder Pal Singh","Anoop Gupta"],"issue":["ISCA '95: Proceedings of the 22nd annual international symposium on Computer architecture","July 1995","Pages   24\u201336","https://doi.org/10.1145/223982.223990"],"date":"01 May 1995","ref":[{"text":"David H.

The difficulty of scaling search to large datasets largely explains why most academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millions of time series objects, while much of industry and science sits on billions of time series objects waiting to be explored. In this work we show that by using a combination of four novel ideas we can search and mine truly massive time series for the first time. We demonstrate the following extremely unintuitive fact; in large datasets we can exactly search under DTW much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art Euclidean distance search algorithms. We demonstrate our work on the largest set of time series experiments ever attempted. In particular, the largest dataset we consider is larger than the combined size of all of the time series datasets considered in all data mining papers ever published. We show that our ideas allow us to solve higher-level time series data mining problem such as motif discovery and clustering at scales that would otherwise be untenable. In addition to mining massive datasets, we will show that our ideas also have implications for real-time monitoring of data streams, allowing us to handle much faster arrival rates and/or use cheaper and lower powered devices than are currently possible.","author":["Thanawin Rakthanmanon","Bilson Campana","Abdullah Mueen","Gustavo Batista","Brandon Westover","Qiang Zhu","Jesin Zakaria","Eamonn Keogh"],"issue":["KDD '12: Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2012","Pages   262\u2013270","https://doi.org/10.1145/2339530.2339576"],"date":"12 August 2012","ref":[{"text":"N.

A major challenge for link-based clustering in such networks is its potential to generate many different results, carrying rather diverse semantic meanings. In order to generate desired clustering, we propose to use meta-path, a path that connects object types via a sequence of relations, to control clustering with distinct semantics. Nevertheless, it is easier for a user to provide a few examples (\"seeds\") than a weighted combination of sophisticated meta-paths to specify her clustering preference. Thus, we propose to integrate meta-path selection with user-guided clustering to cluster objects in networks, where a user first provides a small set of object seeds for each cluster as guidance. Then the system learns the weights for each meta-path that are consistent with the clustering result implied by the guidance, and generates clusters under the learned weights of meta-paths. A probabilistic approach is proposed to solve the problem, and an effective and efficient iterative algorithm, PathSelClus, is proposed to learn the model, where the clustering quality and the meta-path weights are mutually enhancing each other. Our experiments with several clustering tasks in two real networks demonstrate the power of the algorithm in comparison with the baselines.","author":["Yizhou Sun","Brandon Norick","Jiawei Han","Xifeng Yan","Philip S.

Yet usage-based pricing still requires ISPs to over-provision capacity for demand at peak times of the day. Time-dependent pricing (TDP) addresses this problem by considering when a user consumes data, in addition to how much is used. We present the architecture, implementation, and a user trial of an end-to-end TDP system called TUBE. TUBE creates a price-based feedback control loop between an ISP and its end users. On the ISP side, it computes TDP prices so as to balance the cost of congestion during peak periods with that of offering lower prices in less congested periods. On mobile devices, it provides a graphical user interface that allows users to respond to the offered prices either by themselves or using an \"autopilot\" mode. We conducted a pilot TUBE trial with 50 iPhone or iPad 3G data users, who were charged according to our TDP algorithms. Our results show that TDP benefits both operators and customers, flattening the temporal fluctuation of demand while allowing users to save money by choosing the time and volume of their usage.","author":["Sangtae Ha","Soumya Sen","Carlee Joe-Wong","Youngbin Im","Mung Chiang"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 42","Issue 4","October 2012","pp   247\u2013258","https://doi.org/10.1145/2377677.2377723"],"date":"13 August 2012","ref":[{"text":"Cheng, R.

However, their use remains beyond the reach of traditionally trained applications code developers because of the complexity of their programming tool-chain. Compilers for high-level languages targeting FPGAs have to bridge a huge abstraction gap between two divergent computational models: a temporal, sequentially consistent, control driven execution in the stored program model versus a spatial, parallel, data-flow driven execution in the spatial hardware model. In this paper we discuss these challenges to the compiler designer and report on our experience with the ROCCC toolset.","author":["Walid Najjar","Jason Villarreal"],"issue":["DAC '13: Proceedings of the 50th Annual Design Automation Conference","May 2013","Article No.: 141","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2463209.2488908"],"date":"29 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"ROCCC 2.0 - www.jacquardcomputing.com, 2013.","order":1},{"text":"Bertin, P., Roncin, D, and Vuillemin.

We analyze how emoticons typically convey sentiment and demonstrate how we can exploit this by using a novel, manually created emoticon sentiment lexicon in order to improve a state-of-the-art lexicon-based sentiment classification method. We evaluate our approach on 2,080 Dutch tweets and forum messages, which all contain emoticons and have been manually annotated for sentiment. On this corpus, paragraph-level accounting for sentiment implied by emoticons significantly improves sentiment classification accuracy. This indicates that whenever emoticons are used, their associated sentiment dominates the sentiment conveyed by textual cues and forms a good proxy for intended sentiment.","author":["Alexander Hogenboom","Daniella Bal","Flavius Frasincar","Malissa Bal","Franciska de Jong","Uzay Kaymak"],"issue":["SAC '13: Proceedings of the 28th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing","March 2013","Pages   703\u2013710","https://doi.org/10.1145/2480362.2480498"],"date":"18 March 2013","ref":[{"text":"S.

In LBSNs, users can check in and leave tips commenting on a venue. These two heterogeneous data sources both describe users' preference of venues. However, in current research work, only users' check-in behavior is considered in users' location preference model, users' tips on venues are seldom investigated yet. Moreover, while existing work mainly considers social influence in recommendation, we argue that considering venue similarity can further improve the recommendation performance. In this research, we ameliorate location recommendation by enhancing not only the user location preference model but also recommendation algorithm. First, we propose a hybrid user location preference model by combining the preference extracted from check-ins and text-based tips which are processed using sentiment analysis techniques. Second, we develop a location based social matrix factorization algorithm that takes both user social influence and venue similarity influence into account in location recommendation. Using two datasets extracted from the location based social networks Foursquare, experiment results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid preference model can better characterize user preference by maintaining the preference consistency, and the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.","author":["Dingqi Yang","Daqing Zhang","Zhiyong Yu","Zhu Wang"],"issue":["HT '13: Proceedings of the 24th ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media","May 2013","Pages   119\u2013128","https://doi.org/10.1145/2481492.2481505"],"date":"01 May 2013","ref":[{"text":"G.

We discuss what we have learned from the T3D project (the predecessor to the T3E) and the rationale behind changes made for the T3E. We include performance measurements for various aspects of communication and synchronization.The T3E augments the memory interface of the DEC 21164 microprocessor with a large set of explicitly-managed, external registers (E-registers). E-registers are used as the source or target for all remote communication. They provide a highly pipelined interface to global memory that allows dozens of requests per processor to be outstanding. Through E-registers, the T3E provides a rich set of atomic memory operations and a flexible, user-level messaging facility. The T3E also provides a set of virtual hardware barrier/eureka networks that can be arbitrarily embedded into the 3D torus interconnect.","author":["Steven L.

This charge leaks off over time, eventually causing data to be lost. To prevent this data loss from occurring, DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed. Unfortunately, DRAM refresh operations waste energy and also degrade system performance by interfering with memory requests. These problems are expected to worsen as DRAM density increases. The amount of time that a DRAM cell can safely retain data without being refreshed is called the cell's retention time. In current systems, all DRAM cells are refreshed at the rate required to guarantee the integrity of the cell with the shortest retention time, resulting in unnecessary refreshes for cells with longer retention times. Prior work has proposed to reduce unnecessary refreshes by exploiting differences in retention time among DRAM cells; however, such mechanisms require knowledge of each cell's retention time. In this paper, we present a comprehensive quantitative study of retention behavior in modern DRAMs. Using a temperature-controlled FPGA-based testing platform, we collect retention time information from 248 commodity DDR3 DRAM chips from five major DRAM vendors. We observe two significant phenomena: data pattern dependence, where the retention time of each DRAM cell is significantly affected by the data stored in other DRAM cells, and variable retention time, where the retention time of some DRAM cells changes unpredictably over time. We discuss possible physical explanations for these phenomena, how their magnitude may be affected by DRAM technology scaling, and their ramifications for DRAM retention time profiling mechanisms.","author":["Jamie Liu","Ben Jaiyen","Yoongu Kim","Chris Wilkerson","Onur Mutlu"],"issue":["ISCA '13: Proceedings of the 40th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","June 2013","Pages   60\u201371","https://doi.org/10.1145/2485922.2485928"],"date":"23 June 2013","ref":[{"text":"J.-H.

In services such as Foursquare.com, whether a person likes an article is considered private and therefore not disclosed; only the aggregative statistics of articles (i.e., how many people like this article) is revealed. This paper tries to answer a question: can we predict the opinion holder in a heterogeneous social network without any labeled data? This question can be generalized to a link prediction with aggregative statistics problem. This paper devises a novel unsupervised framework to solve this problem, including two main components: (1) a three-layer factor graph model and three types of potential functions; (2) a ranked-margin learning and inference algorithm. Finally, we evaluate our method on four diverse prediction scenarios using four datasets: preference (Foursquare), repost (Twitter), response (Plurk), and citation (DBLP). We further exploit nine unsupervised models to solve this problem as baselines. Our approach not only wins out in all scenarios, but on the average achieves 9.90% AUC and 12.59% NDCG improvement over the best competitors.

Because heterogeneous systems typically comprise multiple execution contexts with different programming abstractions and runtimes, programming them remains extremely challenging. Dandelion is a system designed to address this programmability challenge for data-parallel applications. Dandelion provides a unified programming model for heterogeneous systems that span diverse execution contexts including CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and the cloud. It adopts the .NET LINQ (Language INtegrated Query) approach, integrating data-parallel operators into general purpose programming languages such as C# and F#. It therefore provides an expressive data model and native language integration for user-defined functions, enabling programmers to write applications using standard high-level languages and development tools. Dandelion automatically and transparently distributes data-parallel portions of a program to available computing resources, including compute clusters for distributed execution and CPU and GPU cores of individual nodes for parallel execution. To enable automatic execution of .NET code on GPUs, Dandelion cross-compiles .NET code to CUDA kernels and uses the PTask runtime [85] to manage GPU execution. This paper discusses the design and implementation of Dandelion, focusing on the distributed CPU and GPU implementation. We evaluate the system using a diverse set of workloads.","author":["Christopher J.

We show that it is possible to obtain both serializable transactions and low latency, under two conditions. First, transactions are known ahead of time, permitting an a priori static analysis of conflicts. Second, transactions are structured as transaction chains consisting of a sequence of hops, each hop modifying data at one server. To demonstrate this idea, we built Lynx, a geo-distributed storage system that offers transaction chains, secondary indexes, materialized join views, and geo-replication. Lynx uses static analysis to determine if each hop can execute separately while preserving serializability---if so, a client needs wait only for the first hop to complete, which occurs quickly. To evaluate Lynx, we built three applications: an auction service, a Twitter-like microblogging site and a social networking site. These applications successfully use chains to achieve low latency operation and good throughput.","author":["Yang Zhang","Russell Power","Siyuan Zhou","Yair Sovran","Marcos K.

In this article we focus on this embedded system. To accelerate the image reconstruction, the Beamforming phase has to be implemented in a parallel fashion. We assess its implementation in three currently available high-end platforms based on a multicore CPU, a GPU, and an FPGA, respectively. We then project the results applying technology scaling rules to future many-core CPUs, many-thread GPUs, and advanced FPGAs. We consider an optimistic case in which available resources increase according to Moore's law only, and a pessimistic case in which only a fraction of those resources are available due to a limited power budget. In both scenarios, an implementation that includes a high-end FPGA outperforms the other alternatives. Since the number of effectively usable cores in future many-cores will be power-limited, and there is a trend toward the integration of power-efficient accelerators, we conjecture that a chip consisting of a many-core section and a reconfigurable logic section will be the perfect platform for this application.","author":["Mario R.

B4 has a number of unique characteristics: i) massive bandwidth requirements deployed to a modest number of sites, ii) elastic traffic demand that seeks to maximize average bandwidth, and iii) full control over the edge servers and network, which enables rate limiting and demand measurement at the edge.These characteristics led to a Software Defined Networking architecture using OpenFlow to control relatively simple switches built from merchant silicon. B4's centralized traffic engineering service drives links to near 100% utilization, while splitting application flows among multiple paths to balance capacity against application priority/demands. We describe experience with three years of B4 production deployment, lessons learned, and areas for future work.","author":["Sushant Jain","Alok Kumar","Subhasree Mandal","Joon Ong","Leon Poutievski","Arjun Singh","Subbaiah Venkata","Jim Wanderer","Junlan Zhou","Min Zhu","Jon Zolla","Urs H\u00f6lzle","Stephen Stuart","Amin Vahdat"],"issue":["ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review","Volume 43","Issue 4","October 2013","pp   3\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/2534169.2486019"],"date":"27 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"Al-Fares, M., Loukissas, A., and Vahdat, A.

Currently only 40\\% or less of the raw bandwidth of the flash memory in the SSDs is delivered by the storage system to the applications. Moreover, because of space over-provisioning in the SSD to accommodate non-sequential or random writes, and additionally, parity coding across flash channels, typically only 50-70\\% of the raw capacity of a commodity SSD can be used for user data. Given the large scale of Baidu's data center, making the most effective use of its SSDs is of great importance. Specifically, we seek to maximize both bandwidth and usable capacity. To achieve this goal we propose {\\em software-defined flash} (SDF), a hardware/software co-designed storage system to maximally exploit the performance characteristics of flash memory in the context of our workloads. SDF exposes individual flash channels to the host software and eliminates space over-provisioning. The host software, given direct access to the raw flash channels of the SSD, can effectively organize its data and schedule its data access to better realize the SSD's raw performance potential. Currently more than 3000 SDFs have been deployed in Baidu's storage system that supports its web page and image repository services. Our measurements show that SDF can deliver approximately 95% of the raw flash bandwidth and provide 99% of the flash capacity for user data. SDF increases I/O bandwidth by 300\\% and reduces per-GB hardware cost by 50% on average compared with the commodity-SSD-based system used at Baidu.","author":["Jian Ouyang","Shiding Lin","Song Jiang","Zhenyu Hou","Yong Wang","Yuanzheng Wang"],"issue":["ASPLOS '14: Proceedings of the 19th international conference on Architectural support for programming languages and operating systems","February 2014","Pages   471\u2013484","https://doi.org/10.1145/2541940.2541959"],"date":"24 February 2014","ref":[{"text":"\"Micron 25nm MLC Product Datasheet.\" http://www.micron.com.","order":1},{"text":"\"NVMe: Non-volatile Memory Express.\" http://www.nvmexpress.org/.","order":2},{"text":"\"UBIFS: Unsorted Block Image File System.\" http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/doc/ubifs.html/.","order":3},{"text":"\"YFFS: Yet Another Flash File System.\" http://www.yaffs.net/.","order":4},{"text":"F.

The implementation details of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique employed by us for the linguistic engine is described in this paper in detail. Also, we consider a corpus containing 123 use cases from real-life industrial projects within our company, and translate them into annotation models using our NLP technique.

We use a novel density function based on electrostatics to remove overlap and Nesterov's method to minimize the nonlinear cost. Steplength is estimated as the inverse of Lipschitz constant, which is determined by our dynamic prediction and backtracking method. An approximated preconditioner is proposed to resolve the difference between large macros and standard cells, while an annealing engine is devised to handle macro legalization followed by placement of standard cells. The above innovations are integrated into our placement prototype ePlace, which outperforms the leading-edge placers on respective standard-cell and mixed-size benchmark suites.

Much recent work on last-level caches has focused on exploiting reference locality to improve efficiency. However, value redundancy is another source of potential improvement. We find that many blocks in the working set of typical benchmark programs have the same values. We propose cache deduplication that effectively increases last- level cache capacity. Rather than exploit specific value redundancy with compression, as in previous work, our scheme detects duplicate data blocks and stores only one copy of the data in a way that can be accessed through multiple physical addresses. We find that typical benchmarks exhibit significant value redundancy, far beyond the zero-content blocks one would expect in any program. Our deduplicated cache effectively increases capacity by an average of 112% com- pared to an 8MB last-level cache while reducing the physical area by 12.2%, yielding an average performance improvement of 15.2%.","author":["Yingying Tian","Samira M.

For example, annotations of entities from large general purpose knowledge bases, such as Freebase and the Google Knowledge Graph. Understanding how to leverage these entity annotations of text to improve ad hoc document retrieval is an open research area. Query expansion is a commonly used technique to improve retrieval effectiveness. Most previous query expansion approaches focus on text, mainly using unigram concepts. In this paper, we propose a new technique, called entity query feature expansion (EQFE) which enriches the query with features from entities and their links to knowledge bases, including structured attributes and text. We experiment using both explicit query entity annotations and latent entities. We evaluate our technique on TREC text collections automatically annotated with knowledge base entity links, including the Google Freebase Annotations (FACC1) data. We find that entity-based feature expansion results in significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over state-of-the-art text expansion approaches.","author":["Jeffrey Dalton","Laura Dietz","James Allan"],"issue":["SIGIR '14: Proceedings of the 37th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research & development in information retrieval","July 2014","Pages   365\u2013374","https://doi.org/10.1145/2600428.2609628"],"date":"03 July 2014","ref":[{"text":"K.

It is a challenging problem due to its sparse, high-dimensional, and large-volume characteristics. In this paper, we proposed a collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture model for short text clustering (abbr. to GSDMM). We found that GSDMM can infer the number of clusters automatically with a good balance between the completeness and homogeneity of the clustering results, and is fast to converge. GSDMM can also cope with the sparse and high-dimensional problem of short texts, and can obtain the representative words of each cluster. Our extensive experimental study shows that GSDMM can achieve significantly better performance than three other clustering models.","author":["Jianhua Yin","Jianyong Wang"],"issue":["KDD '14: Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining","August 2014","Pages   233\u2013242","https://doi.org/10.1145/2623330.2623715"],"date":"24 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"C.

The high computation and storage requirements of DLNs have led to the exploration of various avenues for their efficient realization. Concurrently, the ability of emerging post-CMOS devices to efficiently mimic neurons and synapses has led to great interest in their use for neuromorphic computing. We describe SPINDLE, a programmable processor for deep learning based on spintronic devices. SPINDLE exploits the unique ability of spintronic devices to realize highly dense and energy-efficient neurons and memory, which form the fundamental building blocks of DLNs. SPINDLE consists of a three-tier hierarchy of processing elements to capture the nested parallelism present in DLNs, and a two-level memory hierarchy to facilitate data reuse. It can be programmed to execute DLNs with widely varying topologies for different applications. SPINDLE employs techniques to limit the overheads of spin-to-charge conversion, and utilizes output and weight quantization to enhance the efficiency of spin-neurons. We evaluate SPINDLE using a device-to-architecture modeling framework and a set of widely used DLN applications (handwriting recognition, face detection, and object recognition). Our results indicate that SPINDLE achieves 14.4X reduction in energy consumption and 20.4X reduction in EDP over the CMOS baseline under iso-area conditions.","author":["Shankar Ganesh Ramasubramanian","Rangharajan Venkatesan","Mrigank Sharad","Kaushik Roy","Anand Raghunathan"],"issue":["ISLPED '14: Proceedings of the 2014 international symposium on Low power electronics and design","August 2014","Pages   15\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/2627369.2627625"],"date":"11 August 2014","ref":[{"text":"Y.

However, the storage subsystem has always been a prohibitive factor that slows down the pace of reaching even higher performance while maintaining good user experience. Despite today's smartphones are equipped with larger-than-ever main memories, they consume more energy and still run out of memory. But the slow NAND flash based storage vetoes the possibility of swapping---an important technique to extend main memory---and leaves a system that constantly terminates user applications under memory pressure. In this paper, we revisit swapping for smartphones with fast, byte-addressable, non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies. Instead of using flash, we build the swap area with NVM, to allow high performance without sacrificing user experience. Based on NVM's high performance and byte-addressability, we show that a copy-on-write swap-in scheme can achieve even better performance by avoiding unnecessary memory copy operations. To avoid fast worn-out of certain NVMs, we also propose Heap-Wear, a wear leveling algorithm that more evenly distributes writes in NVM. Evaluation results based on the Google Nexus 5 smartphone show that our solution can effectively enhance smartphone performance and give better wear-leveling of NVM.","author":["Kan Zhong","Tianzheng Wang","Xiao Zhu","Linbo Long","Duo Liu","Weichen Liu","Zili Shao","Edwin H.-M.

Since the seminal Bellcore attack on modular exponentiation, there has been extensive work to discover new fault attacks against cryptographic schemes and develop countermeasures against such attacks. Originally focused on high-level algorithmic descriptions, these efforts increasingly focus on concrete implementations. While lowering the abstraction level leads to new fault attacks, it also makes their discovery significantly more challenging. In order to face this trend, it is therefore desirable to develop principled, tool-supported approaches that allow a systematic analysis of the security of cryptographic implementations against fault attacks. We propose, implement, and evaluate a new approach for finding fault attacks against cryptographic implementations. Our approach is based on identifying implementation-independent mathematical properties, or fault conditions. We choose fault conditions so that it is possible to recover secret data purely by computing on sufficiently many data points that satisfy them. Fault conditions capture the essence of a large number of attacks from the literature, including lattice-based attacks on RSA. Moreover, they provide a basis for discovering automatically new attacks: using fault conditions, we specify the problem of finding faulted implementations as a program synthesis problem. Using a specialized form of program synthesis, we discover multiple faulted attacks on RSA and ECDSA. Several of the attacks found by our tool are new, and of independent interest.","author":["Gilles Barthe","Fran\u00e7ois Dupressoir","Pierre-Alain Fouque","Benjamin Gr\u00e9goire","Jean-Christophe Zapalowicz"],"issue":["CCS '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","November 2014","Pages   1016\u20131027","https://doi.org/10.1145/2660267.2660304"],"date":"03 November 2014","ref":[{"text":"R.

In addition to being able to scale to smaller cell sizes than DRAM, a PCM cell can also store multiple bits per cell (referred to as multilevel cell, or MLC), enabling even greater capacity per bit. However, reading and writing the different bits of data from and to an MLC PCM cell requires different amounts of time: one bit is read or written first, followed by another. Due to this asymmetric access process, the bits in an MLC PCM cell have different access latency and energy depending on which bit in the cell is being read or written.We leverage this observation to design a new way to store and buffer data in MLC PCM devices. While traditional devices couple the bits in each cell next to one another in the address space, our key idea is to logically decouple the bits in each cell into two separate regions depending on their read/write characteristics: fast-read/slow-write bits and slow-read/fast-write bits. We propose a low-overhead hardware/software technique to predict and map data that would benefit from being in each region at runtime. In addition, we show how MLC bit decoupling provides more flexibility in the way data is buffered in the device, enabling more efficient use of existing device buffer space.Our evaluations for a multicore system show that MLC bit decoupling improves system performance by 19.2%, memory energy efficiency by 14.4%, and thread fairness by 19.3% over a state-of-the-art MLC PCM system that couples the bits in its cells. We show that our results are consistent across a variety of workloads and system configurations.","author":["Hanbin Yoon","Justin Meza","Naveen Muralimanohar","Norman P.

In this article, we introduce a new code-scheduling technique for irregular ILP called \u201cselective scheduling\u201d which can be used as a component for superscalar and VLIW compilers. Selective scheduling can compute a wide set of independent operations across all execution paths based on renaming and forward-substitution and can compute available operations across loop iterations if combined with software pipelining. This scheduling approach has better heuristics for determining the usefulness of moving one operation versus moving another and can successfully find useful code motions without resorting to branch profiling. The compile-time overhead of selective scheduling is low due to its incremental computation technique and its controlled code duplication. We parallelized the SPEC integer benchmarks and five AIX utilities without using branch probabilities. The experiments indicate that a fivefold speedup is achievable on realistic resources with a reasonable overhead in compilation time and code expansion and that a solid speedup increase is also obtainable on machines with fewer resources. These results improve previously known characteristics of irregular ILP.","author":["Soo-Mook Moon","Kemal Ebcio\u011flu"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems","Volume 19","Issue 6","Nov. 1997","pp   853\u2013898","https://doi.org/10.1145/267959.269966"],"date":"01 November 1997","ref":[{"text":"AHO, A., SETHI, R., AND ULLMAN, J. 1986.

Unfortunately, the classical translation of refinement types to verification conditions is unsound under lazy evaluation. When checking an expression, such systems implicitly assume that all the free variables in the expression are bound to values. This property is trivially guaranteed by eager, but does not hold under lazy, evaluation. Thus, to be sound and precise, a refinement type system for Haskell and the corresponding verification conditions must take into account which subset of binders actually reduces to values. We present a stratified type system that labels binders as potentially diverging or not, and that (circularly) uses refinement types to verify the labeling. We have implemented our system in LIQUIDHASKELL and present an experimental evaluation of our approach on more than 10,000 lines of widely used Haskell libraries. We show that LIQUIDHASKELL is able to prove 96% of all recursive functions terminating, while requiring a modest 1.7 lines of termination-annotations per 100 lines of code.","author":["Niki Vazou","Eric L.

This is particularly challenging in SRAM, where manufacturing precision and leakage power control are critical issues. To alleviate these challenges, we proposed a novel volatile memory alternative to SRAM called nanowire volatile RAM (NWRAM). Due to NWRAM's regular grid-based layout and innovative circuit style, manufacturing complexities are reduced and, at the same time, considerable benefits are attained in terms of performance and leakage power reduction. In this article we elaborate NWRAM's circuit aspects and manufacturability, and quantify benefits at 16nm technology node through simulation against state-of-the-art 6T-SRAM and gridded 8T-SRAM designs. Our results show that when lower bounds in design rules are considered, 10T-NWRAM's read and write time are 1.38x and 2x faster, and the leakage power is 14x better in comparison to high-performance 6T-SRAM. Similarly the 10T-NWRAM achieves 1.3x and 1.9x read and write performance, and 35x leakage power improvements compared to high-performance 8T-SRAM. 10T-NWRAM's density is comparable to 6T-SRAM and 8T-SRAM for lower bounds, but exhibits higher active power in similar comparisons. This article details all benchmarking results and provides thorough analysis of NWRAM's evaluations.","author":["Mostafizur Rahman","Santosh Khasanvis","Csaba Andras Moritz"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 12","Issue 3","September 2015","Article No.: 30","pp   1\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/2714567"],"date":"21 September 2015","ref":[{"text":"P.

The taxonomic type systems of such knowledge bases are often highly heterogeneous, as they reflect different cultures, languages, and intentions of usage. We present a novel method to the problem of multi-cultural knowledge alignment, which maps each node of a source taxonomy onto a ranked list of most suitable nodes in the target taxonomy. We model this task as combinatorial optimization problems, using integer linear programming and quadratic programming. The quality of the computed alignments is evaluated, using large heterogeneous taxonomies about book categories.","author":["Natalia Prytkova","Gerhard Weikum","Marc Spaniol"],"issue":["WWW '15 Companion: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web","May 2015","Pages   93\u201394","https://doi.org/10.1145/2740908.2742721"],"date":"18 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"R.

The demands of high speed and power efficiency as well as the fault tolerance nature of some applications have promoted the development of approximate adders. This paper reviews current approximate adder designs and provides a comparative evaluation in terms of both error and circuit characteristics. Simulation results show that the equal segmentation adder (ESA) is the most hardware-efficient design, but it has the lowest accuracy in terms of error rate (ER) and mean relative error distance (MRED). The error-tolerant adder type II (ETAII), the speculative carry select adder (SCSA) and the accuracy-configurable approximate adder (ACAA) are equally accurate (provided that the same parameters are used), however ETATII incurs the lowest power-delay-product (PDP) among them. The almost correct adder (ACA) is the most power consuming scheme with a moderate accuracy. The lower-part-OR adder (LOA) is the slowest, but it is highly efficient in power dissipation.","author":["Honglan Jiang","Jie Han","Fabrizio Lombardi"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '15: Proceedings of the 25th edition on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2015","Pages   343\u2013348","https://doi.org/10.1145/2742060.2743760"],"date":"20 May 2015","ref":[{"text":"K.

While a good approximation for some operation types, this fails to consider technology mapping, where a group of logic operations can be mapped to a single look-up table (LUT) and together incur one LUT worth of delay. We propose an exact formulation of the throughput-constrained, mapping-aware pipeline scheduling problem for FPGA-targeted high-level synthesis with area minimization being a primary objective. By taking this cross-layered approach, our technique is able to mitigate the pessimism inherent in static delay estimates and reduce the usage of LUTs and pipeline registers.

They range from healthcare to video surveillance. As the number of applications and their associated performance requirements grow rapidly, more and more powerful, flexible and power efficient computing units are necessary. In such a context, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) architectures present a good trade-off between performance and flexibility. However, they consume high static power and can hardly be associated with power gating techniques due to their long context restoring phase. In this paper, we propose to integrate non-volatile resistive memories in configuration cells in order to instantly restore the FPGA context. We then show that if the circuit is in 'ON' state for less than 42% of time, non-volatile FPGA starts saving energy compared to classical FPGA. Finally, for a typical application with only 1% of time spent in 'ON' state, the energy gain reaches 50%.","author":["Ogun Turkyilmaz","Santhosh Onkaraiah","Marina Reyboz","Fabien Clermidy","Hraziia","Costin Anghel","Jean-Michel Portal","Marc Bocquet"],"issue":["NANOARCH '12: Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","July 2012","Pages   101\u2013108","https://doi.org/10.1145/2765491.2765510"],"date":"04 July 2012","ref":[{"text":"X.

Dependent terms are predominantly identified using lexical frequency statistics, assuming that (a) if terms co-occur often enough in some corpus, they are semantically dependent; (b) the more often they co-occur, the more semantically dependent they are. This assumption is not always correct: the frequency of co-occurring terms can be separate from the strength of their semantic dependence. E.g. \"red tape\" might be overall less frequent than \"tape measure\" in some corpus, but this does not mean that \"red\"+\"tape\" are less dependent than \"tape\"+\"measure\". This is especially the case for non-compositional phrases, i.e. phrases whose meaning cannot be composed from the individual meanings of their terms (such as the phrase \"red tape\" meaning bureaucracy). Motivated by this lack of distinction between the frequency and strength of term dependence in IR, we present a principled approach for handling term dependence in queries, using both lexical frequency and semantic evidence. We focus on non-compositional phrases, extending a recent unsupervised model for their detection (Kiela & Clark 2013) to IR. Our approach, integrated into ranking using Markov Random Fields (Metzler & Croft 2005), yields effectiveness gains over competitive TREC baselines, showing that there is still room for improvement in the very well-studied area of term dependence in IR.","author":["Christina Lioma","Jakob Grue Simonsen","Birger Larsen","Niels Dalum Hansen"],"issue":["SIGIR '15: Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","August 2015","Pages   595\u2013604","https://doi.org/10.1145/2766462.2767717"],"date":"09 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"T.

Their embodiments, from software and HDL program down to device-level netlist and mask data, represent carefully guarded intellectual property (IP). Hence, design methodologies based on IP reuse require new mechanisms to protect the rights of IP producers and owners. This paper establishes principles of watermarking-based IP protection, where a watermark is a mechanism for identification that is (i) nearly invisible to human and machine inspection, (ii) difficult to remove, and (iii) permanently embedded as an integral part of the design.

In U.S. law, unintentional bias is encoded via disparate impact, which occurs when a selection process has widely different outcomes for different groups, even as it appears to be neutral. This legal determination hinges on a definition of a protected class (ethnicity, gender) and an explicit description of the process. When computers are involved, determining disparate impact (and hence bias) is harder. It might not be possible to disclose the process. In addition, even if the process is open, it might be hard to elucidate in a legal setting how the algorithm makes its decisions. Instead of requiring access to the process, we propose making inferences based on the data it uses. We present four contributions. First, we link disparate impact to a measure of classification accuracy that while known, has received relatively little attention. Second, we propose a test for disparate impact based on how well the protected class can be predicted from the other attributes. Third, we describe methods by which data might be made unbiased. Finally, we present empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our test for disparate impact and our approach for both masking bias and preserving relevant information in the data. Interestingly, our approach resembles some actual selection practices that have recently received legal scrutiny.","author":["Michael Feldman","Sorelle A.

Due to the financial gains associated with positive reviews, however, opinion spam has become a widespread problem, with often paid spam reviewers writing fake reviews to unjustly promote or demote certain products or businesses. Existing approaches to opinion spam have successfully but separately utilized linguistic clues of deception, behavioral footprints, or relational ties between agents in a review system. In this work, we propose a new holistic approach called SPEAGLE that utilizes clues from all metadata (text, timestamp, rating) as well as relational data (network), and harness them collectively under a unified framework to spot suspicious users and reviews, as well as products targeted by spam. Moreover, our method can efficiently and seamlessly integrate semi-supervision, i.e., a (small) set of labels if available, without requiring any training or changes in its underlying algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of SPEAGLE on three real-world review datasets from Yelp.com with filtered (spam) and recommended (non-spam) reviews, where it significantly outperforms several baselines and state-of-the-art methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest scale quantitative evaluation performed to date for the opinion spam problem.","author":["Shebuti Rayana","Leman Akoglu"],"issue":["KDD '15: Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2015","Pages   985\u2013994","https://doi.org/10.1145/2783258.2783370"],"date":"10 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"L.

Because the estimator of 0-bit CWS constitutes a positive definite kernel, this method can be naturally applied to large-scale data mining problems. Basically, if we feed the sampled data from 0-bit CWS to a highly efficient linear classifier (e.g., linear SVM), we effectively (and approximately) train a nonlinear classifier based on the min-max kernel. The accuracy improves as we increase the sample size. In this paper, we first demonstrate, through an extensive classification study using kernel machines, that the min-max kernel often provides an effective measure of similarity for nonnegative data. This helps justify the use of min-max kernel. However, as the min-max kernel is nonlinear and might be difficult to be used for industrial applications with massive data, we propose to linearize the min-max kernel via 0-bit CWS, a simplification of the original CWS method. The previous remarkable work on {\\em consistent weighted sampling (CWS)} produces samples in the form of (i*, t*) where the i* records the location (and in fact also the weights) information analogous to the samples produced by classical minwise hashing on binary data. Because the t* is theoretically unbounded, it was not immediately clear how to effectively implement CWS for building large-scale linear classifiers. We provide a simple solution by discarding t* (which we refer to as the \"0-bit\" scheme). Via an extensive empirical study, we show that this 0-bit scheme does not lose essential information. We then apply 0-bit CWS for building linear classifiers to approximate min-max kernel classifiers, as extensively validated on a wide range of public datasets. We expect this work will generate interests among data mining practitioners who would like to efficiently utilize the nonlinear information of non-binary and nonnegative data.","author":["Ping Li"],"issue":["KDD '15: Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2015","Pages   665\u2013674","https://doi.org/10.1145/2783258.2783406"],"date":"10 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"R.

Quantum computing is limited, however, by the challenges of decoherence: i.e., a quantum state can only be maintained for short windows of time before it decoheres. While quantum error correction codes can protect against decoherence, fast execution time is the best defense against decoherence, so efficient architectures and effective scheduling algorithms are necessary. This paper proposes the Multi-SIMD QC architecture and then proposes and evaluates effective schedulers to map benchmark descriptions onto Multi-SIMD architectures. The Multi-SIMD model consists of a small number of SIMD regions, each of which may support operations on up to thousands of qubits per cycle.Efficient Multi-SIMD operation requires efficient scheduling. This work develops schedulers to reduce communication requirements of qubits between operating regions, while also improving parallelism.We find that communication to global memory is a dominant cost in QC. We also note that many quantum benchmarks have long serial operation paths (although each operation may be data parallel). To exploit this characteristic, we introduce Longest-Path-First Scheduling (LPFS) which pins operations to SIMD regions to keep data in-place and reduce communication to memory. The use of small, local scratchpad memories also further reduces communication. Our results show a 3% to 308% improvement for LPFS over conventional scheduling algorithms, and an additional 3% to 64% improvement using scratchpad memories. Our work is the most comprehensive software-to-quantum toolflow published to date, with efficient and practical scheduling techniques that reduce communication and increase parallelism for full-scale quantum code executing up to a trillion quantum gate operations.","author":["Jeff Heckey","Shruti Patil","Ali JavadiAbhari","Adam Holmes","Daniel Kudrow","Kenneth R.

Many applications would benefit from such device-free tracking, e.g. elderly people surveillance, intruder detection, gaming, etc. In this work, we present a system, named Tadar, for tracking moving objects without instrumenting them us- ing COTS RFID readers and tags. It works even through walls and behind closed doors. It aims to enable a see-through-wall technology that is low-cost, compact, and accessible to civilian purpose. In traditional RFID systems, tags modulate their IDs on the backscatter signals, which is vulnerable to the interferences from the ambient reflections. Unlike past work, which considers such vulnerability as detrimental, our design exploits it to detect surrounding objects even through walls. Specifically, we attach a group of RFID tags on the outer wall and logically convert them into an antenna array, receiving the signals reflected off moving objects. This paper introduces two main innovations. First, it shows how to eliminate the flash (e.g. the stronger reflections off walls) and extract the reflections from the backscatter signals. Second, it shows how to track the moving object based on HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and its reflections. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to implement a through-wall tracking using the COTS RFID systems. Empirical measurements with a prototype show that Tadar can detect objects behind 5\" hollow wall and 8\" concrete wall, and achieve median tracking errors of 7.8cm and 20cm in the X and Y dimensions.","author":["Lei Yang","Qiongzheng Lin","Xiangyang Li","Tianci Liu","Yunhao Liu"],"issue":["MobiCom '15: Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking","September 2015","Pages   487\u2013499","https://doi.org/10.1145/2789168.2790100"],"date":"07 September 2015","ref":[{"text":"Radar Vision, Time Domain Corporation. http://www.timedomain.com.TimeDomain.","order":1},{"text":"EPC Gen2, EPCglobal. www.gs1.org/epcglobal.","order":2},{"text":"LawrenceLivermore, National Laboratory. https://www.llnl.gov.","order":3},{"text":"Seeing through walls-MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5xmo7iJ7KA.","order":4},{"text":"Speedway installation and operations guide.","order":5},{"text":"F.

To this end, some proposed models (e.g., TransE) embed entities and relations of a KG into a \"point\" vector space by optimizing a global loss function which ensures the scores of positive triplets are higher than negative ones. We notice that these models always regard all entities and relations in a same manner and ignore their (un)certainties. In fact, different entities and relations may contain different certainties, which makes identical certainty insufficient for modeling. Therefore, this paper switches to density-based embedding and propose KG2E for explicitly modeling the certainty of entities and relations, which learn the representations of KGs in the space of multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions. Each entity/relation is represented by a Gaussian distribution, where the mean denotes its position and the covariance (currently with diagonal covariance) can properly represent its certainty. In addition, compared with the symmetric measures used in point-based methods, we employ the KL-divergence for scoring triplets, which is a natural asymmetry function for effectively modeling multiple types of relations. We have conducted extensive experiments on link prediction and triplet classification with multiple benchmark datasets (WordNet and Freebase). Our experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively model the (un)certainties of entities and relations in a KG, and it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods (including TransH and TransR).","author":["Shizhu He","Kang Liu","Guoliang Ji","Jun Zhao"],"issue":["CIKM '15: Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management","October 2015","Pages   623\u2013632","https://doi.org/10.1145/2806416.2806502"],"date":"17 October 2015","ref":[{"text":"K.

However, it is difficult to semantically link together these two media forms, even when they feature identical or very similar objects. We propose a joint embedding space populated by both 3D shapes and 2D images of objects, where the distances between embedded entities reflect similarity between the underlying objects. This joint embedding space facilitates comparison between entities of either form, and allows for cross-modality retrieval. We construct the embedding space using 3D shape similarity measure, as 3D shapes are more pure and complete than their appearance in images, leading to more robust distance metrics. We then employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to \"purify\" images by muting distracting factors. The CNN is trained to map an image to a point in the embedding space, so that it is close to a point attributed to a 3D model of a similar object to the one depicted in the image. This purifying capability of the CNN is accomplished with the help of a large amount of training data consisting of images synthesized from 3D shapes. Our joint embedding allows cross-view image retrieval, image-based shape retrieval, as well as shape-based image retrieval. We evaluate our method on these retrieval tasks and show that it consistently out-performs state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrate the usability of a joint embedding in a number of additional applications.","author":["Yangyan Li","Hao Su","Charles Ruizhongtai Qi","Noa Fish","Daniel Cohen-Or","Leonidas J.

Our approach leverages on the recent success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on face recognition problems. Unlike the settings often assumed there, far less labeled data is typically available for training emotion classification systems. Our method is therefore designed with the goal of simplifying the problem domain by removing confounding factors from the input images, with an emphasis on image illumination variations. This, in an effort to reduce the amount of data required to effectively train deep CNN models. To this end, we propose novel transformations of image intensities to 3D spaces, designed to be invariant to monotonic photometric transformations. These are applied to CASIA Webface images which are then used to train an ensemble of multiple architecture CNNs on multiple representations. Each model is then fine-tuned with limited emotion labeled training data to obtain final classification models. Our method was tested on the Emotion Recognition in the Wild Challenge (EmotiW 2015), Static Facial Expression Recognition sub-challenge (SFEW) and shown to provide a substantial, 15.36% improvement over baseline results (40% gain in performance).","author":["Gil Levi","Tal Hassner"],"issue":["ICMI '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM on International Conference on Multimodal Interaction","November 2015","Pages   503\u2013510","https://doi.org/10.1145/2818346.2830587"],"date":"09 November 2015","ref":[{"text":"T.

This problem can be solved by constructing the Voronoi diagram of the griven sites and then locating the query point inone of its regions. Two algorithms are given, one that constructs the Voronoi diagram in O(n log n) time, and another that inserts a new sit on O(n) time. Both are based on the use of the Voronoi dual, or Delaunay triangulation, and are simple enough to be of practical value. the simplicity of both algorithms can be attributed to the separation of the geometrical and topological aspects of the problem and to the use of two simple but powerful primitives,  a geometric predicate and an operator for manipulating the topology of the diagram. The topology is represented by a new data structure for generalized diagrams, that is, embeddings of graphs in two-dimensional manifolds. This structure represents simultaneously an embedding, its dual, and its mirror image. Furthermore, just two operators are sufficients for building and modifying arbitrary diagrams.","author":["Leonidas Guibas","Jorge Stolfi"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 4","Issue 2","April 1985","pp   74\u2013123","https://doi.org/10.1145/282918.282923"],"date":"01 April 1985","ref":[{"text":"BAUMGART, B.G.

The questions, then, are what and how accelerators should be designed, and what software support is required. Our accelerator design approach stems from the observation that many efficient and portable software implementations rely on high performance software libraries with well-established application programming interfaces (APIs). We propose the integration of hardware accelerators on 3D-stacked memory that explicitly targets the memory-bounded operations within high performance libraries. The fixed APIs with limited configurability simplify the design of the accelerators, while ensuring that the accelerators have wide applicability. With our software support that automatically converts library APIs to accelerator invocations, an additional advantage of our approach is that library-based legacy code automatically gains the benefit of memory-side accelerators without requiring a reimplementation. On average, the legacy code using our proposed MEmory Accelerated Library (MEALib) improves performance and energy efficiency for individual operations in Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL) by 38x and 75x, respectively. For a real-world signal processing application that employs Intel MKL, MEALib attains more than 10x better energy efficiency.","author":["Qi Guo","Tze-Meng Low","Nikolaos Alachiotis","Berkin Akin","Larry Pileggi","James C.

Many previous methods on 3D mesh labeling achieve impressive performances by using predefined geometric features. However, the generalization abilities of such low-level features, which are heuristically designed to process specific meshes, are often insufficient to handle all types of meshes. To address this problem, we propose to learn a robust mesh representation that can adapt to various 3D meshes by using CNNs. In our approach, CNNs are first trained in a supervised manner by using a large pool of classical geometric features. In the training process, these low-level features are nonlinearly combined and hierarchically compressed to generate a compact and effective representation for each triangle on the mesh. Based on the trained CNNs and the mesh representations, a label vector is initialized for each triangle to indicate its probabilities of belonging to various object parts. Eventually, a graph-based mesh-labeling algorithm is adopted to optimize the labels of triangles by considering the label consistencies. Experimental results on several public benchmarks show that the proposed approach is robust for various 3D meshes, and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches as well as classic learning algorithms in recognizing mesh labels.","author":["Kan Guo","Dongqing Zou","Xiaowu Chen"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 35","Issue 1","December 2015","Article No.: 3","pp   1\u201312","https://doi.org/10.1145/2835487"],"date":"29 December 2015","ref":[{"text":"O.

This paper uses the simple reference behavior of a linked-list traversal as a proxy to study the performance potentials of accelerating these applications on shared-memory processor-FPGA systems. The linked-list traversal is parameterized by node layout in memory, per-node data payload size, payload dependence, and traversal concurrency to capture the main performance effects of different pointer-based data structures and algorithms. The paper explores the trade-offs over a wide range of implementation options available on shared-memory processor-FPGA architectures, including using tightly-coupled processor assistance. We make observations of the key effects on currently available systems including the Xilinx Zynq, the Intel QuickAssist QPI FPGA Platform, and the Convey HC-2. The key results show: (1) the FPGA fabric is least efficient when traversing a single list with non-sequential node layout and a small payload size; (2) processor assistance can help alleviate this shortcoming; and (3) when appropriate, a fabric only approach that interleaves multiple linked list traversals is an effective way to maximize traversal performance.","author":["Gabriel Weisz","Joseph Melber","Yu Wang","Kermin Fleming","Eriko Nurvitadhi","James C.

In particular, the mismatch between vergence and accommodation cues inherent to most stereoscopic displays has been a long standing challenge. In this paper, we evaluate several adaptive display modes afforded by focus-tunable optics or actuated displays that have the promise to mitigate visual discomfort caused by the vergence-accommodation conflict, and improve performance in VR environments. We also explore monovision as an unconventional mode that allows each eye of an observer to accommodate to a different distance. While this technique is common practice in ophthalmology, we are the first to report its effectiveness for VR applications with a custom built set up. We demonstrate that monovision and other focus-tunable display modes can provide better user experiences and improve user performance in terms of reaction times and accuracy, particularly for nearby simulated distances in VR.","author":["Robert Konrad","Emily A.

For a main-memory database, however, these indexes consume a large fraction of the total memory available and are thus a major source of storage overhead of in-memory databases. To reduce this overhead, we propose using a two-stage index: The first stage ingests all incoming entries and is kept small for fast read and write operations. The index periodically migrates entries from the first stage to the second, which uses a more compact, read-optimized data structure. Our first contribution is hybrid index, a dual-stage index architecture that achieves both space efficiency and high performance. Our second contribution is Dual-Stage Transformation (DST), a set of guidelines for converting any order-preserving index structure into a hybrid index. Our third contribution is applying DST to four popular order-preserving index structures and evaluating them in both standalone microbenchmarks and a full in-memory DBMS using several transaction processing workloads. Our results show that hybrid indexes provide comparable throughput to the original ones while reducing the memory overhead by up to 70%.","author":["Huanchen Zhang","David G.

Many applications have turned to periodically checkpointing full database state. However, existing checkpointing methods---even those which avoid freezing the storage layer---often come with significant costs to operation throughput, end-to-end latency, and total memory usage. This paper presents Checkpointing Asynchronously using Logical Consistency (CALC), a lightweight, asynchronous technique for capturing database snapshots that does not require a physical point of consistency to create a checkpoint, and avoids conspicuous latency spikes incurred by other database snapshotting schemes. Our experiments show that CALC can capture frequent checkpoints across a variety of transactional workloads with extremely small cost to transactional throughput and low additional memory usage compared to other state-of-the-art checkpointing systems.","author":["Kun Ren","Thaddeus Diamond","Daniel J.

A fundamental problem in a DSDPS is the scheduling problem (i.e., assigning workload to workers/machines) with the objective of minimizing average end-to-end tuple processing time. A widely-used solution is to distribute workload evenly over machines in the cluster in a round-robin manner, which is obviously not efficient due to lack of consideration for communication delay. Model-based approaches (such as queueing theory) do not work well either due to the high complexity of the system environment.We aim to develop a novel model-free approach that can learn to well control a DSDPS from its experience rather than accurate and mathematically solvable system models, just as a human learns a skill (such as cooking, driving, swimming, etc). Specifically, we, for the first time, propose to leverage emerging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for enabling model-free control in DSDPSs; and present design, implementation and evaluation of a novel and highly effective DRL-based control framework, which minimizes average end-to-end tuple processing time by jointly learning the system environment via collecting very limited runtime statistics data and making decisions under the guidance of powerful Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). To validate and evaluate the proposed framework, we implemented it based on a widely-used DSDPS, Apache Storm, and tested it with three representative applications: continuous queries, log stream processing and word count (stream version). Extensive experimental results show 1) Compared to Storm's default scheduler and the state-of-the-art model-based method, the proposed framework reduces average tuple processing by 33.5% and 14.0% respectively on average. 2) The proposed framework can quickly reach a good scheduling solution during online learning, which justifies its practicability for online control in DSDPSs.","author":["Teng Li","Zhiyuan Xu","Jian Tang","Yanzhi Wang"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 6","February 2018","pp   705\u2013718","https://doi.org/10.14778/3199517.3199521"],"date":"01 June 2014","ref":[{"text":"AgigaTech.

More specifically, at the device-level, high-Vt FinFETs are adopted for the 6T SRAM cell, which significantly reduces the leakage power and improves static noise margins. However, due to the lower ON current, the bit-line delay of the read access is increased. Accordingly, at the circuit-level, the voltage level of assist circuits, and at the architecture-level (i.e., the array organization), key parameters of the SRAM array are jointly optimized to derive a design that results in the minimum energy-delay product point. By using the proposed optimization framework, for SRAM array capacities ranging from 1KB to 16KB, on average 59% lower energy-delay product with maximum 12% (and on average 9%) performance penalty is achieved.","author":["Alireza Shafaei","Hassan Afzali-Kusha","Massoud Pedram"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 107","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898044"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS). {Online}.

Three techniques, including cell cluster, asymmetric sensing amplifier (ASA) and self-error-detection-correction (SEDC), are proposed to implement the PDS concept. Our experimental results show that the PDS scheme with the 3T3MTJ cell cluster can reduce the area (~21.7%) and write power (~25.6%) of the differential sensing (DS) scheme while improve the read reliability (read margin, ~35.6%) of the typical sensing (TS) scheme for a 16 Mbit cache. Furthermore, the PDS scheme with the 1T3MTJ cell cluster can outperform both the TS and DS schemes in terms of area (~40.0%, ~66.1%), read latency (~16.6%, ~32.1%), read power (~16.7%, ~37.1%), write latency (~5.4%, 16.3%) and write power (~18.6%, ~43.4%).","author":["Wang Kang","Tingting Pang","Bi Wu","Weifeng Lv","Youguang Zhang","Guanyu Sun","Weisheng Zhao"],"issue":["DAC '16: Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Design Automation Conference","June 2016","Article No.: 120","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2897937.2898058"],"date":"05 June 2016","ref":[{"text":"\"International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors\".

These systems must provide both highly accurate, secured and quick processing and delivery of vast amount of data. In addition, wearable biomedical devices are used in inpatient, outpatient, and at home e-Patient care that must constantly monitor the patient's biomedical and physiological signals 24/7. These biomedical applications require sampling and processing multiple streams of physiological signals with strict power and area footprint. The processing typically consists of feature extraction, data fusion, and classification stages that require a large number of digital signal processing and machine learning kernels. In response to these requirements, in this paper, a low-power, domain-specific many-core accelerator named Power Efficient Nano Clusters (PENC) is proposed to map and execute the kernels of these applications. Experimental results show that the manycore is able to reduce energy consumption by up to 80% and 14% for DSP and machine learning kernels, respectively, when optimally parallelized. The performance of the proposed PENC manycore when acting as a coprocessor to an Intel Atom processor is compared with existing commercial off-the-shelf embedded processing platforms including Intel Atom, Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, and NVIDIA TK1 ARM-A15 with GPU SoC. The results show that the PENC manycore architecture reduces the energy by as much as 10X while outperforming all off-the-shelf embedded processing platforms across all studied machine learning classifiers.","author":["Adam Page","Nasrin Attaran","Colin Shea","Houman Homayoun","Tinoosh Mohsenin"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '16: Proceedings of the 26th edition on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2016","Pages   63\u201368","https://doi.org/10.1145/2902961.2902986"],"date":"18 May 2016","ref":[{"text":"J.

The successful deployment of DNN based applications pose challenges for a cross platform software framework that enable multiple user scenarios, including offline model training on HPC clusters and online recognition in embedded environments. Existing DNN frameworks are mostly focused on a closed format CUDA implementations, which is limiting of deploy breadth of DNN hardware systems. This paper presents OpenCL\u2122 caffe, which targets in transforming the popular CUDA based framework caffe [1] into open standard OpenCL backend. The goal is to enable a heterogeneous platform compatible DNN framework and achieve competitive performance based on OpenCL tool chain. Due to DNN models' high complexity, we use a two-phase strategy. First we introduce the OpenCL porting strategies that guarantee algorithm convergence; then we analyze OpenCL's performance bottlenecks in DNN domain and propose a few optimization techniques including batched manner data layout and multiple command queues to better map the problem size into existing BLAS library, improve hardware resources utilization and boost OpenCL runtime efficiency. We verify OpenCL caffe's successful offline training and online recognition on both server-end and consumer-end GPUs. Experimental results show that the phase-two's optimized OpenCL caffe achieved a 4.5x speedup without modifying BLAS library. The user can directly run mainstream DNN models and achieves the best performance for a specific processors by choosing the optimal batch number depending on H/W properties and input data size.","author":["Junli Gu","Yibing Liu","Yuan Gao","Maohua Zhu"],"issue":["IWOCL '16: Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on OpenCL","April 2016","Article No.: 8","Pages   1\u20135","https://doi.org/10.1145/2909437.2909443"],"date":"19 April 2016","ref":[{"text":"caffe. http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org.","order":1},{"text":"Cifar. http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.","order":2},{"text":"Convnet. https://github.com/sdemyanov/ConvNet.","order":3},{"text":"Mxnet. https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet.","order":4},{"text":"Tensor flow. http://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials.","order":5},{"text":"Threefry random generator. https://www.deshawresearch.com/resources_random123.html.","order":6},{"text":"K.

Different from the leading approaches, who all learn from the 1,000 classes defined in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, we investigate how to leverage the complete ImageNet hierarchy for pre-training deep networks. To deal with the problems of over-specific classes and classes with few images, we introduce a bottom-up and top-down approach for reorganization of the ImageNet hierarchy based on all its 21,814 classes and more than 14 million images. Experiments on the TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection 2013 and 2015 datasets show that video representations derived from the layers of a deep neural network pre-trained with our reorganized hierarchy i) improves over standard pre-training, ii) is complementary among different reorganizations, iii) maintains the benefits of fusion with other modalities, and v) leads to state-of-the-art event detection results.

It provides a sound translation of lambda-terms (on the high-level) to their realizations by stream transducers (on the low-level), where the internal states of the latter (called memories) are exploited for accommodating algebraic effects of Plotkin and Power. The translation is compositional, hence ``denotational,'' where transducers are inductively composed using an adaptation of Barbosa's coalgebraic component calculus. In the current paper we extend the mGoI framework and provide a systematic treatment of recursion---an essential feature of programming languages that was however missing in our previous work. Specifically, we introduce two new fixed-point operators in the coalgebraic component calculus. The two follow the previous work on recursion in GoI and are called Girard style and Mackie style: the former obviously exhibits some nice domain-theoretic properties, while the latter allows simpler construction. Their equivalence is established on the categorical (or, traced monoidal) level of abstraction, and is therefore generic with respect to the choice of algebraic effects. Our main result is an adequacy theorem of our mGoI translation, against Plotkin and Power's operational semantics for algebraic effects.","author":["Koko Muroya","Naohiko Hoshino","Ichiro Hasuo"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 51","Issue 1","January 2016","pp   748\u2013760","https://doi.org/10.1145/2914770.2837672"],"date":"11 January 2016","ref":[{"text":"S.

This question arises in cellular networks, where the uplink and the downlink operate on different frequencies. Addressing this question is critical for the deployment of key 5G solutions such as massive MIMO, multi-user MIMO, and distributed MIMO, which require channel state information. We introduce R2-F2, a system that enables LTE base stations to infer the downlink channels to a client by observing the uplink channels from that client. By doing so, R2-F2 extends the concept of reciprocity to LTE cellular networks, where downlink and uplink transmissions occur on different frequency bands. It also removes a major hurdle for the deployment of 5G MIMO solutions. We have implemented R2-F2 in software radios and integrated it within the LTE OFDM physical layer. Our results show that the channels computed by R2-F2 deliver accurate MIMO beamforming (to within 0.7~dB of beamforming gains with ground truth channels) while eliminating channel feedback overhead.","author":["Deepak Vasisht","Swarun Kumar","Hariharan Rahul","Dina Katabi"],"issue":["SIGCOMM '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGCOMM Conference","August 2016","Pages   398\u2013411","https://doi.org/10.1145/2934872.2934895"],"date":"22 August 2016","ref":[{"text":"3rd Generation Partnership Project.

To alleviate these difficulties and to develop and share knowledge, the community needs open architecture frameworks for simulation, synthesis, and software exploration which support extensibility, scalability, and configurability, alongside an established base of verification tools and supported software. In this paper we present OpenPiton, an open source framework for building scalable architecture research prototypes from 1 core to 500 million cores. OpenPiton is the world's first open source, general-purpose, multithreaded manycore processor and framework. OpenPiton leverages the industry hardened OpenSPARC T1 core with modifications and builds upon it with a scratch-built, scalable uncore creating a flexible, modern manycore design. In addition, OpenPiton provides synthesis and backend scripts for ASIC and FPGA to enable other researchers to bring their designs to implementation. OpenPiton provides a complete verification infrastructure of over 8000 tests, is supported by mature software tools, runs full-stack multiuser Debian Linux, and is written in industry standard Verilog. Multiple implementations of OpenPiton have been created including a taped-out 25-core implementation in IBM's 32nm process and multiple Xilinx FPGA prototypes.","author":["Jonathan Balkind","Michael McKeown","Yaosheng Fu","Tri Nguyen","Yanqi Zhou","Alexey Lavrov","Mohammad Shahrad","Adi Fuchs","Samuel Payne","Xiaohua Liang","Matthew Matl","David Wentzlaff"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 51","Issue 4","April 2016","pp   217\u2013232","https://doi.org/10.1145/2954679.2872414"],"date":"25 March 2016","ref":[{"text":"Beri processor 'arcina' release 1. https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/beri.

Unlike state-of-the-art, our methodology generates various design points by adapting three key parameters: (1) different types of elementary approximate multiply modules, (2) different types of elementary adder modules for summing the partial products, and (3) selection of bits for approximation in a wide-bit multiplier design. Generation and exploration of such a design space enables a wide-range of multipliers with varying approximation levels, each exhibiting distinct area, power, and output quality, and thereby facilitates approximate computing at higher abstraction levels. We synthesized our designs using Synopsys Design Compiler with a TSMC 45nm technology library and verified using ModelSim gatelevel simulations. Power and quality evaluations for various designs are performed using PrimeTime and behavioral models, respectively. The selected designs are then deployed in a JPEG application. For reproducibility and to facilitate further research and development at higher abstraction layers, we have released the RTL and behavioral models of these approximate multipliers and adders as an open-source library at https://sourceforge.net/projects/lpaclib/.","author":["Semeen Rehman","Walaa El-Harouni","Muhammad Shafique","Akash Kumar","J\u00f6rg Henkel"],"issue":["ICCAD '16: Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2016","Article No.: 80","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967005"],"date":"07 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"R.

These may shorten the time to failure (TTF) of fabricated chips unexpectedly. This paper focuses on critical path isolation, which increases timing slack of non-intrinsic critical paths and decreases timing error occurrence probability in the circuit, and proposes a design methodology of isolated circuits for TTF extension and/or lower voltage operation. The proposed methodology selects a set of FFs for isolation using ILP so that it maximumly reduces the sum of gate-wise failure probabilities. We evaluated MTTF (Mean Time To Failure) of circuits with/without critical path isolation and examined how much supply voltage could be reduced without MTTF degradation. Evaluation results show that circuits with the proposed critical path isolation achieved 25% supply voltage reduction with 1.4% area overhead. With the same supply voltage, MTTF was improved by 14 orders of magnitude.","author":["Yutaka Masuda","Masanori Hashimoto","Takao Onoye"],"issue":["ICCAD '16: Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2016","Article No.: 63","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967019"],"date":"07 November 2016","ref":[{"text":"B.

This paper proposes a new view of logic design with the name of Complement Based Logic Design (CBLD) has been presented for modeling and optimization of some arithmetic building blocks which have used a kind of conditional operation in their input stage, output stage or both. These conditional operations mostly are in the arithmetic building blocks and they could be: conditional add/sub by a constant number, or conditional complement and also MUX modules for the final output selection at the output stages. Also, CBLD can cover multi stages conditional blocks and pack them all together as one block with some input control signals. All these optimization states with the use of CBLD leads to decreasing the number of logic gates, as a result it also improves the area, power efficiency, and the speed. In this work CBLD functionality verified by applying it on conventional BCD adder/subtractor, an optimized module of BCD adder/subtractor and an optimized conditional module used in a parallel decimal multiplier. Comparison of CBLD design with its counterpart shows significant area and power efficiency with the speed improvement.","author":["Nikhil Patil","Teja Geddamuri","Tooraj Nikoubin"],"issue":["ICCCNT '16: Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies","July 2016","Article No.: 13","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/2967878.2967892"],"date":"06 July 2016","ref":[{"text":"Nikhil Patil et al, \"RCA with conditional BEC in CSLA structure for area-power efficiency\", IEEE 6th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies, 6th ICCCNT, July 2015.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2015.7395199","order":1},{"text":"Alp Arslan Bayrakci, Ahmet Akkas, \"Reduced Delay BCD Adder\", IEEE International Conf. on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors(ASAP 2007), Volume-Issue: 9--11, Page(s): 266--271, July 2007.","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2007.4429991","order":2},{"text":"Sundaresan C. et al, \"Modified reduced delay BCD adder,\" Int. conf. on Biomedical Eng.

ION attempts to achieve several ambitious goals that have not been simultaneously achieved before (not even on Linux). Different from managing regular memory in the system, ION is designed to share and manage memory with special constraints, e.g., physically contiguous memory. Despite the great flexibility and performance benefits offered, such a critical subsystem, as we discover, unfortunately has flawed security assumptions and designs. In this paper, we systematically analyze ION related vulnerabilities from conceptual root causes to detailed implementation decisions. Since ION is often customized heavily for different Android devices, the specific vulnerabilities often manifest themselves differently. By conducting a range of runtime testing as well as static analysis, we are able to uncover a large number of serious vulnerabilities on the latest Android devices (e.g., Nexus 6P running Android 6.0 and 7.0 preview) such as denial-of-service and dumping memory from the system and arbitrary applications (e.g., email content, passwords). Finally, we offer suggestions on how to redesign the ION subsystem to eliminate these flaws. We believe that the lessons learned can help guide the future design of similar memory management subsystems.","author":["Hang Zhang","Dongdong She","Zhiyun Qian"],"issue":["CCS '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2016","Pages   1663\u20131674","https://doi.org/10.1145/2976749.2978320"],"date":"24 October 2016","ref":[{"text":"https://sites.google.com/a/androidionhackdemo.net/androidionhackdemo/.","order":1},{"text":"Android Low Memory Killer. https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common.git/","order":2},{"text":"/android-3.4/drivers/staging/android/lowmemorykiller.c.","order":3},{"text":"Android MediaServer Bug Traps Phones in Endless Reboots. http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/android-mediaserver-bug-traps-phones-in-endless-reboots/.","order":4},{"text":"Arm TrustZone Technology. http://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/trustzone/.","order":5},{"text":"Device Tree. https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/usage-model.txt.","order":6},{"text":"Integer Overflow leading to Heap Corruption while Unflattening GraphicBuffer. http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Mar/63.","order":7},{"text":"STAC - Static Taint Analysis for C. http://code.google.com/p/tanalysis/.","order":8},{"text":"The Android ION memory allocator. https://lwn.net/Articles/480055/, 2012.","order":9},{"text":"Patch: sparc32: dma_alloc_coherent must honour GFP_ZERO. https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/386217/, 2014.","order":10},{"text":"Y.

A key requirement for IoT applications is the power consumption to allow very high autonomy in the case of battery-powered systems. Depending on the application, such devices will be most of the time in a low-power mode (sleep mode) and will wake up only when there is a task to accomplish (active mode). Emerging non-volatile memory technologies are seen as a very attractive solution to design ultra-low-power systems. Among these technologies, magnetic random access memory is a promising candidate, as it combines non-volatility, high density, reasonable latency, and low leakage. Integration of non-volatility as a new feature of memories has the great potential to allow full data retention after a complete shutdown with a fast wake-up time. This article explores the benefits of having a non-volatile processor to enable ultra-low-power IoT devices.","author":["Sophiane Senni","Lionel Torres","Gilles Sassatelli","Abdoulaye Gamatie"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 13","Issue 2","March 2017","Article No.: 17","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3001936"],"date":"01 December 2016","ref":[{"text":"Ali Ahari, Hossein Asadi, Behnam Khaleghi, and Mehdi B.

However, it is still difficult to build and deploy chatbots. Developers need to handle the coordination of the cognitive services to build the chatbot interface, integrate the chatbot with external services, and worry about extensibility, scalability, and maintenance. In this work, we present the architecture and prototype of a chatbot using a serverless platform, where developers compose stateless functions together to perform useful actions. We describe our serverless architecture based on function sequences, and how we used these functions to coordinate the cognitive microservices in the Watson Developer Cloud to allow the chatbot to interact with external services. The serverless model improves the extensibility of our chatbot, which currently supports 6 abilities: location based weather reports, jokes, date, reminders, and a simple music tutor.","author":["Mengting Yan","Paul Castro","Perry Cheng","Vatche Ishakian"],"issue":["MOTA '16: Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Mashups of Things and APIs","December 2016","Article No.: 5","Pages   1\u20134","https://doi.org/10.1145/3007203.3007217"],"date":"12 December 2016","ref":[{"text":"Weizenbaum, Joseph. \"ELIZA---a computer program for the study of natural language communication between man and machine.\" Communications of the ACM 9.1 (1966): 36--45.","doi":"10.1145/365153.365168","order":1},{"text":"Facebook Messenger Platform, https://messengerplatform.fb.com","order":2},{"text":"AskTanmay, https://github.com/tanmayb123/AskTanmay.","order":3},{"text":"Watson Developer Cloud, https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/","order":4},{"text":"OpenWhisk, https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk","order":5},{"text":"Shawar, Bayan Abu, and Eric Atwell. \"Chatbots: are they really useful?.\" LDV Forum.

Some characteristics of FPGA make it a promising solution to accelerate various applications. For example, on-chip block RAMs can provide high throughput for random data access. However, large-scale processing on a single FPGA chip is constrained by limited on-chip memory resources and off-chip bandwidth. Using a multi-FPGA architecture may alleviate these problems to some extent, while the data partitioning and communication schemes should be considered to ensure the locality and reduce data conflicts. In this paper, we propose ForeGraph, a large-scale graph processing framework based on the multi-FPGA architecture. In ForeGraph, each FPGA board only stores a partition of the entire graph in off-chip memory. Communication over partitions is reduced. Vertices and edges are sequentially loaded onto the FPGA chip and processed. Under our scheduling scheme, each FPGA chip performs graph processing in parallel without conflicts. We also analyze the impact of system parameters on the performance of ForeGraph. Our experimental results on Xilinx Virtex UltraScale XCVU190 chip show ForeGraph outperforms state-of-the-art FPGA-based large-scale graph processing systems by 4.54x when executing PageRank on the Twitter graph (1.4 billion edges). The average throughput is over 900 MTEPS in our design and 2.03x larger than previous work.","author":["Guohao Dai","Tianhao Huang","Yuze Chi","Ningyi Xu","Yu Wang","Huazhong Yang"],"issue":["FPGA '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","February 2017","Pages   217\u2013226","https://doi.org/10.1145/3020078.3021739"],"date":"22 February 2017","ref":[{"text":"Graph 500. http://www.graph500.org/.","order":1},{"text":"Je Gonzalez, Y Low, and H Gu.

The data management community has been working for over a decade on tackling data management-related challenges that arise in ML workloads, and has built several systems for advanced analytics. This tutorial provides a comprehensive review of such systems and analyzes key data management challenges and techniques. We focus on three complementary lines of work: (1) integrating ML algorithms and languages with existing data systems such as RDBMSs, (2) adapting data management-inspired techniques such as query optimization, partitioning, and compression to new systems that target ML workloads, and (3) combining data management and ML ideas to build systems that improve ML lifecycle-related tasks. Finally, we identify key open data management challenges for future research in this important area.","author":["Arun Kumar","Matthias Boehm","Jun Yang"],"issue":["SIGMOD '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data","May 2017","Pages   1717\u20131722","https://doi.org/10.1145/3035918.3054775"],"date":"09 May 2017","ref":[{"text":"Apache Mahout. mahout.apache.org.","order":1},{"text":"Microsoft AzureML Studio. studio.azureml.net.","order":2},{"text":"Oracle R Enterprise. www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/r/r-enterprise.","order":3},{"text":"M.

A diversity of complex models has been proposed for a wide variety of applications. Despite this, learning from implicit feedback is still computationally challenging. So far, most work relies on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) solvers which are easy to derive, but in practice challenging to apply, especially for tasks with many items. For the simple matrix factorization model, an efficient coordinate descent (CD) solver has been previously proposed. However, efficient CD approaches have not been derived for more complex models. In this paper, we provide a new framework for deriving efficient CD algorithms for complex recommender models. We identify and introduce the property of k-separable models. We show that k-separability is a sufficient property to allow efficient optimization of implicit recommender problems with CD. We illustrate this framework on a variety of state-of-the-art models including factorization machines and Tucker decomposition. To summarize, our work provides the theory and building blocks to derive efficient implicit CD algorithms for complex recommender models.","author":["Immanuel Bayer","Xiangnan He","Bhargav Kanagal","Steffen Rendle"],"issue":["WWW '17: Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web","April 2017","Pages   1341\u20131350","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052694"],"date":"03 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"C.

This computation overhead limits the applicability of DNNs to low-power, embedded platforms and incurs high cost in data centers. This motivates recent interests in designing low-power, low-latency DNNs based on fixed-point, ternary, or even binary data precision. While recent works in this area offer promising results, they often lead to large accuracy drops when compared to the floating-point networks. We propose a novel approach to map floating-point based DNNs to 8-bit dynamic fixed-point networks with integer power-of-two weights with no change in network architecture. Our dynamic fixed-point DNNs allow different radix points between layers. During inference, power-of-two weights allow multiplications to be replaced with arithmetic shifts, while the 8-bit fixed-point representation simplifies both the buffer and adder design. In addition, we propose a hardware accelerator design to achieve low-power, low-latency inference with insignificant degradation in accuracy. Using our custom accelerator design with the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, we show that our method achieves significant power and energy savings while increasing the classification accuracy.","author":["Hokchhay Tann","Soheil Hashemi","R.

However inherent random fluctuation error and long latency of SC lead to the degradation of accuracy and energy efficiency when applied to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper we address the two critical problems of SC-based CNNs, by proposing a novel SC multiply algorithm and its vector extension, SC-MVM (Matrix-Vector Multiplier), under which one SC multiply takes just a few cycles, generates much more accurate results, and can be realized with significantly less cost, as compared to the conventional SC method. Our experimental results using CNNs designed for MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that not only is our SC-based CNN more accurate and 40X~490X more energy-efficient in computation than the conventional SC-based ones, but ours can also achieve lower area-delay product and lower energy compared with bitwidth-optimized fixed-point implementations of the same accuracy.","author":["Hyeonuk Sim","Jongeun Lee"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 29","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062290"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Armin Alaghi and John P.

Memristor has shown its potential in computation of NN. Especially for the metal-oxide resistive random access memory (RRAM), its crossbar structure and multi-bit characteristic can perform the matrix-vector product in high precision, which is the most common operation of NN. However, there exist two challenges on realizing the training of NN. Firstly, the current architecture can only support the inference phase of training and cannot perform the backpropagation (BP), the weights update of NN. Secondly, the training of NN requires enormous iterations and constantly updates the weights to reach the convergence, which leads to large energy consumption because of lots of write and read operations. In this work, we propose a novel architecture, TIME, and peripheral circuit designs to enable the training of NN in RRAM. TIME supports the BP and the weights update while maximizing the reuse of peripheral circuits for the inference operation on RRAM. Meanwhile, a variability-free tuning scheme and gradually-write circuits are designed to reduce the cost of tuning RRAM. We explore the performance of both SL (supervised learning) and DRL (deep reinforcement learning) in TIME, and a specific mapping method of DRL is also introduced to further improve the energy efficiency. Experimental results show that, in SL, TIME can achieve 5.3x higher energy efficiency on average compared with the most powerful application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) in the literature. In DRL, TIME can perform averagely 126x higher than GPU in energy efficiency. If the cost of tuning RRAM can be further reduced, TIME have the potential of boosting the energy efficiency by 2 orders of magnitude compared with ASIC.","author":["Ming Cheng","Lixue Xia","Zhenhua Zhu","Yi Cai","Yuan Xie","Yu Wang","Huazhong Yang"],"issue":["DAC '17: Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017","June 2017","Article No.: 26","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062326"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Volodymyr Mnih et al.

High performance and extreme energy efficiency are critical for deployments of CNNs, especially in mobile platforms such as autonomous vehicles, cameras, and electronic personal assistants. This paper introduces the Sparse CNN (SCNN) accelerator architecture, which improves performance and energy efficiency by exploiting the zero-valued weights that stem from network pruning during training and zero-valued activations that arise from the common ReLU operator. Specifically, SCNN employs a novel dataflow that enables maintaining the sparse weights and activations in a compressed encoding, which eliminates unnecessary data transfers and reduces storage requirements. Furthermore, the SCNN dataflow facilitates efficient delivery of those weights and activations to a multiplier array, where they are extensively reused; product accumulation is performed in a novel accumulator array. On contemporary neural networks, SCNN can improve both performance and energy by a factor of 2.7x and 2.3x, respectively, over a comparably provisioned dense CNN accelerator.","author":["Angshuman Parashar","Minsoo Rhu","Anurag Mukkara","Antonio Puglielli","Rangharajan Venkatesan","Brucek Khailany","Joel Emer","Stephen W.

The key limitation of existing WiFi based gesture recognition systems is that they require the user to be in the same configuration (i.e., at the same position and in same orientation) when performing gestures at runtime as when providing training samples, which significantly restricts their practical usability. In this paper, we propose a WiFi based gesture recognition system, namely WiAG, which recognizes the gestures of the user irrespective of his/her configuration. The key idea behind WiAG is that it first requests the user to provide training samples for all gestures in only one configuration and then automatically generates virtual samples for all gestures in all possible configurations by applying our novel translation function on the training samples. Next, for each configuration, it generates a classification model using virtual samples corresponding to that configuration. To recognize gestures of a user at runtime, as soon as the user performs a gesture, WiAG first automatically estimates the configuration of the user and then evaluates the gesture against the classification model corresponding to that estimated configuration. Our evaluation results show that when user's configuration is not the same at runtime as at the time of providing training samples, WiAG significantly improves the gesture recognition accuracy from just 51.4% to 91.4%.","author":["Aditya Virmani","Muhammad Shahzad"],"issue":["MobiSys '17: Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services","June 2017","Pages   252\u2013264","https://doi.org/10.1145/3081333.3081340"],"date":"16 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"Allure Smart Thermostat. https://www.ure-energy.com/.","order":1},{"text":"Honeywell Lyric Thermostat. http://wifithermostat.com/Products/Lyric/.","order":2},{"text":"Honeywell Smart Thermostat. http://wifithermostat.com/Products/WiFiSmartThermostat/.","order":3},{"text":"Insteon LED Bulbs. http://www.insteon.com/led-bulbs/.","order":4},{"text":"LG Smart Appliances. http://www.lg.com/us/discover/smartthinq/thinq.","order":5},{"text":"Nest Thermostat. https://nest.com/thermostat/meet-nest-thermostat/.","order":6},{"text":"Philips Hue. http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/.","order":7},{"text":"Smart Home. http://www.smarthome.com/.","order":8},{"text":"Smoothing Spline Matlab. https://www.mathworks.com/help/curvefit/smoothing-splines.html.","order":9},{"text":"Whirlpool Smart Appliances. http://www.whirlpool.com/smart-appliances/.","order":10},{"text":"WiFi Plug. http://www.wifiplug.co.uk/.","order":11},{"text":"Abdelnasser, H., Youssef, M., and Harras, K.

Despite the fact that the performance of the generated code is nearly optimal, due to its offline nature, TTC cannot be utilized in all the application codes in which the tensor sizes and the necessary tensor permutations are determined at runtime. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the open-source C++ library High-Performance Tensor Transposition (HPTT). Similar to TTC, HPTT incorporates optimizations such as blocking, multi-threading, and explicit vectorization; furthermore it decomposes any transposition into multiple loops around a so called micro-kernel. This modular design-inspired by BLIS-makes HPTT easy to port to different architectures, by only replacing the hand-vectorized micro-kernel (e.g.,a 4 x 4 transpose). HPTT also offers an optional autotuning framework-guided by performance heuristics-that explores a vast search space of implementations at runtime (similar to FFTW). Across a wide range of different tensor transpositions and architectures (e.g., Intel Ivy Bridge, ARMv7, IBM Power7), HPTT attains a bandwidth comparable to that of SAXPY, and yields remarkable speedups over Eigen's tensor transposition implementation. Most importantly, the integration of HPTT into the Cyclops Tensor Framework (CTF) improves the overall performance of tensor contractions by up to 3.1x.","author":["Paul Springer","Tong Su","Paolo Bientinesi"],"issue":["ARRAY 2017: Proceedings of the 4th ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Libraries, Languages, and Compilers for Array Programming","June 2017","Pages   56\u201362","https://doi.org/10.1145/3091966.3091968"],"date":"18 June 2017","ref":[{"text":"M.

GPU and FPGA-based clouds have illustrated improvements in power and performance by accelerating compute-intensive workloads. ASIC-based clouds are a promising way to optimize the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of a given datacenter computation (e.g. YouTube transcoding) by reducing both energy consumption and marginal computation cost.The feasibility of an ASIC Cloud for a particular application is directly gated by the ability to manage the Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs of designing and fabricating the ASIC, so that it is significantly lower (e.g. 2X) than the TCO of the best available alternative.In this paper, we show that technology node selection is a major tool for managing ASIC Cloud NRE, and allows the designer to trade off an accelerator's excess energy efficiency and cost performance for lower total cost.We explore NRE and cross-technology optimization of ASIC Clouds for four different applications: Bitcoin mining, YouTube-style video transcoding, Litecoin, and Deep Learning. We address these challenges and show large reductions in the NRE, potentially enabling ASIC Clouds to address a wider variety of datacenter workloads. Our results suggest that advanced nodes like 16nm will lead to sub-optimal TCO for many workloads, and that use of older nodes like 65nm can enable a greater diversity of ASIC Clouds.","author":["Moein Khazraee","Lu Zhang","Luis Vega","Michael Bedford Taylor"],"issue":["ACM SIGPLAN Notices","Volume 52","Issue 4","April 2017","pp   511\u2013526","https://doi.org/10.1145/3093336.3037749"],"date":"04 April 2017","ref":[{"text":"M.

However, finding useful analogies in these large, messy, real-world repositories remains a persistent challenge for either human or automated methods. Previous approaches include costly hand-created databases that have high relational structure (e.g., predicate calculus representations) but are very sparse. Simpler machine-learning/information-retrieval similarity metrics can scale to large, natural-language datasets, but struggle to account for structural similarity, which is central to analogy. In this paper we explore the viability and value of learning simpler structural representations, specifically, \"problem schemas\", which specify the purpose of a product and the mechanisms by which it achieves that purpose. Our approach combines crowdsourcing and recurrent neural networks to extract purpose and mechanism vector representations from product descriptions. We demonstrate that these learned vectors allow us to find analogies with higher precision and recall than traditional information-retrieval methods. In an ideation experiment, analogies retrieved by our models significantly increased people's likelihood of generating creative ideas compared to analogies retrieved by traditional methods. Our results suggest a promising approach to enabling computational analogy at scale is to learn and leverage weaker structural representations.","author":["Tom Hope","Joel Chan","Aniket Kittur","Dafna Shahaf"],"issue":["KDD '17: Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","August 2017","Pages   235\u2013243","https://doi.org/10.1145/3097983.3098038"],"date":"04 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Sanjeev Arora, Yuanzhi Li, Yingyu Liang, Tengyu Ma, and Andrej Risteski 2016.

As many DDIs are frequently reported in biomedical literature, it is important to mine DDI information from literature to keep DDI knowledge up to date. One of the SemEval challenges in the year 2011 and 2013 was designed to tackle the task where the best system achieved an F1 score of 0.80. In this paper, we propose to utilize dependency embeddings and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) embeddings as features for extracting DDIs. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we employed dependency embeddings, previously shown effective for sentence classification, for DDI extraction. The dependency embeddings incorporated structural syntactic contexts into the embeddings, which were not present in the conventional word embeddings. Second, we proposed a novel syntactic embedding approach using AMR. AMR aims to abstract away from syntactic idiosyncrasies and attempts to capture only the core meaning of a sentence, which could potentially improve DDI extraction from sentences. Two classifiers (Support Vector Machine and Random Forest) taking these embedding features as input were evaluated on the DDIExtraction 2013 challenge corpus. The experimental results show the effectiveness of dependency and AMR embeddings in the DDI extraction task. The best performance was obtained by combining word, dependency and AMR embeddings (F1 score=0.84).","author":["Yanshan Wang","Sijia Liu","Majid Rastegar-Mojarad","Liwei Wang","Feichen Shen","Fei Liu","Hongfang Liu"],"issue":["ACM-BCB '17: Proceedings of the 8th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology,and Health Informatics","August 2017","Pages   36\u201343","https://doi.org/10.1145/3107411.3107426"],"date":"20 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"Laura Banarescu, Claire Bonial, Shu Cai, Madalina Georgescu, Kira Griffitt, Ulf Hermjakob, Kevin Knight, Philipp Koehn, Martha Palmer, and Nathan Schneider. 2012.

They are flexibly extensible and can incorporate various kinds of information including temporal order. These properties make them well suited for generating sequential recommendations. In this paper, we extend Recurrent Neural Networks by considering unique characteristics of the Recommender Systems domain. One of these characteristics is the explicit notion of the user recommendations are specifically generated for. We show how individual users can be represented in addition to sequences of consumed items in a new type of Gated Recurrent Unit to effectively produce personalized next item recommendations. Offline experiments on two real-world datasets indicate that our extensions clearly improve objective performance when compared to state-of-the-art recommender algorithms and to a conventional Recurrent Neural Network.","author":["Tim Donkers","Benedikt Loepp","J\u00fcrgen Ziegler"],"issue":["RecSys '17: Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM Conference on Recommender Systems","August 2017","Pages   152\u2013160","https://doi.org/10.1145/3109859.3109877"],"date":"27 August 2017","ref":[{"text":"L.

This issue has gained even more importance recently in light of crowdsourced relevance judgments, where it is customary to gather many relevance labels for each topic-document pair. In a crowdsourcing setting, agreement is often even used as a proxy for quality, although without any systematic verification of the conjecture that higher agreement corresponds to higher quality. In this paper we address this issue and we study in particular: the effect of topic on assessor agreement; the relationship between assessor agreement and judgment quality; the effect of agreement on ranking systems according to their effectiveness; and the definition of an agreement-aware effectiveness metric that does not discard information about multiple judgments for the same document as it typically happens in a crowdsourcing setting.","author":["Eddy Maddalena","Kevin Roitero","Gianluca Demartini","Stefano Mizzaro"],"issue":["ICTIR '17: Proceedings of the ACM SIGIR International Conference on Theory of Information Retrieval","October 2017","Pages   75\u201382","https://doi.org/10.1145/3121050.3121060"],"date":"01 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Omar Alonso and Stefano Mizzaro 2012.

Moreover, efficient Re-ID systems are required to cope with the massive visual data being produced by video surveillance systems. Targeting to solve these problems, this work proposes a Global-Local-Alignment Descriptor (GLAD) and an efficient indexing and retrieval framework, respectively. GLAD explicitly leverages the local and global cues in human body to generate a discriminative and robust representation. It consists of part extraction and descriptor learning modules, where several part regions are first detected and then deep neural networks are designed for representation learning on both the local and global regions. A hierarchical indexing and retrieval framework is designed to eliminate the huge redundancy in the gallery set, and accelerate the online Re-ID procedure. Extensive experimental results show GLAD achieves competitive accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Our retrieval framework significantly accelerates the online Re-ID procedure without loss of accuracy. Therefore, this work has potential to work better on person Re-ID tasks in real scenarios.","author":["Longhui Wei","Shiliang Zhang","Hantao Yao","Wen Gao","Qi Tian"],"issue":["MM '17: Proceedings of the 25th ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2017","Pages   420\u2013428","https://doi.org/10.1145/3123266.3123279"],"date":"19 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"Ejaz Ahmed, Michael Jones, and Tim K Marks. 2015.

Although GPUs have gained popularity as a key accelerator platform for deep learning workloads, the increasing demand for DNN computation leaves a significant gap between the compute capabilities of GPU-enabled datacenters and the compute needed to service demand. The state-of-the-art techniques to improve DNN performance have significant limitations in bridging the gap on real systems. Current network pruning techniques remove computation, but the resulting networks map poorly to GPU architectures, yielding no performance benefit or even slowdowns. Meanwhile, current bandwidth optimization techniques focus on reducing off-chip bandwidth while overlooking on-chip bandwidth, a key DNN bottleneck. To address these limitations, this work introduces DeftNN, a GPU DNN execution framework that targets the key architectural bottlenecks of DNNs on GPUs to automatically and transparently improve execution performance. DeftNN is composed of two novel optimization techniques - (1) synapse vector elimination, a technique that identifies non-contributing synapses in the DNN and carefully transforms data and removes the computation and data movement of these synapses while fully utilizing the GPU to improve performance, and (2) near-compute data fission, a mechanism for scaling down the on-chip data movement requirements within DNN computations. Our evaluation of DeftNN spans 6 state-of-the-art DNNs. By applying both optimizations in concert, DeftNN is able to achieve an average speedup of 2.1X on real GPU hardware. We also introduce a small additional hardware unit per GPU core to facilitate efficient data fission operations, increasing the speedup achieved by DeftNN to 2.6X.","author":["Parker Hill","Animesh Jain","Mason Hill","Babak Zamirai","Chang-Hong Hsu","Michael A.

The memory access patterns of CPU and IP cores are dramatically different in a handheld device, making the main memory a critical bottleneck of the entire system. As a result, non-volatile memories, such as spin transfer torque magnetoresistive random-access memory (STT-MRAM), are emerging as a replacement for the existing DRAM-based main memory, achieving a wide variety of advantages. However, replacing DRAM with STT-MRAM also results in new design challenges including read disturbance. A simple read-and-restore scheme preserves data integrity under read disturbance, but incurs significant performance and energy overheads. Consequently, by utilizing unique characteristics of mobile applications, we propose FlowPaP, a flow pattern prediction scheme to dynamically predict the write-to-last-read distances for data frames running on a handheld device. FlowPaP identifies and removes unnecessary memory restores originally required for preventing read disturbance, significantly improving energy efficiency and performance for STT-MRAM-based handheld devices. In addition, we propose a flow-based data retention time reduction scheme named FlowReR to further lower energy consumption of STT-MRAM at the expense of reducing its data retention time. FlowReR imposes a second step that marginally trades off the already improved energy efficiency for performance improvements. Experimental results show that, compared to the original read-and-restore scheme, the application of FlowPaP and FlowReR together can simultaneously improve energy efficiency by 34% and performance by 17% for a set of commonly used Android applications.","author":["Hao Yan","Lei Jiang","Lide Duan","Wei-Ming Lin","Eugene John"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems","Volume 16","Issue 5s","October 2017","Article No.: 132","pp   1\u201320","https://doi.org/10.1145/3126532"],"date":"27 September 2017","ref":[{"text":"Nathan Binkert, Bradford Beckmann, Gabriel Black, Steven K.

Specialized hardware accelerators have been proposed to accelerate the execution of DNN algorithms for high-performance and energy efficiency. Recently, they have been deployed in datacenters (potentially for business-critical or industrial applications) and safety-critical systems such as self-driving cars. Soft errors caused by high-energy particles have been increasing in hardware systems, and these can lead to catastrophic failures in DNN systems. Traditional methods for building resilient systems, e.g., Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), are agnostic of the DNN algorithm and the DNN accelerator's architecture. Hence, these traditional resilience approaches incur high overheads, which makes them challenging to deploy. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the resilience characteristics of DNN systems (i.e., DNN software running on specialized accelerators). We find that the error resilience of a DNN system depends on the data types, values, data reuses, and types of layers in the design. Based on our observations, we propose two efficient protection techniques for DNN systems.","author":["Guanpeng Li","Siva Kumar Sastry Hari","Michael Sullivan","Timothy Tsai","Karthik Pattabiraman","Joel Emer","Stephen W.

However, such algorithms involve massive computations that are not manageable in general purpose processors. To cope with this challenge, spatial architecture-based accelerators, which consist of an array of hundreds of processing elements (PEs), have emerged. These accelerators achieve high throughput exploiting massive parallel computations over the PEs; however, most of them do not focus on on-chip data movement overhead, which increases with the degree of computational parallelism, and employ primitive networks-on-chip (NoC) such as buses, crossbars, and meshes. Such NoCs work for general purpose multicores, but lack scalability in area, power, latency, and throughput to use inside accelerators, as this work demonstrates. To this end, we propose a novel NoC generator that generates a network tailored for the traffic flows within a neural network, namely scatters, gathers and local communication, facilitating accelerator design. We build our NoC using an array of extremely lightweight microswitches that are energy- and area-efficient compared to traditional on-chip routers. We demonstrate the performance, area, and energy of our micro-switch based networks for convolutional neural network accelerators.","author":["Hyoukjun Kwon","Ananda Samajdar","Tushar Krishna"],"issue":["NOCS '17: Proceedings of the Eleventh IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip","October 2017","Article No.: 19","Pages   1\u20138","https://doi.org/10.1145/3130218.3130230"],"date":"19 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"F.

Unfortunately, this goal has been thwarted a number of times throughout the protocol's tumultuous lifetime, resulting in the need for a new version of the protocol, namely TLS 1.3. Over the past three years, in an unprecedented joint design effort with the academic community, the TLS Working Group has been working tirelessly to enhance the security of TLS. We further this effort by constructing the most comprehensive, faithful, and modular symbolic model of the TLS~1.3 draft 21 release candidate, and use the TAMARIN prover to verify the claimed TLS~1.3 security requirements, as laid out in draft 21 of the specification. In particular, our model covers all handshake modes of TLS 1.3. Our analysis reveals an unexpected behaviour, which we expect will inhibit strong authentication guarantees in some implementations of the protocol. In contrast to previous models, we provide a novel way of making the relation between the TLS specification and our model explicit: we provide a fully annotated version of the specification that clarifies what protocol elements we modelled, and precisely how we modelled these elements. We anticipate this model artifact to be of great benefit to the academic community and the TLS Working Group alike.","author":["Cas Cremers","Marko Horvat","Jonathan Hoyland","Sam Scott","Thyla van der Merwe"],"issue":["CCS '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","October 2017","Pages   1773\u20131788","https://doi.org/10.1145/3133956.3134063"],"date":"30 October 2017","ref":[{"text":"David Adrian, Karthikeyan Bhargavan, Zakir Durumeric, Pierrick Gaudry, Matthew Green, J.

In addition to FPGA performance improvements, OpenCL-based FPGA development toolchains have been developed and offered by FPGA vendors, which reduces the programming effort required as compared to the past. These improvements reveal the possibilities of realizing a concept to enable on-the-fly offloading computation at which CPUs/GPUs perform poorly to FPGAs while performing low-latency data movement. We think that this concept is one of the keys to more improve the performance of modern heterogeneous supercomputers using accelerators like GPUs. In this paper, we propose high-performance inter-FPGA Ethernet communication using OpenCL and Verilog HDL mixed programming in order to demonstrate the feasibility of realizing this concept. OpenCL is used to program application algorithms and data movement control when Verilog HDL is used to implement low-level components for Ethernet communication. Experimental results using ping-pong programs showed that our proposed approach achieves a latency of 0.99 \u03bcs and as much as 4.97 GB/s between FPGAs over different nodes, thus confirming that the proposed method is effective at realizing this concept.","author":["Ryohei Kobayashi","Yuma Oobata","Norihisa Fujita","Yoshiki Yamaguchi","Taisuke Boku"],"issue":["HPC Asia 2018: Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing in Asia-Pacific Region","January 2018","Pages   192\u2013201","https://doi.org/10.1145/3149457.3149479"],"date":"28 January 2018","ref":[{"text":"T.

Neural networks, on the other hand, have proven track records in many supervised learning tasks. In this work, we propose a training framework with a graph-regularised objective, namely Neural Graph Machines, that can combine the power of neural networks and label propagation. This work generalises previous literature on graph-augmented training of neural networks, enabling it to be applied to multiple neural architectures (Feed-forward NNs, CNNs and LSTM RNNs) and a wide range of graphs. The new objective allows the neural networks to harness both labeled and unlabeled data by: (a)~allowing the network to train using labeled data as in the supervised setting, (b)~biasing the network to learn similar hidden representations for neighboring nodes on a graph, in the same vein as label propagation. Such architectures with the proposed objective can be trained efficiently using stochastic gradient descent and scaled to large graphs, with a runtime that is linear in the number of edges. The proposed joint training approach convincingly outperforms many existing methods on a wide range of tasks (multi-label classification on social graphs, news categorization, document classification and semantic intent classification), with multiple forms of graph inputs (including graphs with and without node-level features) and using different types of neural networks.","author":["Thang D.

Our tutorial explains why knowledge graphs are important, how knowledge graphs are constructed, and where new research opportunities exist for improving the state-of-the-art. In this tutorial, we cover the many sophisticated approaches that complete and correct knowledge graphs. We organize this exploration into two main classes of models. The first include probabilistic logical frameworks that use graphical models, random walks, or statistical rule mining to construct knowledge graphs. The second class of models includes latent space models such as matrix and tensor factorization and neural networks. We conclude the tutorial with a critical comparison of techniques and results. We will offer practical advice for novices to identify common empirical challenges and concrete data sets for initial experimentation.

They are embarrassingly parallel and perfectly fit modern hardware such as Graphic Processing Units. Although stencil computations have been extensively studied, optimizing them for increasingly diverse hardware remains challenging. Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) have raised the programming abstraction and offer good performance. However, this places the burden on DSL implementers who have to write almost full-fledged parallelizing compilers and optimizers.   Lift has recently emerged as a promising approach to achieve performance portability and is based on a small set of reusable parallel primitives that DSL or library writers can build upon. Lift\u2019s key novelty is in its encoding of optimizations as a system of extensible rewrite rules which are used to explore the optimization space. However, Lift has mostly focused on linear algebra operations and it remains to be seen whether this approach is applicable for other domains.   This paper demonstrates how complex multidimensional stencil code and optimizations such as tiling are expressible using compositions of simple 1D Lift primitives. By leveraging existing Lift primitives and optimizations, we only require the addition of two primitives and one rewrite rule to do so. Our results show that this approach outperforms existing compiler approaches and hand-tuned codes.","author":["Bastian Hagedorn","Larisa Stoltzfus","Michel Steuwer","Sergei Gorlatch","Christophe Dubach"],"issue":["CGO 2018: Proceedings of the 2018 International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization","February 2018","Pages   100\u2013112","https://doi.org/10.1145/3168824"],"date":"24 February 2018","ref":[{"text":"Jason Ansel, Shoaib Kamil, Kalyan Veeramachaneni, Jonathan RaganKelley, Jeffrey Bosboom, Una-May O\u2019Reilly, and Saman Amarasinghe. 2014.

In order to manage bugs effectively, bug tracking systems are developed to help to record, manage and track the bugs of each project. The rich information in the bug repository provides the possibility of establishment of entity-centric knowledge bases to help understand and fix the bugs. However, existing named entity recognition (NER) systems deal with text that is structured, formal, well written, with a good grammatical structure and few spelling errors, which cannot be directly used for bug-specific named entity recognition. For bug data, they are free-form texts, which include a mixed language studded with code, abbreviations and software-specific vocabularies. In this paper, we summarize the characteristics of bug entities, propose a classification method for bug entities, and build a baseline corpus on two open source projects (Mozilla and Eclipse). On this basis, we propose an approach for bug-specific entity recognition called BNER with the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model and word embedding technique. An empirical study is conducted to evaluate the accuracy of our BNER technique, and the results show that the two designed baseline corpus are suitable for bug-specific named entity recognition, and our BNER approach is effective on cross-projects NER.","author":["Cheng Zhou","Bin Li","Xiaobing Sun","Hongjing Guo"],"issue":["ICPC '18: Proceedings of the 26th Conference on Program Comprehension","May 2018","Pages   108\u2013119","https://doi.org/10.1145/3196321.3196335"],"date":"28 May 2018","ref":[{"text":"Adrian Bachmann, Christian Bird, Foyzur Rahman, Premkumar T.

AoI measures the time that elapsed since the last received update was generated. We consider the problem of minimizing average and peak AoI in wireless networks under general interference constraints. When fresh information is always available for transmission, we show that a stationary scheduling policy is peak age optimal. We also prove that this policy achieves average age that is within a factor of two of the optimal average age. In the case where fresh information is not always available, and packet/information generation rate has to be controlled along with scheduling links for transmission, we prove an important separation principle: the optimal scheduling policy can be designed assuming fresh information, and independently, the packet generation rate control can be done by ignoring interference.

To accelerate DNNs using heterogeneous multi-/many-core clusters, we propose an OpenCL-based DNN framework called UHCL-Darknet. First, we design a unified OpenCL platform model for the heterogeneous cluster called UHCL, and an adaptive runtime system with the affinity-based dynamic scheduler for UHCL, enabling transparent utilization of a wide variety of vendor-specific OpenCL devices in the heterogeneous cluster. Then, we extend Darknet to UHCL by introducing the parallel optimization of DNNs, such as paralleling Winogrand-based convolutions and auto-tuning parameterized OpenCL kernels. The training and inference of art-of-data DNN models (e.g., YOLOv2, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-201) are executed on an experimental heterogeneous cluster. Results show that UHCL-Darknet is a scalable and portable DNN framework for heterogeneous clusters, and achieves 1.9x and 2.2x speedups on average respectively for the image throughput of data-parallel training and inference on the experimental heterogeneous cluster.","author":["Longlong Liao","Kenli Li","Keqin Li","Canqun Yang","Qi Tian"],"issue":["ICPP 2018: Proceedings of the 47th International Conference on Parallel Processing","August 2018","Article No.: 44","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3225058.3225107"],"date":"13 August 2018","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, and et.al. 2016.

It has attracted attention in various applications such as 3D tele-presence, navigation for unmanned vehicles and heritage reconstruction. The understanding of point clouds, such as point cloud segmentation, is crucial in exploiting the informative value of point clouds for such applications. Due to the irregularity of the data format, previous deep learning works often convert point clouds to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images before feeding them into neural networks, which leads to voluminous data and quantization artifacts. In this paper, we instead propose a regularized graph convolutional neural network (RGCNN) that directly consumes point clouds. Leveraging on spectral graph theory, we treat features of points in a point cloud as signals on graph, and define the convolution over graph by Chebyshev polynomial approximation. In particular, we update the graph Laplacian matrix that describes the connectivity of features in each layer according to the corresponding learned features, which adaptively captures the structure of dynamic graphs. Further, we deploy a graph-signal smoothness prior in the loss function, thus regularizing the learning process. Experimental results on the ShapeNet part dataset show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the computational complexity while achieving competitive performance with the state of the art. Also, experiments show RGCNN is much more robust to both noise and point cloud density in comparison with other methods. We further apply RGCNN to point cloud classification and achieve competitive results on ModelNet40 dataset.","author":["Gusi Te","Wei Hu","Amin Zheng","Zongming Guo"],"issue":["MM '18: Proceedings of the 26th ACM international conference on Multimedia","October 2018","Pages   746\u2013754","https://doi.org/10.1145/3240508.3240621"],"date":"15 October 2018","ref":[{"text":"Josep Miquel Biosca and Jos\u00e9 Luis Lerma.

As a field effect device, FeFET significantly reduces the read/write energy compared with the resistive random-access memory (ReRAM). At circuit level, we propose an all-digital peripheral design, reducing the large overhead introduced by ADC and DAC in prior works. In terms of micro-architecture innovation, a dedicated hierarchical network-on-chip (H-NoC) is developed for input broadcasting and on-the-fly partial results processing, reducing the data transmission volume and latency. Speed, power, area and computing accuracy are evaluated based on detailed device characterization and system modeling.

We formulate a systolic model that shifts partial sums by CUDA warp primitives for the computation. We also employ register files as a cache resource in order to operate the entire model efficiently. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed model for a wide variety of stencil kernels that appear commonly in HPC, and also convolution kernels (increasingly important in deep learning workloads). Our algorithm outperforms the top reported state-of-the-art stencil implementations, including implementations with sophisticated temporal and spatial blocking techniques, on the two latest Nvidia architectures: Tesla V100 and P100. For 2D convolution of general filter sizes and shapes, our algorithm is on average 2.5\u00d7 faster than Nvidia's NPP on V100 and P100 GPUs.","author":["Peng Chen","Mohamed Wahib","Shinichiro Takizawa","Ryousei Takano","Satoshi Matsuoka"],"issue":["SC '19: Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","November 2019","Article No.: 53","Pages   1\u201381","https://doi.org/10.1145/3295500.3356162"],"date":"17 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"M.

This represents a challenge and an opportunity for different scientific workloads to be adapted to upcoming programming models that simplify the usage of such platforms. In this paper we introduce a serverless model for highly-parallel file-processing applications. We also describe a middleware implementation that supports the execution of customized execution environments based on Docker images on AWS Lambda, the leading serverless computing platform. Moreover, this middleware offers tools to manage the input/output of the serverless infrastructure and the creation of HTTP endpoints in a transparent way to the user. To test the programming model proposed and the middleware, this paper describes two case studies. The first one analyzes medical images with a high degree of parallelism. The second one presents an architecture to process video keyframes. The results from both case studies are discussed and a cost analysis of the medical image architecture comparing different Cloud options is carried out. The results show that the combination of a high-level programming model with the scalable capabilities of AWS Lambda makes it easy for end users to efficiently exploit serverless computing for the optimized and cost-effective execution of loosely-coupled tasks.","author":["Alfonso P\u00e9rez","Germ\u00e1n Molt\u00f3","Miguel Caballer","Amanda Calatrava"],"issue":["SAC '19: Proceedings of the 34th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing","April 2019","Pages   106\u2013113","https://doi.org/10.1145/3297280.3297292"],"date":"08 April 2019","ref":[{"text":"Amazon.

This design choice goes directly against at least three key trends in systems that cause performance, scalability and energy bottlenecks: 1) data access from memory is already a key bottleneck as applications become more data-intensive and memory bandwidth and energy do not scale well, 2) energy consumption is a key constraint in especially mobile and server systems, 3) data movement is very expensive in terms of bandwidth, energy and latency, much more so than computation [1-3]. These trends are especially severely-felt in the data-intensive server and energy-constrained mobile systems of today. At the same time, conventional memory technology is facing many scaling challenges in terms of reliability, energy, and performance [4-5]. As a result, memory system architects are open to organizing memory in different ways and making it more intelligent, at the expense of slightly higher cost. The emergence of 3D-stacked memory plus logic [6], the adoption of error correcting codes inside the latest DRAM chips [7-8], and intelligent memory controllers to solve the RowHammer problem [9-11] are an evidence of this trend. In this talk, I will discuss some recent research that aims to practically enable computation close to data. After motivating trends in applications as well as technology, we will discuss at least two promising directions: 1) performing massively-parallel bulk operations in memory by exploiting the analog operational properties of DRAM, with low-cost changes [3, 12-14, 23], 2) exploiting the logic layer in 3D-stacked memory technology in various ways to accelerate important data-intensive applications [2, 15-22]. In both approaches, we will discuss relevant cross-layer research, design, and adoption challenges in devices, architecture, systems, applications, and programming models [1]. Our focus will be the development of in-memory processing designs that can be adopted in real computing platforms and real data-intensive applications, spanning machine learning, graph processing, data analytics, and genome analysis, at low cost [26]. If time permits, we will also discuss simulation and evaluation infrastructures that can enable exciting and forward-looking research in future memory systems, including Ramulator [24] and SoftMC [25].","author":["Onur Mutlu"],"issue":["GLSVLSI '19: Proceedings of the 2019 on Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","May 2019","Pages   5\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3299874.3322805"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"Saugata Ghose et al., \"Enabling the Adoption of Processing-in-Memory: Challenges, Mechanisms, Future Research Directions\", Invited Book Chapter, 2019.","order":1},{"text":"Amirali Boroumand et al., \"Google Workloads for Consumer Devices: Mitigating Data Movement Bottlenecks\", ASPLOS 2018.","doi":"10.1145/3173162.3173177","order":2},{"text":"Vivek Seshadri and Onur Mutlu, \"Simple Operations in Memory to Reduce Data Movement\", Invited Book Chapter in Advances in Computers, 2018.","order":3},{"text":"Onur Mutlu, \"Memory Scaling: A Systems Architecture Perspective\", IMW 2013.","order":4},{"text":"Onur Mutlu and Lavanya Subramanian, \"Research Problems and Opportunities in Memory Systems\", SUPERFRI 2015.","doi":"10.14529/jsfi140302","order":5},{"text":"Donghyuk Lee et al., \"Simultaneous Multi-Layer Access: Improving 3D-Stacked Memory Bandwidth at Low Cost\", ACM TACO 2016.","doi":"10.1145/2832911","order":6},{"text":"Uksong Kang, et al., \"Co-Architecting Controllers and DRAM to Enhance DRAM Process Scaling\", Memory Forum 2014.","order":7},{"text":"Minesh Patel et al., \"Understanding and Modeling On-Die Error Correction in Modern DRAM: An Experimental Study Using Real Devices\", DSN 2019.","order":8},{"text":"Yoongu Kim et al., \"Flipping Bits in Memory Without Accessing Them: An Experimental Study of DRAM Disturbance Errors\", ISCA 2014.","doi":"10.5555/2665671.2665726","order":9},{"text":"Onur Mutlu, \"The RowHammer Problem and Other Issues We May Face as Memory Becomes Denser\", DATE 2017.","doi":"10.5555/3130379.3130643","order":10},{"text":"Onur Mutlu and Jeremie S.

Queries which exceed these quotas are interrupted and deliver partial results. Such interruption is not an issue if it is possible to resume queries execution afterward. Unfortunately, there is no preemption model for the Web that allows for suspending and resuming SPARQL queries. In this paper, we propose SaGe: a SPARQL query engine based on Web preemption. SaGe allows SPARQL queries to be suspended by the Web server after a fixed time quantum and resumed upon client request. Web preemption is tractable only if its cost in time is negligible compared to the time quantum. The challenge is to support the full SPARQL query language while keeping the cost of preemption negligible. Experimental results demonstrate that SaGe outperforms existing SPARQL query processing approaches by several orders of magnitude in term of the average total query execution time and the time for first results.","author":["Thomas Minier","Hala Skaf-Molli","Pascal Molli"],"issue":["WWW '19: The World Wide Web Conference","May 2019","Pages   1268\u20131278","https://doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313652"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"G\u00fcnes Alu\u00e7, Olaf Hartig, M.

Despite this development, we lack a nuanced understanding of driver preference in decision scenarios that semi-AVs will face, and of possible misalignment between semi-AV decisions and user preference. Using an online survey, we explore how participants would like semi-AVs to act and alert them of the vehicles' decisions in various scenarios. Participants reported varying levels of comfort with autonomy, desire to takeover control, and desire for AV informing. Individual differences, including level of experience with autonomy and situation awareness, affected perceptions of the vehicle. Our results highlight the importance of considering driver preference in AV decision-making, and we present an influence diagram that situates this factor among others. We also derive five design principles, including that a previous positive AV experience can lead to more harmful consequences for AVs when not aligned with driver preference.","author":["So Yeon Park","Dylan James Moore","David Sirkin"],"issue":["CHI '20: Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","April 2020","Pages   1\u201313","https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376644"],"date":"23 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and others. 2019.

Hypervectors are D-dimensional (pseudo)random vectors with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) components constituting ultra-wide holographic words: D=10,000 bits, for instance. At its very core, HD computing manipulates a set of seed hypervectors to build composite hypervectors representing objects of interest. It demands memory optimizations with simple operations for an efficient hardware realization. In this article, we propose hardware techniques for optimizations of HD computing, in a synthesizable open-source VHDL library, to enable co-located implementation of both learning and classification tasks on only a small portion of Xilinx UltraScale FPGAs: (1) We propose simple logical operations to rematerialize the hypervectors on the fly rather than loading them from memory. These operations massively reduce the memory footprint by directly computing the composite hypervectors whose individual seed hypervectors do not need to be stored in memory. (2) Bundling a series of hypervectors over time requires a multibit counter per every hypervector component. We instead propose a binarized back-to-back bundling without requiring any counters. This truly enables on-chip learning with minimal resources as every hypervector component remains binary over the course of training to avoid otherwise multibit components. (3) For every classification event, an associative memory is in charge of finding the closest match between a set of learned hypervectors and a query hypervector by using a distance metric. This operator is proportional to hypervector dimension (D), and hence may take O(D) cycles per classification event. Accordingly, we significantly improve the throughput of classification by proposing associative memories that steadily reduce the latency of classification to the extreme of a single cycle. (4) We perform a design space exploration incorporating the proposed techniques on FPGAs for a wearable biosignal processing application as a case study. Our techniques achieve up to 2.39\u00d7 area saving, or 2,337\u00d7 throughput improvement. The Pareto optimal HD architecture is mapped on only 18,340 configurable logic blocks (CLBs) to learn and classify five hand gestures using four electromyography sensors.","author":["Manuel Schmuck","Luca Benini","Abbas Rahimi"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 15","Issue 4","December 2019","Article No.: 32","pp   1\u201325","https://doi.org/10.1145/3314326"],"date":"10 October 2019","ref":[{"text":"Alessio Burrello, Kaspar Schindler, Luca Benini, and Abbas Rahimi. 2018.

With Von-Neumann computing architectures struggling to address such computationally-expensive and memory-intensive task today, Processing-in-Memory (PIM) platforms are gaining growing interests. In this paper, an energy-efficient and parallel PIM accelerator (AlignS) is proposed to execute DNA short read alignment based on an optimized and hardware-friendly alignment algorithm. We first develop AlignS platform that harnesses SOT-MRAM as computational memory and transforms it to a fundamental processing unit for short read alignment. Accordingly, we present a novel, customized, highly parallel read alignment algorithm that only seeks the proposed simple and parallel in-memory operations (i.e. comparisons and additions). AlignS is then optimized through a new correlated data partitioning and mapping methodology that allows local storage and processing of DNA sequence to fully exploit the algorithm-level's parallelism, and to accelerate both exact and inexact matches. The device-to-architecture co-simulation results show that AlignS improves the short read alignment throughput per Watt per mm2 by ~12\u00d7 compared to the ASIC accelerator. Compared to recent FM-index-based ReRAM platform, AlignS achieves 1.6\u00d7 higher throughput per Watt.","author":["Shaahin Angizi","Jiao Sun","Wei Zhang","Deliang Fan"],"issue":["DAC '19: Proceedings of the 56th Annual Design Automation Conference 2019","June 2019","Article No.: 144","Pages   1\u20136","https://doi.org/10.1145/3316781.3317764"],"date":"02 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"Y.

Neural networks' effectiveness in the fields of image recognition and natural language processing stems primarily from the vast amounts of data available to companies and researchers, coupled with the huge amounts of compute power available in modern accelerators such as GPUs, FPGAs and ASICs. There are a number of approaches available to developers for utilizing GPGPU technologies such as SYCL, OpenCL and CUDA, however many applications require the same low level mathematical routines. Libraries dedicated to accelerating these common routines allow developers to easily make full use of the available hardware without requiring low level knowledge of the hardware themselves, however such libraries are often provided by hardware manufacturers for specific hardware such as cuDNN [9] for Nvidia hardware or MIOpen [5] for AMD hardware. SYCL-DNN is a new open-source library dedicated to providing accelerated routines for neural network operations which are hardware and vendor agnostic. Built on top of the SYCL open standard and written entirely in standard C++, SYCL-DNN allows a user to easily accelerate neural network code for a wide range of hardware using a modern C++ interface. The library is tested on AMD's OpenCL for GPU, Intel's OpenCL for CPU and GPU, ARM's OpenCL for Mali GPUs as well as ComputeAorta's OpenCL for R-Car CV engine and host CPU. In this talk we will present performance figures for SYCL-DNN on this range of hardware, and discuss how high performance was achieved on such a varied set of accelerators with such different hardware features.","author":["Rod Burns","John Lawson","Duncan McBain","Daniel Soutar"],"issue":["IWOCL'19: Proceedings of the International Workshop on OpenCL","May 2019","Article No.: 10","Pages   1\u20134","https://doi.org/10.1145/3318170.3318183"],"date":"13 May 2019","ref":[{"text":"{n. d.}.

In addition to its security, important performance measures of a blockchain protocol are its transaction throughput and confirmation latency. In a decentralized setting, these measures are limited by two underlying physical network attributes: communication capacity and speed-of-light propagation delay. In this work we introduce Prism, a new proof-of-work blockchain protocol, which can achieve 1) security against up to 50% adversarial hashing power; 2) optimal throughput up to the capacity C of the network; 3) confirmation latency for honest transactions proportional to the propagation delay D, with confirmation error probability exponentially small in the bandwidth-delay product CD; 4) eventual total ordering of all transactions. Our approach to the design of this protocol is based on deconstructing Nakamoto's blockchain into its basic functionalities and systematically scaling up these functionalities to approach their physical limits.","author":["Vivek Bagaria","Sreeram Kannan","David Tse","Giulia Fanti","Pramod Viswanath"],"issue":["CCS '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","November 2019","Pages   585\u2013602","https://doi.org/10.1145/3319535.3363213"],"date":"06 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"I.

Among multiple sensing technologies, WiFi-based in-car activity recognition exhibits unique advantages since it does not rely on visible light, avoids privacy leaks and is cost-efficient with integrated WiFi signals in cars. Existing WiFi-based recognition systems mostly focus on the relatively stable indoor space, which only yield reasonably good performance in limited situations. Based on our field studies, the in-car activity recognition, however, is much more complicated suffering from more impact factors. First, the external moving objects and the surrounding WiFi signals can cause various disturbances to the in-car activity sensing. Second, considering the compact in-car space, different car models can also lead to different multipath distortions. Moreover, different people can also perform activities in different shapes. Such extraneous information related to specific driving conditions, car models and human subjects is implicitly contained for training and prediction, inevitably leading to poor recognition performance for new environment and people. In this paper, we consider the impact of different domains including driving conditions, car models and human subjects on the in-car activity recognition with field measurements and experiments. We present WiCAR, a WiFi-based in-car activity recognition framework that is able to remove domain-specific information in the received signals while retaining the activity related information to the maximum extent. A deep learning architecture integrated with domain adversarial training is applied to domain independent activity recognition. Specifically, we leverage multi-adversarial domain adaptation to avoid the discriminative structures mixing up for different domains. We have implemented WiCAR with commercial-off-the-shelf WiFi devices. Our extensive evaluations show that WiCAR can achieve in-car recognition accuracy of around 95% in untrained domains, where it is only 53% for solutions without domain adversarial network and 83% for the state-of-the-art domain adversarial solution.","author":["Fangxin Wang","Jiangchuan Liu","Wei Gong"],"issue":["IWQoS '19: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Quality of Service","June 2019","Article No.: 19","Pages   1\u201310","https://doi.org/10.1145/3326285.3329054"],"date":"24 June 2019","ref":[{"text":"Mart\u00edn Abadi et al. 2016.

The proposed framework learns the brain network representations via a supervised metric-based approach with siamese neural networks using two graph convolutional networks as the twin networks. Our proposed framework performs higher-order convolutions by incorporating higher-order proximity in graph convolutional networks to characterize and learn the community structure in brain connectivity networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first community-preserving graph similarity learning framework for multi-subject brain network analysis. Experimental results on four real fMRI datasets demonstrate the potential use cases of the proposed framework for multi-subject brain analysis in health and neuropsychiatric disorders. Our proposed approach achieves an average AUC gain of $75$% compared to PCA, an average AUC gain of $65.5$% compared to Spectral Embedding, and an average AUC gain of $24.3$% compared to S-GCN across the four datasets, indicating promising applications in clinical investigation and brain disease diagnosis.","author":["Guixiang Ma","Nesreen K.

Human activity recognition is one of the fields in which unobtrusive sensing is heavily researched, as this is especially important in health care. In this regard, investigating WiFi signals, and more specifically 802.11n channel state information, is one of the more prominent research fields. However, there is a challenge in scaling it up. Transfer learning is rarely applied, and when applied, it is done on filtered/modified data or extracted features. This paper focuses on two aspects. First, convolutional networks are used across multiple participants, days and activities and analysis is done based on these results. Secondly, it looks into the possibility of applying transfer learning based on raw channel state information over multiple participants and activities over multiple days. Results show channel state information is accurate for single participants (F1-score of 0.90), but sensitive to different participants and fluctuating WiFi signals over days (F1-score of 0.25-0.35). Furthermore, results show both clustering and transfer learning can be applied to increase the performance to 0.80 when using minimal resources and retraining.","author":["Jeroen Klein Brinke","Nirvana Meratnia"],"issue":["AIChallengeIoT'19: Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Challenges in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Internet of Things","November 2019","Pages   56\u201362","https://doi.org/10.1145/3363347.3363362"],"date":"10 November 2019","ref":[{"text":"Q.

Initial research has suggested that providing children with information about robots\u2019 mechanical status does not alter children's humanlike perception of, and relationship formation with, social robots. Against this background, our study experimentally investigated the effects of transparency about a robot's lack of human psychological capacities (intelligence, self-consciousness, emotionality, identity construction, social cognition) on children's perceptions of a robot and their relationship to it. Our sample consisted of 144 children aged 8 to 9 years old who interacted with the Nao robot in either a transparent or a control condition. Transparency decreased children's humanlike perception of the robot in terms of animacy, anthropomorphism, social presence, and perceived similarity. Transparency reduced child-robot relationship formation in terms of decreased trust, while children's feelings of closeness toward the robot were not affected.","author":["Caroline L. van Straten","Jochen Peter","Rinaldo K\u00fchne","Alex Barco"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Human-Robot Interaction","Volume 9","Issue 2","February 2020","Article No.: 11","pp   1\u201322","https://doi.org/10.1145/3365668"],"date":"25 January 2020","ref":[{"text":"American Psychiatric Association. 2013.

Among other uses, having a meaningful layout is often useful to help interpret the results from network science tasks such as community detection and link prediction. There are several existing graph visualization techniques in the literature that are based on spectral methods, graph embeddings, or optimizing graph distances. Despite the large number of methods, it is still often challenging or extremely time consuming to produce meaningful layouts of graphs with hundreds of thousands of vertices. Existing methods often either fail to produce a visualization in a meaningful time window, or produce a layout colorfully called a \u201chairball\u201d, which does not illustrate any internal structure in the graph. Here, we show that adding higher-order information based on cliques to a classic eigenvector based graph visualization technique enables it to produce meaningful plots of large graphs. We further evaluate these visualizations along a number of graph visualization metrics and we find that it outperforms existing techniques on a metric that uses random walks to measure the local structure. Finally, we show many examples of how our algorithm successfully produces layouts of large networks.

In this paper, we explore an array of phased arrays (APA) architecture, which aggregates co-located phased arrays with complementary FoVs to approximate WiFi-like omni-directional coverage. We found that straightforwardly activating all the arrays may even hamper network performance. To fully exploit the APA's potential, we propose X-Array, which jointly selects the arrays and beams, and applies a dynamic co-phasing mechanism to ensure different arrays' signals enhance each other. X-Array also incorporates a link recovery mechanism to identify alternative arrays/beams that can efficiently recover the link from outage. We have implemented X-Array on a commodity 802.11ad APA radio. Our experiments demonstrate that X-Array can approach omni-directional coverage and maintain high performance in spite of link dynamics.","author":["Song Wang","Jingqi Huang","Xinyu Zhang","Hyoil Kim","Sujit Dey"],"issue":["MobiCom '20: Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking","April 2020","Article No.: 5","Pages   1\u201314","https://doi.org/10.1145/3372224.3380882"],"date":"17 April 2020","ref":[{"text":"Federal Communications Commission, \"FCC Promotes Higher Frequency Spectrum for Future Wireless Technology,\" https://apps.fcc.gov, 2015.","order":1},{"text":"T.

This approach is demonstrated with 1.2 million data points collected using 14nm, 7nm regular-voltage (RVT), and 7nm low-voltage (LVT) technologies with twelve IC designs. The accuracy of predicting the QoRs (delay and area) evaluated using mean absolute prediction error (MAPE). While collecting training data points in EDA can be extremely challenging, we propose to elaborate transfer learning in our approach, which enables accurate predictions cross different technologies and different IC designs.

However, these crossbars require the use of ADCs which constitute a significant fraction of the cost of MVM operations. The overhead of ADCs can be mitigated via partial sum quantization. However, prior quantization flows for DNN inference accelerators do not consider partial sum quantization which is not highly relevant to traditional digital architectures. To address this issue, we propose a mixed precision quantization scheme for ReRAM-based DNN inference accelerators where weight quantization, input quantization, and partial sum quantization are jointly applied for each DNN layer. We also propose an automated quantization flow powered by deep reinforcement learning to search for the best quantization configuration in the large design space. Our evaluation shows that the proposed mixed precision quantization scheme and quantization flow reduce inference latency and energy consumption by up to 3.89x and 4.84x, respectively, while only losing 1.18% in DNN inference accuracy.","author":["Sitao Huang","Aayush Ankit","Plinio Silveira","Rodrigo Antunes","Sai Rahul Chalamalasetti","Izzat El Hajj","Dong Eun Kim","Glaucimar Aguiar","Pedro Bruel","Sergey Serebryakov","Cong Xu","Can Li","Paolo Faraboschi","John Paul Strachan","Deming Chen","Kaushik Roy","Wen-mei Hwu","Dejan Milojicic"],"issue":["ASPDAC '21: Proceedings of the 26th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","January 2021","Pages   372\u2013377","https://doi.org/10.1145/3394885.3431554"],"date":"18 January 2021","ref":[{"text":"Patrick Judd et al.

RNNs are particularly well suited for machine learning problems in which context is important, such as speech recognition and language translation.This work presents RNNFast, a hardware accelerator for RNNs that leverages an emerging class of non-volatile memory called domain-wall memory (DWM). We show that DWM is very well suited for RNN acceleration due to its very high density and low read/write energy. At the same time, the sequential nature of input/weight processing of RNNs mitigates one of the downsides of DWM, which is the linear (rather than constant) data access time.RNNFast is very efficient and highly scalable, with flexible mapping of logical neurons to RNN hardware blocks. The basic hardware primitive, the RNN processing element (PE), includes custom DWM-based multiplication, sigmoid and tanh units for high density and low energy. The accelerator is designed to minimize data movement by closely interleaving DWM storage and computation. We compare our design with a state-of-the-art GPGPU and find 21.8\u00d7 higher performance with 70\u00d7 lower energy.","author":["Mohammad Hossein Samavatian","Anys Bacha","Li Zhou","Radu Teodorescu"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 16","Issue 4","October 2020","Article No.: 38","pp   1\u201327","https://doi.org/10.1145/3399670"],"date":"18 September 2020","ref":[{"text":"[n.d.].

To achieve PPA goals, a human engineer typically spends a considerable amount of time tuning the multiple settings of a commercial placer (e.g. maximum density, congestion effort, etc.). This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework to optimize the placement parameters of a commercial EDA tool. We build an autonomous agent that learns to tune parameters optimally without human intervention and domain knowledge, trained solely by RL from self-search. To generalize to unseen netlists, we use a mixture of handcrafted features from graph topology theory along with graph embeddings generated using unsupervised Graph Neural Networks. Our RL algorithms are chosen to overcome the sparsity of data and latency of placement runs. Our trained RL agent achieves up to 11% and 2.5% wirelength improvements on unseen netlists compared with a human engineer and a state-of-the-art tool auto-tuner, in just one placement iteration (20\u00d7 and 50\u00d7 less iterations).","author":["Anthony Agnesina","Kyungwook Chang","Sung Kyu Lim"],"issue":["ICCAD '20: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design","November 2020","Article No.: 144","Pages   1\u20139","https://doi.org/10.1145/3400302.3415690"],"date":"02 November 2020","ref":[{"text":"J.

FPGA-based acceleration of CNN inference has demonstrated various benefits compared to other high-performance devices such as GPGPUs. Current FPGA CNN-acceleration solutions are based on a single FPGA design, which are limited by the available resources on an FPGA. In addition, they can only accelerate conventional 2D neural networks. To address these limitations, we present a generic multi-FPGA solution, written in OpenCL, which can accelerate more complex CNNs (e.g., C3D CNN) and achieve a near linear speedup with respect to the available single-FPGA solutions. The design is built upon the Intel Deep Learning Accelerator architecture, with three extensions. First, it includes updates for better area efficiency (up to 25%) and higher performance (up to 24%). Second, it supports 3D convolutions for more challenging applications such as video learning. Third, it supports multi-FPGA communication for higher inference throughput. The results show that utilizing multiple FPGAs can linearly increase the overall bandwidth while maintaining the same end-to-end latency. In addition, the design can outperform other FPGA 2D accelerators by up to 8.4 times and 3D accelerators by up to 1.7 times.","author":["Saman Biookaghazadeh","Pravin Kumar Ravi","Ming Zhao"],"issue":["ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems","Volume 17","Issue 2","April 2021","Article No.: 25","pp   1\u201323","https://doi.org/10.1145/3432816"],"date":"29 April 2021","ref":[{"text":"Chen Zhang, Di Wu, Jiayu Sun, Guangyu Sun, Guojie Luo, and Jason Cong. 2016.

The main promise is very low energy consumption. Classic Von Neumann architecture based SNN accelerators in hardware, however, often fall short of addressing demanding computation and data transfer requirements efficiently at scale. In this article, we propose a promising alternative to overcome scalability limitations, based on a network of in-memory SNN accelerators, which can reduce the energy consumption by up to 150.25= when compared to a representative ASIC solution. The significant reduction in energy comes from two key aspects of the hardware design to minimize data communication overheads: (1) each node represents an in-memory SNN accelerator based on a spintronic Computational RAM array, and (2) a novel, De Bruijn graph based architecture establishes the SNN array connectivity.","author":["H\u00fcsrev C\u0131lasun","Salonik Resch","Zamshed I.

In this paper we propose a simulated sintering technique which is analogous to the sintering process in material processing. In sintering one improves the quality of a processed material by heating it to a temperature close to the melting point. Analogously, we show that by starting out with a good initial configuration instead of a random configuration, and restricting uphill moves, we can considerably speed up simulated annealing. We use this idea for a standard cell placement program - GRIM in LTX2, an AT&T Bell Labs VLSI layout system. The initial configuration is produced either by changes to a layout the designer had done previously, or else by a fast program like min-cut. We obtain improvements of about 10% in chip area starting from a min-cut placement, in times about 3 times faster than our simulated annealing program (which itself is several times faster than other well known simulated annealing programs).","author":["L.

In these six programs ten distinct values occupy over 50% of all memory locations and on an average account for nearly 50% of all memory accesses during program execution. This observation holds for smaller blocks of consecutive memory locations and the set of frequent values remains quite stable over the execution of the program.In the six benchmarks with frequent value locality, on an average 50% of all cache misses occur during the reading or writing of the ten most frequently accessed values. We propose a new data cache structure, the frequent value cache (FVC), which employs a value-centric approach to caching data locations for exploiting the frequent value locality phenomenon. FVC is a small direct-mapped cache which is dedicated to holding only frequently occurring values. The value-centric nature of FVC enables us to store data in a compressed form where the compression is achieved by encoding the frequent values using a few bits. Moreover this simple compression scheme preserves the random access to data values in a cache line.Our experiments demonstrate that by augmenting a direct mapped cache (DMC) with a direct mapped FVC of size no more than 3 Kbytes we can obtain reductions in miss rates ranging from 1% to 68%. In fact we observed that higher reductions in miss rates can he achieved by augmenting a DMC with a small FVC as opposed to doubling the size of DMC for the 124.m88ksim and 134.perl benchmarks.","author":["Youtao Zhang","Jun Yang","Rajiv Gupta"],"issue":["ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","Volume 34","Issue 5","Dec. 2000","pp   150\u2013159","https://doi.org/10.1145/384264.379235"],"date":"12 November 2000","ref":[{"text":"D.

Consider an n-by-m rectangular grid and a set of N two-terminal nets. A net is a pair of points on the boundary of the rectangle. A layout is a set of edge-disjoint paths, one for each net. Our algorithm constructs a layout, if there is one, in O(N log N) time; this contrasts favorably with the area of the layout that might be as large as N2. The layout constructed can be wired using four layers of interconnect with only O(N) contact cuts. A partial extension to multiterminal nets is also discussed.","author":["K. Mehlhorn","F. P.

Extractors are algorithms that transform a \u201cweakly random\u201d distribution into an almost uniform distribution. Explicit constructions of extractors have a variety of important applications, and tend to be very difficult to obtain.We demonstrate an unsuspected connection between extractors and pseudorandom generators. In fact, we show that every pseudorandom generator of a certain kind is an extractor.A pseudorandom generator construction due to Impagliazzo and Wigderson, once reinterpreted via our connection, is already an extractor that beats most known constructions and solves an important open question. We also show that, using the simpler Nisan--Wigderson generator and standard error-correcting codes, one can build even better extractors with the additional advantage that both the construction and the analysis are simple and admit a short self-contained description.","issue":["Journal of the ACM","Volume 48","Issue 4","July 2001","pp   860\u2013879","https://doi.org/10.1145/502090.502099"],"date":"01 July 2001","ref":[{"text":"ANDREEV, A.

We prove existence and uniqueness properties of the weighted averages, and give fast iterative algorithms with linear and quadratic convergence rates. Our methods are appropriate to problems involving averages of spherical data in meteorological, geophysical, and astronomical applications. One simple application is a method for smooth averaging of quaternions, which generalizes Shoemake's spherical linear interpolation.The weighted averages methods allow a novel method of defining B\u00e9zier and spline curves on spheres, which provides direct generalization of B\u00e9zier and B-spline curves to spherical spline curves. We present a fast algorithm for spline interpolation on spheres. Our spherical splines allow the use of arbitrary knot positions; potential applications of spherical splines include smooth quaternion curves for applications in graphics, animation, robotics, and motion planning.","author":["Samuel R.

This technique uses a cell connectivity metric to identify seeds for efficient clustering. Effective seed selection, coupled with an interconnect-resource aware clustering and placement, can have a favorable impact on circuit routability. It leads to better device utilization, savings in area, and reduction in power consumption. Routing area reduction of 35% is achieved over previously published results. Power dissipation simulations using a buffered pass-transistor-based FPGA interconnect model are presented. They show that our clustering technique can reduce the overall device power dissipation by an average of 13%.","author":["Amit Singh","Malgorzata Marek-Sadowska"],"issue":["FPGA '02: Proceedings of the 2002 ACM/SIGDA tenth international symposium on Field-programmable gate arrays","February 2002","Pages   59\u201366","https://doi.org/10.1145/503048.503058"],"date":"24 February 2002","ref":[{"text":"E.

It is inconvenient and inefficient for an ordinary user to invoke multiple search engines and identify useful documents from the returned results. To support unified access to multiple search engines, a metasearch engine can be constructed. When a metasearch engine receives a query from a user, it invokes the underlying search engines to retrieve useful information for the user. Metasearch engines have other benefits as a search tool such as increasing the search coverage of the Web and improving the scalability of the search. In this article, we survey techniques that have been proposed to tackle several underlying challenges for building a good metasearch engine. Among the main challenges, the database selection problem is to identify search engines that are likely to return useful documents to a given query. The document selection problem is to determine what documents to retrieve from each identified search engine. The result merging problem is to combine the documents returned from multiple search engines. We will also point out some problems that need to be further researched.","author":["Weiyi Meng","Clement Yu","King-Lup Liu"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 34","Issue 1","March 2002","pp   48\u201389","https://doi.org/10.1145/505282.505284"],"date":"01 March 2002","ref":[{"text":"ABDULLA, G., LIU, B., SAAD, R., AND FOX, E. 1997.

However, the lack of any structural regularity in these essentially random codes is a major challenge for building a practical low-power LDPC decoder. In this paper, we jointly design the code and the decoder to induce the structural regularity needed for a reduced complexity parallel decoder architecture. This interconnect-driven code design approach eliminates the need for a complex interconnection network while still retaining the algorithmic performance promised by random codes. Moreover, we propose a new approach for computing reliability metrics based on the BCJR algorithm that reduces the message switching activity in the decoder compared to existing approaches. Simulations show that the proposed approach results in power savings of up to 85.64% over conventional implementations.","author":["Mohammad M. Mansour","Naresh R.

The process of remeshing refers to approximating such geometry using a mesh with (semi)-regular connectivity, which has advantages for many graphics applications. However, current techniques for remeshing arbitrary surfaces create only semi-regular meshes. The original mesh is typically decomposed into a set of disk-like charts, onto which the geometry is parametrized and sampled. In this paper, we propose to remesh an arbitrary surface onto a completely regular structure we call a geometry image. It captures geometry as a simple 2D array of quantized points. Surface signals like normals and colors are stored in similar 2D arrays using the same implicit surface parametrization --- texture coordinates are absent. To create a geometry image, we cut an arbitrary mesh along a network of edge paths, and parametrize the resulting single chart onto a square. Geometry images can be encoded using traditional image compression algorithms, such as wavelet-based coders.","author":["Xianfeng Gu","Steven J.

An analytical comparison shows that the retrieval performance of methods based on distinct term-scoring functions is comparable on the whole query set but differs considerably on single queries, consistent with the fact that the ordered sets of expansion terms suggested for each query by the different functions are largely uncorrelated. Motivated by these findings, we argue that the results of multiple functions can be merged, by analogy with ensembling classifiers, and present a simple combination technique based on the rank values of the suggested terms. The combined retrieval feedback method is effective not only with respect to unexpanded queries but also to any individual method, with notable improvements on the system's precision. Furthermore, the combined method is robust with respect to variation of experimental parameters and it is beneficial even when the same information needs are expressed with shorter queries.","author":["Claudio Carpineto","Giovanni Romano","Vittorio Giannini"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Information Systems","Volume 20","Issue 3","July 2002","pp   259\u2013290","https://doi.org/10.1145/568727.568728"],"date":"01 July 2002","ref":[{"text":"Aronson, A.

Unfortunately, traditional text-based search techniques are not always effective for 3D data. In this article, we investigate new shape-based search methods. The key challenges are to develop query methods simple enough for novice users and matching algorithms robust enough to work for arbitrary polygonal models. We present a Web-based search engine system that supports queries based on 3D sketches, 2D sketches, 3D models, and/or text keywords. For the shape-based queries, we have developed a new matching algorithm that uses spherical harmonics to compute discriminating similarity measures without requiring repair of model degeneracies or alignment of orientations. It provides 46 to 245% better performance than related shape-matching methods during precision--recall experiments, and it is fast enough to return query results from a repository of 20,000 models in under a second. The net result is a growing interactive index of 3D models available on the Web (i.e., a Google for 3D models).","author":["Thomas Funkhouser","Patrick Min","Michael Kazhdan","Joyce Chen","Alex Halderman","David Dobkin","David Jacobs"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 22","Issue 1","January 2003","pp   83\u2013105","https://doi.org/10.1145/588272.588279"],"date":"01 January 2003","ref":[{"text":"Aherne, F., Thacker, N., and Rockett, P. 1997.

To classify a database, QProber does not retrieve or inspect any documents or pages from the database, but rather just exploits the number of matches that each query probe generates at the database in question. We have conducted an extensive experimental evaluation of QProber over collections of real documents, experimenting with different types of document classifiers and retrieval models. We have also tested our system with over one hundred Web-accessible databases. Our experiments show that our system has low overhead and achieves high classification accuracy across a variety of databases.","author":["Luis Gravano","Panagiotis G.

With a large (and growing) number of electronic systems being designed with battery considerations in mind, minimizing the energy consumed in on-chip interconnects becomes crucial. Further, the use of nanometer technologies is making it increasingly important to consider reliability issues during the design of SoC communication architectures. Continued supply voltage scaling has led to decreased noise margins, making interconnects more susceptible to noise sources such as crosstalk, power supply noise, radiation induced defects, etc. The resulting transient faults cause the interconnect to behave as an unreliable transport medium for data signals. Therefore, fault tolerant communication mechanisms, such as Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ), Forward Error Correction (FEC), etc., which have been widely used in the networking community, are likely to percolate to the SoC domain.This paper presents a survey of techniques for energy efficient on-chip communication. Techniques operating at different levels of the communication design hierarchy are described, including circuit-level techniques, such as low voltage signaling, architecture-level techniques, such as communication architecture selection and bus isolation, system-level techniques, such as communication based power management and dynamic voltage scaling for interconnects, and network-level techniques, such as error resilient encoding for packetized on-chip communication. Emerging technologies, such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) based buses, and wireless interconnects are also surveyed.","author":["Vijay Raghunathan","Mani B. Srivastava","Rajesh K.

The ratio of the flow supplied between a pair of entities to the predefined demand for that pair is called throughput and must be the same for all pairs of entities for a concurrent flow. The MCFP objective is to maximize the throughput, subject to the capacity constraints. We develop a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the MCFP for the case of arbitrary demands and uniform capacity. Computational results are presented. It is shown that the problem of associating costs (distances) to the edges so as to maximize the minimum-cost of routing the concurrent flow is the dual of the MCFP. A path-cut type duality theorem to expose the combinatorial structure of the MCFP is also derived. Our duality theorems are proved constructively for arbitrary demands and uniform capacity using the algorithm.

The objective function is a weighted combination of three measures: proximity of transformed vertices to the range data, similarity between neighboring transformations, and proximity of sparse markers at corresponding locations on the template and target surface. We solve for the transformations with a non-linear optimizer, run at two resolutions to speed convergence. We demonstrate reconstruction and consistent parameterization of 250 human body models. With this parameterized set, we explore a variety of applications for human body modeling, including: morphing, texture transfer, statistical analysis of shape, model fitting from sparse markers, feature analysis to modify multiple correlated parameters (such as the weight and height of an individual), and transfer of surface detail and animation controls from a template to fitted models.","author":["Brett Allen","Brian Curless","Zoran Popovi\u0107"],"issue":["ACM Transactions on Graphics","Volume 22","Issue 3","July 2003","pp   587\u2013594","https://doi.org/10.1145/882262.882311"],"date":"01 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"ALLEN, B., CURLESS, B., AND POPOVI\u0106, Z. 2002.

This is due to the importance of combinatorial optimization problems for the scientific as well as the industrial world. We give a survey of the nowadays most important metaheuristics from a conceptual point of view. We outline the different components and concepts that are used in the different metaheuristics in order to analyze their similarities and differences. Two very important concepts in metaheuristics are intensification and diversification. These are the two forces that largely determine the behavior of a metaheuristic. They are in some way contrary but also complementary to each other. We introduce a framework, that we call the I&D frame, in order to put different intensification and diversification components into relation with each other. Outlining the advantages and disadvantages of different metaheuristic approaches we conclude by pointing out the importance of hybridization of metaheuristics as well as the integration of metaheuristics and other methods for optimization.","author":["Christian Blum","Andrea Roli"],"issue":["ACM Computing Surveys","Volume 35","Issue 3","September 2003","pp   268\u2013308","https://doi.org/10.1145/937503.937505"],"date":"01 September 2003","ref":[{"text":"Aarts, E.

Therefore, practical techniques, such as test compression and compaction, are required to reduce the amount of test data in order to reduce both the total testing time and memory requirements for the tester. In this article, a new approach to static compaction for combinational circuits, referred to as test vector decomposition (TVD), is proposed. In addition, two new TVD based static compaction algorithms are presented. Experimental results for benchmark circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the two new static compaction algorithms.","author":["Aiman H. El-Maleh","Yahya E.

A new intersection algorithm is developed which uses ideas from algebraic geometry to obtain a numerical procedure for finding the intersection of a ray and a patch without subdivision. The algorithm may use complex coordinates for the (u, v)-parameters of the patches. The choice of these coordinates makes the computations more uniform, so that there are fewer special cases to be considered. In particular, the appearance and disappearance of silhouette edges can be handled quite naturally. The uniformity of these techniques may be suitable for implementation on either a general purpose pipelined machine, or on special purpose hardware.","author":["James T.

The Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method is a powerful computational electromagnetic technique for modelling the electromagnetic space. The 3D FDTD buried object detection forward model is emerging as a useful application in mine detection and other subsurface sensing areas. However, the computation of this model is complex and time consuming. Implementing this algorithm in hardware will greatly increase its computational speed and widen its use in many other areas. We present an FPGA implementation to speedup the pseudo-2D FDTD algorithm which is a simplified version of the 3D FDTD model. The pseudo-2D model can be upgraded to 3D with limited modification of structure. We implement the pseudo-2D FDTD model for layered media and complete boundary conditions on an FPGA. The computational speed on the reconfigurable hardware design is about 24 times faster than a software implementation on a 3.0GHz PC. The speedup is due to pipelining, parallelism, use of fixed point arithmetic, and careful memory architecture design.","author":["Wang Chen","Panos Kosmas","Miriam Leeser","Carey Rappaport"],"issue":["FPGA '04: Proceedings of the 2004 ACM/SIGDA 12th international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays","February 2004","Pages   213\u2013222","https://doi.org/10.1145/968280.968311"],"date":"22 February 2004","ref":[{"text":"K.

One of the most widely used data organization structures is the tree structure. When such structures encode sensitive information (such as in XML documents), it is crucial that integrity and confidentiality be assured not only for the content, but also for the structure. Digital signature schemes are commonly used to authenticate the integrity of the data. The most widely used such technique for tree structures is the Merkle hash technique, which however is known to be \"not hiding\", thus leading to unauthorized leakage of information. Most techniques in the literature are based on the Merkle hash technique and thus suffer from the problem of unauthorized information leakages. Assurance of integrity and confidentiality (no leakages) of tree-structured data is an important problem in the context of secure data publishing and content distribution systems.In this paper, we propose a signature scheme for tree structures, which assures both confidentiality and integrity and is also efficient, especially in third-party distribution environments. Our integrity assurance technique, which we refer to as the \"Structural signature scheme\", is based on the structure of the tree as defined by tree traversals (pre-order, post-order, in-order) and is defined using a randomized notion of such traversal numbers. In addition to formally defining the technique, we prove that it protects against violations of content and structural integrity and information leakages. We also show through complexity and performance analysis that the structural signature scheme is efficient; with respect to the Merkle hash technique, it incurs comparable cost for signing the trees and incurs lower cost for user-side integrity verification.","author":["Ashish Kundu","Elisa Bertino"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 1","Issue 1","August 2008","pp   138\u2013150","https://doi.org/10.14778/1453856.1453876"],"date":"01 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"IBM XL C/C++. http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/xlcpp/.","order":1},{"text":"Java cryptographic architecture. http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/ security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html.","order":2},{"text":"Rakesh Agrawal, Jerry Kiernan, Ramakrishnan Srikant, and Yirong Xu.

Similarity join is a fundamental operation in many application areas, such as data integration and cleaning, bioinformatics, and pattern recognition. We focus on efficient algorithms for similarity join with edit distance constraints. Existing approaches are mainly based on converting the edit distance constraint to a weaker constraint on the number of matching q-grams between pair of strings.In this paper, we propose the novel perspective of investigating mismatching q-grams. Technically, we derive two new edit distance lower bounds by analyzing the locations and contents of mismatching q-grams. A new algorithm, Ed-Join, is proposed that exploits the new mismatch-based filtering methods; it achieves substantial reduction of the candidate sizes and hence saves computation time. We demonstrate experimentally that the new algorithm outperforms alternative methods on large-scale real datasets under a wide range of parameter settings.","author":["Chuan Xiao","Wei Wang","Xuemin Lin"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 1","Issue 1","August 2008","pp   933\u2013944","https://doi.org/10.14778/1453856.1453957"],"date":"01 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"A.

For cost and performance reasons, processing is typically done on large clusters of shared-nothing commodity machines. It is imperative to develop a programming model that hides the complexity of the underlying system but provides flexibility by allowing users to extend functionality to meet a variety of requirements.In this paper, we present a new declarative and extensible scripting language, SCOPE (Structured Computations Optimized for Parallel Execution), targeted for this type of massive data analysis. The language is designed for ease of use with no explicit parallelism, while being amenable to efficient parallel execution on large clusters. SCOPE borrows several features from SQL. Data is modeled as sets of rows composed of typed columns. The select statement is retained with inner joins, outer joins, and aggregation allowed. Users can easily define their own functions and implement their own versions of operators: extractors (parsing and constructing rows from a file), processors (row-wise processing), reducers (group-wise processing), and combiners (combining rows from two inputs). SCOPE supports nesting of expressions but also allows a computation to be specified as a series of steps, in a manner often preferred by programmers. We also describe how scripts are compiled into efficient, parallel execution plans and executed on large clusters.","author":["Ronnie Chaiken","Bob Jenkins","Per-\u00c5ke Larson","Bill Ramsey","Darren Shakib","Simon Weaver","Jingren Zhou"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 1","Issue 2","August 2008","pp   1265\u20131276","https://doi.org/10.14778/1454159.1454166"],"date":"01 August 2008","ref":[{"text":"Apache.

Even though database systems traditionally accommodate simultaneous requests, a multitude of synchronization barriers serialize execution. Write-ahead logging is a fundamental, omnipresent component in ARIES-style concurrency and recovery, and one of the most important yet-to-be addressed potential bottlenecks, especially in OLTP workloads making frequent small changes to data.In this paper, we identify four logging-related impediments to database system scalability. Each issue challenges different level in the software architecture: (a) the high volume of small-sized I/O requests may saturate the disk, (b) transactions hold locks while waiting for the log flush, (c) extensive context switching overwhelms the OS scheduler with threads executing log I/Os, and (d) contention appears as transactions serialize accesses to in-memory log data structures. We demonstrate these problems and address them with techniques that, when combined, comprise a holistic, scalable approach to logging. Our solution achieves a 20%-69% speedup over a modern database system when running log-intensive workloads, such as the TPC-B and TATP benchmarks. Moreover, it achieves log insert throughput over 1.8GB/s for small log records on a single socket server, an order of magnitude higher than the traditional way of accessing the log using a single mutex.","author":["Ryan Johnson","Ippokratis Pandis","Radu Stoica","Manos Athanassoulis","Anastasia Ailamaki"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   681\u2013692","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1920928"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"L.

The copying relationships can be complex: some sources copy from multiple sources on different subsets of data; some co-copy from the same source, and some transitively copy from another. Understanding such copying relationships is desirable both for business purposes and for improving many key components in data integration, such as resolving conflicts across various sources, reconciling distinct references to the same real-world entity, and efficiently answering queries over multiple sources. Recent works have studied how to detect copying between a pair of sources, but the techniques can fall short in the presence of complex copying relationships.In this paper we describe techniques that discover global copying relationships between a set of structured sources. Towards this goal we make two contributions. First, we propose a global detection algorithm that identifies co-copying and transitive copying, returning only source pairs with direct copying. Second, global detection requires accurate decisions on copying direction; we significantly improve over previous techniques on this by considering various types of evidence for copying and correlation of copying on different data items. Experimental results on real-world data and synthetic data show high effectiveness and efficiency of our techniques.","author":["Xin Luna Dong","Laure Berti-Equille","Yifan Hu","Divesh Srivastava"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 3","Issue 1-2","September 2010","pp   1358\u20131369","https://doi.org/10.14778/1920841.1921008"],"date":"01 September 2010","ref":[{"text":"L.

Those knowledge bases can be viewed as graphs with nodes representing entities and edges representing (primary) relationships, and various studies have been conducted on how to leverage them to answer entity seeking queries. Meanwhile, in a complementary direction, analyses over the query logs have enabled researchers to identify entity pairs that are statistically correlated. Such entity relationships are then presented to search users through the \"related searches\" feature in modern search engines. However, entity relationships thus discovered can often be \"puzzling\" to the users because why the entities are connected is often indescribable. In this paper, we propose a novel problem called entity relationship explanation, which seeks to explain why a pair of entities are connected, and solve this challenging problem by integrating the above two complementary approaches, i.e., we leverage the knowledge base to \"explain\" the connections discovered between entity pairs.More specifically, we present REX, a system that takes a pair of entities in a given knowledge base as input and efficiently identifies a ranked list of relationship explanations. We formally define relationship explanations and analyze their desirable properties. Furthermore, we design and implement algorithms to efficiently enumerate and rank all relationship explanations based on multiple measures of \"interestingness.\" We perform extensive experiments over real web-scale data gathered from DBpedia and a commercial search engine, demonstrating the efficiency and scalability of REX. We also perform user studies to corroborate the effectiveness of explanations generated by REX.","author":["Lujun Fang","Anish Das Sarma","Cong Yu","Philip Bohannon"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 5","Issue 3","November 2011","pp   241\u2013252","https://doi.org/10.14778/2078331.2078339"],"date":"01 November 2011","ref":[{"text":"S.

While this problem is NP-hard, in recent years, many algorithms have been proposed to solve it in a reasonable time for real datasets using different join orders, pruning rules, and auxiliary neighborhood information. However, since they have not been empirically compared one another in most research work, it is not clear whether the later work outperforms the earlier work. Another problem is that reported comparisons were often done using the original authors' binaries which were written in different programming environments. In this paper, we address these serious problems by re-implementing five state-of-the-art subgraph isomorphism algorithms in a common code base and by comparing them using many real-world datasets and their query loads. Through our in-depth analysis of experimental results, we report surprising empirical findings.","author":["Jinsoo Lee","Wook-Shin Han","Romans Kasperovics","Jeong-Hoon Lee"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 2","December 2012","pp   133\u2013144","https://doi.org/10.14778/2535568.2448946"],"date":"01 December 2012","ref":[{"text":"J.

Users specify a directed computation graph and application code for individual nodes, and the system manages persistent state and the continuous flow of records, all within the envelope of the framework's fault-tolerance guarantees.This paper describes MillWheel's programming model as well as its implementation. The case study of a continuous anomaly detector in use at Google serves to motivate how many of MillWheel's features are used. MillWheel's programming model provides a notion of logical time, making it simple to write time-based aggregations. MillWheel was designed from the outset with fault tolerance and scalability in mind. In practice, we find that MillWheel's unique combination of scalability, fault tolerance, and a versatile programming model lends itself to a wide variety of problems at Google.","author":["Tyler Akidau","Alex Balikov","Kaya Bekiro\u011flu","Slava Chernyak","Josh Haberman","Reuven Lax","Sam McVeety","Daniel Mills","Paul Nordstrom","Sam Whittle"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 6","Issue 11","August 2013","pp   1033\u20131044","https://doi.org/10.14778/2536222.2536229"],"date":"01 August 2013","ref":[{"text":"D.

Such NVRAMs could revolutionize online transaction processing (OLTP), which today must employ sophisticated optimizations with substantial software overheads to overcome the long latency and poor random access performance of disk. Nevertheless, many candidate NVRAM technologies exhibit their own limitations, such as greater-than-DRAM latency, particularly for writes.In this paper, we reconsider OLTP durability management to optimize recovery performance and forward-processing throughput for emerging NVRAMs. First, we demonstrate that using NVRAM as a drop-in replacement for disk allows near-instantaneous recovery, but software complexity necessary for disk (i.e., Write Ahead Logging/ARIES) limits transaction throughput. Next, we consider the possibility of removing software-managed DRAM buffering. Finally, we measure the cost of ordering writes to NVRAM, which is vital for correct recovery. We consider three recovery mechanisms: NVRAM Disk-Replacement, In-Place Updates (transactions persist data in-place), and NVRAM Group Commit (transactions commit/persist atomically in batches). Whereas In-Place Updates offers the simplest design, it introduces persist synchronizations at every page update. NVRAM Group Commit minimizes persist synchronization, offering up to a 50% throughput improvement for large synchronous persist latencies.","author":["Steven Pelley","Thomas F. Wenisch","Brian T.

Despite several recent advancements, such as pre-configured cloud database images and database-as-a-service (DBaaS) offerings, the deployment of a comprehensive testing platform with a diverse set of datasets and workloads is still far from being trivial. In many cases, researchers and developers are limited to a small number of workloads to evaluate the performance characteristics of their work. This is due to the lack of a universal benchmarking infrastructure, and to the difficulty of gaining access to real data and workloads. This results in lots of unnecessary engineering efforts and makes the performance evaluation results difficult to compare. To remedy these problems, we present OLTP-Bench, an extensible \"batteries included\" DBMS benchmarking testbed. The key contributions of OLTP-Bench are its ease of use and extensibility, support for tight control of transaction mixtures, request rates, and access distributions over time, as well as the ability to support all major DBMSs and DBaaS platforms. Moreover, it is bundled with fifteen workloads that all differ in complexity and system demands, including four synthetic workloads, eight workloads from popular benchmarks, and three workloads that are derived from real-world applications. We demonstrate through a comprehensive set of experiments conducted on popular DBMS and DBaaS offerings the different features provided by OLTP-Bench and the effectiveness of our testbed in characterizing the performance of database services.","author":["Djellel Eddine Difallah","Andrew Pavlo","Carlo Curino","Philippe Cudre-Mauroux"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 7","Issue 4","December 2013","pp   277\u2013288","https://doi.org/10.14778/2732240.2732246"],"date":"01 December 2013","ref":[{"text":"JPA Performance Benchmark. http://www.jpab.org.","order":1},{"text":"OLTPBenchmark.com. http://oltpbenchmark.com.","order":2},{"text":"pgbench. http://postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/pgbench.html.","order":3},{"text":"PolePosition: The Open Source Database Benchmark. http://polepos.org.","order":4},{"text":"SysBench: A System Performance Benchmark. http://sysbench.sourceforge.net.","order":5},{"text":"V.

Persistent memory is byte-addressable, but exhibits asymmetric I/O: writes are typically one order of magnitude more expensive than reads. Byte addressability combined with I/O asymmetry render the performance profile of persistent memory unique. Thus, it becomes imperative to find new ways to seamlessly incorporate it into database systems. We do so in the context of query processing. We focus on the fundamental operations of sort and join processing. We introduce the notion of write-limited algorithms that effectively minimize the I/O cost. We give a high-level API that enables the system to dynamically optimize the workflow of the algorithms; or, alternatively, allows the developer to tune the write profile of the algorithms. We present four different techniques to incorporate persistent memory into the database processing stack in light of this API. We have implemented and extensively evaluated all our proposals. Our results show that the algorithms deliver on their promise of I/O-minimality and tunable performance. We showcase the merits and deficiencies of each implementation technique, thus taking a solid first step towards incorporating persistent memory into query processing.","author":["Stratis D.

Particularly in exploratory data analysis, the focus is on interactive querying and some degree of error in estimated results is tolerable. A common response to this challenge is approximate query processing, where the user is presented with a quick confidence interval estimate based on a sample of the data. In this work, we highlight some of the problems that are associated with this probabilistic approach when extended to more complex queries, both in semantic interpretation and the lack of a formal algebra. As an alternative, we propose deterministic approximate querying (DAQ) schemes, formalize a closed deterministic approximation algebra, and outline some design principles for DAQ schemes. We also illustrate the utility of this approach with an example deterministic online approximation scheme which uses a bitsliced index representation and computes the most significant bits of the result first. Our prototype scheme delivers speedups over exact aggregation and predicate evaluation, and outperforms sampling-based schemes for extreme value aggregations.","author":["Navneet Potti","Jignesh M.

While numerous graph processing systems have been developed and evaluated on available benchmark graphs of up to 6.6B edges, they often face significant difficulties in scaling to much larger graphs. Industry graphs can be two orders of magnitude larger - hundreds of billions or up to one trillion edges. In addition to scalability challenges, real world applications often require much more complex graph processing workflows than previously evaluated. In this paper, we describe the usability, performance, and scalability improvements we made to Apache Giraph, an open-source graph processing system, in order to use it on Facebook-scale graphs of up to one trillion edges. We also describe several key extensions to the original Pregel model that make it possible to develop a broader range of production graph applications and workflows as well as improve code reuse. Finally, we report on real-world operations as well as performance characteristics of several large-scale production applications.","author":["Avery Ching","Sergey Edunov","Maja Kabiljo","Dionysios Logothetis","Sambavi Muthukrishnan"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 12","August 2015","pp   1804\u20131815","https://doi.org/10.14778/2824032.2824077"],"date":"01 August 2015","ref":[{"text":"Apache giraph - http://giraph.apache.org.","order":1},{"text":"Apache hadoop. http://hadoop.apache.org/.","order":2},{"text":"Apache mahout - http://mahout.apache.org.","order":3},{"text":"Beevolve twitter study. http://www.beevolve.com/twitter-statistics.","order":4},{"text":"Giraph jira. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GIRAPH.","order":5},{"text":"Netty - http://netty.io.","order":6},{"text":"Open graph. https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph.","order":7},{"text":"Yahoo! altavista web page hyperlink connectivity graph, circa 2002, 2012. http://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/.","order":8},{"text":"L.

These frameworks hide the complexity of task parallelism and fault-tolerance, by exposing a simple programming API to users. In this paper, we evaluate the major architectural components in MapReduce and Spark frameworks including: shuffle, execution model, and caching, by using a set of important analytic workloads. To conduct a detailed analysis, we developed two profiling tools: (1) We correlate the task execution plan with the resource utilization for both MapReduce and Spark, and visually present this correlation; (2) We provide a break-down of the task execution time for in-depth analysis. Through detailed experiments, we quantify the performance differences between MapReduce and Spark. Furthermore, we attribute these performance differences to different components which are architected differently in the two frameworks. We further expose the source of these performance differences by using a set of micro-benchmark experiments. Overall, our experiments show that Spark is about 2.5x, 5x, and 5x faster than MapReduce, for Word Count, k-means, and PageRank, respectively. The main causes of these speedups are the efficiency of the hash-based aggregation component for combine, as well as reduced CPU and disk overheads due to RDD caching in Spark. An exception to this is the Sort workload, for which MapReduce is 2x faster than Spark. We show that MapReduce's execution model is more efficient for shuffling data than Spark, thus making Sort run faster on MapReduce.","author":["Juwei Shi","Yunjie Qiu","Umar Farooq Minhas","Limei Jiao","Chen Wang","Berthold Reinwald","Fatma \u00d6zcan"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 8","Issue 13","September 2015","pp   2110\u20132121","https://doi.org/10.14778/2831360.2831365"],"date":"01 September 2015","ref":[{"text":"Apache Hadoop. http://hadoop.apache.org/.","order":1},{"text":"Apache Mahout. https://mahout.apache.org/.","order":2},{"text":"HDFS caching. http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/CentralizedCacheManagement.html.","order":3},{"text":"HPROF: A heap/cpu profiling tool. http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/samples/hprof.html.","order":4},{"text":"RRDtool. http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/.","order":5},{"text":"Spark wins 2014 graysort competition. http://databricks.com/blog/2014/11/05/spark-officially-sets-a-new-record-in-large-scale-sorting.html.","order":6},{"text":"J.

However, new classes of applications have emerged, e.g., blockchain and collaborative analytics, featuring data versioning, fork semantics, tamper-evidence or any combination thereof. They present new opportunities for storage systems to efficiently support such applications by embedding the above requirements into the storage.In this paper, we present ForkBase, a storage engine designed for blockchain and forkable applications. By integrating core application properties into the storage, ForkBase not only delivers high performance but also reduces development effort. The storage manages multiversion data and supports two variants of fork semantics which enable different fork worklflows. ForkBase is fast and space efficient, due to a novel index class that supports efficient queries as well as effective detection of duplicate content across data objects, branches and versions. We demonstrate ForkBase's performance using three applications: a blockchain platform, a wiki engine and a collaborative analytics application. We conduct extensive experimental evaluation against respective state-of-the-art solutions. The results show that ForkBase achieves superior performance while significantly lowering the development effort.","author":["Sheng Wang","Tien Tuan Anh Dinh","Qian Lin","Zhongle Xie","Meihui Zhang","Qingchao Cai","Gang Chen","Beng Chin Ooi","Pingcheng Ruan"],"issue":["Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","Volume 11","Issue 10","June 2018","pp   1137\u20131150","https://doi.org/10.14778/3231751.3231762"],"date":"01 June 2018","ref":[{"text":"Chainalysis - blockchain analysis. https://www.chainalysis.com.","order":1},{"text":"Ethereum. https://www.ethereum.org.","order":2},{"text":"Github. https://github.com.","order":3},{"text":"Googledocs. https://www.docs.google.com.","order":4},{"text":"Hyperledger. https://www.hyperledger.org.","order":5},{"text":"LevelDB. https://github.com/google/leveldb.","order":6},{"text":"MongoDB. http://mongodb.com.","order":7},{"text":"Redis. http://redis.io.","order":8},{"text":"RocksDB. http://rocksdb.org.","order":9},{"text":"The Morning Paper review on ForkBase. https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/06/01/forkbase-an-efficient-storage-engine-for-blockchain-and-forkable-applications.","order":10},{"text":"I.

We describe details of the integration methods, and show how information extraction and language checking applications for realworld German text benefit from a deep grammatical analysis.","author":["Berthold Crysmann","Anette Frank","Bernd Kiefer","Stefan M\u00fcller","G\u00fcnter Neumann","Jakub Piskorski","Ulrich Sch\u00e4fer","Melanie Siegel","Hans Uszkoreit","Feiyu Xu","Markus Becker","Hans-Ulrich Krieger"],"issue":["ACL '02: Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics","July 2002","Pages   441\u2013448","https://doi.org/10.3115/1073083.1073157"],"date":"06 July 2002","ref":[{"text":"D.

In this paper, we evaluate an approach to automatically acquire sense-tagged training data from English-Chinese parallel corpora, which are then used for disambiguating the nouns in the SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sample task. Our investigation reveals that this method of acquiring sense-tagged data is promising. On a subset of the most difficult SENSEVAL-2 nouns, the accuracy difference between the two approaches is only 14.0%, and the difference could narrow further to 6.5% if we disregard the advantage that manually sense-tagged data have in their sense coverage. Our analysis also highlights the importance of the issue of domain dependence in evaluating WSD programs.","author":["Hwee Tou Ng","Bin Wang","Yee Seng Chan"],"issue":["ACL '03: Proceedings of the 41st Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics - Volume 1","July 2003","Pages   455\u2013462","https://doi.org/10.3115/1075096.1075154"],"date":"07 July 2003","ref":[{"text":"Peter F.

The scheme iteratively uses more and more complex recognition schemes, where each iteration constrains the search space of the next.

It can generate a word lattice in a progressive search that would be used as a language model embedded in a succeeding recognition pass to reduce computation requirements.

This integration increases robustness, directs the search space and hence reduces processing time of the deep parser.

Given the task of predicting the correct rule to associate with a parse-tree node, or the correct tag to associate with a word of text, and assuming a particular class of parsing or tagging model, we quantify the information gain realized by taking account of rule or tag trigger-pair predictors, i.e. pairs consisting of a \"triggering\" rule or tag which has already occurred in the document being processed, together with a specific \"triggered\" rule or tag whose probability of occurrence within the current sentence we wish to estimate. This information gain is shown to be substantial. Further, by utilizing trigger pairs taken from the same general sort of document as is being processed (e.g. same subject matter or same discourse type)---as opposed to predictors derived from a comprehensive general set of English texts---we can significantly increase this information gain.","author":["Ezra Black","Andrew Finch","Hideki Kashioka"],"issue":["ACL '98/COLING '98: Proceedings of the 36th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and 17th International Conference on Computational Linguistics - Volume 1","August 1998","Pages   131\u2013137","https://doi.org/10.3115/980845.980867"],"date":"10 August 1998","ref":[{"text":"D.

This paper describes automatic and semi-automatic procedures for extracting and organizing semantic feature information implicit in dictionary definitions. Two head-finding heuristics are described for locating the genus terms in noun and verb definitions. The assumption is that the genus term represents inherent features of the word it defines. The two heuristics have been used to process definitions of 40,000 nouns and 8,000 verbs, producing indexes in which each genus term is associated with the words it defined. The Sprout program interactively grows a taxonomic \"tree\" from any specified root feature by consulting the genus index. Its output is a tree in which all of the nodes have the root feature for at least one of their senses. The Filter program uses an inverted form of the genus index. Filtering begins with an initial filter file consisting of words that have a given feature (e.g. [+human]) in all of their senses. The program then locates, in the index, words whose genus terms all appear in the filter file. The output is a list of new words that have the given feature in all of their senses.","author":["Martin S. Chodorow","Roy J. Byrd","George E.

Analysis shows that story boundaries cannot be clearly discriminated from utterance boundaries by speaker-normalized pitch reset due to its large variations across different syllable tone pairs. Instead, speaker- and tone-normalized pitch reset can provide a clear separation between utterance and story boundaries. Experiments using decision trees for story boundary detection reinforce that raw and speaker-normalized pitch resets are not effective for Mandarin Chinese story segmentation. Speaker- and tone-normalized pitch reset is a good story boundary indicator. When it is combined with pause duration, a high F-measure of 86.7% is achieved. Analysis of the decision tree uncovered four major heuristics that show how speakers jointly utilize pause duration and pitch reset to separate speech into stories.","author":["Lei Xie","Chuan Liu","Helen Meng"],"issue":["NAACL-Short '07: Human Language Technologies 2007: The Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics; Companion Volume, Short Papers","April 2007","Pages   193\u2013196"],"date":"22 April 2007","ref":[{"text":"Shriberg E., Stolcke A., Hakkani-T\u00fcr D. and T\u00fcr G. 2000.
