Greenwood, which appeared in NATURE of the 1st December last (No. 57, p. 87), I wrote to Dr. G. O. Sars, of Christiania, who is the Inspector of Sea-fisheries in Norway, for information on the subject.

I allude specially to the want of an extensive series of carefully prepared specimens and dissections illustrative of the principal modifications of form and structure to be met with in plants. To the ordinary student of botany, especially to the beginner, a series of herbarium specimens conveys about as much information as a similar collection of postage stamps would do. It is not until the pupil has made some considerable progress that he is in a position to make use of herbarium specimens with advantage to himself for anything more than superficial examination. The supply of fresh specimens in a large town like London is necessarily limited, if not in point of numbers, at least in variety. Would it not therefore be advisable in any future re-organisation of our botanical museums, to meet this want so far as it is possible to do so? A collection, such as I am alluding to, should comprise specimens selected and displayed in such a manner as to show the principal variations in the structure and form of the several organs of plants from the lowest to the highest. It should illustrate, so far as circumstances will allow, the comparative anatomy and physiology of plants much in the same way as the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons illustrates the peculiarities of animal life. In such a museum the system should be subordinated to the plants, not the plants to the system. I am quite aware that in all three establishments to which you call attention some specimens of the kind I refer to are to be found. In the Edinburgh Botanical Museum also are to be seen models and preparations made under the superintendence of Professor Balfour by several of his pupils. It is such specimens as these that for educational purposes it is so desirable to multiply and collect together in a separate department. Where, from the nature of things, such as the delicacy or minute size of the organ or what not, it is not possible to prepare a satisfactory specimen for reference, large models in wax or papier mach\u00e9 might be substituted with advantage. What teacher who has had to initiate the tyro into the complexities of the sphenoid bone or the disposition of the ovules, the structure of the anther, the development of the flower, the arrangements of the flowers in grasses, &c., but has longed for Brobdignagian models whereon to demonstrate the peculiarities of their formation. The organs themselves are often so small, and require so much practice with the use of the dissecting needle before they can be seen by the student, that it is very desirable to aid his preliminary labours as much as possible; to give him, at least, a general idea of what he is to look for in the living specimen. For want of this preliminary help specimens are often wasted by the inexpert pupil, who becomes disgusted because he is unable to see for himself what his books or his teachers tell him he ought to see. A good collection of microscopical preparations should also be provided to illustrate such points as require the use of the compound microscope. Probably the British Museum would be the most fitting place wherein to exhibit such specimens side by side or in conjunction with those illustrative of fossil plants. If some such plan as that hinted at in your article were adopted, we should have the general collections at Kew in conjunction with the gardens and Economic museum, the historical and structural collections at the British Museum, and the Trade Museum at South Kensington. I cannot conclude this letter without adverting to the facilities which exist at Kew for the determination of unknown plants, and particularly of plants cultivated in gardens. Thanks to the admirable arrangements made by former and by the present curator of the herbarium and their assistants, the determination of an unknown plant becomes, comparatively, an easy matter.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"3","prism.number":"74","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"425","prism.endingPage":"425","prism.copyright":"1871 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003425a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/003425a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003425a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003425a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Botanical Museums","citation_volume":"3","citation_issue":"74","citation_publication_date":"1871/03","citation_firstpage":"425","citation_lastpage":"425","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/003425a0","DOI":"10.1038/003425a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/003425a0","description":"IN your excellent article on Botanical Museums, one point appears to have been overlooked, and to which, with your permission, I should like to call attention.

THISELTON DYER has well pointed out a distinction which exists between the mathematical courses at Oxford and Cambridge. But his conclusion, that at Oxford \u201cspecial attention to geometrical methods would pay very well,\u201d though acceptable in its way, falls far short of what I advocate. The great want at both Universities is a course of geometrical studies; and the prooi that such a want exists is to be found in the fact that the geometrical treatises in use at either University, cover so very limited a range. There are not even any text-books on the geometry of the sphere, cone, cylinder, and like simple solids, or on such curves as the lemniscate, cycloid, and the simpler spirals. A few stray notes on these subjects may be found in some of the text-books, but not a thorough and systematic geometrical investigation of any of them. Geometrical treatises might with advantage range much further. A geometrical treatise on ellipsoids would be of immense use apart from its employment as a means of mental training.

THISELTON DYER has well pointed out a distinction which exists between the mathematical courses at Oxford and Cambridge. But his conclusion, that at Oxford \u201cspecial attention to geometrical methods would pay very well,\u201d though acceptable in its way, falls far short of what I advocate. The great want at both Universities is a course of geometrical studies; and the prooi that such a want exists is to be found in the fact that the geometrical treatises in use at either University, cover so very limited a range. There are not even any text-books on the geometry of the sphere, cone, cylinder, and like simple solids, or on such curves as the lemniscate, cycloid, and the simpler spirals. A few stray notes on these subjects may be found in some of the text-books, but not a thorough and systematic geometrical investigation of any of them. Geometrical treatises might with advantage range much further. A geometrical treatise on ellipsoids would be of immense use apart from its employment as a means of mental training. Geometrical treatises on paraboloids of both kinds, on hyperboloids of one sheet and of two sheets, on the various orders of ring-surfaces and screw-surfaces, and on many other tridimensional matters, would afford invaluable exercise to the student, besides having a real value to the scientific worker.

In the southern hemisphere, where continents are \u201cfew and far between,\u201d and where a comparatively open channel exists through which the waters may circulate round the globe at any velocity without much impediment, this rapid general eastward motion of the ocean ought to be developed to a large extent.

If the presence of the Antarctic continent does not hinder the motion of the water polewards, why should the presence of the continents of Australia or the southern portion of South America hinder the motion of the water eastward, seeing that rotation performs about 1,500 times more work in deflecting the water eastward than the difference of specific gravity performs in impelling the water southward? The very fact that the water does not turn to the east but moves straight towards the Antarctic continent, shows that the waters must be impelled by a force immensely greater than that derived from difference of specific gravity, because it must be greater than that derived from rotation, or else the \u201cset\u201d would be as much to the east as to the south.

It is said that even the most experienced hunters of the forest-covered mountains in that unsettled region are liable to a kind of seizure; that they may \u201close their head\u201d all at once, and become convinced that they are going in quite the contrary direction to what they had intended, and that no reasoning nor pointing out of landmarks by their companions, nor observations of the position of the sun, can overcome this feeling; it is accompanied by great nervousness and a general sense of dismay and \u201cupset;\u201d the nervousness comes after the seizure, and is not the cause of it. I was present in a company of hunters when a tale of this \u201cgetting turned round\u201d was told as a good joke against one of the party\u2014a Nimrod of renown\u2014the leading features of which he was reluctantly obliged to confess to the truth of, while denying some minor points that had been added to embellish it, as making him more ridiculous than he was: it would take up too much of your space to tell the particulars of the story. The feeling is described as sometimes ceasing suddenly, and sometimes wearing away gradually.

It is said that even the most experienced hunters of the forest-covered mountains in that unsettled region are liable to a kind of seizure; that they may \u201close their head\u201d all at once, and become convinced that they are going in quite the contrary direction to what they had intended, and that no reasoning nor pointing out of landmarks by their companions, nor observations of the position of the sun, can overcome this feeling; it is accompanied by great nervousness and a general sense of dismay and \u201cupset;\u201d the nervousness comes after the seizure, and is not the cause of it. I was present in a company of hunters when a tale of this \u201cgetting turned round\u201d was told as a good joke against one of the party\u2014a Nimrod of renown\u2014the leading features of which he was reluctantly obliged to confess to the truth of, while denying some minor points that had been added to embellish it, as making him more ridiculous than he was: it would take up too much of your space to tell the particulars of the story. The feeling is described as sometimes ceasing suddenly, and sometimes wearing away gradually. Would it not be strange if it should appear that there is a \u201csense of direction\u201d other than an acquired sense of direction the result of unconscious observation, and that some animals possessed the first in a pre-eminent degree?

We are acquainted with the objects of most of the spontaneous and periodical movements of plants, but of the physiological means by which these same movements are effected we know little or nothing. But it is important to remember that phenomena like in effect may be diverse in cause. The folding up of petals may have nothing physiologically in common with that of foliage-leaves. In fact, these phenomena may be divided into several classes. Thus movements due to irritation or concussion must be considered apart from those due to spontaneity, and the movements which form part of the series of processes of growth, such as the first unfolding of leaves and flowers, from those which occur in mature organs, though movements belonging to any two of these classes may be exhibited by the same plant, as in Oxalis and Mimosa. Cereus grandiflorus opens between 7 and 8 P.M., Mirabilis jalapa between 5 and 7 P.M. There is every probability that these times are those at which the insects which fertilise these two species also come forth, and that the same object exists in the case of other species which open and close their flowers more than once, \u201cwaking\u201d and \u201csleeping;\u201d but in the case of Cereus and Mirabilis the movement is one of growth only, though, no doubt, affected by external influences, such as the variation of heat and light.

Besides the causes mentioned in your note, the movements have been attributed to actinism. That they are not hygrometric is clear from the fact stated by Sachs, on the authority of unpublished experiments by Pfeffer (\u201cText-book of Botany,\u201d p. 798), that they take place under water. These same experiments show them to be due to variations in the temperature, and when the temperature is constant, to variations in the intensity of light, and also to be accompanied, at least in some cases, with an increase of the length of the inner side of the phyll\u00e6 of the perianth when opening. Light certainly seems to have more to do with the movements of the \u201cpoor man's weather-glass\u201d than heat, though perhaps atmospheric pressure might equally well be argued to be their cause. We must remember that as osmotic action is constantly going on at the root-hairs and in the growing parts of living plants, so a constant molecular diffusion of gases is going on through cell-walls, besides the passage of gases through stomata. \u201cThe movements of diffusion,\u201d as Sachs says (p. 614), \u201ctend to bring about conditions of equilibrium which depend on the co-efficients of absorption of the gas by a particular cell-fluid, on the molecular condition of the cell-wall, &c., on temperature, and on the pressure of the air.

Richardsonii, and about the eye most splendid; black centre, brilliant orange ring, outside of which is a most brilliant turquoise blue ring set in deep brown.","dc.creator":["FRANCIS, GEORGE"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["FRANCIS, GEORGE"],"citation_author_institution":["Laboratory Institute, Adelaide"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Spectrum of Fish-pigment","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Spectrum of Fish-pigment&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"013226a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In the crater of Kilauea, in the Island of Hawai, wherever the well-known Pele's hair is in process of formation, long-tailed pear-shaped globules are formed in abundance, and a large proportion of the \u201chairs\u201d are to be found with larger or smaller globules in connection with their ends.","dc.creator":["MOSELEY, H.

Nevertheless, it is most probable that this fly, if not disturbed by my approach, would have stepped forward on the labellum, and, trying one of the sham-nectaries, would have removed one of the pollinia and perhaps transferred to the stigma of another stem, in the manner described by Charles Darwin (\u201cFertilisation of Orchids,\u201d p. 47).","dc.creator":["M\u00dcLLER, HERMANN"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["M\u00dcLLER, HERMANN"],"citation_author_institution":["Lippstadt"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Ophrys muscifera","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Ophrys muscifera&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"018249a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

So the sight of the vulture would seem to be paralleled by the faculty of smell in moths, as evidenced by the detection of distant females by males. It would seem probable that the sense of smell may guide insects at a far greater distance than that of vision; for a consideration of the structure of the eyes of insects leads to the belief that they are not capable of forming clear images of distant objects. While, then, the scent of its blossoms may attract insects to a plant, their colour will act as a subsequent guide to the individual flowers, just as variegations undoubtedly act as honey-guides when the insect reaches the flower. This view is borne out, firstly, by the undoubted connection between perfume and pollination, shown by Morren in the case of the orchid Maxillaria, whose aromatic perfume lasts till pollination; and, secondly, by the well known connection of odour both with colour and with natural groups, white flowers being mostly sweet-scented, brown and orange ones most fetid. The insect could thus identify species before seeing them. Mr. Wallace has been, perhaps justly, blamed by a writer in the Gardener's Chronicle for saying that brightly-coloured flowers are seldom scented, and Dr. Taylor by \u201cJ. S. G\u201d. (NATURE, vol. xviii. p. 277), for saying that white flowers open mostly at night. It would, I think, be truer to say that few flowers are both variegated and scented, i.e., that scented flowers are mostly monochromous, and that the majority of night-blowing flowers are white. The latter is a very different matter from saying that the majority of white flowers are night-blowing. We can perceive with difficulty that one part of a flower is more scented than another, yet scent may replace the dots and point-indicating lines of variegation to the senses of an insect. Nature not only often effects one purpose by divers means, but also uses one means for divers ends; so just as colour exists in plants, not only to attract insects, we can understand it being absent in some white flowers simply as a phenomenon of degradation and not as one of specialisation. The dog-rose, white convolvulus, and daisy, mentioned by Mr. Gardner as closing at eventide, are all scentless. The first, according to Dr. Hermann M\u00fcller, is visited by six hymenoptera, two diptera, and twelve coleoptera. The convolvulus does not close till between eight and ten P.M., and re-opens by moonlight. It is visited by two diptera, Podura, Thrips, one coleopteron, two hymenoptera, and the Sphinx conovolvuli, L. This is a dusk-loving hawk-moth, which also visits the honeysuckle. The daisy is visited by nine hymenoptera, thirteen diptera, three coleoptera, and two lepicloptera, viz., the least meadow brown and the common blue butterflies. Many flowers, like Lychnis vespertina, remain open without exhaling their perfume, and I think Mr. Gardner will find that most of the subduedly-coloured flowers which are open at night give off most perfume, and are visited and fertilised by moths rather at dusk than in the dark, whilst the white ones remain fragrant still later. The clearly-cut discs of white of Lychnis vespertina are the last objects our eyes can often discern on a midsummer night's ramble. Of course variegation on the moths themselves would be as useless, from the point of view of sexual selection, as on the flowers from that of insect-fertilisation. Though it is to a certain extent true that like causes produce like effects, in investigations into phenomena so complex in their etiology as those of biology we must, I think, be more mindful that the converse that like effects are the result of like causes by no means necessarily follows.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"18","prism.number":"459","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"427","prism.endingPage":"428","prism.copyright":"1878 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/018427c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/018427c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/018427c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/018427c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Scent and Colour in Flowers","citation_volume":"18","citation_issue":"459","citation_publication_date":"1878/08","citation_firstpage":"427","citation_lastpage":"428","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/018427c0","DOI":"10.1038/018427c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/018427c0","description":"THE extension of our perceptive faculties of sight and hearing by various optical and acoustical instruments may enable us to comprehend the possibility of these faculties existing in other creatures to a degree so far surpassing ours as to seem a difference almost of kind.

Of Chionobas one species (C. a\u00ebllo, confined to the Alps) occurs in Central Europe, whilst six or seven others range from Lapland over Russia and Siberia, Mongolia, &c., to the Amur, and there are numerous species in Arctic and Alpine North America. Of Erebia there are fortyfive Pal\u00e6arctic species enumerated by Staudinger, and of these no less than twenty-five occur in the central Alpine chains of Europe.

This appears specially applicable to solar phenomena, and particularly to sun-spots, of which there must be many thousands of exact delineations without precise record of the times when the spots first appeared on the visible surface of the sun. No doubt there are several reasons to account for this unavoidable absence of valuable information; amongst others the intense brightness and heat of the sun make it an exceedingly disagreeable object for protracted telescopic inspection; nor yet are we in a position at present to photograph it continuously, so that we are necessarily content to compare photographs taken at intervals of perhaps many hours, and to assume, or at any rate, not to dispute, that events of great importance have not occurred in the intervals. This is the more to be regretted because a knowledge of solar events is comparatively of little importance, unless it helps us to ascertain what influence those events exercise on the earth and its inhabitants; and it is obvious that in comparing solar and terrestrial phenomena the times of occurrences are of essential importance, if only to avoid ascribing an undue effect to a given cause. It thus follows that even an approximate time of the appearance of sun-spots is not without value. On these grounds, as well as on the score of magnitude, I communicate the following particulars of a recent appearance, or outburst, of sun-spots, which occurred within certain moderate limits of time. I premise briefly that a photoheliograph is in daily use at the Trigonometrical Survey Office, Dehra Doon, India, of which I have executive charge. At present the instrument yields but a 4-inch negative, which is merely a microscopic delineation of 11/4 million millions square miles of solar surface; however, as surely as the sun shines, so surely are at least two negatives taken of it daily. Interruptions, even in a land of sunshine like this, sometimes occur; notably at the bursting of the monsoons, which occurred here last month (July), when the photographer was compelled to take the sun whenever visible, rather than not take him at all. Under this choice of alternations the first negative (or say N1) on July 25, 1881, was taken at 3.58 p.m. of local apparent time; it exhibited several sun-spots, as is now usual, and of which therefore little need be said, since solar observers are well aware that the sun has for some months past resumed a state of considerable energy in respect to development of features; the second negative, or N2, was taken at 4.47 p.m. On comparing N1 and N2 it was at once seen that in the interval of 49m. a considerable group of spots had appeared in the neighbourhood of the sun's centre. It is exceedingly difficult to exhibit an exact delineation of spots when the negative is on so minute a scale; I however inclose a silver print, as well as a hand-tracing of N2, from which the position and magnitude of the group, i. e. the new group, may be nearly inferred. This new group consists of sixteen spots, of which no individual spot is notably large, but there is this peculiarity about them all, that they exhibit hardly any penumbra, but consist almost entirely of well-defined umbra; what penumbra appears, is confined chiefly to two spots, where it is seen only to the southeast; imagine a round, straight hole bored through a stratum of sand sufficiently adhesive for the sides to remain erect for a time, and after this suppose that the sand begins to fall inwards, creating a partial cone around to the south-east side; this is the sort of progress that these two spots convey. As to magnitude, the spots are scattered over an area of some 6000 millions of square miles; while the collective area of the spots themselves is about 630 millions of square mile, or, say, six times the area presented by the earth to the sun. Remembering that of solar change \u201ca little goes a long way\u201d, so far as we are concerned, who shall say that changes of this magnitude are inappreciable on the earth, however ineffectual the instruments we can now command may be able to measure them? But was this sudden change inappreciable? that is now the question. Unhappily the sun remained invisible till July 30, when two negatives were taken, i.e. after an interval of just five days; so far as solar rotation could effect, the so-called new group of N2 should have been visible not far from the sun's western edge; but the entire group had vanished, leaving no trace behind. In the interim of five days two new spots had come out; of one of these I may add that the umbra is about 200 millions of square miles, and the penumbra some 700 millions, presenting in all a single feature of more than 900 millions of square miles, or say nine times the area exhibited by the earth to a distant spectator. This ends the purport of my letter. But I cannot help adding that I believe the bright solar features or facul\u00e6 will eventually prove to be more effective exponents than the dark features or spots; as a matter of fact, faculse commonly appear in abundance, covering considerable areas and branching out from one another like coral reefs; and it is a mistake to suppose that facul\u00e6 exist only in the vicinity of spots; the former may abound where the latter are quite absent, not only in a 4-inch negative, but in a very fair 5-inch equatorial. But I suppose the world will be better informed some day. Meanwhile, surely the sun is worthy of more earnest attention, not only from points of attack already so ably occupied, but from others none the less important, though at present greatly neglected: need I name solar radiation and photography? Physicians are alarmed for the safety of our bodies on detection of even a trifling change in temperature; but what do we know of fluctuations in the source of all terrestrial heat, though it be measurable with an actinometer? Again, land surveys are often made on huge scales; but for the solar survey of 11/4 million millions of square miles, what is our largest delineation, and at how many spots round the world is the required daily record made? If a survey of London pays, depend on it surveys of the sun will pay all nations infinitely better.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"24","prism.number":"622","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"508","prism.endingPage":"509","prism.copyright":"1881 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/024508a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/024508a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/024508a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/024508a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Sun-Spots","citation_volume":"24","citation_issue":"622","citation_publication_date":"1881/09","citation_firstpage":"508","citation_lastpage":"509","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/024508a0","DOI":"10.1038/024508a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/024508a0","description":"RECORDS concerning phenomena are considerably enhanced in value if they include accurate determinations of the times of occurrence.

Near the middle of the implement there are the remains of some herbaceous stem firmly fixed to the flint; the colour of the vegetable material is bright ochreous, and under the microscope the vegetable structure (especially the vessels) is most clearly seen; the patch is an inch long and about a quarter of an inch in average width; it has not the stellate cells of the rush. The material has been protected in a depression in one of the artificial facets of the implement, and in a second position somewhat nearer the butt, there is further trace of the same material.

Near the middle of the implement there are the remains of some herbaceous stem firmly fixed to the flint; the colour of the vegetable material is bright ochreous, and under the microscope the vegetable structure (especially the vessels) is most clearly seen; the patch is an inch long and about a quarter of an inch in average width; it has not the stellate cells of the rush. The material has been protected in a depression in one of the artificial facets of the implement, and in a second position somewhat nearer the butt, there is further trace of the same material.

But one field on a ridge near the foot of the slope is remarkable for the number of red flints it contains; on the dusty soil they look just like bits of broken earthenware, and might at first fail to attract attention. Their size is much less than the average size of the black flints; some are rounded and some angular, others almost flake like. As to the frequency of their occurrence, I found I was able to pick up at least one at every step I took.","dc.creator":["FREAM, W."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["FREAM, W."],"citation_author_institution":["College of Agriculture, Salisbury"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Red Flints in the Chalk","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Red Flints in the Chalk&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"025584a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

As this unique natural fortress rises sheer from the plain, on the side toward Attica, to the height of eighteen or nineteen hundred feet, a group of these birds, hanging at that height above the surface, were thus brought in a line with the eye. I could detect the minutest movement of wings or tail. Again and again there were considerable intervals, of many seconds' duration, during which one bird and another would hang, with pinions horizontally outstretched, absolutely motionless, neither descending nor drifting, but as if his balance in the air were one of delicately adjusted equipoise. And when, by a just perceptible movement of wing, he stirred again, it seemed rather to be to change his position than that he needed any kind or degree of effort to maintain it. The kestrel is an unfortunately chosen bird for Mr. Hubert Airy's observation, because though it hangs for a minute or two over the same spot watching its prey, it is always \u201cby short and rapid motion of its wings\u201d; from which fanning motion it has acquired, I think, its popular name of windhover, and not because, as Mr. Airy supposes, it is upborne by the wind. But were my Corintbian buzzards uphorue by the wind? There was none. The day was one of dead calm. No doubt of necessity there was some upward current of air from the sun-warmed surface of the ground by which the birds profited; but if at all sufficient to sustain them, their actual gravity, when in that position and so willing it (by which I mean nothing so absurd as that gravitation can be counteracted by the vis vit\u0153, but that by inflating its lungs, and perhaps suspending its respiration, the bird may have the power at will of lessening its comparative weight in the air), must be very near to that of the atmosphere around and underneath them. It is evident that Mr. Airy could only claim my observation as being in favour of his theory if there had been a breeze from Attica striking against the face of the citadel.

The observation there made is correct as to the absence of earthworms in the region mentioned, but the reason assigned is, I think, incorrect. It is well known to settlers on virgin soils in this country that in the first tillage of tie ground they will see no earthworms.

The observation there made is correct as to the absence of earthworms in the region mentioned, but the reason assigned is, I think, incorrect. It is well known to settlers on virgin soils in this country that in the first tillage of tie ground they will see no earthworms. This is equally the case whether they settle upon prairie land which has been swept annually by fires, or upon wood land which has been cleared for cultivation and which has never been burned over. Even in the natural meadows called \u201cbeaver meadows,\u201d which one will chance upon in an otherwise completely forest-covered region, one will at first find no sign of the earthworm.

Amongst bovine animals many species produce hybrids which are apparently perfectly fertile; those between the Indian ox and the gayal, species of different genera, Bos and Bibos, are common, and their fertility is shown by the existence of numerous intermediate hybrids. There is living at the Zoological Gardens at the present time, a hybrid between the Indian ox, the gayal, and the bison, and, by her side, a hybrid between herself and a bison. The offspring of the cross between many species of ducks are perfectly fertile. This I have repeatedly seen in the case of the hybrids between the tufted duck and the pochard. I think there is another unnoticed factor in evolution. The scent of animals plays an important part in their sexual relationships, and \u201csports\u201d in this respect are as likely to occur as in the organs of the body; thus the peculiar odours of the sheep and the goat may be mutually repulsive.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"31","prism.number":"792","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"194","prism.endingPage":"194","prism.copyright":"1885 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/031194b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/031194b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/031194b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/031194b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"An Unnoticed Factor in Evolution","citation_volume":"31","citation_issue":"792","citation_publication_date":"1885/01","citation_firstpage":"194","citation_lastpage":"194","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/031194b0","DOI":"10.1038/031194b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/031194b0","description":"I AM surprised that the letter of Mr. Catchpool in NATURE (vol. xxxi. p. 4) has remained unnoticed by your correspondents.

There is living at the Zoological Gardens at the present time, a hybrid between the Indian ox, the gayal, and the bison, and, by her side, a hybrid between herself and a bison. The offspring of the cross between many species of ducks are perfectly fertile. This I have repeatedly seen in the case of the hybrids between the tufted duck and the pochard. I think there is another unnoticed factor in evolution. The scent of animals plays an important part in their sexual relationships, and \u201csports\u201d in this respect are as likely to occur as in the organs of the body; thus the peculiar odours of the sheep and the goat may be mutually repulsive.","dc.creator":["WEIR, J.

Whilst turning over a collection of miscellaneous papers, in a box, Mrs. Clifford and I had the good fortune to light upon a manuscript quite ready for printing, and this (\u201cMathematical Papers,\u201d p. 628) subsequently formed part of the volume on \u201cSeeing and Thinking;\u201d but we could not find any trace of any more manuscript of the above-mentioned series of lectures. Just before the recent Easter holidays Prof. Karl Pearson returned to me a few pages of manuscript bearing on the International Scientific Series volume which I had lent him, and with them he sent me a large note book which had been in the late Prof. Rowe's hands. On opening this book I at once saw that it contained very full notes of other lectures of the course. In fact, Lecture II. (\u201cOn Plane Surfaces and Straight Lines\u201d) is quite ready for press, as is also, I think, Lecture III. (\u201cOn the Rotation of Plane Figures\u201d); Lecture IV. (\u201cOf Similar Figures\u201d) is a fragment, and still more fragmentary is Lecture V. (\u201cThe First Principles of Calculation\u201d). Of Lecture VI.

Whilst turning over a collection of miscellaneous papers, in a box, Mrs. Clifford and I had the good fortune to light upon a manuscript quite ready for printing, and this (\u201cMathematical Papers,\u201d p. 628) subsequently formed part of the volume on \u201cSeeing and Thinking;\u201d but we could not find any trace of any more manuscript of the above-mentioned series of lectures. Just before the recent Easter holidays Prof. Karl Pearson returned to me a few pages of manuscript bearing on the International Scientific Series volume which I had lent him, and with them he sent me a large note book which had been in the late Prof. Rowe's hands. On opening this book I at once saw that it contained very full notes of other lectures of the course. In fact, Lecture II. (\u201cOn Plane Surfaces and Straight Lines\u201d) is quite ready for press, as is also, I think, Lecture III. (\u201cOn the Rotation of Plane Figures\u201d); Lecture IV. (\u201cOf Similar Figures\u201d) is a fragment, and still more fragmentary is Lecture V. (\u201cThe First Principles of Calculation\u201d). Of Lecture VI. (\u201cThe Theorem of Pythagoras\u201d) there are two loose sheets of figures: on one sheet is \u201cthe Bride's Chair,\u201d and the figures on this and the other sheet show that my information was correct, and that the remarks on pp. 633, 637 are ad rem.

But the question whether a dog, or any other animal, can count will depend upon what we mean by counting. In the ordinary and correct signification of the term, counting consists in applying conventional signs to objects, events, &c., as when we say \u201cone,\u201d \u201ctwo,\u201d \u201cthree,\u201d to the striking of a clock. Clearly in this sense there is no reason to suppose that any animal can count. But there is another sense in which the term \u201ccounting\u201d may be used\u2014i.e. as designating the process of distinguishing, with respect to number, between the relative contents of two or more perceptions. While addressing an audience of 100 individuals a lecturer can immediately perceive that it does not contain 1000; and even without, in the true sense, counting them may make a tolerably close guess at their number. The accuracy of such a guess will depend upon two conditions. The first of these is the number of units to be computed, and the second is the previous practice he may have had in that kind of computation. Thus, every man is able to tell the difference between one and two, two and three, &c., up to perhaps seven and eight objects or events, without resorting to the expedient of marking off each with a separate sign. But somewhere about this point most persons require to adopt a system of numerical notation, if they desire to be accurate; and probably no one, without either special practice or some such system, could be perfectly sure whether he held eleven or twelve shillings in his hand, or whether a clock had just struck eleven or twelve. Indeed, it is just because of the rapidly-increasing difficulty of thus computing diminishing differences of ratio by immediate perception, that primitive man first lays the foundations of arithmetic by marking off the objects or events upon his fingers and toes. As already indicated, however, special practice makes a great difference in the accuracy with which such instantaneous computation can be made.

Her only way was over a wall four or five feet high, on which she left traces, but the young could not have been able to climb this, and she must have carried them.","dc.creator":["CLARKE, HYDR"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["CLARKE, HYDR"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Climbing Powers of the Hedgehog","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Climbing Powers of the Hedgehog&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"034029b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Allow me to add some remarks on another side of that question. For many years pact I have had in succession several amanuenses, and my first care has always been to require a straight hand without any distinction between up and down strokes.

From their very positive statements I concluded that the evidence as described by them did actually exist, and that until it was disproved it should not be ignored.

As a partial justification of what has now proved my too hasty acceptance of the statements of these gentlemen, I will give one passage in which Prof. Agassiz refers to the supposed glacial phenomena near Ceara:\u2014\"I may say that in the whole valley of Hasli there are no accumulations of morainic materials more characteristic than those I have found here, not even about the Kirchel; neither are there any remains of the kind more striking about the valleys of Mount Desert in Maine, where the glacial phenomena are so remarkable; nor in the valleys of Loch Fine, Loch Awe, and Loch Long, in Scotland, where the traces of ancient glaciers are so distinct.\" Both Agassiz and Hartt were equally strong as to similar phenomena near Rio.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"48","prism.number":"1251","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"589","prism.endingPage":"590","prism.copyright":"1893 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/048589a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/048589a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/048589a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/048589a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Supposed Glaciation of Brazil","citation_volume":"48","citation_issue":"1251","citation_publication_date":"1893/10","citation_firstpage":"589","citation_lastpage":"590","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/048589a0","DOI":"10.1038/048589a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/048589a0","description":"IN the second volume of NATURE, p. 510, I reviewed the late Prof. Hartt's \u201cGeology and Physical Geography of Brazil,\u201d and called attention to the author's views, as well as those of the late Prof. Agassiz, relating to the supposed glaciation of that country.

In meteorological studies \u02d901\u2033 of air pressure is an extremely convenient limit, and in most inquiries only two figures are needed. On the other hand a millimetre (\u02d904 inch) is altogether too large a limit, and one-tenth m.m. is too small. The labour of writing, averaging, and studying with the metric scale will be at least one-third greater than with the common inch scale to the same degree of accuracy. It is a very great pity that the French, in looking for a convenient length to divide into a thousand parts, did not take up the already existing yard, which is nearly the same as the metre. Yard \u00f7 1000 = (metre \u00f7 1000) \u2212 \u02d9004 inch.

In meteorological studies \u02d901\u2033 of air pressure is an extremely convenient limit, and in most inquiries only two figures are needed. On the other hand a millimetre (\u02d904 inch) is altogether too large a limit, and one-tenth m.m. is too small. The labour of writing, averaging, and studying with the metric scale will be at least one-third greater than with the common inch scale to the same degree of accuracy. It is a very great pity that the French, in looking for a convenient length to divide into a thousand parts, did not take up the already existing yard, which is nearly the same as the metre. Yard \u00f7 1000 = (metre \u00f7 1000) \u2212 \u02d9004 inch. The amount of confusion that would have been saved is almost incalculable.","dc.creator":["HAZEN, H.

It is amazing that it should be pursued and for one moment permitted. Your highly appreciated publication will, I am certain, feel the necessity of defending nature's produce. All milk drawn from healthy cows is yielded sterile. The remedy against the use of drugs and late-refrigeration, &c., is to purify and preserve the milk in its natural sterile condition by quickly\u2014on drawing it\u2014a\u00ebrating, cooling and refrigerating it down to the non-decomposing and non-fermenting temperature of 50\u00b0 Fahrenheit or lower at the farms and rural factories before being sent off from the country, and having it conveyed, so chilled, into ordinary cold stores\u2014the same as doubtless most of your butchers have, and with less reason\u2014at the town dairy premises.

It is amazing that it should be pursued and for one moment permitted. Your highly appreciated publication will, I am certain, feel the necessity of defending nature's produce. All milk drawn from healthy cows is yielded sterile. The remedy against the use of drugs and late-refrigeration, &c., is to purify and preserve the milk in its natural sterile condition by quickly\u2014on drawing it\u2014a\u00ebrating, cooling and refrigerating it down to the non-decomposing and non-fermenting temperature of 50\u00b0 Fahrenheit or lower at the farms and rural factories before being sent off from the country, and having it conveyed, so chilled, into ordinary cold stores\u2014the same as doubtless most of your butchers have, and with less reason\u2014at the town dairy premises.

When the rain had ceased, in the course of about fifteen minutes, I re-mounted, with my hands upon the handles in the usual manner.

The forest lies in the west of Inverness-shire, near Loch Askaig, on the first, or one of the first, of the glens that run westward from the Caledonian Canal, just north of Fort William. It is on the great estate, and near to the mansion house, of Cameron of Lochiel. While not so old as, for instance, the historic trees of the New Forest, or as that strange grove of oaks at Wistman's Wood, the Scots firs at Auchnacarry are of deep interest and value as perhaps the largest and finest fragment that is left to us of \u201cpri\u00e6val forest\u201d, neither planted nor tended by the hand of man. Its area is about 1500 acres, and the trees are of immense size, being mostly from 200 to 300 years old; the largest have a circumference of about 18 feet at 5 feet from the ground, and the dimensions of a very large number are said to be little less. The scenery of the forest is of great beauty, marking the difference that exists between the natural look of self-grown timber and the stiff, unvaried lines of an artificial plantation. In England we think of the Scots fir as an uninteresting, and even, unsightly, tree, unpleasing in colour and often cumbering the ground (as in parts of the New Forest) to the exclusion of more picturesque trees. It is usually planted, as Gilpin said in his \u201cForest Scenery\u201d, \u201cin thick array, which suffocates or cramps them, and if they ever get loose from their bondage they are already ruined\u201d.

The forest lies in the west of Inverness-shire, near Loch Askaig, on the first, or one of the first, of the glens that run westward from the Caledonian Canal, just north of Fort William. It is on the great estate, and near to the mansion house, of Cameron of Lochiel. While not so old as, for instance, the historic trees of the New Forest, or as that strange grove of oaks at Wistman's Wood, the Scots firs at Auchnacarry are of deep interest and value as perhaps the largest and finest fragment that is left to us of \u201cpri\u00e6val forest\u201d, neither planted nor tended by the hand of man. Its area is about 1500 acres, and the trees are of immense size, being mostly from 200 to 300 years old; the largest have a circumference of about 18 feet at 5 feet from the ground, and the dimensions of a very large number are said to be little less. The scenery of the forest is of great beauty, marking the difference that exists between the natural look of self-grown timber and the stiff, unvaried lines of an artificial plantation. In England we think of the Scots fir as an uninteresting, and even, unsightly, tree, unpleasing in colour and often cumbering the ground (as in parts of the New Forest) to the exclusion of more picturesque trees. It is usually planted, as Gilpin said in his \u201cForest Scenery\u201d, \u201cin thick array, which suffocates or cramps them, and if they ever get loose from their bondage they are already ruined\u201d. Very different from this description are the beautiful glades at Auchnacarry, where (to borrow words from Sir T. Dick Lauder), \u201cWe have seen it towering at full majesty in the midst of some appropriate Highland scene, and sending its limbs abroad with all the unconstrained freedom of a hardy mountaineer, as if it claimed dominion over the savage regions around it\u201d.

Then with regard to his remarks about the lava flows from a crater, though I am by no means an authority upon this subject, such as Dr. Johnston-Lavis, I would beg to point out that the lava from the crater of Skaptar Jokul in the year 1783 formed two main streams which flowed for a distance of forty to fifty miles each, and varied in thickness or depth from 600 to 1000 ft. Now I cannot help thinking that such streams, only so much bigger, might have flowed from the craters of the moon, and it is well known that enormous floods have issued from volcanoes in the Sandwich Islands without much eruption of rocky, or pumaceous debris, which might hide the effect of the lava, as Dr. Johnston-Lavis suggests, though Prof. Pickering puts forward the suggestion that it is some material, such as pumice, which we see in the moon's rays. Apart from which geologists tell us that apparently in prehistoric times lava seems to have issued from vertical fissures, and deluged large areas, as is well seen in the great basalt plain of Snake River, Idaho, North America. Assuming that these fissures were caused by the contraction of the earth's outer crust when cooling, and again comparing the moon with the earth, we at least come to Nasmyth's well-known theory as regards these ray systems, though the manner in which these peculiar phenomena radiate from the craters still seems to suggest to me the same actions which took place from Skaptar Jokul, and in the Sandwich Islands.

The proposal that at least as many marks in the Civil Service examinations shall be allotted to science as to classics, may be a step in the right direction, but it is a halting one, for it affects only a limited class of the community and does not insist on the paramount importance of science in general education.

The present paper will cover behavioral, theoretical and neurobiological work, and will conclude with a discussion of clinical implications.","dc.creator":["Myers, K M","Davis, M"],"dc.subject":["Medicine/Public Health, general","Psychiatry","Neurosciences","Behavioral Sciences","Pharmacotherapy","Biological Psychology"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=The role of the amygdala in conditioned and unconditioned fear and anxiety; citation_inbook_title=The Amygdala, Volume 2; citation_publication_date=2000; citation_pages=213-287; citation_id=CR1; citation_author=M Davis; citation_publisher=Oxford University Press","citation_journal_title=Neuron; citation_title=Molecular mechanisms underlying emotional learning and memory in the lateral amygdala; citation_author=SM Rodrigues, GE Schafe, JE LeDoux; citation_volume=44; citation_publication_date=2004; citation_pages=75-91; citation_doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2004.09.014; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Neuron; citation_title=Behavioral and neural analysis of extinction: a review; citation_author=KM Myers, M Davis; citation_volume=36; citation_publication_date=2002; citation_pages=567-584; citation_doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(02)01064-4; citation_id=CR3","Pavlov IP .

We propose that Egl and BicD are core components of a selective dynein motor complex that drives transcript localization in a variety of tissues.","dc.creator":["Bullock, Simon L.","Ish-Horowicz, David"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Cell; citation_title=The intracellular localization of messenger RNAs.; citation_author=D St Johnston; citation_volume=81; citation_publication_date=1995; citation_pages=161-170; citation_doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90324-0; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Ann.

To our knowledge, ultrasonic alarm calls have not previously been detected in any animal group, despite their twin advantages of being highly directional and inaudible to key predators.","dc.creator":["Wilson, David R.","Hare, James F."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Science; citation_author=JA Simmons, MB Fenton, MJ O'Farrell; citation_volume=203; citation_publication_date=1979; citation_pages=16-21; citation_doi=10.1126/science.758674; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Am.

See the panel in the Editorial on page 367 and on the web landing page (\nhttp://www.nature.com/news/specials/china/\n\n) for a full contents listing. Highlights include a look at the prospects for clean coal technology, the perils of climate change in Tibet, and a look back at the achievements of Joseph Needham, who championed the Chinese cause for nearly fifty years and edited the influential Science and Civilisation in China series. And this week's podcast covers China as well. The cover image is of course the iconic 'birds' nest', the main stadium for the Beijing Olympics, which open on 8 August.","dc.creator":["Liu, Junguo","Yang, Hong","Savenije, H. H.

Channelling effectively focuses positive particles into the interstitial regions of the crystal: nuclear collisional processes such as Rutherford backscattering are suppressed, while the number of interactions with valence electrons increases. The interaction of channelled positrons with electrons produces annihilation radiation that can in principle9,10,11,12 serve as a quantitative, spatially selective probe of electronic charge and spin densities within the crystal: in the interstitial regions, two-photon annihilation is enhanced relative to single-photon annihilation, because the latter process requires a nuclear recoil to conserve momentum.

Channelling effectively focuses positive particles into the interstitial regions of the crystal: nuclear collisional processes such as Rutherford backscattering are suppressed, while the number of interactions with valence electrons increases. The interaction of channelled positrons with electrons produces annihilation radiation that can in principle9,10,11,12 serve as a quantitative, spatially selective probe of electronic charge and spin densities within the crystal: in the interstitial regions, two-photon annihilation is enhanced relative to single-photon annihilation, because the latter process requires a nuclear recoil to conserve momentum.

Despite its enormous burden on world health, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Bacterial multiplication and concomitant tissue damage within an infected host, including experimentally infected mice, occurs primarily in the lungs\u2014the favoured niche of M. tuberculosis2. Although it has been proposed that the distinctive cell wall of M. tuberculosis is important for virulence, rigorous genetic proof has been lacking. Here, using signature-tagged mutagenesis, we isolated three attenuated M. tuberculosis mutants that cannot synthesize or transport a complex, cell wall-associated lipid called phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) which is found only in pathogenic mycobacteria3,4.

Despite its enormous burden on world health, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Bacterial multiplication and concomitant tissue damage within an infected host, including experimentally infected mice, occurs primarily in the lungs\u2014the favoured niche of M. tuberculosis2. Although it has been proposed that the distinctive cell wall of M. tuberculosis is important for virulence, rigorous genetic proof has been lacking. Here, using signature-tagged mutagenesis, we isolated three attenuated M. tuberculosis mutants that cannot synthesize or transport a complex, cell wall-associated lipid called phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) which is found only in pathogenic mycobacteria3,4. Two mutants have transposon insertions affecting genes implicated in PDIM synthesis; the third has a disruption in a gene encoding a large transmembrane protein required for proper subcellular localization of PDIM. Synthesis and transport of this complex lipid is only required for growth in the lung; all three mutants are unaffected for growth in the liver and spleen.

The nature of the jamming transition is well understood for ideal, frictionless grains. But real-world granular systems are inherently frictional.

The basic concept of jamming is intuitive, and broadly relevant for everyday experiences that range from pouring breakfast cereal to creating a stable embankment. The nature of the jamming transition is well understood for ideal, frictionless grains. But real-world granular systems are inherently frictional. Dapeng Bi and colleagues show that assemblages of frictional grains exhibit a much broader range of phenomena than an ideal system, most noticeably the occurrence of jamming induced by strain at packing densities below the critical threshold.","dc.creator":["Vitelli, Vincenzo","van Hecke, Martin"],"dc.subject":["Applied physics","Soft materials"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_author=D Bi, J Zhang, B Chakraborty, RP Behringer; citation_volume=480; citation_publication_date=2011; citation_pages=355-358; citation_doi=10.1038/nature10667; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_author=AJ Liu, SR Nagel; citation_volume=396; citation_publication_date=1998; citation_pages=21-22; citation_doi=10.1038/23819; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_author=TS Majmudar, RP Behringer; citation_volume=435; citation_publication_date=2005; citation_pages=1079-1082; citation_doi=10.1038/nature03805; citation_id=CR3","citation_journal_title=Phys.

The strength of correlation between these two indices differed significantly between subjects with and those without CAS.","dc.creator":["Podolec, Piotr","Kope\u0107, Grzegorz","Podolec, Jakub","Wilko\u0142ek, Piotr","Krochin, Marek","Rubi\u015b, Pawe\u0142","Cwynar, Marcin","Grodzicki, Tomasz","\u017bmudka, Krzysztof","Tracz, Wies\u0142awa"],"dc.subject":["Medicine/Public Health, general","Internal Medicine","Public Health","Geriatrics/Gerontology","Obstetrics/Perinatology/Midwifery","Health Promotion and Disease Prevention"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol; citation_title=Aortic pulse wave velocity predicts cardiovascular mortality in subjects >70 years of age; citation_author=S Meaume, A Benetos, OF Henry; citation_volume=21; citation_publication_date=2001; citation_pages=2046-2050; citation_doi=10.1161/hq1201.100226; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Kidney Int; citation_title=Aortic pulse wave velocity index and mortality in end-stage renal disease; citation_author=J Blacher, ME Safar, AP Guerin, B Pannier, SJ Marchais, GM London; citation_volume=63; citation_publication_date=2003; citation_pages=1852-1860; citation_doi=10.1046/j.1523-1755.2003.00932.x; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Circulation; citation_title=Impact of aortic stiffness on survival in end-stage renal disease; citation_author=J Blacher, AP Guerin, B Pannier, SJ Marchais, ME Safar, GM London; citation_volume=99; citation_publication_date=1999; citation_pages=2434-2439; citation_doi=10.1161/01.CIR.99.18.2434; citation_id=CR3","citation_journal_title=Hypertension; citation_title=Central pulse pressure and mortality in end-stage renal disease; citation_author=ME Safar, J Blacher, B Pannier; citation_volume=39; citation_publication_date=2002; citation_pages=735-738; citation_doi=10.1161/hy0202.098325; citation_id=CR4","citation_journal_title=Hypertension; citation_title=Aortic stiffness is an independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in hypertensive patients; citation_author=S Laurent, P Boutouyrie, R Asmar; citation_volume=37; citation_publication_date=2001; citation_pages=1236-1241; citation_doi=10.1161/01.HYP.37.5.1236; citation_id=CR5","citation_journal_title=Hypertension; citation_title=Aortic stiffness is an independent predictor of primary coronary events in hypertensive patients: a longitudinal study; citation_author=P Boutouyrie, AI Tropeano, R Asmar; citation_volume=39; citation_publication_date=2002; citation_pages=10-15; citation_doi=10.1161/hy0102.099031; citation_id=CR6","citation_journal_title=J Am Soc Nephrol; citation_title=Diabetes mellitus, aortic stiffness, and cardiovascular mortality in end-stage renal disease; citation_author=T Shoji, M Emoto, K Shinohara; citation_volume=12; citation_publication_date=2001; citation_pages=2117-2124; citation_id=CR7","citation_journal_title=Circulation; citation_title=Aortic pulse-wave velocity and its relationship to mortality in diabetes and glucose intolerance: an integrated index of vascular function?; citation_author=K Cruickshank, L Riste, SG Anderson, JS Wright, G Dunn, RG Gosling; citation_volume=106; citation_publication_date=2002; citation_pages=2085-2090; citation_doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000033824.02722.F7; citation_id=CR8","citation_journal_title=Circulation; citation_title=Arterial stiffness and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke: the Rotterdam Study; citation_author=FUS Mattace-Raso, TJM van der Cammen, A Hofman; citation_volume=113; citation_publication_date=2006; citation_pages=657-663; citation_doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.555235; citation_id=CR9","citation_journal_title=Hypertension; citation_title=Aortic pulse wave velocity is associated with the presence and quantity of coronary artery calcium: a community-based study; citation_author=IJ Kullo, LF Bielak, ST Turner, PF Sheedy, PA Peyser; citation_volume=47; citation_publication_date=2006; citation_pages=174-179; citation_doi=10.1161/01.HYP.0000199605.35173.14; citation_id=CR10","citation_journal_title=J Nephrol; citation_title=Aortic pulse wave velocity and arterial wave reflections predict the extent and severity of coronary artery disease in chronic kidney disease patients; citation_author=A Covic, AA Haydar, P Bhamra-Ariza, P Gusbeth-Tatomir, DJ Goldsmith; citation_volume=18; citation_publication_date=2005; citation_pages=388-396; citation_id=CR11","citation_journal_title=J Hypertens; citation_title=Estimation of an age-specific reference interval for pulse wave velocity: a meta-analysis; citation_author=AR Khoshdel, A Thakkinstian, SL Carney, J Attia; citation_volume=24; citation_publication_date=2006; citation_pages=1231-1237; citation_doi=10.1097/01.hjh.0000234098.85497.31; citation_id=CR12","American Diabetes Association : Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus.

Using linear optical elements, quantum optical computations can be performed with integrated optical circuits and can therefore overcome the existing limitations in terms of scalability.
