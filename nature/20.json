Smokers have all noticed that the smoke from the end of a pipe or eigar is bluer than that which they puff from the mouth, and many may have wondered, as I did for a long time, what the reason of this could be.

No. 38, read June 6, 1867), has the following curious account of similar flights, which, he says, have also been described by Messrs. Edwards, Wallace, and Bates: \u201cThe first time that I fell in with such a migration was in November 1849, rear the mouth of the Xing\u00fa, when I was travelling up the Amazon from Par\u00e0 to Sautareon. . . We saw a vast multitude of butterflies flying across the Amazon from the northern to the southern side in a direction from about N.N.W. to S.S.E. They were evidently in the last stage of fatigue. They were all of common white and orange yellow species, such as are bred in cultivated and waste grounds, and having found no matrix whereon to deposit their eggs to the northward of the river (the leaves proper for their purpose having probably been already destroyed or at least occupied by caterpillars) were going in quest of it elsewhere. The very little wind there was, blew from between E. and N.E., therefore the butterflies steered their course at right angles to it; and this was the case in subsequent flights I saw across the Amazon. . . But the most notable circumstance is that the movement is always southward. . . Since my return to England I have read Mr. Bates's graphic description of a flight of butterflies across the Amazon, below Obidos, lasting for two days without intermission during daylight. These also all crossed in one direction, from north to south. Nearly all were species of Callidryas, the males of which species are wont to resort to beaches, while the females hover on the borders of the forest and deposit their eggs on low-growing, shade-loving Mimosas. He adds, \u2018the migrating hordes, so far as I could ascertain, are composed only of males.\u2019 It is possible, therefore, that in the flights witnessed by myself the individuals were all males - in which case the flights should probably be looked upon, not as migrations, but dispersions, analogous to those of male ants and bees when their occupation is done, and they are doomed by the workers to banishment, which means death. In the case I am about to describe, however, the swarms certainly comprised both sexes, although I know not in what proportion; and their movements were more evidently dependent on the failure of their food.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.publicationDate":"1871-12-01","prism.volume":"5","prism.number":"110","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"101","prism.endingPage":"101","prism.copyright":"1871 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/005101a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/005101a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/005101a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/005101a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Flight of Butterflies","citation_volume":"5","citation_issue":"110","citation_publication_date":"1871/12","citation_online_date":"1871/12/01","citation_firstpage":"101","citation_lastpage":"101","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/005101a0","DOI":"10.1038/005101a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/005101a0","description":"IN the 103rd number of NATURE there are two notices of remarkable butterfly flights in America, and it is asked \u201cWhere the yellow butterflies are going?\u201d Mr. R.

In favour of such a policy it has been urged not only that it is in accordance with sound political economy to leave every pursuit to seek for itself its own reward, but also that the system of endowment and artificial aid has proved a signal failure. Now, if by this last argument it is meant that the large rewards which have been given for classical knowledge and for mathematical attainments have not been productive of numerous Bentleys, Porsons, and Newtons, the truth and validity of the argument must be admitted. The rewarding of mere acquired knowledge was little likely to show its results in original work. The capacity for acquisition, literary, mathematical, or scientific, is a very different thing from the power of original production, or of extending the boundaries of human knowledge. Probably in some cases the latent spark of genius has even been stifled and smothered by the load of \u201ccram\u201d necessarily superimposed to meet the requirements of exacting examiners. It would be, however, I think, a mistake not to allow some considerable reward to more exact knowledge. But it is with regard to original work and the proved capacity for doing it that external encouragement and reward is absolutely necessary. Such work, in most departments of literature and science, cannot possibly, in a commercial sense, pay. It is this work, however, which confers especial honour and advantage on the State. Therefore it is in accordance alike with justice and sound policy that the doing of such work should be munificently encouraged and rewarded by the State. Such a policy might be reasonably expected to issue in results very different from those which have attended the endowment of \u201ccram.\u201d Previous failure cannot be objected, for the attempt can scarcely be said to have ever been made. It behoves, therefore, literary and scientific men to look to it that, in any redistribution of the University or other endowments, the true interests of both science and literature\u2014and especially the encouragement and reward of original research\u2014are duly regarded by the Government. But a certain superficial political economy may object that such a policy would be of dangerous tendency, inasmuch as it would recognise the existence of the State as a unity, which, being honoured and benefited, should encourage and reward. The man of original thought and the discoverer of Nature's secrets must be left, each for himself, to seek such recompense as he can in the ordinary market.

Since I described in 1851, the males and complemental males of certain cirripedes, I have been most anxious that some competent naturalist should re-examine them; more especially as a German, without apparently having taken the trouble to look at any specimens, has spoken of my description as a fantastic dream. That the males of an animal should be attached to the female, should be very much smaller than, and differ greatly in structure from her, is nothing new or strange. Nevertheless, the difference between the males and the hermaphrodites of Scalpellum vulgare is so great, that when I first roughly dissected the former, even the suspicion that they belonged to the class of cirripedes did not cross my mind. These males are half as large as the head of a small pin; whereas the hermaphrodites are from an inch to an inch and a quarter in length. They consist of little more than a mere sack, containing the male reproductive organs, with rudiments of only four of the valves; there is no mouth or alimentary canal, but there exists a rudimentary thorax with rudimentary cirri, and these apparently serve to protect the orifice of the sack from the intrusion of enemies. The males of Alcippe and Cryptophialus are even more rudimentary; of the seventeen segments which ought to be fully developed, together with their appendages, only three remain, and these are imperfectly developed; the other fourteen segments are represented by a mere slight projection bearing the probosci-formed penis. This latter organ, on the other hand, is so enormously developed in Cryptophialus, that when fully extended it must have been between eight and nine times the length of the animal! There is another curious point about these little males, viz., the great difference between those belonging to the several species of the same genus Scalpellum: some are manifestly pedunculated cirripedes, differing by characters which in an independent creature would be considered as of only generic value; whereas others do not offer a single character by which they can be recognised as cirripedes, with the exception of the cast-off prehensile, larval antenn\u00e6, preserved by being buried in the natural cement at the point of attachment.

Since I described in 1851, the males and complemental males of certain cirripedes, I have been most anxious that some competent naturalist should re-examine them; more especially as a German, without apparently having taken the trouble to look at any specimens, has spoken of my description as a fantastic dream. That the males of an animal should be attached to the female, should be very much smaller than, and differ greatly in structure from her, is nothing new or strange. Nevertheless, the difference between the males and the hermaphrodites of Scalpellum vulgare is so great, that when I first roughly dissected the former, even the suspicion that they belonged to the class of cirripedes did not cross my mind. These males are half as large as the head of a small pin; whereas the hermaphrodites are from an inch to an inch and a quarter in length. They consist of little more than a mere sack, containing the male reproductive organs, with rudiments of only four of the valves; there is no mouth or alimentary canal, but there exists a rudimentary thorax with rudimentary cirri, and these apparently serve to protect the orifice of the sack from the intrusion of enemies. The males of Alcippe and Cryptophialus are even more rudimentary; of the seventeen segments which ought to be fully developed, together with their appendages, only three remain, and these are imperfectly developed; the other fourteen segments are represented by a mere slight projection bearing the probosci-formed penis. This latter organ, on the other hand, is so enormously developed in Cryptophialus, that when fully extended it must have been between eight and nine times the length of the animal! There is another curious point about these little males, viz., the great difference between those belonging to the several species of the same genus Scalpellum: some are manifestly pedunculated cirripedes, differing by characters which in an independent creature would be considered as of only generic value; whereas others do not offer a single character by which they can be recognised as cirripedes, with the exception of the cast-off prehensile, larval antenn\u00e6, preserved by being buried in the natural cement at the point of attachment.

DAVID GRAY, of the steamship Eclipse, has done good service to the cause of humanity in writing, and Mr. Buckland in publishing, the letter on the seal fishery which appears in Land and Water for May 9. The fearful cruelties perpetrated year after year, and the enormous waste of life entailed by the reckless manner in which the seal fishery is prosecuted, are well known, but no steps have hitherto been taken to regulate a trade which, if carried on within proper bounds, would continue to yield great profits, but if still pursued with such utter disregard to consequences must soon end in the extermination of the whole race. As an instance of the wastefulness of the mode of proceeding, Capt. Gray says that five ships attacking a pack of seals, in four days killed about 10,000 old seals; \u201cadd 20 percent for seals mortally wounded and lost, gives an aggregate of 12,000 old ones; add 12,000 young which died of starvation, gives 24,000; but this is not all. The men spread on the ice, so that the old ones that were left alive could not get on to suckle their young. The consequence was that the whole of the young brood was destroyed, and had these seals been left alone for eight or ten days, I am quite within the mark when I say that, instead of only taking 300 tons of oil out of them, 1,500 could as easily have been got, and that without touching an old one.\u201d In one day by the men of the five ships upwards of 4,000 old seals were taken, \u201cthe young ones in thousands yelling for their mothers, following the skins as the men dragged them to the ships, and sucking the crangs, i.e. skins, in desperation.\u201d The maternal love for its offspring was made use of to save the men trouble, as a seal killed when giving suck was more easily secured, and often seals desperately wounded were seen administering nourishment to their young ones. The plight of the young ones which had lost their mothers was pitiful in the extreme; they were seen huddling together for heat, \u201cand trying to suck one another,\u201d till they at length succumbed. Capt. Gray exclaims, \u201csurely there is influence enough left in Great Britain to prevent a continuation of such barbarity. I overheard some of my men saying to one another, \u201cIt is a shame this sort of work;\u201d and so it is. It is a shame that any civilised Government should allow its subjects to perpetrate such cruelty when it could so easily be prevented. The remedy is simply, let the ships be kept from sailing before March 25; ships now sail from Feb. 25 to March 1. This would give a fortnight to make the passage, and find the seals in; by that time the young would be beginning to be worth taking, and a fearful waste of life put a stop to that now annually occurs.\u201d The accounts of the cruelties practiced in sealing are sickening in the extreme, the only thing considered being how to deprive as great a number of their skin and blubber in as short a time as possible. Mr. Brown (Proc. Zool. Soc, 1868) remarks: \u201cSeals are very tenacious of life, and difficult to kill, unless by a bullet through the brain or heart. They are so quickly flensed (the operation of removing the blubber and skin) that after having been deprived of their skin they have been seen to strike out in the water; so that the sympathies of the rough hunters have been so excited that they will pierce the heart several times with their knives before throwing away the carcass.\u201d These movements Mr. Brown attributes to reflex action, but considering the haste of the operation, and the seal's known tenacity of life, it is quite as likely that it was merely a stunned and not a dead animal thus deprived of its skin and blubber. It is terrible to dwell thus upon the horrors of this cruel trade, which make even the hardened participators sicken and relent, but it is necessary that it should be done, in order, if possible, to reach the hearts of Englishmen, and enlist their sympathies. If these beautiful and harmless creatures must be sacrificed for our requirements, it is a duty incumbent upon us to see that their destruction is carried out mercifully, and with the infliction of as little suffering and waste of life as possible.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"10","prism.number":"240","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"85","prism.endingPage":"86","prism.copyright":"1874 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/010085d0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/010085d0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/010085d0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/010085d0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Seal Fishery","citation_volume":"10","citation_issue":"240","citation_publication_date":"1874/06","citation_firstpage":"85","citation_lastpage":"86","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/010085d0","DOI":"10.1038/010085d0","citation_doi":"10.1038/010085d0","description":"CAPT.

If these beautiful and harmless creatures must be sacrificed for our requirements, it is a duty incumbent upon us to see that their destruction is carried out mercifully, and with the infliction of as little suffering and waste of life as possible.","dc.creator":["SOUTHWELL, THOS."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["SOUTHWELL, THOS."],"citation_author_institution":["Norwich"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Seal Fishery","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Seal Fishery&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"010262b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Personally, I have never been able to detect any movement in this bird, but one has only to turn to works on the ornithology of the extreme north and south of Europe to see that it is affected like the rest, and even in the Orkneys it is described as an occasional autumnal visitant. However, in most of the British Islands and the more temperate parts of Europe it is very possibly only the young of this species which migrate, and the adults, having once fixed on a place of residence, may stick to it; so that here we have a case which will almost bear out Mr. Wallace's supposition.

Personally, I have never been able to detect any movement in this bird, but one has only to turn to works on the ornithology of the extreme north and south of Europe to see that it is affected like the rest, and even in the Orkneys it is described as an occasional autumnal visitant. However, in most of the British Islands and the more temperate parts of Europe it is very possibly only the young of this species which migrate, and the adults, having once fixed on a place of residence, may stick to it; so that here we have a case which will almost bear out Mr. Wallace's supposition. With this, however, he stops, and I am sorry to say offers no suggestion as to the way in which migration is effected.","dc.creator":["NEWTON, ALFRED"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["NEWTON, ALFRED"],"citation_author_institution":["Magdalene College, Cambridge"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Migration of Birds","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Migration of Birds&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"011027b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It would be interesting if it could be ascertained how such a peculiar instrument as that described by your correspondent came to be used as a weapon of war. Its form precludes the possibility of its having been designed for such a purpose. The mode of holding it suggests the idea of its having originally been used as a pounder, the thick end having perhaps been employed for pounding grain, beating out grass for cloth, or for preparing skins. It somewhat resembles the instrument used for making bark cloth in some of the Polynesian Isles, and it corresponds to the Beatle (Battelle) still used by Irishwomen for beating flax, and occasionally, I have no doubt, as a weapon of war; but these are used with the flat side, not the end. The only weapon I know of that is used like the Pai-ute club is the New Zealander's Merai or Pattoo-Pattoo, the sharp end of which is thrust into the back of the head of the offender; and I have suggested elsewhere that this peculiar and awkward mode of using it arose from its having been originally what its form resembles, a stone axe blade (celt), used as the Australians now use it sometimes, in the hand without any handle.

It would be interesting if it could be ascertained how such a peculiar instrument as that described by your correspondent came to be used as a weapon of war. Its form precludes the possibility of its having been designed for such a purpose. The mode of holding it suggests the idea of its having originally been used as a pounder, the thick end having perhaps been employed for pounding grain, beating out grass for cloth, or for preparing skins. It somewhat resembles the instrument used for making bark cloth in some of the Polynesian Isles, and it corresponds to the Beatle (Battelle) still used by Irishwomen for beating flax, and occasionally, I have no doubt, as a weapon of war; but these are used with the flat side, not the end. The only weapon I know of that is used like the Pai-ute club is the New Zealander's Merai or Pattoo-Pattoo, the sharp end of which is thrust into the back of the head of the offender; and I have suggested elsewhere that this peculiar and awkward mode of using it arose from its having been originally what its form resembles, a stone axe blade (celt), used as the Australians now use it sometimes, in the hand without any handle. The sharp edge at the end of the Merai shows its original intention, in the same way that the flat end of the Pai-ute club could never have been designed as an offensive weapon, but would have been useful as a pounder; it may be, in fact, a \u201csurvival\u201d converted to other uses.

I can find no allusion to the singular mode in which the capsules as well as the seeds of this plant become liberated. The fruit is a three-celled capsule, and is almost wholly included within the tube of the calyx. When quite ripe it is of a pale straw colour, and becomes cartilaginous and highly polished, as does also the internal surface of the calyx tube. The latter is ribbed with fifteen prominent lines disposed in threes, each set pertaining respectively to the five sepals, and extending into their free portions. These ridges may possibly help to give direction to the capsule during its exit. Dehiscence takes place loculicidally, and the three dark-brown seeds, one in each cell, are exposed to view. It is at this stage that the phenomenon in question may be observed. The pressure exerted by the smooth sides of the somewhat obconical capsule against the equally polished surface of the calyx-tube occasions the rupture of the capsule from the base of the calyx, and its more or less rapid expulsion into the air with its three seeds. The latter, which are at this time free within the cells of the capsule, are carried to greater distances on account of the smaller amount of resistance they offer to the air by reason of their shape and weight; the action, in fact, being not altogether unlike that of the discharge of a cartridge and its contents from a rifle. The suddenness of the explosion depends very much on the state of the atmosphere at the time. On a hot day I have observed several instances of spontaneous discharges, whilst a slight touch only was necessary for the explosion of the remaining capsules whose dehiscence had already commenced. Many of the seeds were observed adhering to the upper leaves and calyx-segments, which are thickly covered with glandular hairs of a remarkably viscid nature. Contact with these moist bodies very soon induces the outgrowth of those curious and beautiful spiral hairs for which the seeds of this and a few other plants are remarkable, and thus they become doubly secured by adhesion. I have noticed in some cases when seeds adhere to the flat surface of a viscid leaf, that this outgrowth assumes a definite outline extending all round the seed in the form of a flat membranous expansion, and these, on removal, recall forcibly the appearance of ordinary winged seeds, like those of Lepigonum marginatum, for instance. Can this attachment be of any use to the seeds or to the plant itself by feeding on the nitrogenous products of their decomposition? Although I have observed a few of these attached seeds undergoing partial decay, yet, from the nature of their hard horny perisperm, it is not reasonable to suppose that it can take place to any great extent, unless the viscid secretion from the glands is able to render this substance sufficiently soluble for the purpose. If, however, a certain proportion do become sacrificed for the good of the plant, we can understand the object not only of the delicate spiral hairs for ensuring firm attachment, but also that of the explosive process, by means of which a certain number of seeds are conveyed beyond the reach of the viscid surfaces, and falling to the ground, are available for the reproduction of the plant. Saxifraga tridactylites might be mentioned as another instance of a viscid plant with the habit of retaining the seeds on its glandular parts; the much larger quantity, however, produced by this latter plant in proportion to what can be required for reproductive purposes would seem to do away with the necessity for any sudden mode of expulsion.

At this time Saturn was visible, having an altitude of 10\u00b0 56\u2032, azimuth 53\u00b0 15\u2032.","dc.creator":["PLUMMER, JOHN I."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["PLUMMER, JOHN I."],"citation_author_institution":["Orwell Park Observatory,"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Brilliant Meteor","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Brilliant Meteor&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"015005b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Tolver Preston in NATURE, vol. xvii. p. 31, throw a flood of light on the subject of availability of heat-energy, which altogether alters the basis upon which the hitherto imperfectly expressed conditions of the use of this form of energy will be made to rest. Mr. Tolver Preston has, in fact, discovered that discriminating \u201csprite,\u201d or being whom Prof. Clerk-Maxwell imagined (\u201cTheory of Heat,\u201d 1875, p. 328) singling out the fast-moving, and separating them in a space by themselves (without any expenditure of energy), from the slow-moving molecules of a gaseous mass; or what is nearly equivalent to this, he has at least shown how some fast-moving and some slow-moving particles of a mass of gas originally in equilibrium, both as to temperature and pressure, will naturally be so guided amongst each other, that their joint energy will become more available than it was before. But it has, perhaps, not occurred to Mr. Tolver Preston and to some of your readers, that this power or faculty of rendering heat-energy available, which mutual diffusion of heterogeneous gas masses, either through a porous septum or in their own contiguous layers possesses, is a consequence of the general form of efficacy belonging to force, of which Prof. Clausius pointed out the existence in his important propositions on the \u201cvirial,\u201d 1 as he has termed one of the two members, of which this kind of mechanical tendency of force is the sum. The other member of a force's \u201cradiahty\u201d (as it may be termed). \u201cwith respect to a given point,\u201d is the vis viva2 of the material particle upon which it acts, in a space of which the selected point is the origin. In description of this newly-discovered natural tendency of a force with respect to a given point or focus, it is enough to say that while the statical moment of a force, or the product of the distance of its point of application from a point or fulcrum by the resolved part of the force perpendicular to this distance tends to increase uniformly the moment of momentum (defined similarly with that of force) of the particle upon which it acts, so does the \u201cradiancy\u201d of a force, or the product of the distance of its point of application from a given point or \u201cfocus,\u201d together with the vis viva of the particle upon which it acts, tend to increase the \u201cradiancy of momentum\u201d of the particle described in the same way as the radiancy (or the first term of the radiality) of the force, as just defined. We may speak of the radiancies of equal and opposite reactions, or of force-pairs, in the same way that we deal in statics with the moments of couples; with similar general properties of their equilibrium, including the resoluticn of the total radiancy (like the impulse, the horse-power, and the moment) of a system of force, into an internal and an external part with respect to the centre of mass of a material system upon which it acts; and there are principles of conservation of moment and of radiancy of momentum about any point, taken as centre, of all the force-pairs whose moments and radiancies balance each other on a material system. Only the system's vis viva referred to the centre is in the latter case the rate of change of its radiancy of momentum relatively to it. It is in the same way that the conservation of the motion of the centre of mass, and the conservation of energy, are principles of nullity or of inaction of two other forms of force-agency balancing each other on a material system (the impulse of farces, and the product of their impulse by the virtual velocity of their point of application, or their \u201chorse-power\u201d) to which we are obliged to have special recourse to resolve the particular varieties of questions of the \u201ctransfer of energy\u201d which occur in mechanics. But it is remarkable that the radiality of a force-pair includes the vis viva of its mass-couplet as one member of its mechanical efficacy, and a surprising example of an agent (evidently the agent of heat-distribution) here presents itself in which vis viva itself is one of the active elements of the mechanical variation or compulsion! Its total tendency in any body acted on internally only by directly reacting force-pairs is the total vis viva, and the sum of the virials of those force-pairs, diminished, if the body is subjected externally to a uniform pressure normal to its surface, by three times the well-known product of this latter pressure by the volume of the bedy (written-3pv).","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"18","prism.number":"445","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"39","prism.endingPage":"40","prism.copyright":"1878 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/018039b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/018039b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/018039b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/018039b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"On the use of the viral in Thermodynamics","citation_volume":"18","citation_issue":"445","citation_publication_date":"1878/05","citation_firstpage":"39","citation_lastpage":"40","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/018039b0","DOI":"10.1038/018039b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/018039b0","description":"THE ingenious experiment and the deductions from it, described by Mr. S.

In description of this newly-discovered natural tendency of a force with respect to a given point or focus, it is enough to say that while the statical moment of a force, or the product of the distance of its point of application from a point or fulcrum by the resolved part of the force perpendicular to this distance tends to increase uniformly the moment of momentum (defined similarly with that of force) of the particle upon which it acts, so does the \u201cradiancy\u201d of a force, or the product of the distance of its point of application from a given point or \u201cfocus,\u201d together with the vis viva of the particle upon which it acts, tend to increase the \u201cradiancy of momentum\u201d of the particle described in the same way as the radiancy (or the first term of the radiality) of the force, as just defined. We may speak of the radiancies of equal and opposite reactions, or of force-pairs, in the same way that we deal in statics with the moments of couples; with similar general properties of their equilibrium, including the resoluticn of the total radiancy (like the impulse, the horse-power, and the moment) of a system of force, into an internal and an external part with respect to the centre of mass of a material system upon which it acts; and there are principles of conservation of moment and of radiancy of momentum about any point, taken as centre, of all the force-pairs whose moments and radiancies balance each other on a material system. Only the system's vis viva referred to the centre is in the latter case the rate of change of its radiancy of momentum relatively to it. It is in the same way that the conservation of the motion of the centre of mass, and the conservation of energy, are principles of nullity or of inaction of two other forms of force-agency balancing each other on a material system (the impulse of farces, and the product of their impulse by the virtual velocity of their point of application, or their \u201chorse-power\u201d) to which we are obliged to have special recourse to resolve the particular varieties of questions of the \u201ctransfer of energy\u201d which occur in mechanics. But it is remarkable that the radiality of a force-pair includes the vis viva of its mass-couplet as one member of its mechanical efficacy, and a surprising example of an agent (evidently the agent of heat-distribution) here presents itself in which vis viva itself is one of the active elements of the mechanical variation or compulsion! Its total tendency in any body acted on internally only by directly reacting force-pairs is the total vis viva, and the sum of the virials of those force-pairs, diminished, if the body is subjected externally to a uniform pressure normal to its surface, by three times the well-known product of this latter pressure by the volume of the bedy (written-3pv).","dc.creator":["H., A.

Probably the difficulties of giving such a test scientific precision are insurmountable. No doubt these grains do vary in weight from year to year. Of some samples of oats, of crop 1877, contributed by me to the South Kensington Museum, the pound contained 13,642 grains, while the pound of crop 1878 contained 16,870. But there are many varieties of oats, barley, and wheat in general cultivation, each producing grains differing in weight from the others. In an inquiry which I made regarding the weight of the sterling, average grains of wheat of crop 1876 from the south of England were found, in an air-dry condition, to weigh as follows: Talavera, 1.01 gr. troy; Chidham white, 76; Sherrifl's bearded, 86; Kessingland red, 92; Nursery red, .76; Trump white, .81; Red rivet, 1.00; Lammas red, .89; Hunter's white, .75.

Probably the difficulties of giving such a test scientific precision are insurmountable. No doubt these grains do vary in weight from year to year. Of some samples of oats, of crop 1877, contributed by me to the South Kensington Museum, the pound contained 13,642 grains, while the pound of crop 1878 contained 16,870. But there are many varieties of oats, barley, and wheat in general cultivation, each producing grains differing in weight from the others. In an inquiry which I made regarding the weight of the sterling, average grains of wheat of crop 1876 from the south of England were found, in an air-dry condition, to weigh as follows: Talavera, 1.01 gr. troy; Chidham white, 76; Sherrifl's bearded, 86; Kessingland red, 92; Nursery red, .76; Trump white, .81; Red rivet, 1.00; Lammas red, .89; Hunter's white, .75. And different ears of a given variety of wheat have grains of different weight. If six or eight culms come up on one stool, the largest ears hare the heaviest grains. In general, the larger flower-cups in an ear, contain the heavier grains. Then, there is scarcely such a thing to be found as a crop of one pure variety. Any variety rapidly gets mixed with others. And, supposing that a plot were set aside for a pure variety, year after year, for a few cycles of sun-spots, the mineral conditions would be constantly varying; so that any test by the balance to compare the fruit of one year with that of another, would involve too many unappraisable elements to have a real value.","dc.creator":["WILSON, A.

It was first seen on March 2 in about lat. 22\u00b0 30\u2032 N., long. 42\u00b0 W., halfway between the Canaries and the West Indies. Again on March 6, lat 21\u00b0 N., long. 49\u00b0 W., quantities of gulf-weed drifted past the ship. On more than one occasion large patches of Sargassum were observed extending from the vicinity of the vessel to a great distance. The gulf-weed was also encountered between St. Thomas and the Bermudas group, and was last met by us between the latter islands and the Azores on June 18, lat. 35\u00b0 N., long. 53\u00b0 W.","dc.creator":["WILD, J.

That Terminalia tomentosa contains calcareous matter has long been known to natives, and a reference to Tennent's \u201cCeylon,\u201d i. 99, will show that they make a practical use of their knowledge by using the ashes of the bark as a substitute for lime, to chew with betel. Another southern tree which contains an alkali in its bark is Avicennia tomentosa. It generally grows along the margins of backwaters, and has a most wonderful provision for preventing the erosion of the banks and for adding to the dry land. It is a squat bushy tree, and round the stem, to an extent equal to the spread of its branches, it sends up thickets of straight shoots a foot or two high. These, when the tide is up or the water in flood, catch all the stray branches, leaves, grass, &c., that may be floating about, and also promote silt. By this contrivance, therefore, not only are the banks protected from the distinctive action of water, but also raised and consolidated. Again, as regards Mr. Stoney's observation of calcareous masses in timber, which was brought to the notice of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1870 as a fresh discovery, it seems strange that the learned body in question did not know that the existence of such concretions, so far from being very rare, is an occasional and well-known phenomenon. Thus, in the Madras Journal of Literature and Science for April-September, 1858, page 142, Prof. Mayer gives a qualitative analysis of a concretion of the kind found in a teak log. It consisted chiefly of magnesia, with potash, lime, silica, and a trace of iron. The substance, he says, \u201cMust be looked on as a mixture, and not a true chemical compound.\u201d Again, he observes, \u201cas a whole the substance thus hardened is insoluble in cold, and but slightly so in water of higher temperature. At 212\u00b0, however, there is sensible action after a time. In diluted hydrochloric acid solubility ensues, hastened by increased temperature. Solution is attended by slight effervescence, some carbonic acid being liberated.\u201d He then proceeds to give an explanation of the process by which sach mineral matters may be taken up from the soil and deposited in the tree. So far as I know the occurrence of such concretions in India was first brought to notice by Lieut., now Col. Hawkes, of the Madras Army, in 1858. He had seen them only in teak logs, and remarked that they generally occur \u201cin what carpenters call a shake in the wood, but with this exception the logs are perfectly sound, and no communication whatever with the external air has been observed.\u201d","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"22","prism.number":"556","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"169","prism.endingPage":"170","prism.copyright":"1880 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/022169c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/022169c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/022169c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/022169c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Calcareous Concretions in Timber","citation_volume":"22","citation_issue":"556","citation_publication_date":"1880/06","citation_firstpage":"169","citation_lastpage":"170","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/022169c0","DOI":"10.1038/022169c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/022169c0","description":"IN NATURE, vol. xxi. p. 376, I observe that in a remark of the reviewer, and also in an extract from Mr. Ball's \u201cJungle Life in India,\u201d the occurrence of concretions of lime in trees is spoken of as a rare and novel phenomenon.

It generally grows along the margins of backwaters, and has a most wonderful provision for preventing the erosion of the banks and for adding to the dry land. It is a squat bushy tree, and round the stem, to an extent equal to the spread of its branches, it sends up thickets of straight shoots a foot or two high. These, when the tide is up or the water in flood, catch all the stray branches, leaves, grass, &c., that may be floating about, and also promote silt. By this contrivance, therefore, not only are the banks protected from the distinctive action of water, but also raised and consolidated. Again, as regards Mr. Stoney's observation of calcareous masses in timber, which was brought to the notice of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1870 as a fresh discovery, it seems strange that the learned body in question did not know that the existence of such concretions, so far from being very rare, is an occasional and well-known phenomenon. Thus, in the Madras Journal of Literature and Science for April-September, 1858, page 142, Prof. Mayer gives a qualitative analysis of a concretion of the kind found in a teak log. It consisted chiefly of magnesia, with potash, lime, silica, and a trace of iron. The substance, he says, \u201cMust be looked on as a mixture, and not a true chemical compound.\u201d Again, he observes, \u201cas a whole the substance thus hardened is insoluble in cold, and but slightly so in water of higher temperature. At 212\u00b0, however, there is sensible action after a time. In diluted hydrochloric acid solubility ensues, hastened by increased temperature. Solution is attended by slight effervescence, some carbonic acid being liberated.\u201d He then proceeds to give an explanation of the process by which sach mineral matters may be taken up from the soil and deposited in the tree. So far as I know the occurrence of such concretions in India was first brought to notice by Lieut., now Col. Hawkes, of the Madras Army, in 1858. He had seen them only in teak logs, and remarked that they generally occur \u201cin what carpenters call a shake in the wood, but with this exception the logs are perfectly sound, and no communication whatever with the external air has been observed.\u201d","dc.creator":["BIDIE, G."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["BIDIE, G."],"citation_author_institution":["Government Central Museum, Madras"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Calcareous Concretions in Timber","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Calcareous Concretions in Timber&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"022170a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Immediately after the publication of my former letter, it was remarked to me, that although I had shown hot ice to be an impossible commodity, perhaps Dr. Carnelley's assertion of the existence of solid mercuric chloride above its boiling point might still hold. I therefore repeated this experiment, and after overcoming a few preliminary difficulties, obtained a result similar to that with ice. The difficulties were these:\u2014After solidifying a cylinder of mercuric chloride round the thermometer (to which it adhered at first), on hearing, the mercuric chloride soon became detached and fell from the thermometer. It had therefore to be sustained in position round the thermometer, by a stout iron or copper wire. Another difficulty arose from the fact that the mercuric chloride soon became deeply pitted and fissured, so much so, that the thermometer was sometimes seen through holes a quarter of an inch deep. This pitting went on till the mercuric chloride cylinder, though not much reduced in diameter, became a mere network, the thermometer being visible in many places. The erosion seemed to take place more quickly next the bulb; making the holes in the cylinder widest at the interior. Another difficulty lay in the high temperature causing, as Prof. McLeod noticed, the rupture of the thermometer thread; but by using a very good thermometer, and keeping it as nearly vertical as was convenient, this was entirely obviated. A large condenser is not required, and I only used a piece of combustion tubing fully an inch in diameter and about twenty inches long, the thermometer with the cylinder of mercuric chloride being inserted at one end, and a tube connected with a Sprengel pump at the other. The results obtained are as follows:\u2014Melting point of mercuric chloride, 271\u00b0 (uncorr.); boiling point, 291\u00b0 (uncorr.). The pressure was now reduced to 400 mm., and the tube heated until the temperature was constant, the pressure again reduced, another reading taken, and so on until a vacuum was reached, or the cylinder had become too porous to give correct readings. By the use of Gimmingham's form of pump the exhaustion can be increased in a very short time, and the readings all obtained from one cylinder an inch in diameter. Three series of readings were taken agreeing very well with each other.

Immediately after the publication of my former letter, it was remarked to me, that although I had shown hot ice to be an impossible commodity, perhaps Dr. Carnelley's assertion of the existence of solid mercuric chloride above its boiling point might still hold. I therefore repeated this experiment, and after overcoming a few preliminary difficulties, obtained a result similar to that with ice. The difficulties were these:\u2014After solidifying a cylinder of mercuric chloride round the thermometer (to which it adhered at first), on hearing, the mercuric chloride soon became detached and fell from the thermometer. It had therefore to be sustained in position round the thermometer, by a stout iron or copper wire. Another difficulty arose from the fact that the mercuric chloride soon became deeply pitted and fissured, so much so, that the thermometer was sometimes seen through holes a quarter of an inch deep. This pitting went on till the mercuric chloride cylinder, though not much reduced in diameter, became a mere network, the thermometer being visible in many places. The erosion seemed to take place more quickly next the bulb; making the holes in the cylinder widest at the interior. Another difficulty lay in the high temperature causing, as Prof. McLeod noticed, the rupture of the thermometer thread; but by using a very good thermometer, and keeping it as nearly vertical as was convenient, this was entirely obviated. A large condenser is not required, and I only used a piece of combustion tubing fully an inch in diameter and about twenty inches long, the thermometer with the cylinder of mercuric chloride being inserted at one end, and a tube connected with a Sprengel pump at the other. The results obtained are as follows:\u2014Melting point of mercuric chloride, 271\u00b0 (uncorr.); boiling point, 291\u00b0 (uncorr.). The pressure was now reduced to 400 mm., and the tube heated until the temperature was constant, the pressure again reduced, another reading taken, and so on until a vacuum was reached, or the cylinder had become too porous to give correct readings. By the use of Gimmingham's form of pump the exhaustion can be increased in a very short time, and the readings all obtained from one cylinder an inch in diameter. Three series of readings were taken agreeing very well with each other. At first there were discrepancies, owing to the porosity of the cylinder not being noticed, but these disappeared when care was taken. The temperatures were not corrected, as the results were not intended for publication, as I expected some other worker to repeat the experiment, but that not being the case I give the numbers as they are, premising that the temperatures, if corrected, would be 6\u00b0 or 7\u00b0 higher for the upper and 4\u00b0 to 6\u00b0 for the lower ones.

If the water is not much disturbed by wind, it is seen, on attentive watching, that this \u201ccombing\u201d appears suddenly, and begins at the advancing edge of the crest, and spreads backwards. With small waves a foot or so in height and of long extended front, such as are seen in shallow water, it may be observed that the crest, which in this case rolls down the front of the wave, is at first smooth and even, while the back of the wave is also smooth and unfurrowed, but the edge of the crest suddenly becomes crenated, and almost simultaneously the combing appears on the back of the wave, travelling rapidly backwards from the crenated edge. Moreover a considerable length of the wave appears to be similarly affected almost at the same instant. With larger waves, whose crest falls rather than rolls upon the concave front, I have observed that the edge is at first smooth and even, but that it suddenly becomes uneven, and often fringed with a row or rows of drops, and that at the same instant the combing appears. In both cases, if there is much wind, the regularity of the phenomenon is disturbed, and observation is in other ways rendered difficult. The action is so exactly parallel to something which takes place in the splash of drops, and which I have described in detail in a paper recently read before the Royal Society (see Proc. Roy. Soc., No. 218), that I think your readers may be interested in a brief statement, with special reference to this more familiar case of waves, of the explanation there put forward. The explanation amounts to this:\u2014It is well known that a long cylinder of liquid is unstable, and will, if left to itself, at once tend to split into a row of equal, equidistant drops; the splitting being effected by a constriction of the cylinder in certain places, and a bulging out in others. Again, if a mass of liquid is bounded by an edge whose surface is approximately a portion of a long cylinder, there is good reason for supposing that this cylindrical edge will be subject to similar laws of stability, and that it will tend to cleave in the same way, the surface being forced in in certain places, and out in others. Now a wave's crest presents such a cylindrical edge. It will, therefore, of itself, cleave in the way described, and the flow of water will thereby be hindered at the constrictions, and aided at the places of bulging out. Thus lines of easiest flow will be set up, which in their turn will determine the furrows on the back of the wave. The fringe of drops is due to the splitting in a similar manner of the cylindrical jets shot out from the places of bulging, where the flow is aided. Indeed, much of the seething at the edge of a wave is, I think, attributable to the breaking up of such jets in this manner. In the case of the minute phenomenon of a drop splash, I have been able, in some degree, to bring this explanation to the test of measurements, which, so far as they go, quite confirm it. The regularly-toothed edge of a spot of candle-wax that has fallen on a cold object, affords in a permanent form a familiar illustration of the same action.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"26","prism.number":"661","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"198","prism.endingPage":"199","prism.copyright":"1882 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/026198b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/026198b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/026198b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/026198b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"\u201cCombing\u201d of Waves","citation_volume":"26","citation_issue":"661","citation_publication_date":"1882/06","citation_firstpage":"198","citation_lastpage":"199","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/026198b0","DOI":"10.1038/026198b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/026198b0","description":"ALL who have watched waves breaking on the sea-shore must have noticed the furrowed or \u201ccombed\u201d appearance of the back of a wave as it curls over.

However, during favourable intervals I have seen many brilliant meteors; from twenty to thirty on an average every night. They were principally seen with the face to the north, and glancing from shoulder to shoulder; but not a single Andromede did I see. I had the pleasure of seeing altogether about a score of Leonids before the 12th and after the 19th November. Leo Minorids and Arietids were plentiful, and a goodly number of Geminids were seen; but the richest field for meteors during the month was in the neighbourhood of the Plough. November 6, at 4.30 a.m., a large meteor passed from \u03b3 Urs\u00e6 Majoris right down to the horizon. From 4.35 to 5.15 three veritable Leonids proceeded from the Sickle; one dashed down to the right-hand, and another from the top of the Sickle to the left over the Lion's back. They were very large. November 10, at 8 p.m., a brilliant meteor started from a point nearly half way between Aldebaran and Saturn, and disappeared at a point down more than half way to the horizon. At 9.30 a very bright one appeared at a point about 1\u00b0 above Castor and above Jupiter to the north. At 11.25 an exceedingly large and brilliant meteor burst out from 1/2 \u00b0 below Menkar (in the Whale), and went down at right angles to the very horizon, leaving a long, bright streak behind. November 11, a large one, at 0.15 a.m., dropped down to the horizon from Ur\u00e6; Majoris. At 0.55 a.m. a very large one proceeded from 1/2 \u00b0 to the right of Lacert\u00e6 and disappeared at \u03b3 Cygni. November 18, at 1.40 a.m., a very large reddish meteor burst out from the top of Ursa Major's head, and passed right above Vega, and disappeared about 4\u00b0 beyond it in a strange sparkling explosion. At 1.55 a.m. a very brilliant meteor dashed out about 2\u00b0 above \u03b1 Arietis, went through the Square of Pegasus, leaving a beautiful stream of blue fire behind, and lasting a few seconds. About 5.30 another large blue meteor passed from the centre of Leo's back through a point 4\u00b0 above Denebola, and ended in a beautiful explosion 15\u00b0 beyond. On the night of November 22 there was a fine display of (generally) large meteors from Taurus to Ursa Major; many of them proceeded from the Lion's Head. During the month a great number of meteors passed from some point in Scorpio, under Jupiter and Mars, right into the Lion's Head. They were all large and bright. During the last half of the month some fine displays of morning meteors were seen. At 4 a.m., November 29, I observed a very large and swift meteor. It blazed oat from a point about 8\u00b0 above Denebola, and dashed with great velocity up the heavens, passing 4\u00b0 above \u03b4 Leonis and over the Lion's Head, and exploded about 5\u00b0 beyond, leaving a stream of the most beautiful blue light in its wake that I ever witnessed.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"29","prism.number":"736","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"123","prism.endingPage":"123","prism.copyright":"1883 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029123a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/029123a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029123a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029123a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Meteors","citation_volume":"29","citation_issue":"736","citation_publication_date":"1883/12","citation_firstpage":"123","citation_lastpage":"123","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/029123a0","DOI":"10.1038/029123a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/029123a0","description":"HERE, November has generally been unpropitious for astronomical observations.

JOHN MILNE, of Tokio, refers in an article under this heading (NATURE, vol. xxix. p. 290) to buildings in Caracas, which are low, slightly pyramidal, have flat roofs, and are bound along their faces with iron.

On June 15, when in S. lat. 21\u00b0 37\u2032 and E. long. 113\u00b0 49\u2032, about five miles off the Exmouth Gulf on the western coast of the continent, he saw an immense creature which he took to be a species of Octopus. His attention was drawn to it by a perfect cloud of sea birds, and at first he naturally thought it must be a dead carcass. On approaching it, however, he found it was alive, and sluggishly disporting itself. In shape it was like a violin, but of immense size, with some six feelers about the greater diameters of the violin. It lay almost flat upon the water, was of a dark gray above and lighter gray below, and was continually elevating one of its feelers, apparently twice the thickness of a man's arm, to a height of from six to eight feet. It appeared to be vomiting, and as the birds were evidently feeding, that accounted for their presence in such numbers. Its size was so great that, had it grasped the vessel, it could easily have capsized it. The captain therefore got out of the way as quickly as possible, and without making definite measurements; but a large whale in the vicinity looked quite diminutive. It is a pity that something more exact as to size is not available, but I think the description is sufficient to convey an idea of the nature of the monster. All along the northern and western coasts of the continent vast shoals of pumice, in portions varying in size from ordinary gravel to about a foot in diameter, and completely covered with barnacles, were passed through.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"30","prism.number":"778","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"513","prism.endingPage":"513","prism.copyright":"1884 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/030513a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/030513a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/030513a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/030513a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"A Sea Monster","citation_volume":"30","citation_issue":"778","citation_publication_date":"1884/09","citation_firstpage":"513","citation_lastpage":"513","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/030513a0","DOI":"10.1038/030513a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/030513a0","description":"A FRIEND of mine, Capt.

Statistics show that over 90 per cent. of mad dogs are retrievers, or animals so-called.

Pointers, setters, terriers, and hounds will not readily breed from dogs of another class, but the reverse is true of the retriever, and the result is the production of a horrible progeny that ought to be immediately destroyed. Owners of a kennel of sporting dogs are constantly subjected to the annoyance of one of their true-bred retrievers having a litter of pups that only resemble retrievers in their coats. I would therefore suggest that the Retriever Stud Book should be kept by a Government official, and that all owners of retrievers should be obliged to send notice to him when a litter arrived; and that the police should be empowered to destroy any retriever whose owner was not provided with a certificate of registration. A few inspectors of litters could travel the country, and at a cost of a few hundreds a year prevent the development of countless mongrels\u2014valueless for sporting purposes, hideous to look at, and sure promoters of canine madness.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"33","prism.number":"846","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"245","prism.endingPage":"245","prism.copyright":"1886 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/033245a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/033245a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/033245a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/033245a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Hydrophobia\u2014A Further Precaution","citation_volume":"33","citation_issue":"846","citation_publication_date":"1886/01","citation_firstpage":"245","citation_lastpage":"245","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/033245a0","DOI":"10.1038/033245a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/033245a0","description":"IT may be taken as an accepted fact that mongrels are more liable to rabies than well-bred dogs, both from the ill-treatment they commonly receive, and from the unnatural mingling of species that has led to their production.

Owners of a kennel of sporting dogs are constantly subjected to the annoyance of one of their true-bred retrievers having a litter of pups that only resemble retrievers in their coats. I would therefore suggest that the Retriever Stud Book should be kept by a Government official, and that all owners of retrievers should be obliged to send notice to him when a litter arrived; and that the police should be empowered to destroy any retriever whose owner was not provided with a certificate of registration. A few inspectors of litters could travel the country, and at a cost of a few hundreds a year prevent the development of countless mongrels\u2014valueless for sporting purposes, hideous to look at, and sure promoters of canine madness.","dc.creator":["TOMLIN, H.

This evidence is to be found in that peculiar state of mind produced when, as we say, we have a word \u201con the tip of the tongue.\u201d In this case the idea which the word, when found, will represent is most vividly present to the mind, but it is an idea only.

The possibility of this arises from the fact that in the snail the embryological course of development is capable of being repeated by the adult structure. In higher organisms this possibility does not as a rule exist, and mutilation is not followed by regeneration; but even in their case the ancestral cells remain, and when the embryological development is repeated their representatives in the embryo are present to give rise to descendants of the normal type in the normal fashion.

In the case of the pelican soaring to a great elevation, it is less easy to understand how the differences of horizontal velocity can be sufficient.","dc.creator":["RAYLEIGH"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["RAYLEIGH"],"citation_author_institution":["Terling Place, Witham"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Sailing Flight of the Albatross","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Sailing Flight of the Albatross&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"040174b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A few days ago Mr. Latter, science master at the Charterhouse, kindly forwarded to me three tubes containing a quantity of \u00c6olosma quaternarium. They were so abundant that every drop of water contained several specimens; in the water I found also a still larger number of spherical bodies, which proved to be cysts, each completely filled by a single worm coiled once upon itself. The cysts were perfectly colourless and transparent, and very thin-walled; one cyst was found empty, and had been ruptured by the worm in escaping from it. Twenty-six years ago Maggi (Mem. Soc. Ital. Sci. Nat., 1865) described and figured some bodies, oval in form, which he believed to be the cocoons of \u00c6olosoma; embryos were found in these cocoons in different stages of development. Prof. Vejdovsky (Entwickelungsgesch. Unters., Heft 1, Prag, 1888) suggested the possibility that these bodies were really cysts; my own examination of what are, I think, undoubtedly cysts in \u00c6olosoma leads me to agree with Vejdovsky's suggested interpretation of Maggi's figures. If the structures which I describe here are really cocoons, their form differs from that of the cocoons of all other Oligoch\u00e6ta, in being spherical and without a narrow process at either pole; moreover, it is\u2014on the hypothesis that they are cocoons\u2014a remarkable coincidence that they should all contain completely adult worms; finally, and this is of course conclusive, the intestinal tract of the worms contained vegetable detritus. The cysts, as I believe them to be, are of about the size of a Volvox globator. In this encysted condition the worms might perhaps be easily transported from place to place; I have found that they survived the evaporation of the surrounding water upon a glass slide for a considerable period; the worms were in continual movement within their cysts, so that it was quite easy to be sure that they were alive. Now this very species has a wide distribution, which may perhaps be partially accounted for by this habit of encystment; with regard to other fresh-water Annelids which have a wide range, such as Tubifex, it is possible that birds may inadvertently transport the cocoons from country to country. It is not known yet whether \u00c6olosoma forms a cocoon, though it is probable, as the worm develops a clitellum. But sexual maturity appears to be a comparatively rare occurrence in \u00c6olosoma; very few observers appear to have seen the sexually mature worms.

Recent authorities are not so well placed for judging of this matter as the earlier; for the reason that immunity is not alleged except for the African negro of pure blood or unchanged racial characters, and that these conditions of the problem have been much less frequently satisfied in the yellow-fever harbours of the western hemisphere since the African slave trade ceased. However, there was a good opportunity in 1866, during the disastrous yellow fever among the French troops of the Mexican expedition when they lay at Vera Cruz.

Recent authorities are not so well placed for judging of this matter as the earlier; for the reason that immunity is not alleged except for the African negro of pure blood or unchanged racial characters, and that these conditions of the problem have been much less frequently satisfied in the yellow-fever harbours of the western hemisphere since the African slave trade ceased. However, there was a good opportunity in 1866, during the disastrous yellow fever among the French troops of the Mexican expedition when they lay at Vera Cruz. Among them was a regiment of Nubians, who had been enlisted for the expedition by permission of the Khedive: that regiment had not a single case of yellow fever all through the epidemic. The African negro regiment brought over from the French colonies of Martinique and Guadeloupe had two or three cases, with, I think, one death.

DE RANCE'S note relating to the above subject in. NATURE, p. 294, mentions that \u201cHeer has determined a magnificent flora of more than 350 species from these northerrt tertiaries, and that he at once pointed out the absence of tropical and subtropical forms.\u201d My contention, founded on an attentive study of his determinations and of the original specimens in London and Dublin, and to some extent in Copenhagen, is that not fifty, or perhaps not the half of fifty, of these determinations are entitled to the smallest weight; and again that though at first he saw nothing subtropical in the flora, he subsequently declared the presence of palms, &c., upon utterly insufficient data. While, however, wishing to rid the \u201cmagnificent\u201d flora of 300 or more useless and misleading encumbrances, I am far from wishing to depreciate the extraordinary significance and value of that which remains, and which clearly shows that in early Eocene times the coast of Greenland supported in certain places forests which included the redwood, the plane, and even the magnolia, associated with many more northern forms. This is consistent with the tropical vegetation existing during a part of the possibly contemporary lower tertiary period in the south of England. Both facts are sufficiently inexplicable, but there is no occasion to magnify the difficulties they present. As to the Greenland floras they have not been proved to contain any forest trees that might not, and which in fact do not, flourish in their modern representatives, when planted in certain favourable spots on the west coast of Ireland, and even of Scotland. We are not even obliged to assume that Greenland as a country was characterised by such vegetation, for this might be as erroneous as to regard Ireland or Scotland as countries generally characterised by forests of arbutus. The flora of a country is in fact most likely to be preserved in its most sheltered spots, in lake bottoms like parts of Killarney, or where small rivers quietly steal into the tidal waters of deeply recessed bays like those of Bantry and Kenmare, in forest pools like some in the Mount Stewarts' woods of Bute, and in the backwaters and marginal pools of the lower reaches of larger rivers; we are not only entitled, but we are bound to consider this to have been the case in Greenland, and to base our estimate of its climate in the lower tertiaries upon this view and no other. Now what geologists and physicists ought to do, and what they resolutely won't do, is before going farther afield for cause and effect, to take the map of the world on Mercator's projection, and consider how far, if the Atlantic were a closed ocean to the north, as we know it must have been, the required climatic conditions would be produced. The difference between the arbutus nooks of Ireland on the one side and the desolation of Labrador on the other is brought about solely by ocean currents. At the period of the Greenland floras the arctic currents were excluded, and consequently the whole Atlantic basin was filled with the circulation of equatorial and temperate waters only. The distribution of plants and animals renders it extremely probable that during much of the tertiary period, the antarctic waters were equally excluded from the Atlantic by land connecting Africa and South America. What, under these circumstances, would happen to the climate of the Atlantic littoral? It would, it appears to me, be more philosophical to dispose of this question, which is supported by a weight of evidence, before invoking shifting of the earth's axis, or other hypothetical causes supported by none.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"47","prism.number":"1216","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"364","prism.endingPage":"365","prism.copyright":"1893 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/047364d0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/047364d0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/047364d0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/047364d0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Fossil Plants as Tests of Climate","citation_volume":"47","citation_issue":"1216","citation_publication_date":"1893/02","citation_firstpage":"364","citation_lastpage":"365","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/047364d0","DOI":"10.1038/047364d0","citation_doi":"10.1038/047364d0","description":"MR.

Soc. (Bir. Phil. Soc. Proc., vol. ix. part 1, 1893), upon the effect of a solid in concentrating a substance out of a solution into the superficial film in accordance with Prof. J. J. Thomson's investigation (\u201cApplications of Dynamics to Physics,\u201d p. 191), Dr. Gore has quoted an observation of Pouillet's (Annales de Chemie, 1822, vol. xx. pp. 141\u2013162), that when inert powders like silica are mixed with liquids that do not act on them heat is evolved. On the other hand, when the superficial area of contact between a liquid and its gas is increased heat is absorbed. This latter is known to be the case because the superficial tension diminishes with rise of temperature. In the case of the solid-liquid surface being produced, it would appear at first sight to follow that the superficial tension should increase with increased temperature. The matter is, however, somewhat more complicated. When a dry solid is mixed with a liquid we are substituting a solid-liquid surface for a solid-air surface, and from the fact that most liquids soak up into a mass of dry powder, we may conclude that the superficial potential energy of the solid-liquid is less than that of the solid-air surface, i.e. that more work must be done to separate the liquid from the solid than is developed by the air getting at the solid. If these actions are reversible, we may apply the laws of thermodynamics, and conclude that as heat is evolved when the system does work, i.e. when the solid-liquid surface is increased, that it must require more work to separate the solid from the liquid at high temperatures than at low ones, and in the case of silica and water, for instance, that is very much what one would expect from the action of water at very high temperatures on silica. If we could assume that the superficial tension of air-solid were zero, it would follow from this that the superficial tension of a solid-liquid surface is negative, i.e. that there is a superficial pressure, and that the liquid has more attraction for the solid than for its own particles, and that this difference increases with increased temperature, i.e. the superficial pressure increases.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"49","prism.number":"1265","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"293","prism.endingPage":"293","prism.copyright":"1894 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/049293a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/049293a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/049293a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/049293a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"On the Change of Superficial Tension of Solid-Liquid Surfaces with Temperature","citation_volume":"49","citation_issue":"1265","citation_publication_date":"1894/01","citation_firstpage":"293","citation_lastpage":"293","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/049293a0","DOI":"10.1038/049293a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/049293a0","description":"IN a recent very interesting communication to the Birmingham Phil.

When a dry solid is mixed with a liquid we are substituting a solid-liquid surface for a solid-air surface, and from the fact that most liquids soak up into a mass of dry powder, we may conclude that the superficial potential energy of the solid-liquid is less than that of the solid-air surface, i.e. that more work must be done to separate the liquid from the solid than is developed by the air getting at the solid. If these actions are reversible, we may apply the laws of thermodynamics, and conclude that as heat is evolved when the system does work, i.e. when the solid-liquid surface is increased, that it must require more work to separate the solid from the liquid at high temperatures than at low ones, and in the case of silica and water, for instance, that is very much what one would expect from the action of water at very high temperatures on silica. If we could assume that the superficial tension of air-solid were zero, it would follow from this that the superficial tension of a solid-liquid surface is negative, i.e. that there is a superficial pressure, and that the liquid has more attraction for the solid than for its own particles, and that this difference increases with increased temperature, i.e. the superficial pressure increases.","dc.creator":["FITZGERALD, GEO.

I cannot agree with M. Kronecker's statement that beyond three thousand metres mountain sickness attacks all persons as soon as they indulge in the least muscular effort, as I made the acquaintance of many people, mostly railway men, living and working at altitudes of fourteen or fifteen thousand feet on the Oroya line and the Southern Railway of Peru, who had never experienced soroche, or mountain sickness. As far as my own experience goes, in three journeys across the Andes and several mountain ascents, including one to the top of the crater of the Misti, 19,300 feet above sea level, I had only one attack of soroche, and that was at the end of a ride on an oil engine from sea level to fourteen thousand feet in nine hours. But this was so complicated with suffocation by the oil fumes and scorching by the heat of the furnace while running through the fifty-seven tunnels on the line, that I cannot say how much was mountain sickness and how much was not. At any rate, I was perfectly well the next morning, and rode over a pass nearly seventeen thousand feet high without the slightest inconvenience. As regards the danger of a prolonged sojourn, my experience teaches me that it is almost entirely due to personal idiosyncrasy and unwise eating and drinking. A healthy person whose lungs and heart are all right, who does not over-eat and is very moderate in the use of stimulants, will not suffer from mountain sickness after the first few hours, and in many cases will not suffer at all if the ascent is sufficiently gradual. Of course very violent exertion produces distress by reason of the deficiency of oxygen.

I cannot agree with M. Kronecker's statement that beyond three thousand metres mountain sickness attacks all persons as soon as they indulge in the least muscular effort, as I made the acquaintance of many people, mostly railway men, living and working at altitudes of fourteen or fifteen thousand feet on the Oroya line and the Southern Railway of Peru, who had never experienced soroche, or mountain sickness. As far as my own experience goes, in three journeys across the Andes and several mountain ascents, including one to the top of the crater of the Misti, 19,300 feet above sea level, I had only one attack of soroche, and that was at the end of a ride on an oil engine from sea level to fourteen thousand feet in nine hours. But this was so complicated with suffocation by the oil fumes and scorching by the heat of the furnace while running through the fifty-seven tunnels on the line, that I cannot say how much was mountain sickness and how much was not. At any rate, I was perfectly well the next morning, and rode over a pass nearly seventeen thousand feet high without the slightest inconvenience. As regards the danger of a prolonged sojourn, my experience teaches me that it is almost entirely due to personal idiosyncrasy and unwise eating and drinking. A healthy person whose lungs and heart are all right, who does not over-eat and is very moderate in the use of stimulants, will not suffer from mountain sickness after the first few hours, and in many cases will not suffer at all if the ascent is sufficiently gradual. Of course very violent exertion produces distress by reason of the deficiency of oxygen. I do not think that there need be any difficulty about the officials of the proposed Jungfrau railway, if steady men, not of a full habit of body, are selected. I never heard of any trouble from mountain sickness among the Peruvian railway men unless they over-stimulated, and yet they are accustomed to go in a day from sea level to 15,764 feet on the Oroya line, and to 14,666 feet on the Southern line, and return to sea level on the following day.

They can certainly be made to start from a portion of the kathode itself by shaping it so as to concentrate the kathodic discharges (or \u201cradiant matter\u201d) upon a prolongation of itself.","dc.creator":["THOMPSON, SILVANUS P."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["THOMPSON, SILVANUS P."],"citation_author_institution":["Finsbury Technical College,"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The R\u00f6ntgen Rays","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The R&#246;ntgen Rays&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"053461d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

To put this point to the test, Mr. MacGregor and I have polarimetrically examined two optically active compounds, ethylic dibenzoylglycerate and methylic acetylglycerate, interposing a Crookes' focus tube between the polarising Nicol and the column of active liquid; but although the discharge was maintained in both cases for three-quarters of an hour, there was not the slightest change in the rotation observable. To facilitate the passage of the rays, we employed a thin microscope cover-glass to close the polarimeter tube at the end nearest to the Crookes' tube, and that the rays were actually traversing the column of active liquid was demonstrated by obtaining a photographic effect at the other extremity of the tube, whilst the efficiency of the Crookes' tube was further proved by the favourite test of the skeletal photograph of a hand, which yielded an impression of great sharpness and exhibiting a most remarkable amount of detail. It would appear, therefore, that the R\u00f6ntgen rays either do not give rise to any ionisation at all, or that the concentration of the ions is so small as not to be detectable, by means of a sensitive polarimeter.

He says that \u201cAdmiral Makaroff considers that difference of density of the water is the primary, and, indeed I gather he thinks, the only cause of these opposing currents; but he brings no evidence beyond theoretical considerations in support of his belief\u201d; further, in his letter, Admiral Wharton refers particularly to the double current of the Bosporus, of which I spoke in my lecture at the Royal Society of Edinburgh. I cannot leave unnoticed remarks from so distinguished a hydrographer, who, during his long work, has contributed so much to the advance of science. My researches about the Bosporus are published only in Russian, in a book named \u201cOn exchange of water between Black Sea and Mediterranean\u201d (St. Petersburg, 1885). Should Admiral Wharton know my language, he would easily come to the conclusion that my opinion about double currents in the Bosporus are based upon the observations made in 1881 and 1882. I then invented an instrument for measuring the current at different depths, and gave the name of \u201cfluctometer\u201d to it. The instrument consists of a propeller revolving on a horizontal spindle. A bell is attached to the propeller, and at every revolution of the propeller it strikes twice. As water is a very good conductor of sound, the number of revolutions could be counted through the bottom of the ship (provided the ship is not sheeted with wood) at all depths to which the instrument was lowered (40 fathoms). I used to anchor in the middle of the Bosporus for a couple of days at a time, and make a series of observations every two hours. In order to obtain more detailed data, I used to take the samples of water from the same depth to which the fluctometer was lowered. Twice I used to go along the Bosporus from the Black Sea to the Marmora Sea in order to learn in what depth is the limit of two currents. In volume xxii. of the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Plate I. shows a position of the limit of two currents, mean velocity of both currents, and specific gravity of water.

He does not realise how utterly impossible it is in certain groups to assign limits to the variability of \u201cspecies,\u201d and it will never occur to him that two specimens superficially alike in all respects may quite possibly have been evolved along entirely different paths.","dc.creator":["PACE, S."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["PACE, S."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Collection of Material for the Study of...","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Collection of Material for the Study of...","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"063548b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

More than nine-tenths of these show more or less clearly in the upper valve the figure impressed upon the lower valve by the shell to which the latter adhered.","dc.creator":["DAY, ALFRED ELY"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["DAY, ALFRED ELY"],"citation_author_institution":["Syrian Protestant, College, Beirut, Syria"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Remarkable Fossil Oysters from Syria","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Remarkable Fossil Oysters from Syria&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"067009a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Of course, the sand can only be experimented upon when it has been uncovered by the sea for a sufficient length of time to enable it to become dry, and it gives remarkable results when tested in the ordinary way\u2014especially when placed in a china vessel and struck with a wooden plunger.","dc.creator":["CARUS-WILSON, CECIL"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["CARUS-WILSON, CECIL"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Musical Sands","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Musical Sands&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"068247a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It is meanwhile to be noted with regard to this, that the notion of force acting at a distance from point to point, being equal and reciprocal between the various material points, does not appear to be any better met by the manifestation of the unfailing energy of radium than the simple movements of the kinetic theory. This remark justifies attention being directed to a view of the natural physical forces presented by the present writer more than ten years ago (see Lagrange's \u201cStudy of the System of Physical Forces,\u201d forming vol. xlviii. of the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Belgium).

A force of repulsion is referred to here, emanating from the surface, and not from the centre of the mass of atoms, acting on opposed surfaces, and the varying intensity of which is nothing else than what is known to science as absolute temperature. That repulsive force, acting in the inverse ratio of the volume of matter (or of the cube of the distance), just as Newtonian gravitation acts in the inverse ratio of the surface (or as the square of the distance), takes its immediate development, and to some extent visible shape, in Mariotte's law of the relation of pressure to volume in gases. The memoir establishes the existence of a continuous interatomic medium of transcendental qualities not yet understood, conveying the effect of a force acting at the surface of atoms, and the real seat of luminous and electromagnetic wave motion, according to the views to which clearly Lord Kelvin has of late returned. The view now presented is entirely deduced from analysis of the actual facts, worked out at length, and justified by the memoir, and new so far as the case of the impossibility of an equilibrium due to the surface force of repulsion, which gives rise to an exhaustless emission of energy. The reflecting attention of physicists may therefore be legitimately directed to the subject, because it seems certain that the new properties which radium manifests are not explainable by the kinetic hypothesis, but, on the contrary, are of a nature henceforward to modify considerably the speculations of modern physics.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"68","prism.number":"1760","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"269","prism.endingPage":"269","prism.copyright":"1903 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/068269b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/068269b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/068269b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/068269b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Source of Radium Energy","citation_volume":"68","citation_issue":"1760","citation_publication_date":"1903/07","citation_firstpage":"269","citation_lastpage":"269","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/068269b0","DOI":"10.1038/068269b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/068269b0","description":"THE novel and unforeseen property of radium of producing energy, which purely kinetic theories, in opposition to the notion of inherent force as a transcendental element, do not seem able to explain, is perhaps destined to give a fresh impetus to discussion from the two distinct points of view.

I have shown that all the striking phenomena of the secondary kathode radiations are simply and completely explained on a neutral pair theory, but not on the older theory of ether pulses. Dr. Barkla refuses to consider this large body of evidence on the ground that it is well to deal with the simple and then proceed to the complex, and he would consider only the secondary X-rays. I grant this principle, of course, but I object entirely to the application which he makes of it. It is the \u03b3rays which give the simpler effects, and the hardest \u03b3rays which give the simplest, for the obvious reason that such rays ignore atomic structure altogether even in the case of the heaviest atoms. The X-rays are soft, and therefore atomic structure influences and complicates the effects to a remarkable degree, as Dr. Barkla's own work shows.

I have shown that all the striking phenomena of the secondary kathode radiations are simply and completely explained on a neutral pair theory, but not on the older theory of ether pulses. Dr. Barkla refuses to consider this large body of evidence on the ground that it is well to deal with the simple and then proceed to the complex, and he would consider only the secondary X-rays. I grant this principle, of course, but I object entirely to the application which he makes of it. It is the \u03b3rays which give the simpler effects, and the hardest \u03b3rays which give the simplest, for the obvious reason that such rays ignore atomic structure altogether even in the case of the heaviest atoms. The X-rays are soft, and therefore atomic structure influences and complicates the effects to a remarkable degree, as Dr. Barkla's own work shows. A true application of the principle would lead us to work out the laws of the hard \u03b3rays first, and then to consider the X-rays in the light of the knowledge we have obtained. This is what I have tried to do. The \u03b3rays suggest a corpuscular hypothesis, and on turning to the X-rays it is at once clear that a large proportion of the effects which they show may also be simply explained on the same hypothesis.","dc.creator":["BRAGG, W.

It may perhaps be worth while to point out that this statement has no foundation in fact. It was first made in 1895 by Dr. G. W. M\u00fcller (Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool. Harvard, xxvii., p. 165), who quotes a passage from the \u201cChallenger-Briefe\u201d of R. v. Willemoes Suhm (Zeitschr. wiss. Zool., xxiv., p. 13, 1874), where it is stated that the Challenger dredged between Prince Edward Island and the Crozets a fragmentary specimen of a gigantic Ostracod. Dr. M\u00fcller suggests that this may have been a Gigantocypris, and he continues:\u2014\u201cLeider fehlen n\u00e4here Angaben \u00fcber das Thier, und in den Challengerostracoden ist es nicht erw\u00e4hnt\u201d.

Long before M\u00fcller conjectured that it might be a Gigantocypris, Prof. G. O. Sars had described and figured it as one of the two co-types of the remarkable phyllocarid crustacean Nebaliopsis typica (Rep. Phyllocarida Challenger, p. 22, 1887). Prof. Sars says:\u2014\u201cIt is apparently this form that was mentioned by the late Dr. v. Willemoes Suhm in a letter to Prof. v. Siebold as a gigantic Ostracode. This strange mistake may be readily explained by the incompleteness of the first specimen obtained, of which only the carapace and a small fragment of the body was brought up in the dredge\u201d. The statement might have been made still more emphatic. The description and the dimensions given by Willemoes Suhm, as well as the locality, put it beyond doubt that he was speaking of the identical specimen which is figured on Plate III., Fig. 5, of Prof. Sars's report.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"80","prism.number":"2061","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"248","prism.endingPage":"248","prism.copyright":"1909 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/080248a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/080248a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/080248a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/080248a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Gigantocypris and the \u201cChallenger\u201d","citation_volume":"80","citation_issue":"2061","citation_publication_date":"1909/04","citation_firstpage":"248","citation_lastpage":"248","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/080248a0","DOI":"10.1038/080248a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/080248a0","description":"THE writer of the note on \u201cSome Marine and Freshwater Organisms\u201d (NATURE, April 8) quotes from Herr L\u00fcders (Zeitschr. wiss.

DEAR PROF. HERDMAN, Just a line to tell you that the journey is accomplished with results which I hope will prove to be quite successful. I learned just what I wanted to learn and a good deal more besides. The route was a particularly interesting one; it showed me more of the transition zone between the littoral desert and the plateau than I had expected, and it gave me a good insight into the relations between the Damaraland and Nama-qualand floras. It has connected up the results of my previous journeys, and I can now tackle my general summary much more satisfactorily than I could have done before. The journey itself was in some respects the most difficult I haye ever done. Along the edge of the desert the road disappeared entirely, and we got entangled in the ravines of a peculiarly awkward range of mountains. On December 31 we spent five hours in. advancing considerably less than a mile. Both the wagons broke down, one of them twice within half an hour and in a vital part. But for the extraordinary skill of the two Hottentot drivers we should never have got them both through. Darkness found us in a dangerous river-bed, in which, in defiance of all the laws of good trekking, we had to spend the night-and a sleepless one so far as I was concerned. However, the new year was kinder, and although we broke down again in later stages of the journey, I had the satisfaction of taking everything safely into Windhoek except two of my thirty donkeys. One of these died on the road; the other I left in a weak condition with one of our military outposts, and it eventually recovered. Our troubles were due primarily to a bad mistake in the German maps, and to the fact that for 120 miles the country was absolutely without inhabitants, white or black. . . . I passed through the semi-independent territory of the Bastard Hottentots. No German dare venture into it, but when these people found I was English they could not do enough for me. The chief sent his son with me for thirty miles to make sure that I regained the trunk road lost through the mistake mentioned above. They and all the natives through out the country are profoundly thankful that the German r\u00e9gime is over\u2014and they have good reason to be.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"97","prism.number":"2418","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"4","prism.endingPage":"4","prism.copyright":"1916 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/097004c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/097004c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/097004c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/097004c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Exploration in South-West Africa","citation_volume":"97","citation_issue":"2418","citation_publication_date":"1916/03","citation_firstpage":"4","citation_lastpage":"4","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/097004c0","DOI":"10.1038/097004c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/097004c0","description":"PROF.

DEAR PROF. HERDMAN, Just a line to tell you that the journey is accomplished with results which I hope will prove to be quite successful. I learned just what I wanted to learn and a good deal more besides. The route was a particularly interesting one; it showed me more of the transition zone between the littoral desert and the plateau than I had expected, and it gave me a good insight into the relations between the Damaraland and Nama-qualand floras. It has connected up the results of my previous journeys, and I can now tackle my general summary much more satisfactorily than I could have done before. The journey itself was in some respects the most difficult I haye ever done. Along the edge of the desert the road disappeared entirely, and we got entangled in the ravines of a peculiarly awkward range of mountains. On December 31 we spent five hours in. advancing considerably less than a mile. Both the wagons broke down, one of them twice within half an hour and in a vital part. But for the extraordinary skill of the two Hottentot drivers we should never have got them both through. Darkness found us in a dangerous river-bed, in which, in defiance of all the laws of good trekking, we had to spend the night-and a sleepless one so far as I was concerned. However, the new year was kinder, and although we broke down again in later stages of the journey, I had the satisfaction of taking everything safely into Windhoek except two of my thirty donkeys. One of these died on the road; the other I left in a weak condition with one of our military outposts, and it eventually recovered. Our troubles were due primarily to a bad mistake in the German maps, and to the fact that for 120 miles the country was absolutely without inhabitants, white or black. . . . I passed through the semi-independent territory of the Bastard Hottentots. No German dare venture into it, but when these people found I was English they could not do enough for me. The chief sent his son with me for thirty miles to make sure that I regained the trunk road lost through the mistake mentioned above. They and all the natives through out the country are profoundly thankful that the German r\u00e9gime is over\u2014and they have good reason to be.","dc.creator":["HERDMAN, W. A.","PEARSON, H. H.

Gu\u00e9guen in Comtes rendus, vol. clix. (1914), p. 781, Sur l'alt\u00e9ration dite piq\u00fbre des toiles de tente et des toiles \u00e0 voile. The spots are caused by fungi which damage the fabric, so that after some months it is easily torn. The fungus hyph\u00e6 grow on the surface of the fabric, between the fibres and within the lumen of the fibres. Gu\u00e8guen found that the fungi principally concerned were the Pyrenomycetes, Pleospora infectoria and P. herbarum, especially the former. These Ascomycetes are also found in their conidial states, Alternaria tenuis and Macrosporium commune, and other Mucedine\u00e6, Rhinocladium, Helminthosporium, etc., are often associated with them. According to Gu\u00e9guen, the malady is scarcely ever due to accidental contamination, but is caused by the development, in moist warmth, of moulds already present in the newly manufactured fabric, commercial patterns of the most diverse origin being found almost all to contain fungus spores. Practically all unbleached canvas is affected, but that bleached with hypochlorites, etc., remains freethe glaucous colonies which are sometimes seen are due to Penicillium or Aspergillus derived from the air, and almost invariably non-injurious to the fabric. Gu\u00e9guen holds that the fungi causing the spots ate those which grow on the dead stems of the textile plant, which are introduced amongst the fibres at the time of retting. The thick-walled hyph\u00e6 remain in a resting state in the dry canvas, and resume vegetative growth when external conditions become again favourable (humidity, warm confined air).

Gu\u00e9guen in Comtes rendus, vol. clix. (1914), p. 781, Sur l'alt\u00e9ration dite piq\u00fbre des toiles de tente et des toiles \u00e0 voile. The spots are caused by fungi which damage the fabric, so that after some months it is easily torn. The fungus hyph\u00e6 grow on the surface of the fabric, between the fibres and within the lumen of the fibres. Gu\u00e8guen found that the fungi principally concerned were the Pyrenomycetes, Pleospora infectoria and P. herbarum, especially the former. These Ascomycetes are also found in their conidial states, Alternaria tenuis and Macrosporium commune, and other Mucedine\u00e6, Rhinocladium, Helminthosporium, etc., are often associated with them. According to Gu\u00e9guen, the malady is scarcely ever due to accidental contamination, but is caused by the development, in moist warmth, of moulds already present in the newly manufactured fabric, commercial patterns of the most diverse origin being found almost all to contain fungus spores. Practically all unbleached canvas is affected, but that bleached with hypochlorites, etc., remains freethe glaucous colonies which are sometimes seen are due to Penicillium or Aspergillus derived from the air, and almost invariably non-injurious to the fabric. Gu\u00e9guen holds that the fungi causing the spots ate those which grow on the dead stems of the textile plant, which are introduced amongst the fibres at the time of retting. The thick-walled hyph\u00e6 remain in a resting state in the dry canvas, and resume vegetative growth when external conditions become again favourable (humidity, warm confined air). He considers that the best method of prevention would be to sterilise the tow after retting, by heatsteam under pressure, and then dry heat. Boiling solutions of salts of chromium or copper would also serve, applied either to the tow or the fabric. A suitable method of rendering awnings, etc., impermeable would be to immerse the fabric first in a 20 per cent. solution of soap, and then in 8 per cent. copper sulphate, each at boiling point.","dc.creator":["RAMSBOTTOM, J."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["RAMSBOTTOM, J."],"citation_author_institution":["Department of Botany, British Museum (Nat.

At the end of the paper it is shown that a periodic surface velocity with a maximum of 2 ft. per second all over the ocean, with a viscosity of 1.4 \u00d7 10-5 ft..2/sec., would account for a retardation of the earth's rotation of amount 4 of arc per century per century. Now it is easy to find from equations (II) on p. 303 of Lamb's Hydrodynamic's that the surface velocity in mid-ocean for a tide of height 2 ft. is only of order 0.04 ft. per second; on the other hand, the effective viscosity is very much increased on account of turbulence.

More recent theoretical studies9,10,11,12 have emphasized the role played by deterministic chaos, although many experimental studies1,5,6,7,8,13,14 were performed before the development of such ideas.

The measured ratio of ATP consumption rate to stepping rate is invariant over a wide range of ATP concentration, suggesting that the 1 ATP to 8 nm coupling inferred from behaviour at low ATP can be generalized to high ATP.","dc.creator":["Hua, Wei","Young, Edgar C.","Fleming, Margaret L.","Gelles, Jeff"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=Variations on the theme of movement.; citation_author=EW Taylor; citation_volume=361; citation_publication_date=1993; citation_pages=115-116; citation_doi=10.1038/361115a0; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Biochem.

The unique features of this dual-engagement pathway should facilitate the development of therapies that specifically target autoreactive B cells.","dc.creator":["Leadbetter, Elizabeth A.","Rifkin, Ian R.","Hohlbaum, Andreas M.","Beaudette, Britte C.","Shlomchik, Mark J.","Marshak-Rothstein, Ann"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Adv.

They produce regular clustering of the energy levels6 and certain states exhibit regions of enhanced probability density or \u2018scars\u2019 in the neighbourhood of the classical periodic trajectories2.

We demonstrate that this non-apoptotic cell death is mediated by autophagy, which can be suppressed by chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, and by specific knockdown of autophagy-related gene-5 (Atg5) and Atg7. Avicin D decreases cellular ATP levels, stimulates the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and S6 kinase activity. Suppression of AMPK by compound C and dominant-negative AMPK decreases avicin D-induced autophagic cell death. Furthermore, avicin D-induced autophagic cell death can be abrogated by knockdown of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), a key mediator linking AMPK to mTOR inhibition, suggesting that AMPK activation is a crucial event targeted by avicin D.

Last week's Nature cover featured a fossil that marked a world-changing event, the development of limbed vertebrates from finned fish. A glimpse of how that may have led to the \u2018conquering of the land\u2019 now comes from an unexpected source: the eel-catfish found in the muddy swamps of tropical Africa. It has the remarkable ability to forage and capture prey on land. This animal's capacity to bend its head downwards when feeding seems to be the secret of its adaptability. An important step towards understanding the evolution of terrestriality in vertebrates is to identify how the aquatic ancestors of tetrapods were able to access ground-based prey.

This has important consequences for electrical properties of these materials: charge transport is usually limited by the most difficult hopping processes and is therefore dominated by the disordered matrix, resulting in low charge-carrier mobilities2 (\u2a7d10-5\u2009cm2\u2009V-1\u2009s-1). Here we use thin-film, field-effect transistor structures to probe the transport properties of the ordered microcrystalline domains in the conjugated polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT. Self-organization in P3HT results in a lamella structure with two-dimensional conjugated sheets formed by interchain stacking.

This has important consequences for electrical properties of these materials: charge transport is usually limited by the most difficult hopping processes and is therefore dominated by the disordered matrix, resulting in low charge-carrier mobilities2 (\u2a7d10-5\u2009cm2\u2009V-1\u2009s-1). Here we use thin-film, field-effect transistor structures to probe the transport properties of the ordered microcrystalline domains in the conjugated polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT. Self-organization in P3HT results in a lamella structure with two-dimensional conjugated sheets formed by interchain stacking. We find that, depending on processing conditions, the lamellae can adopt two different orientations\u2014parallel and normal to the substrate\u2014the mobilities of which differ by more than a factor of 100, and can reach values as high as 0.1\u2009cm2\u2009V-1\u2009s-1 (refs 3, 4).

A key player in 3\u2032 splice site definition is the essential heterodimeric splicing factor U2AF, which facilitates the interaction of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle with the branch point. The U2AF subunit with a relative molecular mass (Mr 65K) of 65,000 (U2AF65) binds to the poly(Y) tract3,4,5,6,7, whereas the role of the 35K subunit (U2AF35)8 has not been clearly defined. It is not required for splicing in vitro4 but it plays a critical role in vivo9,10. Caenorhabiditis elegans introns have a highly conserved U4CAG/R at their 3\u2032 splice sites instead of branch-point and poly(Y) consensus sequences11. Nevertheless, C. elegans has U2AF (refs 10, 12). Here we show that both U2AF subunits crosslink to the 3\u2032 splice site. Our results suggest that the U2AF65\u2013U2AF35 complex identifies the U4CAG/R, with U2AF35 being responsible for recognition of the canonical AG.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"402","prism.number":"6763","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"835","prism.endingPage":"838","prism.copyright":"1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltd.","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/45597","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/45597","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/45597.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/45597","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Both subunits of U2AF recognize the 3\u2032 splice site in Caenorhabditis elegans","citation_volume":"402","citation_issue":"6763","citation_publication_date":"1999/12","citation_firstpage":"835","citation_lastpage":"838","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/45597","DOI":"10.1038/45597","citation_doi":"10.1038/45597","description":"Introns are defined by sequences that bind components of the splicing machinery.

The U2AF subunit with a relative molecular mass (Mr 65K) of 65,000 (U2AF65) binds to the poly(Y) tract3,4,5,6,7, whereas the role of the 35K subunit (U2AF35)8 has not been clearly defined. It is not required for splicing in vitro4 but it plays a critical role in vivo9,10. Caenorhabiditis elegans introns have a highly conserved U4CAG/R at their 3\u2032 splice sites instead of branch-point and poly(Y) consensus sequences11. Nevertheless, C. elegans has U2AF (refs 10, 12). Here we show that both U2AF subunits crosslink to the 3\u2032 splice site. Our results suggest that the U2AF65\u2013U2AF35 complex identifies the U4CAG/R, with U2AF35 being responsible for recognition of the canonical AG.","dc.creator":["Zorio, Diego A.

Indeed, loci involved in local adaptations should show high FST values, whereas loci under balancing selection should rather show low FST values. Most tests of selection based on FST use a null distribution generated under a simple island model of population differentiation. Although this model has been shown to be robust, many species have a more complex genetic structure, with some populations sharing a recent ancestry or due to the presence of barriers to gene flow between different parts of a species range. In this paper, we propose the use of a hierarchical island model, in which demes exchange more migrants within groups than between groups, to generate the joint distribution of genetic diversity within and between populations. We show that tests not accounting for a hierarchical structure, when it exists, do generate a large excess of false positive loci, whereas the hierarchical island model is robust to uncertainties about the exact number of groups and demes per group in the system. Our approach also explicitly takes into account the mutational process, and does not just rely on allele frequencies, which is important for short tandem repeat (STR) data. An application to human and stickleback STR data sets reveals a much lower number of significant loci than previously obtained under a non-hierarchical model.

Thus, promoter methylation analysis (MA) has been established as an important tool in cancer research and diagnostics. Here we present MethyQESD (methylation-quantification of endonuclease-resistant DNA) as a fast, easy, precise and reliable method for quantitative MA without the need of bisulfite-treatment or fluorescent probes. Though MethyQESD principally works with any gene promoter we established MethyQESD for the mismatch repair gene MLH1 and tested its utility to differentiate between sporadic microsatellite unstable (MSI-H) colorectal cancer and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) by quantitative MLH1 MA. We investigated formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue samples from a previously published, well-characterized tumor collective comprising 25 HNPCC, 14 sporadic MSI-H CRC and 16 sporadic microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC. We found a high accuracy of MethyQESD by spiking experiments with dilution series of methylated (SW48 cancer cell line) and unmethylated (blood) DNA (Pearson's r=0.9997 (proximal MLH1 promoter region), r=0.9976 (distal MLH1 promoter region)). MethyQESD and conventional quantitative MA using of 96 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded CRC showed a high degree of concordance of both methods (Pearson's r=0.885). HNPCC tumors showed either null MLH1 methylation or a significantly lower degree of MLH1 methylation than sporadic MSI-H CRC (P<0.001). MLH1 methylation was negative in all MSS tumors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses defined a cutoff value of 16.5% MLH1 methylation for specific and sensitive identification of sporadic MSI-H CRC (area under ROC curve: 1.000; asymptotic significance: P<0.001). Thus, quantitative MLH1 MA by MethyQESD provides a simple, fast and valuable tool to identify HNPCC candidates. Furthermore, MethyQESD works reliably with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and simplifies DNA MA both for research and diagnostic purposes.","prism.publicationName":"Laboratory Investigation","prism.publicationDate":"2008-10-20","prism.volume":"88","prism.number":"12","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"1367","prism.endingPage":"1375","prism.copyright":"2008 United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc.","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/labinvest2008100","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/labinvest.2008.100","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/labinvest2008100.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/labinvest2008100","citation_journal_title":"Laboratory Investigation","citation_journal_abbrev":"Lab Invest","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1530-0307","citation_title":"MethyQESD, a robust and fast method for quantitative methylation analyses in HNPCC diagnostics using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue samples","citation_volume":"88","citation_issue":"12","citation_publication_date":"2008/12","citation_online_date":"2008/10/20","citation_firstpage":"1367","citation_lastpage":"1375","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/labinvest.2008.100","DOI":"10.1038/labinvest.2008.100","citation_doi":"10.1038/labinvest.2008.100","description":"Promoter hypermethylation occurs in various tumors and leads to silencing of tumor-relevant genes.

This lightweight and field-portable biosensing device, weighing 60 g and 7.5\u00a0cm tall, utilizes a compact optoelectronic sensor array to record the diffraction patterns of plasmonic nanostructures under uniform illumination by a single-light emitting diode tuned to the plasmonic mode of the nanoapertures. Employing a sensitive plasmonic array design that is combined with lens-free computational imaging, we demonstrate label-free and quantitative detection of biomolecules with a protein layer thickness down to 3\u00a0nm. Integrating large-scale plasmonic microarrays, our on-chip imaging platform enables simultaneous detection of protein mono- and bilayers on the same platform over a wide range of biomolecule concentrations. In this handheld device, we also employ an iterative phase retrieval-based image reconstruction method, which offers the ability to digitally image a highly multiplexed array of sensors on the same plasmonic chip, making this approach especially suitable for high-throughput diagnostic applications in field settings. A handheld biosensor that employs lens-free imaging on a plasmonic chip could simplify high-throughput protein detection. The device, developed by Arif Cetin and co-workers at Boston University and the University of California at Los Angeles in the USA, promises label-free quantitative detection of large variety of proteins on the same sensor chip. The unit, which is battery-powered, 7.5 cm tall and just 60 g in weight, operates by transmitting light from an LED through a functionalized plasmonic chip containing an array of periodic nanoholes in a gold film. The diffraction pattern of the nanoapertures is recorded by a CMOS image sensor. The presence of a protein monolayer as thin as 3 nm that binds to the plasmonic chip induces a dramatic change in the diffraction pattern sampled by the image sensor chip.","prism.publicationName":"Light: Science & Applications","prism.publicationDate":"2014-01-03","prism.volume":"3","prism.number":"1","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"e122","prism.endingPage":"e122","prism.copyright":"2014 The Author(s)","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa20143","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2014.3","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa20143.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa20143","citation_journal_title":"Light: Science & Applications","citation_journal_abbrev":"Light Sci Appl","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"2047-7538","citation_title":"Handheld high-throughput plasmonic biosensor using computational on-chip imaging","citation_volume":"3","citation_issue":"1","citation_publication_date":"2014/01","citation_online_date":"2014/01/03","citation_firstpage":"e122","citation_lastpage":"e122","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2014.3","DOI":"10.1038/lsa.2014.3","citation_doi":"10.1038/lsa.2014.3","description":"We demonstrate a handheld on-chip biosensing technology that employs plasmonic microarrays coupled with a lens-free computational imaging system towards multiplexed and high-throughput screening of biomolecular interactions for point-of-care applications and resource-limited settings.

Using this platform, we quantified the 3D locomotion of 2133 bovine sperms and determined the spin axis and the angular velocity of the sperm head, providing the perspective of an observer seated at the moving and spinning sperm head. In this constantly transforming perspective, flagellum-beating patterns are decoupled from both the 3D translation and spin of the head, which provides the opportunity to truly investigate the 3D spatio-temporal kinematics of the flagellum. In addition to providing unprecedented information on the 3D locomotion of microswimmers, this computational imaging technique could also be instrumental for micro-robotics and sensing research, enabling the high-throughput quantification of the impact of various stimuli and chemicals on the 3D swimming patterns of sperms, motile bacteria and other micro-organisms, generating new insights into taxis behaviors and the underlying biophysics. A label-free imaging system that can image the swimming behaviour of thousands of sperm cells has been developed by a team in the U.S. Conventional lens-based microscopy systems have been used to explore sperm motion in two dimensions, but they are not effective at imaging microswimmer motion in three dimensions.
