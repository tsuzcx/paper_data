To this I was disposed to refer the softening of the cervical spinal cord, which struck me when removing the brain.

The paraplegia had been progressive, and at the date of my visit, respiration was markedly thoracic. The animal was excited, but I could not satisfy myself whether this indicated cerebral disturbance or arose from the contagion of fear, a younger specimen in the same cage being much alarmed at my approach. The animal died at some distance from Glasgow. I made a careful post-mortem, and found no lesion save in the spinal cord and medulla oblongata. The removal of the cord was difficult, on account of the thickening of the membranes, and their adhesion to the bony walls of the canal. The cord was not merely softened; it was semifluid as far up as the origin of the cervical plexus, and welled out like thick cream from an accidental puncture of the sheath. Dr. Joseph Coats who assisted me in the examination, failed to detect any fatty degeneration of the nervous tissue. Its disintegration was, however, very complete. The other organs were healthy, and the body was well nourished. The disease was manifestly of short duration, and I can only hazard this conjecture as to its cause, that the cage was placed at the angle of the square formed by the cars, and that its inmates were thus exposed to draughts and damp, giving rise to acute meningitis.

The phenomenon in question consisted of a number of parallel streamers of light rising vertically and situated from the observer in a north-westerly direction. That pottion of the sky occupied by these streamers would be about twenty-five degrees square, its lowest portion being about fifteen degrees above the horizon. At the time of the appearance the sun was obscured by a small but very dense cloud. Large masses of nimbus clouds occupied almost the whole of the north-western, northern, and north-eastern portion of the sky, whilst a few cumulus and cirro-cumulus clouds were visible in the eastern and southern parts of the heavens; one-twentieth part perhaps of the whole sky being apparently free from cloud. The streamers, which, like those ot the Aurora, were intermittent in intensity, contrasted greatly in direction with any proximate beams of the sun. The whole thing, however, I am strongly of opinion, was nothing more than a meteorological phenomenon of a very different nature from the Aurora; in short, I believe it was an unusual appearance attendant on a distant and somewhat singularly circumstanced rainfall. Immediately above the uppermost boundary of the space occupied by the streamers there was a large nimbus cloud entirely obscured from the sun's direct rays, whilst that part of the sky occupied by the streamers themselves was in a strong sunshine. The whole phenomenon lasted about half an hour, and my opinion that it was but an unusual aspect of a distant rainfall was strengthened by the fact of a heavy shower of rain descending immediately alter ihe disappearance of the streamers, the upper-current of the air being from the west by north.

Auroras are very rare in this latitude, but we have had four or five displays in fifteen months: one so bright as to excite the alarm of fire, and to call out the fire department.","dc.creator":["BLACKIE, GEORGE S."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["BLACKIE, GEORGE S."],"citation_author_institution":["Nashville, U.S.A."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"[Letters to Editor]","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;[Letters to Editor]&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"005422c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

R. A. PROCTOR'S paper on \u201cSaturn and the Sabbath of the Jews,\u201d in the Contemporary Review of this month, reopens one of the oldest and most interesting questions in the history of astronomy. Unfortunately, the writer is very imperfectly acquainted with the literature of his subject, and in consequence has, I think, imported not a little confusion into the discussion. That the week of seven days is directly connected with the worship of the seven planets known to the ancients, is a theory which has always had many supporters. It is at once suggested by the familiar names of the seven days, and would be absolutely proved if we could show that these names are as old as the division of the lunar month into four weeks. Again, it is also a well-known, though less wide-spread doctrine, that the Jewish Sabbath passed into Mosaism from an earlier planetary religion. Of course, if it can be shown that the Sabbath was originally sacred to Saturn, we have a strong proof of the antiquity of the names of the week-days, and a probability that these names are as old as the seven day week itself. In this way a question in the history of Semitic religions comes to have an important bearing on a question in the history of astronomy. Mr. Proctor reverses the argument. He assumes that we have the clearest possible evidence that all nations that adopted the seven day week named the days after the planets, and did so in that peculiar order which is generally explained by assuming that a new planet presides over every successive hour of the week, and that each day takes the name of the planet of its first hour. It is then argued that Saturn, as the highest planet, was the supreme god of Assyria, and so also of the Egyptians who received their astrological lore from Chaldea. The Egyptians, we are told, certainly consecrated the seventh day of the week to Saturn, and since the Israelites left Egypt observing the Sabbath, while there is no evidence of a Sabbath in patriarchal times, \u201cit is presumable that this day was a day of rest in Egypt.\u201d Now, whatever may be the ultimate solution of the problem of the origin and diffusion of the seven-day week, this theory rests partly on uncertain assumptions, partly on undoubted blunders. It is notorious that several Semitic nations, not to speak of the Peruvians, had a seven-day week without planetary names; so that Mr. Proctor's fundamental assumption begs the whole question. Then, again, it is the opinion of so great an authority as Lepsius that the Egyptians had no seven-day week, but divided the month into three decades. The passage of Dion Cassius from which the contrary opinion is drawn is certainly not decisive for ancient Egyptian usage, and Mr. Proctor seems to quote his author at second hand; for he asserts, in flat contradiction to Dion, that when the latter wrote, neither Greeks nor Romans used the week. For the supposition that Saturn was the supreme god of the Egyptians, not a shadow of proof is offered, while what is said of the Assyrian Saturn is directly in the teeth of the most recent researches. If Mr. Proctor had read Schrader's essay on the Babylonian origin of the week, he would have known that Adar or Saturn is quite distinct from the supreme god Asur. Thus, apart from the late and doubtful testimony of Dion, Mr. Proctor has no other evidence for his Egyptian theory of the week than that which he derives from the presumed non-existence of the Sabbath among the Hebrews before they entered Egypt. But the seven-day week appears in the narrative of the flood, which is certainly not an Egyptian legend. I say nothing of numerous minor inaccuracies in Mr. Proctor's paper, but repeat that the point on which new light requires to be thrown is whether it can be made out that the names of the seven days are as old as the week itself. This again seems to depend partly on the question whether the division of the day into twenty-four hours is older than the week, and partly on what can be determined as to early Egyptian and Chaldean subdivisions of the month. The Egyptians had a day of twenty-four hours, but had they a week? The Chaldeans may have had the week, but they seem to have divided the day (including the night) into twelve hours. Perhaps, however, it ought to be borne in mind that Dion gives another way of accounting for the names of the day, depending not on the division of the day into hours, but on the analogy of musical harmony . The Jewish Sabbath can contribute little to the argument unless one is prepared with Lagarde to maintain that Shabbat is a name of Saturn.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"11","prism.number":"280","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"363","prism.endingPage":"363","prism.copyright":"1875 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/011363b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/011363b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/011363b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/011363b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Origin of the Jewish Week","citation_volume":"11","citation_issue":"280","citation_publication_date":"1875/03","citation_firstpage":"363","citation_lastpage":"363","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/011363b0","DOI":"10.1038/011363b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/011363b0","description":"MR.

He assumes that we have the clearest possible evidence that all nations that adopted the seven day week named the days after the planets, and did so in that peculiar order which is generally explained by assuming that a new planet presides over every successive hour of the week, and that each day takes the name of the planet of its first hour. It is then argued that Saturn, as the highest planet, was the supreme god of Assyria, and so also of the Egyptians who received their astrological lore from Chaldea. The Egyptians, we are told, certainly consecrated the seventh day of the week to Saturn, and since the Israelites left Egypt observing the Sabbath, while there is no evidence of a Sabbath in patriarchal times, \u201cit is presumable that this day was a day of rest in Egypt.\u201d Now, whatever may be the ultimate solution of the problem of the origin and diffusion of the seven-day week, this theory rests partly on uncertain assumptions, partly on undoubted blunders. It is notorious that several Semitic nations, not to speak of the Peruvians, had a seven-day week without planetary names; so that Mr. Proctor's fundamental assumption begs the whole question. Then, again, it is the opinion of so great an authority as Lepsius that the Egyptians had no seven-day week, but divided the month into three decades. The passage of Dion Cassius from which the contrary opinion is drawn is certainly not decisive for ancient Egyptian usage, and Mr. Proctor seems to quote his author at second hand; for he asserts, in flat contradiction to Dion, that when the latter wrote, neither Greeks nor Romans used the week. For the supposition that Saturn was the supreme god of the Egyptians, not a shadow of proof is offered, while what is said of the Assyrian Saturn is directly in the teeth of the most recent researches. If Mr. Proctor had read Schrader's essay on the Babylonian origin of the week, he would have known that Adar or Saturn is quite distinct from the supreme god Asur. Thus, apart from the late and doubtful testimony of Dion, Mr. Proctor has no other evidence for his Egyptian theory of the week than that which he derives from the presumed non-existence of the Sabbath among the Hebrews before they entered Egypt. But the seven-day week appears in the narrative of the flood, which is certainly not an Egyptian legend. I say nothing of numerous minor inaccuracies in Mr. Proctor's paper, but repeat that the point on which new light requires to be thrown is whether it can be made out that the names of the seven days are as old as the week itself. This again seems to depend partly on the question whether the division of the day into twenty-four hours is older than the week, and partly on what can be determined as to early Egyptian and Chaldean subdivisions of the month. The Egyptians had a day of twenty-four hours, but had they a week? The Chaldeans may have had the week, but they seem to have divided the day (including the night) into twelve hours. Perhaps, however, it ought to be borne in mind that Dion gives another way of accounting for the names of the day, depending not on the division of the day into hours, but on the analogy of musical harmony . The Jewish Sabbath can contribute little to the argument unless one is prepared with Lagarde to maintain that Shabbat is a name of Saturn.","dc.creator":["SMITH, W.

As the casting was a simple one, it was accomplished very quickly, and as the contents of the huge fourton ladle were emptied into the mould, the dazzling stream of the metal flowed in a large volume over its lip. Brilliantly glossy it appeared as it broke through the folds of thin dross with which its surface was encrusted; and this it did at the lip of the vessel, while fold after fold of the encrusting pellicle was swept down the stream, and left behind it a straight or ragged edge of the thin film, from underneath which the metal welled out for a moment with an appearance on the surface of perfectly transparent purity. The appearance was a deception arising from the strong bluish-green colour of the light emitted by the pure surface of the metal, which I have never seen exhibited under similar circumstances by melted iron or steel. It extended also for only a short distance from the encrusting edge, the green colour soon passing into white, or paler green, where exposure to the air enveloped the metal again in a rapidly increasing film of oxides that tarnish its surface and render the stream white, or nearly so, in every part, excepting in a bluish-green ring, or border where the fresh metal made its appearance, and flowed over in a beautifully coloured stream from the mouth of the ladle. The strongest patches of the colour there were transient, the film of oxide apparently soon thickening enough to eclipse it, and by connecting itself to the broken edge of the thin film in the pot to tear away another fold, when the characteristic greenish glow of the metal immediately presented itself along the freshly-broken edge. I had watched and thus interpreted this beautifully varied play of natural colours in the molten stream for some time before it occurred to me that the peculiar hue of the freshly-exposed surface of the metal, glowing as it does with the brightness of what in the black film of oxide appears as white heat, is no other than the very colour of the heated metal which the theory of exchanges would lead us to expect. For as the colour of gun-metal in a cold state is yellow, the selective absorption of its surface in that condition must be exercised chiefly upon rays occupying the blue portion of the spectrum, and consequently in the heated state these rays are emitted in excess; or if the heat is sufficiently intense to produce them largely, as in the melted metal, where the thin films of oxide on its surface glow with perfect whiteness, the metal itself must shine with bluish, or it may be with geeenish-blue light, if the heat is only high enough to make the excess of green rays very strongly visible. If this should be, as I suppose, the real explanation of the very curious appearance of depth of a certain tint of colour, contrasting strongly in some parts of the melted stream by its greenish hue with the surrounding redder lights, according as the natural tinted appearance of the vivid metal is effaced or diluted by the floating films of white-hot oxides in lines and parts of the stream depending on the surface-flow, and suggesting in some degree the idea of a transparent cascade, and even from its colour of a waterfall, the process often repeated in large foundries of running gun-metal into large castings presents an instance of well-defined action of the law of exchanges which must be constantly witnessed and noted inquiringly by daily observers, and which certainly presents, if a different and more natural explanation can be given of its origin, to eyes unaccustomed and unprepared to receive it, a somewhat surprising and otherwise unaccountable appearance. In gun-metal, when the proportion of zinc introduced is very small, the coating of the melted surface by copper oxide is comparatively slow, and in melted brass it might not be possible, from the rapid oxidation of zinc upon the surface, successfully to observe the same phenomenon. In order to render melted copper fluid enough for casting, a small proportion of alloy sufficient to give it almost the colour of brass is required to be mixed with it, and large pourings of the pure metal cannot commonly be made; but perhaps in small castings of this metal, and probably also in those of gold, opportunities would present themselves similar to that which I have here attempted to describe, of verifying the same general law of radiation connecting together the qualities of luminosity and absorption in the surfaces of highly coloured metals.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"12","prism.number":"309","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"475","prism.endingPage":"476","prism.copyright":"1875 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/012475b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/012475b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/012475b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/012475b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Colours of Heated Metals","citation_volume":"12","citation_issue":"309","citation_publication_date":"1875/09","citation_firstpage":"475","citation_lastpage":"476","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/012475b0","DOI":"10.1038/012475b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/012475b0","description":"I HAVE just watched the casting in gun-metal, in an engineering establishment in this town, of what is intended to be the rudder-post of a large vessel, which when completed will weigh about three tons.

For as the colour of gun-metal in a cold state is yellow, the selective absorption of its surface in that condition must be exercised chiefly upon rays occupying the blue portion of the spectrum, and consequently in the heated state these rays are emitted in excess; or if the heat is sufficiently intense to produce them largely, as in the melted metal, where the thin films of oxide on its surface glow with perfect whiteness, the metal itself must shine with bluish, or it may be with geeenish-blue light, if the heat is only high enough to make the excess of green rays very strongly visible. If this should be, as I suppose, the real explanation of the very curious appearance of depth of a certain tint of colour, contrasting strongly in some parts of the melted stream by its greenish hue with the surrounding redder lights, according as the natural tinted appearance of the vivid metal is effaced or diluted by the floating films of white-hot oxides in lines and parts of the stream depending on the surface-flow, and suggesting in some degree the idea of a transparent cascade, and even from its colour of a waterfall, the process often repeated in large foundries of running gun-metal into large castings presents an instance of well-defined action of the law of exchanges which must be constantly witnessed and noted inquiringly by daily observers, and which certainly presents, if a different and more natural explanation can be given of its origin, to eyes unaccustomed and unprepared to receive it, a somewhat surprising and otherwise unaccountable appearance. In gun-metal, when the proportion of zinc introduced is very small, the coating of the melted surface by copper oxide is comparatively slow, and in melted brass it might not be possible, from the rapid oxidation of zinc upon the surface, successfully to observe the same phenomenon. In order to render melted copper fluid enough for casting, a small proportion of alloy sufficient to give it almost the colour of brass is required to be mixed with it, and large pourings of the pure metal cannot commonly be made; but perhaps in small castings of this metal, and probably also in those of gold, opportunities would present themselves similar to that which I have here attempted to describe, of verifying the same general law of radiation connecting together the qualities of luminosity and absorption in the surfaces of highly coloured metals.","dc.creator":["HERSCHEL, A.

D. Whitney, and referred by him to the Tertiary period, &c,\u201d to which is added a footnote, that \u201cthe ample evidence collected by Prof. Whitney, but not yet published, substantiates the opinion given above with regard to age. The omission of the Calaveras skull would not weaken the evidence as to the existence of man in the Tertiary period in California.\u201d Inasmuch as the Glacial period occurred at the close of the Tertiary period, if Prof. Whitney's discoveries are conclusive, as to this side of the Atlantic, does it not follow that man must have existed, certainly in Asia, prior to the glacial epoch? We are assured by all ethnologists, that man migrated from Asia to America, and now we are offered proofs of his American sojourn, of a date preceding the occurrence of glacial conditions.

The climate of those northern shores must then have been much milder than at the present day, for no currents from the Frozen Ocean could have penetrated into the Pacific.\u201d This reference to a milder climate must necessarily refer to the genial warmth of Pliocene times; for scarcely under other circumstances can we find time enough to explain the various phases of lost civilisations, especially in South America.

This case seemed to me to show in a striking manner that extra-floral nectar-glands are not necessarily protective in function, because the fern has, in England at least, extremely few enemies. The following extract of a letter lately received from Fritz M\u00fcller (of St. Catharina, Brazil) is of considerable interest in relation to this subject. He states that \u201cthe honey-glands on our Pteris aquilina serve, without doubt, to protect the ferns from the depredations of the leaf-cutting ants (\u0152codoma), as is the case with Passiflora, Luffa, and many other plants. The glands of the Pteris are eagerly visited by a small black ant, Crematogaster, of which the \u0152codoma seems to stand in great dread. On the other hand, when no protecting ants are present, I have seen \u0152codoma gnawing the young fronds; here, as in other cases, it is only the young leaves that stand in need of protection, the older ones not being attacked by the leaf-cutting ants.\u201d This fact might, no doubt, be used as an argument by those who believe that all nectar-glands were originally developed as protective organs, and this argument would have great force if it could be shown that Pteris aquilina is a form which has arisen in countries where protection is needed; but even in that case there would remain the difficulty of accounting for the continued functional activity of the glands in districts where no such protection is required. Or it may be said that in past ages the glands on our European Pteris served as a protection against enemies which have now become extinct. But here we are again met by the difficulty of accounting for the continued activity of the glands. It is characteristic of evolution that great changes occur in the functions of organs, and I think that it will generally be allowed that even the most beautifully adapted apparatus must have originated in an organ performing some comparatively simple function. The question at issue may perhaps be stated as follows:\u2014In the cases where the nectar-glands are now well developed has there been a special course of structural development in close relation with the need of the plant for protection? Has there been a course of evolution such as we may believe has taken place in the formation of the food-bodies in Acacia sp\u00e6rocephala and Cecropia peltata, or should we not rather believe that the sweet secretion has been developed in connection with some unknown process of nutrition; according to this view, a well developed system of glands may continue merely performing some obscure excretory function, and consequently, although the presence of nectar-glands has undoubtedly been of the utmost importance in determining the survival of certain species, yet it is hardly fair to assume that all nectar glands were originally protective in function. For many plants secrete large quantities of sweet fluid, which serves no such purpose. This argument is given by my father in his \u201cEffects of Cross and Self-Fertilisation\u201d (p. 402). In addition to the facts there given in support of this view, a curious case described by Prof. H. Hoffmann may be mentioned (\u201cUeber Honigthau,\u201d 1876). He states that numerous large drops of sweetish fluid appeared on the under-surface of the young leaves of a camellia. He also alludes to a similar abnormal production of honey-dew on an ivy plant.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"16","prism.number":"397","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"100","prism.endingPage":"101","prism.copyright":"1877 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/016100c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/016100c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/016100c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/016100c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Nectar-Secreting Glands","citation_volume":"16","citation_issue":"397","citation_publication_date":"1877/06","citation_firstpage":"100","citation_lastpage":"101","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/016100c0","DOI":"10.1038/016100c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/016100c0","description":"I HAVE briefly described in vol. xv. of the Linn\u00e6an Society's Journal, the nectar-glands found at the base of the fronds of the brake fern (Pteris aquilina) which are visited by ants for the sake of their sweet secretion.

On the other hand, when no protecting ants are present, I have seen \u0152codoma gnawing the young fronds; here, as in other cases, it is only the young leaves that stand in need of protection, the older ones not being attacked by the leaf-cutting ants.\u201d This fact might, no doubt, be used as an argument by those who believe that all nectar-glands were originally developed as protective organs, and this argument would have great force if it could be shown that Pteris aquilina is a form which has arisen in countries where protection is needed; but even in that case there would remain the difficulty of accounting for the continued functional activity of the glands in districts where no such protection is required. Or it may be said that in past ages the glands on our European Pteris served as a protection against enemies which have now become extinct. But here we are again met by the difficulty of accounting for the continued activity of the glands. It is characteristic of evolution that great changes occur in the functions of organs, and I think that it will generally be allowed that even the most beautifully adapted apparatus must have originated in an organ performing some comparatively simple function. The question at issue may perhaps be stated as follows:\u2014In the cases where the nectar-glands are now well developed has there been a special course of structural development in close relation with the need of the plant for protection? Has there been a course of evolution such as we may believe has taken place in the formation of the food-bodies in Acacia sp\u00e6rocephala and Cecropia peltata, or should we not rather believe that the sweet secretion has been developed in connection with some unknown process of nutrition; according to this view, a well developed system of glands may continue merely performing some obscure excretory function, and consequently, although the presence of nectar-glands has undoubtedly been of the utmost importance in determining the survival of certain species, yet it is hardly fair to assume that all nectar glands were originally protective in function. For many plants secrete large quantities of sweet fluid, which serves no such purpose. This argument is given by my father in his \u201cEffects of Cross and Self-Fertilisation\u201d (p. 402). In addition to the facts there given in support of this view, a curious case described by Prof. H. Hoffmann may be mentioned (\u201cUeber Honigthau,\u201d 1876). He states that numerous large drops of sweetish fluid appeared on the under-surface of the young leaves of a camellia. He also alludes to a similar abnormal production of honey-dew on an ivy plant.","dc.creator":["DARWIN, FRANCIS"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["DARWIN, FRANCIS"],"citation_author_institution":["Down, Beckenham"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Nectar-Secreting Glands","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;Emphasis Type=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Nectar-Secreting...","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"016143a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

I have hit upon a method for producing them in an equally simple and satisfactory way. If a glass tube (with a length of one or two decim. and four or five millim. wide) has by means of the blowpipe one of its ends reduced to a diameter of two millim., some fibrous matter, as loose cotton-wool or gun-cotton, &c., must be introduced into this part, in such a way that many single fibres protrude out of the tube. They form the lower part when the tube is now fixed in a vertical position, and some sulphuric ether dropped in through the upper end in sufficient quantity to keep the fibrous substance moist, but not enough to run over.

I have hit upon a method for producing them in an equally simple and satisfactory way. If a glass tube (with a length of one or two decim. and four or five millim. wide) has by means of the blowpipe one of its ends reduced to a diameter of two millim., some fibrous matter, as loose cotton-wool or gun-cotton, &c., must be introduced into this part, in such a way that many single fibres protrude out of the tube. They form the lower part when the tube is now fixed in a vertical position, and some sulphuric ether dropped in through the upper end in sufficient quantity to keep the fibrous substance moist, but not enough to run over.

I am engaged in studying a gravimeter designed by the late J. Allan Broun, in which gravity is balanced by the torsion of a single wire; or is intended to be so. As the function of the instrument depends largely on the law of torsion in wires, I have been making experiments to satisfy myself on some points. It is in the results of one of these that I have met with my difficulty. I was using thin brass wire (diam .02), and after stretching it till it broke, twice, I supposed it to be at or near its maximum elasticity, and proceeded to use it in the intended way. At each end of a 6-foot plank I inserted into the edge a 2-inch screw. The wire was fastened upon these so as to get a strain by turning them. The wire was in two pieces, attached to opposite sides of a ring in the middle. By turning this ring the two wires were severally twisted in opposite directions. A straight thick wire passed through the ring, the weight of which afforded a ready means of varying the force necessary to balance the torsion of the wire. My first object was to prove that the force of the latter was, at any rate to some considerable extent, independent of the tension. Suppose that with this arrangement, the wire being horizontal, a balance has been effected when the ring has been turned about the wire as an axis three or four times. What will happen when the wire is further strained? I think it would be a natural expectation (apart from special knowledge) that the weight will rise; on the other hand, a knowledge of the law of torsion teaches (?) that there is no increase of the force sustaining the weight, which therefore will not rise. But who would suppose that, on the contrary, it would sink? Such, nevertheless, is what takes place. I continued increasing the strain, and the weight continued to sink. I had to go on lessening the weight again and again (by shifting the balancing cross-rod), in order to restore the horizontality of the ring; until at last there was scarcely any force of torsion left! To repeat the experiment of course the ring had to receive three or four fresh turns. I did so several times, always continuing, as I thought, to increase the strain. All the time the wire was absorbing the torsion, and did not break. I then thought to try the effect of a high initial torsion. But I did not seem to get any such by turning the ring more than five or six times. I then thought to see how much twisting the wire would bear. Expecting it every instant to break, I counted up to 100 half turns. By this time the wire was quite slack! I added another hundred half turns. The wire was now half an inch longer, without any strain having been kept on it except just enough to keep it straight. I went on twisting. At 218 one wire broke. The other then had only sixteen halt-turns of twist in it, out of the 230 or more received. I afterwards went on twisting, mending each time that the wire broke, till the twist (quite visible under the microscope) amounted to sixteen turns per inch. The length kept on increasing. After breaking, the wire always untwisted one turn in four inches.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"22","prism.number":"572","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"557","prism.endingPage":"558","prism.copyright":"1880 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/022557e0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/022557e0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/022557e0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/022557e0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Wire Torsion","citation_volume":"22","citation_issue":"572","citation_publication_date":"1880/10","citation_firstpage":"557","citation_lastpage":"558","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/022557e0","DOI":"10.1038/022557e0","citation_doi":"10.1038/022557e0","description":"I HOPE you will allow me to seek information, through your aid, on a subject which is perplexing me a good deal at present.

At each end of a 6-foot plank I inserted into the edge a 2-inch screw. The wire was fastened upon these so as to get a strain by turning them. The wire was in two pieces, attached to opposite sides of a ring in the middle. By turning this ring the two wires were severally twisted in opposite directions. A straight thick wire passed through the ring, the weight of which afforded a ready means of varying the force necessary to balance the torsion of the wire. My first object was to prove that the force of the latter was, at any rate to some considerable extent, independent of the tension. Suppose that with this arrangement, the wire being horizontal, a balance has been effected when the ring has been turned about the wire as an axis three or four times. What will happen when the wire is further strained? I think it would be a natural expectation (apart from special knowledge) that the weight will rise; on the other hand, a knowledge of the law of torsion teaches (?) that there is no increase of the force sustaining the weight, which therefore will not rise. But who would suppose that, on the contrary, it would sink? Such, nevertheless, is what takes place. I continued increasing the strain, and the weight continued to sink. I had to go on lessening the weight again and again (by shifting the balancing cross-rod), in order to restore the horizontality of the ring; until at last there was scarcely any force of torsion left! To repeat the experiment of course the ring had to receive three or four fresh turns. I did so several times, always continuing, as I thought, to increase the strain. All the time the wire was absorbing the torsion, and did not break. I then thought to try the effect of a high initial torsion. But I did not seem to get any such by turning the ring more than five or six times. I then thought to see how much twisting the wire would bear. Expecting it every instant to break, I counted up to 100 half turns. By this time the wire was quite slack! I added another hundred half turns. The wire was now half an inch longer, without any strain having been kept on it except just enough to keep it straight. I went on twisting. At 218 one wire broke. The other then had only sixteen halt-turns of twist in it, out of the 230 or more received. I afterwards went on twisting, mending each time that the wire broke, till the twist (quite visible under the microscope) amounted to sixteen turns per inch. The length kept on increasing. After breaking, the wire always untwisted one turn in four inches.","dc.creator":["HERSCHEL, J."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["HERSCHEL, J."],"citation_author_institution":["Collingwood"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Wire Torsion","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Wire Torsion&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"023035c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In some \u201cNotes on some rare and little known Fishes taken at Madeira,\u201d published between 1860 and 1870 in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History, I undertook to prove that the fishes on which Mr. Lowe founded that species were merely young specimens of the common Scorp\u00e6na scrofa, L. It might be well if Prof. Giglioli looked at the paper referred to before labelling his Sicilian fishes. With regard to the two Macruroid fishes, Malacocephalus l\u00e6vis (Lowe), and Coryph\u00e6noides serratus (Lowe), which the Professor captured in the Mediterranean, I may state that they are so rare at Madeira, where they were originally detected by the late Mr. Lowe, that during thirty years I have only obtained a single specimen of the former and have never met with the latter at all. It would be curious if the \u201csingular fish of a deep black colour, with small eyes, a naked skin, and a most abyssal physiognomy,\u201d should prove to be the rare Madeiran Gadoid, Chiasmodon niger, described by me in a paper read before the Zoological Society of London on November 10, 1863. The unique specimen was sent to the British Museum, but another example was afterwards taken in the West Indies, and figured by Dr. Carte in the Proc. Z. S. London, 1866, pl. ii.

In some \u201cNotes on some rare and little known Fishes taken at Madeira,\u201d published between 1860 and 1870 in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History, I undertook to prove that the fishes on which Mr. Lowe founded that species were merely young specimens of the common Scorp\u00e6na scrofa, L. It might be well if Prof. Giglioli looked at the paper referred to before labelling his Sicilian fishes. With regard to the two Macruroid fishes, Malacocephalus l\u00e6vis (Lowe), and Coryph\u00e6noides serratus (Lowe), which the Professor captured in the Mediterranean, I may state that they are so rare at Madeira, where they were originally detected by the late Mr. Lowe, that during thirty years I have only obtained a single specimen of the former and have never met with the latter at all. It would be curious if the \u201csingular fish of a deep black colour, with small eyes, a naked skin, and a most abyssal physiognomy,\u201d should prove to be the rare Madeiran Gadoid, Chiasmodon niger, described by me in a paper read before the Zoological Society of London on November 10, 1863. The unique specimen was sent to the British Museum, but another example was afterwards taken in the West Indies, and figured by Dr. Carte in the Proc. Z. S. London, 1866, pl. ii. Singularly enough the stomach of the latter specimen contained a fish which exceeded the size of its swallower, and this was no other than an example of an extremely rare Madeiran species, Neoscopelus macrolepidotus, described by me in the Proc.

I touched it with my umbrella, expecting to see it retire into its hole, but, taking no notice of my touch, it continued its forward movement, and drew itself out of its hole with a jerk. I then saw that attached to the end of its tail was a caterpillarlike insect\u2014no doubt the larva of some beetle\u2014about 11/4 inch long, the back covered with a series of shining black bands, and the belly, which was furnished with a few short feet at the head and tail, was of dull greenish yellow. This insect, without relaxing its hold of the worm, which was moving along more rapidly than I ever saw a worm move before, gradually shifted its bite along the belly of the worm till it had bitten about two inches, or rather less than one-third the whole length of the worm, which was more than six inches long. This it accomplished in about ten minutes, the bitten portion turning livid and swelling considerably, the worm's power of motion gradually ceasing. The insect then relaxed its hold, and crawled back along the back of the worm, and, seizing its tail, attempted to drag it backward, but finding the worm had still the power of slightly moving forward, it rapidly bit the belly of the worm where it had previously bitten it, and by this time the worm's power of forward motion had entirely ceased. The insect then appeared to survey the ground for some two feet behind the worm, and again seizing the tail, and fastening its own tail to a stalk of clover, it pulled strongly, not directly, but bending the worm sideways round a stalk of grass; gradually, very gradually, the swelled tail of the worm lengthened, and then I saw the whole body come back as it were a ring at a time, with a sort of resilient motion. The insect thus gained about one quarter of an inch, and in an hour and a half had drawn the worm in a sinuous line about 9 or 10 inches. I was unable to observe longer, but I have no doubt the insect would eventually drag the worm back into the latter's own hole, where it had first attacked it.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"26","prism.number":"675","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"549","prism.endingPage":"549","prism.copyright":"1882 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/026549e0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/026549e0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/026549e0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/026549e0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"An Insect Attacking a Worm","citation_volume":"26","citation_issue":"675","citation_publication_date":"1882/10","citation_firstpage":"549","citation_lastpage":"549","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/026549e0","DOI":"10.1038/026549e0","citation_doi":"10.1038/026549e0","description":"ON September 19, 1882, I was waiting for a train at Laqueville, in the Puy-de-Dome district of France, when I noticed a very large worm in the meadow, moving very rapidly from side to side.

Instead of supposing a complicated system of words, as Mr. Harrison does, it is easy to conceive that, with the apparatus he describes, many signs may be made. Expressions of alarm, joy, direction, can be as well made with antenn\u00e6 as with hands.","dc.creator":["CLARKE, HYDE"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["CLARKE, HYDE"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Animal Intelligence","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Animal Intelligence&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"030583b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

I know of a large tree at Kew which altogether confirms the statement. The explanation, however, that the spines of the lower leaves may be produced to prevent animals from browsing on them, and that they are not developed on the upper branches because these are beyond the reach of animals, seems to me to require some modification, if not to be given up altogether, in this limited sense. It seems to me to admit of a much simpler explanation, namely, that it is an approximation\u2014or reversion, if indeed the term be applicable\u2014to the ancestral type. It is a well-known fact that in the embryonic stage of an organism the affinity with the ancestral type is best seen, and that in the mature stage the greatest amount of specialisation takes place; and, viewed in this light, the case of the holly does not appear to present much difficulty. A young seedling is seen to have very spiny leaves but with increasing age the leaves becoming comparatively spineless. In the case of the furze we have the most overwhelming evidence that the spiny character has been developed to repel the attacks of herbivorous animals, and a young seedling is seen to have trifoliate leaves\u2014like the laburnam\u2014from which we infer that its ancestral type was spineless, and had trifoliate leaves. The large group of phyllodineous Acacias bear an equally unmistakable stamp of their origin in the bipinnate leaves which the seedlings at first produce. In most cases these leaves are very early superseded by phyllodes, but in A. melanoxylon the habit of producing true leaves is never quite lost. There is a large tree of this species about 40 feet high at Kew, at the south end of the Temperate House, close to the spiral staircase. It is thus in an admirable position for examination. At the base of this tree the leaves predominate over the phyllodes, but in ascending the staircase the proportion is seen to gradually diminish, till at the top of the tree\u2014a few feet above the gallery\u2014scarcely a true leaf is to be seen. Assuming the mature stage to be the more highly specialised, we have in the holly a preisely parallel case. This necessarily involves the opinion that he ancestral type of the genus Ilex had spiny leaves; and, if so, it seems highly probable that the character was developed as a protection against the attacks of herbivorous animals. A possible objection which at first struck me was that many of the pecies have quite smooth leaves; but this has been removed by a search through the specimens in the Kew Herbarium. In the first place, species with spiny leaves occur in each great centre of distribution of the genus\u2013in North and South America, India, China and Japan, the Atlantic Islands, as well as Europe\u2014and in the second, although no seedling plants were found, there are three species which show very spiny leaves on barren branches, and smooth leaves on the more mature flowering branches. These are I. insignis and I. dipyrena, from India, and I. Perado, from the Atlantic Islands. I have little doubt that seedlings of many species would present the spiny character if we could only see them. The presence of spines\u2014the nerves being extended beyond the margin of the leaf\u2014seems to indicate an excess of vascular over cellular tissue; a condition which is either modified with increasing maturity or is not exhibited in the same phenomena. In any case a severe pruning\u2014or reduction of the parts to be nourished\u2014is followed by a temporary reversion to the more spiny character. If this explanation be the correct one the question naturally arises, Why are the hollies losing the property of producing spiny leaves? rather than, Why does the holly produce spiny leaves on its lower branches? The answer to the first query would perhaps be, Because they no longer need the protection afforded by the spines. To the second, Long-continued habits are not often instantly laid aside.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"31","prism.number":"809","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"600","prism.endingPage":"600","prism.copyright":"1885 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/031600a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/031600a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/031600a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/031600a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Forms of Leaves","citation_volume":"31","citation_issue":"809","citation_publication_date":"1885/04","citation_firstpage":"600","citation_lastpage":"600","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/031600a0","DOI":"10.1038/031600a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/031600a0","description":"IN a recent issue of NATURE, in the discussion on the forms of leaves, Mr. Henslow seems to doubt the assertion of Sir John Lubbock that the holly produces prickly leaves on the lower branches, and smooth leaves without spines above; but this is a fact which may easily be verified in numerous localities (selected gardens varieties are of course not intended).

Will you permit me to offer a few remarks with reference to this matter. In the first place, it is said that M. de Morgan came into contact with three native races, which he respectively names Sakayes [Sakai], Seumangs [S\u011bmang], and Rayats [Ryot]. I have put in brackets the commonly accepted spelling in the Straits. It is funny what peculiar mistakes travellers make when passing through a country the language of which they do not understand, ryot being the word used in the Straits to express those followers or retainers of a native chief who are not actually his debt slaves, but who owe him more or less of feudal allegiance; Malays here invariably use the word when speaking of the following of a Sakai chief. The word ryot is, I believe, also used in the same sense in India. With reference to the tribes of whom M. de Morgan speaks as living in the recesses of the mountains, and whom the Sakaies called \u201cfire apes,\u201d I cannot help remarking that I have never heard the Sakaies speak of them myself, nor can I find that any other Government servant here has heard of them either; still we are in pretty constant communication with certain of the Sakaies of these hills, and for my part I have at different times stayed for longer and shorter periods at the clearings of some of the chiefs whom M. de Morgan visited, and moreover I have employed most of the same Malays who followed M. de Morgan. By the bye, these were Sumatran Malays, and they told me some very extraordinary tales about the wild tribes before I started up country with them; these foreign Malays are especially addicted to telling marvellous tales of the wild tribes of the mountains, but so far I have not been able to verify their information in the least degree either from the Sakaies themselves or from native Malay sources. It would be interesting to know what equivalent was used for the expression \u201cfire apes.\u201d Was it a Malay word or a Sakai word? With reference to the Stone Age I quite agree with M. de Morgan in believing that at a not very late period\u2014probably just before the Malay invasion\u2014there were tribes living in the interior who were not acquainted with the use of iron; up to the present moment I have been able to collect twenty-two stone implements. I have sent drawings and notices of these to the Anthropological Institute. I may, however, here mention that of these twenty-two specimens one is the half of a stone bracelet; the rest are all chopping-tools of different descriptions, used, I think we may fairly conclude, by a race of boat-builders, who most likely constructed dug-outs, much like the Malays of the present day. I adduce this supposition from the fact that of my twenty-one specimens two are perfect gouges, and six others are of the description which Dr. Evans has classed under adzes. The cutting-edges of nearly all my specimens have been considerably damaged by use. The high polish which M. de Morgan's specimens\u2014and mine also\u2014exhibit is, I think, accounted for in a great measure by the fact that they are used and very highly prized by the Malays as whetstones; the women preserve them, especially to sharpen their razors on, with which they shave the heads of their children during the periods ordered by custom or religious law; and the men were, until lately, very anxious to procure them to sharpen the iron spurs used in cock-fighting. As almost all of the specimens procured by me have been purchased of Malays who have inherited them from their ancestors, and prized them as heir-looms, it is, I think, reasonable to suppose that in their original condition some of them, at least, were considerably rougher than when they came into our hands; this supposition is further confirmed by a remark made to me the other day by a Malay chief. He said that he once had a thunderstone given to him which was so rough that he had to wear it down on his emery-wheel before he could use it as a whetstone. I have one specimen which has no cutting-edge, but is squared off at each end and is almost spindle-shaped. I have also seen another specimen of the same description. Can it be that these two specimens have been manufactured by Malays for whetstopes out of the so-called thunder-stones? I cannot account for them in any other way; they are too slight for hammers.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"34","prism.number":"864","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"52","prism.endingPage":"53","prism.copyright":"1886 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/034052b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/034052b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/034052b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/034052b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Stone Age in the Malay Peninsula","citation_volume":"34","citation_issue":"864","citation_publication_date":"1886/05","citation_firstpage":"52","citation_lastpage":"53","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/034052b0","DOI":"10.1038/034052b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/034052b0","description":"IN NATURE, vol. xxxiii. p. 377, there is a notice of a paper by M. de Morgan, published in Cosmos, on the Stone Age in the Malay Peninsula. Will you permit me to offer a few remarks with reference to this matter. In the first place, it is said that M. de Morgan came into contact with three native races, which he respectively names Sakayes [Sakai], Seumangs [S\u011bmang], and Rayats [Ryot]. I have put in brackets the commonly accepted spelling in the Straits. It is funny what peculiar mistakes travellers make when passing through a country the language of which they do not understand, ryot being the word used in the Straits to express those followers or retainers of a native chief who are not actually his debt slaves, but who owe him more or less of feudal allegiance; Malays here invariably use the word when speaking of the following of a Sakai chief. The word ryot is, I believe, also used in the same sense in India. With reference to the tribes of whom M. de Morgan speaks as living in the recesses of the mountains, and whom the Sakaies called \u201cfire apes,\u201d I cannot help remarking that I have never heard the Sakaies speak of them myself, nor can I find that any other Government servant here has heard of them either; still we are in pretty constant communication with certain of the Sakaies of these hills, and for my part I have at different times stayed for longer and shorter periods at the clearings of some of the chiefs whom M. de Morgan visited, and moreover I have employed most of the same Malays who followed M. de Morgan. By the bye, these were Sumatran Malays, and they told me some very extraordinary tales about the wild tribes before I started up country with them; these foreign Malays are especially addicted to telling marvellous tales of the wild tribes of the mountains, but so far I have not been able to verify their information in the least degree either from the Sakaies themselves or from native Malay sources. It would be interesting to know what equivalent was used for the expression \u201cfire apes.\u201d Was it a Malay word or a Sakai word? With reference to the Stone Age I quite agree with M. de Morgan in believing that at a not very late period\u2014probably just before the Malay invasion\u2014there were tribes living in the interior who were not acquainted with the use of iron; up to the present moment I have been able to collect twenty-two stone implements.

He argues that, the moon's mass being great, she should recede to an enormous distance before there will be a reversal of the direction of her tides on the earth; while the satellite of Mars, being very small, need only to recede a short distance before a similar tidal reversal ensues. No mention being made of any other supposed difference in the systems at the starting-point, it must be inferred that, other things are supposed about equal. But, as a matter of fact, the present position of the Martian satellite is incompatible with an initial rotation of its planet anything like so great as that ascribed to the earth at a like stage. If Mars be supposed to rotate ten times while the satellite, at its present distance, makes nine revolutions, the satellite's period would still be affected or lengthened much more than would that of the planet's rotation. The difference between the periods of revolution of the planet and satellite would increase quickly at first, but more slowly as the satellite receded a certain distance, till at a certain time there would be no increase, after which there would be a decrease, and finally a reversal. When the satellite would have receded to a short distance, where she would revolve in the same period as Mars now rotates in, the planet would have lost but little of its original rapid rotation. Now, supposing the satellite tide to go round in the same time as the solar one, ihe period of the satellite would be affected about thirty times as much as that of the planet's rotation. Allowance being made for the comparative slowness of the satellite's tides, the satellite's period would still be changed more than ten times as much as that of the planet. It would be only when the little body got further out, and the planet's rotation slower than it now is, that there could be a reversal of the direction of the satellite's tides. Wherever started, the satellite must either go directly into the planet, or go out a short distance and back into the planet, before the rotation-period can have been much changed by solar tides; or else the satellite must go far out\u2014as when it gets a fair start\u2014and could not possibly turn back until the rotation of Mars be slower than now. Hence it seems that under no conditions could the rotation of Mars, at the birth of her moon, have been twice as rapid as now, and the evidence is very strong that the rotation-period could not have been changed more than a very few hours, if so much. Then, if the rotation of Mars was so slow in the beginning, and so little changed during the whole existence of the satellite, the circumstance does not support the view that the earth's rotation was very rapid in the beginning and so much changed during her past history, but rather inclines the other way.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"35","prism.number":"891","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"75","prism.endingPage":"75","prism.copyright":"1886 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/035075a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/035075a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/035075a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/035075a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Tidal Friction and the Evolution of a Satellite","citation_volume":"35","citation_issue":"891","citation_publication_date":"1886/11","citation_firstpage":"75","citation_lastpage":"75","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/035075a0","DOI":"10.1038/035075a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/035075a0","description":"ADVERTING to the correspondence in NATURE (vol. xxxiv. p. 286), I think that Mr. Darwin has not, FO far, fully realised the results that would follow from the circumstance that the Martian satellite's period would be affected many hundred times more than that of the planet's rotation, as explained in the correspondence referred to.

The author's plan led him to the temporary omission of The\u00e6tetus of Athens, a pupil of Theodorus of Cyrene, and also a disciple of Socrates, who greatly advanced the science of geometry. How his gifts and genius impressed both Socrates and Plato is well known from the dialogue which bears his name. From an analysis which our author makes of part of this dialogue it appears that The\u00e6tetus, in addition to Eudoxus and the Pythagoreans, was one of the original thinkers to whom Euclid was most indebted in the composition of the \u201cElements.\u201d Dr. Allman thus recapitulates:\u2014\u201d In the former parts of this paper we have seen that we owe to the Pythagoreans the substance of the first, second, and fourth books, also the doctrine of proportion and of the similarity of figures, together with the discoveries respecting the application, excess, and defect of areas, the subject-matter of the sixth book.

The author's plan led him to the temporary omission of The\u00e6tetus of Athens, a pupil of Theodorus of Cyrene, and also a disciple of Socrates, who greatly advanced the science of geometry. How his gifts and genius impressed both Socrates and Plato is well known from the dialogue which bears his name. From an analysis which our author makes of part of this dialogue it appears that The\u00e6tetus, in addition to Eudoxus and the Pythagoreans, was one of the original thinkers to whom Euclid was most indebted in the composition of the \u201cElements.\u201d Dr. Allman thus recapitulates:\u2014\u201d In the former parts of this paper we have seen that we owe to the Pythagoreans the substance of the first, second, and fourth books, also the doctrine of proportion and of the similarity of figures, together with the discoveries respecting the application, excess, and defect of areas, the subject-matter of the sixth book. The theorems arrived at, however, were proved for commensurable magnitudes only, and assumed to hold good for all. We have seen, further, that the doctrine of proportion, treated in a general manner, so as to include incommensurables (Book v.), and consequently the recasting of Book vi. and also the method of exhaustions (Book xii.) were the work of Eudoxus.

I have puzzled over this spectral brightness for five years, and never found an explanation of the fact that no one can see anyone's halo but his own. I have delayed writing to NATURE until cause and effect could both be given, but they are not forthcoming.","dc.creator":["EVE, A.

This difference led Home to conjecture that these plates were changed during the growth of the animal\u2014a view which was corrected by Owen (\u201cComp.

Of the figures cited by Dr. Hart Merriam, that of the younger animal seems (as far as can be judged from the roughly executed engraving, with the assistance of the descriptive text) to represent the horny plates, showing the hollows from which the true teeth have recently fallen; that of the old specimen, the same plates after they are fully grown, and their surfaces worn down by attrition.

From these results, Prof. Crafts concludes that it is not proved that pressure plays any part in the contraction of the glass.","dc.creator":["YOUNG, SYDNEY"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["YOUNG, SYDNEY"],"citation_author_institution":["University College, Bristol"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Exact Thermometry","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Exact Thermometry&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"041585c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Can a gas expand without being cooled? It is probable that nearly every physicist will give negative answers to these questions, and yet the fact that such conditions may occur sometimes seems well established. The present writer, in 1889, attempted to determine the actual heating of air when compressed by a pump connected with the cylinder by a long tube, and found that the temperature was raised about 4\u00b0 F. for a compression of 10 inches above atmospheric pressure. In like manner, on expanding this compressed air into the free atmosphere, it was found that the cooling was about 4\u00b0.

Can a gas expand without being cooled? It is probable that nearly every physicist will give negative answers to these questions, and yet the fact that such conditions may occur sometimes seems well established. The present writer, in 1889, attempted to determine the actual heating of air when compressed by a pump connected with the cylinder by a long tube, and found that the temperature was raised about 4\u00b0 F. for a compression of 10 inches above atmospheric pressure. In like manner, on expanding this compressed air into the free atmosphere, it was found that the cooling was about 4\u00b0. These results were published in Science, vol. xv. p. 387, and were strongly combated by Prof. Ferrel and Prof. Marvin. Prof. Ferrel advanced, as applicable in this case, the well-known thermodynamic formula for the computation of the heat developed in a gas when compressed, as follows:\u2014 t/ t\u2032=(p/p\u2032)\u02d9291 in which t and t\u2032 are the absolute temperatures corresponding to the pressures p and p'.

Mr. Wallace says, \u201cIt is this tremendous hypothesis which appears to me to be not only quite unnecessary to explain the facts, but also to be inadequate to explain them. If one thing more than another is clear, it is that these comparatively small flightless birds were developed, as such, in or near to the islands where they are now found, since they could not possibly have arisen on any extensive land inhabited by carnivorous mammals and reptiles, and, if introduced into such a country could not long survive.\" If by this Mr. Wallace means that only the flightlessness of these birds, apart from their general structure as members of the genus Aphanapteryx, arose in or near the islands where they now are, he still leaves the, to me, greater difficulty unexplained how two so closely related species of the same genus should have arisen in regions separated by nearly one half of the circumference of the globe. For it has to be remembered that Aphanapteryx belongs to the Ocydromine group of the Rails, which is quite unknown in the northern hemisphere, and, therefore, to have reached \u201cLemuria\u201d (the ancient land of which Madagascar, Mauritius, Bourbon, Rodriguez, and the Seychelles, are the fragments) the genus must have arisen independently in both regions where its species are now found, or it spread from one or the other centre, or from some common land by flight. Mr. Wallace has himself pointed out that to explain the presence of the flightless Notornis and Ocydromus in two groups of islands in the New Zealand region requires a land connection, for it has been hitherto considered an axiom of geographical distribution that the regions inhabited by the same genus or species have been continuous, or have been, at all events, such as to afford possibilities of migration from one to another. If Aphanapteryx could have spread from the Chatham Islands to Mauritius by flight, surely Notornis and Ocydromus did not require a land connection to reach from New Zealand to the nearer outlying islands, for they may equally have lost the use of their wings only after they reached their present homes.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"48","prism.number":"1230","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"74","prism.endingPage":"75","prism.copyright":"1893 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/048074c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/048074c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/048074c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/048074c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Mr. H.

Mr. Wallace says, \u201cIt is this tremendous hypothesis which appears to me to be not only quite unnecessary to explain the facts, but also to be inadequate to explain them.

What M. Berthelot terms the molecular rapidity of the reaction, as distinguished from the rapidity of propagation, in the case of mixtures of acetylene and oxygen is very high. The heat of the reaction, too, is nearly five times as much as in the cases of electrolytic gas and of carbonic oxide, and more than twice as much as that of methane. It is slightly exceeded by that of ethylene, but, on the other hand, the theoretical temperature of the change with acetylene is enormously greater than in the case of any other explosive mixture of gases. The temperature, too, required to initiate the change is, as Prof. Lothar Meyer showed indirectly some ten years ago, much lower in the case of acetylene than in that of the other gaseous mixtures of which he speaks. All the conditions tend to make the duration of the reaction so nearly instantaneous that the initial pressure cannot be far removed from the theoretical pressure, and this is sufficient to smash a much stronger envelope than a glass cylinder, even if the \u201ctamping\u201d be nothing more than the air.

Up to the present time two types of these spermatophores have been recognised in the Oligoch\u00e6ta. In the Lumbricid\u00e6, Criodrilus, &c., they are compact cases, generally open at one end, and found invariably attached to the outside of the body in the neighbourhood of the reproductive orifices; they are sometimes even slightly imbedded in the skin. The other type of spermatophore characterises Tubifex and several allied genera, as well as the Eudrilid earthworm, Polytoreutus. These are long thin motile bodies. They are found only in the spermathec\u00e6 of those Annelids which they characterise. I have lately studied the structure of a third variety of spermatophore which I found in the spermathecal sac of another Eudrilid genus, Stuhlmannia. This worm is long and slender, not measuring more than 2 mm. in diameter. The spermathecal sac in which the spermatophores are found is about 7 or 8 mm. long. I never found more than two of the spermatophores in a sac; they measure some 3 mm. in length. The shape is peculiar. There is a \u201chead\u201d very similar to that of the spermatophore of Tubifex, a long \u201cbeak,\u201d open at the extremity, is followed by a circumferential swelling, which is again succeeded by a narrow neck; this in its turn gradually widens until at the middle the spermatophore is large and plump. The interior was a mass of separate spermatozoa entirely uncompacted together. The site of the formation of the spermatophores has been much disputed. It seems to be clear, from the investigations of Mr. Lankester, that in Tubifex they are at least moulded in the spermatheca, since the collar of the head of the spermatophore not only corresponded in form with certain foldings of the spermathecal wall, but was actually observed lying in situ. As to the origin of the material, Mr. Lankester and Prof. Vejdovsky were disposed to trace it, partly at least, to the \u201ccement gland\u201d of the male efferent apparatus. I find in Stuhlmannia that the moulding of the head of the spermatophore must be accomplished in the spermathecal sac, since I also observed a spermatophore lying in situ with its convexities fitting into corresponding concavities of the walls of that sac. Further, the large size of the spermatophore necessitates the hypothesis that the whole of it is moulded in the sac, since it could not possibly be contained\u2014even with the greatest stretching\u2014in the spermiducal gland. As to the origin of the material of the case, I hold it to be proved that part comes from the spermiducal gland and that the rest is, in all probability, a result of the breaking down of the abundant cells which line the spermathecal sac. I may add that no spermatozoa protrude through the case. This spermatophore of Stuhlmannia is evidently somewhat intermediate in its characters between the two types already known.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"63","prism.number":"1639","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"515","prism.endingPage":"515","prism.copyright":"1901 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/063515a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/063515a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/063515a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/063515a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Note upon a New Form of Spermatophore in an Earthworm","citation_volume":"63","citation_issue":"1639","citation_publication_date":"1901/03","citation_firstpage":"515","citation_lastpage":"515","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/063515a0","DOI":"10.1038/063515a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/063515a0","description":"IT is well known that the Oligoch\u00e6ta (like many other animals such as molluscs, insects, &c.) form spermatophores.

Lockyer and Mr. Penrose, in NATURE of November 21 has greatly interested me. Just two years ago, I was working at the subject, and wrote to Prof. Petrie to inquire what azimuth he had used for the axis of the temple in his estimate of the date, which he gives as 730 A.D. \u00b1 200 years, with a possible date of 400 A. D. As I received no reply I employed the angle 50\u00b0 12\u2032 E. of N., given in Mr. Edgar Barclay's \u201cStonehenge,\u201d 1895. With this azimuth I obtained by means of a formula, kindly supplied by Dr. Downing, F.R.S., a date of 425 A.D. I find that, for the given azimuth, even this date is too early, as I did not allow, enough for refraction, &c. Applying the same formula to the figures given in Sir N. Lockyer's paper, the date comes out about 1700 B.C., as stated, so that the formula was correct, and the chief error was in the erroneous azimuth of the axis, which differs by about 38\u2032 from the 49\u00b0 34\u2032 18\u2033 so carefully determined in the published paper. Now as an increase of some 90\u2032 in sunrise azimuth at the solstice means a decrease of some 46\u2032 in declination and represents the lapse of about a century, the discrepancy is clearly explained. Allowing for refraction, &c., I make the present azimuth of the sun at sunrise at the solstice about 50\u00b0 26\u2032 21\u2033 E. of N., the sun's declination being 23\u00b0 27\u2032 8\u2033 N. Consequently since the date, 1700 B.C., the solstitial sunrise azimuth has shifted 52\u2032 3\u2033 further E. and the declination has decreased 27\u2032 22\u2033, representing a lapse of about 3600 years, when the appropriate formula is applied.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"65","prism.number":"1676","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"128","prism.endingPage":"129","prism.copyright":"1901 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/065128d0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/065128d0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/065128d0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/065128d0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Date of Stonehenge","citation_volume":"65","citation_issue":"1676","citation_publication_date":"1901/12","citation_firstpage":"128","citation_lastpage":"129","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/065128d0","DOI":"10.1038/065128d0","citation_doi":"10.1038/065128d0","description":"THE remarkable paper on Stonehenge, by Sir N.

Touching it with my finger, the butterfly rose and fluttered feebly along the curved walk in the Parks.

Colonies could be taken to new localities. and watched from year to year to see whether they became modified. The food and moisture conditions might be altered, and the results observed. The exact conditions surrounding each distinct form might be studied and described. Thus it might be determined whether the differentiation was the result of natural selection or has taken place independently of it.

Colonies could be taken to new localities. and watched from year to year to see whether they became modified. The food and moisture conditions might be altered, and the results observed. The exact conditions surrounding each distinct form might be studied and described. Thus it might be determined whether the differentiation was the result of natural selection or has taken place independently of it. Such an investigation would be delightful work for some enthusiastic naturalist, especially with such an excellent guide in hand as Dr. Pilsbry has supplied.","dc.creator":["COCKERELL, T. D.

On trying the experiment I have found that a one ampere 220 volts Nernst lamp gives quite a fair result in a small lantern, certainly very much better than could be got with oil wicks, and when put at a small angle from the horizontal the filament gives a very concentrated light.

J. Fox's letter in NATURE of March 10 it is not wonderful to learn that Prof. Milne emphasises the demand for some theory which shall explain pulsatory movements by which large tracts have been alternately raised and lowered.

It is known that the heating effect of radium when surrounded by an envelope of sufficient thickness to absorb both the \u03b1 and \u03b2 rays is about 100 gram calories per hour per gram. Paschen, however, found that if the radium was surrounded by a sufficient amount of lead to absorb completely the \u03b3 rays the heating effect was increased 2.26 times. This large heating effect of the \u03b3 rays was so unexpected, and of such great importance in connection with the nature of these rays, that we decided to verify this result by an independent method. In Paschen's experiments, the heating effect was determined in a special Bunsen ice calorimeter, in the central tube of which the radium, surrounded by a lead cylinder about 4 cm. in diameter, was placed. In order to correct for the natural melting of the ice mantle a differential method was employed. In our experiments we decided to use a differential air calorimeter, similar to the one described in our previous work on the heating effect of radium and its emanation (Phil. Mag., February). In each flask of the differential air calorimeter there was placed a narrow glass tube, closed at the lower end and extending to about the centre of the flask. The radium bromide weighing 23.7 milligrams was enclosed in a small metal capsule supported by a thread, and was inserted alternately in the glass tubes. The flasks, originally at atmospheric pressure, were immersed in a water bath kept in a constant temperature room, and were connected by a xylene tube which served as a manometer. The heating effect was measured by the movement of the xylene column, observed by a telescope with micrometer oeye-piece, and the scale was calibrated by a small heating coil of approximately the same dimensions as the radium.

Thorium, probably itself inactive, gives rise to radio-thorium (Hahn, Jahrbuch d. Radioact. u. Eleklron., ii., 3330) which emits a rays; radio-thorium forms thorium X, which is followed by the other well known products, the emanation and the active deposit.

Thorium, probably itself inactive, gives rise to radio-thorium (Hahn, Jahrbuch d. Radioact. u. Eleklron., ii., 3330) which emits a rays; radio-thorium forms thorium X, which is followed by the other well known products, the emanation and the active deposit.

Whitney, in 1903, confirmed the opinion that liquid water alone had no effect on the metal at ordinary temperatures. No mention was made, however, of the purity of the iron used.

Three such were chosen:\u2014(1) cast iron from a piece of old piping; (2) wrought iron; (3) fairly pure iron (99.5 per cent.). The pieces were polished, and measured approximately 1 cm. long by 3 cm. broad and 0.2 cm. thick. They were dropped into flasks of boiling distilled water, and after five minutes the latter were closed with tightly-fitting india-rubber bungs, in the way indicated by Whitney. It was found that whilst the pure and wrought iron were unchanged, the cast iron invariably turned a shade darker in tint. The experiment was varied by employing thin glass tubes instead of flasks, and the surface of the metal was in some cases roughened with a coarse file. After the admission of the iron, the tubes were drawn out and finally sealed off. The results were invariably the same.

The direction of the first two vertical planes of section is unimportant; they may be parallel, as in the first figure, or they may enclose a wedge. The cuts shown on the figures represent those made with the intention of letting the cake last for three days, each successive operation having removed about one-third of the area of the original disc. A common india-rubber band embraces the whole and keeps its segments together.","dc.creator":["G., F."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["G., F."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Cutting a Round Cake on Scientific Principles","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Cutting a Round Cake on Scientific Principles&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"075224a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

D. D.\u201d in NATURE of February 13. When that gentleman refers to the slightly dogmatic tone of his original article he is not doing himself justice; the article was as dogmatic as it could possibly be. Now he asserts that there is no sense in the distinction between acquired characters and innate ones with regard to inheritance, that all characters are both acquired and innate. This in the accepted meaning of the words is simply untrue.

D. D.\u201d in NATURE of February 13. When that gentleman refers to the slightly dogmatic tone of his original article he is not doing himself justice; the article was as dogmatic as it could possibly be. Now he asserts that there is no sense in the distinction between acquired characters and innate ones with regard to inheritance, that all characters are both acquired and innate. This in the accepted meaning of the words is simply untrue.

All the genera were considered to be extinct, and although they included both Aphidin\u00e6 and Schizoneurin\u00e6, they were found to differ from the modern representatives of these subfamilies in an important character running throughout the series\u2014the length and slenderness of the marginal or stigmatic cell. In this they also differ from the European Tertiary Aphidid\u00e6, although, according to Scudder, they resemble a species (Genaphis valdensis, Brodie) from the Jurassic of England. This Genaphis, however, has a short thick stigma, such as may be seen in some modern Chaitophorus, whereas the stigma in the Florissant forms is long and slender.","dc.creator":["COCKERELL, T. D.

This is satisfactory so far as it goes, but the main issue is still left very doubtful. In spite of the reduction of the cost of production by one-half, it appears that they are still in India at the mercy of climatic conditions, and even then, supposing these to be favourable for a few seasons, they have only \u201cevery reason to hope\u201d that they will be able to compete with their coal-tar rival. Those who have at heart the welfare of our Indian Empire will cordially endorse the wish that their hope may be realised, but the point at issue between the report to the Indian Government and the Planters' Association is really whether finality has been reached in the way of improvement. According to the statement of the secretary, they have been advised that no further improvement in the \u201cmain processes\u201d is possible. The results of the application of the newer methods of analysis indicate clearly enough that there is more indigotin in the plants than has hitherto been suspected.

A slight agitation of the water was sufficient to bring the young anemone in contact with the tentacles of one of the patriarchs of its own species. They immediately closed round it and a small part of the disk became emarginate. The greater part, however, was not sensibly affected, and the mouth remained closed. In less than two minutes the folded-in tentacles uncurled and the young anemone was thrust away with some force. It then came in contact with the tentacles of a second old Sagartia, and exactly the same thing occurred. Neither the young one nor the tentacles that had held it were apparently affected in any way. Immediately after the first old Sagartia had released the young one, I dropped on its tentacles, in the region which had temporarily been affected by contact with the latter, the body of a small isopod. The isopod was seized in exactly the same manner that the young anemone had been seized, but the movements soon spread to other tentacles, the mouth gaped open, and the isopod was swallowed. In other individuals of the same species I have noticed that small masses of food, such as this little isopod, remain apparently unobserved if dropped gently on to the disk within the tentacles without touching them, but that if the tentacles are then touched and in the movements that ensue come in contact with the food lying neglected on the disk, its presence is apparently realised and it is swallowed.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"89","prism.number":"2233","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"607","prism.endingPage":"607","prism.copyright":"1912 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/089607a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/089607a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/089607a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/089607a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Aged Sea Anemones","citation_volume":"89","citation_issue":"2233","citation_publication_date":"1912/08","citation_firstpage":"607","citation_lastpage":"607","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/089607a0","DOI":"10.1038/089607a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/089607a0","description":"IN 1904 Dr. J.

The remedy consisted in a more scientific cultivation and, in particular, in the application of so-called chemical manures, whereby, by moderate dressings, the then average world-yield of I2.7 bushels per acre would be increased to 20 bushels \u2014\u201cthus postponing the day of dearth to so distant a period that we, our sons, and grandsons may legitimately live without undue solicitude for the future.\u201d","dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=The Wheat Problem; citation_publication_date=1899; citation_id=CR1; citation_author=William Crookes"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The \u201cWheat Problem\u201d and Synthetic Nitrates","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;Emphasis Type=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;The &#8220;Wheat...","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"096492a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

But, as it seems to me, there will be long-sustained, oscillatory, motion. On rotating the disc by a small angle, the descending half will gain, and the ascending half will lose, heat. A turning-moment will arise, and will increase until the angle turned is \u00cf/2. It will then decrease until, when the angle turned is \u00cf, the moment is nil.

But, as it seems to me, there will be long-sustained, oscillatory, motion. On rotating the disc by a small angle, the descending half will gain, and the ascending half will lose, heat. A turning-moment will arise, and will increase until the angle turned is \u00cf/2. It will then decrease until, when the angle turned is \u00cf, the moment is nil. This position gives the condition, quoted by Sir Oliver Lodge, of thermal symmetry about the vertical diameter of the disc. As the disc continues to rotate, due to its momentum, a moment in a reverse sense will be set up, so that when the whole rotation is nearly 2\u00cf, the rotation will be reversed. We shall thus obtain an oscillatory motion, long sustained if small friction is involved. In the final position the disc will have rotated from its initial position by angle \u00cf.

The visual cortex must then integrate the information from these localized receptive fields to obtain a more global picture of the surrounding environment. We studied this process in single neurons within the middle temporal visual area (MT) of macaques using stimuli that produced conflicting local and global information about stimulus motion. Neuronal responses in alert animals initially reflected predominantly the ambiguous local motion features, but gradually converged to an unambiguous global representation.

The visual cortex must then integrate the information from these localized receptive fields to obtain a more global picture of the surrounding environment. We studied this process in single neurons within the middle temporal visual area (MT) of macaques using stimuli that produced conflicting local and global information about stimulus motion. Neuronal responses in alert animals initially reflected predominantly the ambiguous local motion features, but gradually converged to an unambiguous global representation. When the same animals were anaesthetized, the integration of local motion signals was markedly impaired even though neuronal responses remained vigorous and directional tuning characteristics were intact. Our results suggest that anaesthesia preferentially affects the visual processing responsible for integrating local signals into a global visual representation.","dc.creator":["Pack, Christopher C.","Berezovskii, Vladimir K.","Born, Richard T."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Psychol.

The experiments show that the eddy velocity varies in accordance with the new scale, while the size of the eddies varies with the well-known Rhines \u03b2-scale.

This view leads to a new velocity scale, which we have tested along with previously proposed length and velocity scales, using numerical climate simulations in which the eddy properties have been varied by changing forcing and boundary conditions. The experiments show that the eddy velocity varies in accordance with the new scale, while the size of the eddies varies with the well-known Rhines \u03b2-scale. Our results not only give new insight into atmospheric eddy heat transport, but also allow simple estimates of the intensities of mid-latitude storms, which have hitherto only been possible with expensive general circulation models.","dc.creator":["Barry, Leon","Craig, George C.","Thuburn, John"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Annu.

But the role of deep convective eddies, which result from surface cooling and mixing across density surfaces followed by geostrophic adjustment5, has not been fully taken into account in the description of the initiation and growth of convection6. Here we present tracer, float and hydrographic observations of long-lived (\u223c1 year) and compact (\u223c5\u2009km core diameter) vortices that reach down to depths of 2\u2009km.

But the role of deep convective eddies, which result from surface cooling and mixing across density surfaces followed by geostrophic adjustment5, has not been fully taken into account in the description of the initiation and growth of convection6. Here we present tracer, float and hydrographic observations of long-lived (\u223c1 year) and compact (\u223c5\u2009km core diameter) vortices that reach down to depths of 2\u2009km.

In the low-density limit, it is a composite Bose quasi-particle, akin to the hydrogen atom1. Just as in dilute atomic gases2,3, reducing the temperature or increasing the exciton density increases the occupation numbers of the low-energy states leading to quantum degeneracy and eventually to Bose\u2013Einstein condensation (BEC)1. Because the exciton mass is small\u2014even smaller than the free electron mass\u2014exciton BEC should occur at temperatures of about 1\u2009K, many orders of magnitude higher than for atoms. However, it is in practice difficult to reach BEC conditions, as the\u00a0temperature of excitons can considerably exceed that of the\u00a0semiconductor lattice. The search for exciton BEC has concentrated on long-lived excitons: the exciton lifetime against electron\u2013hole recombination therefore should exceed the characteristic timescale for the cooling of initially hot photo-generated excitons4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

In the low-density limit, it is a composite Bose quasi-particle, akin to the hydrogen atom1. Just as in dilute atomic gases2,3, reducing the temperature or increasing the exciton density increases the occupation numbers of the low-energy states leading to quantum degeneracy and eventually to Bose\u2013Einstein condensation (BEC)1. Because the exciton mass is small\u2014even smaller than the free electron mass\u2014exciton BEC should occur at temperatures of about 1\u2009K, many orders of magnitude higher than for atoms. However, it is in practice difficult to reach BEC conditions, as the\u00a0temperature of excitons can considerably exceed that of the\u00a0semiconductor lattice. The search for exciton BEC has concentrated on long-lived excitons: the exciton lifetime against electron\u2013hole recombination therefore should exceed the characteristic timescale for the cooling of initially hot photo-generated excitons4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Until now, all experiments on atom condensation were performed on atomic gases confined in the potential traps. Inspired by these experiments, and using specially designed semiconductor nanostructures, we have collected quasi-two-dimensional excitons in an in-plane potential trap.

In honeybee colonies the queen has a reproductive monopoly because the workers' ovaries are normally inactive and any eggs they do lay are eaten by other workers. But if a colony becomes queenless, workers start to lay eggs, stop policing and rear a last batch of males before the colony dies. Enter the workers of the Asian dwarf red honeybee. They can exploit this interval by laying their own eggs while no policing is in force. The queen of a honeybee colony has a reproductive monopoly because her workers' ovaries are normally inactive and any eggs that they do lay are eaten by their fellow workers1,2,3.

However, little is known about the genetic mediators of autophagy in mammalian cells or their role in tumour development. The mammalian gene encoding Beclin 1 (ref. 3), a novel Bcl-2-interacting, coiled-coil protein, has structural similarity to the yeast autophagy gene, apg6/vps30  (refs 4, 5), and is mono-allelically deleted in 40\u201375% of sporadic human breast cancers and ovarian cancers6. Here we show, using gene-transfer techniques, that beclin 1 promotes autophagy in autophagy-defective yeast with a targeted disruption of agp6/vps30, and in human MCF7 breast carcinoma cells. The autophagy-promoting activity of beclin 1 in MCF7 cells is associated with inhibition of MCF7 cellular proliferation, in vitro clonigenicity and tumorigenesis in nude mice. Furthermore, endogenous Beclin 1 protein expression is frequently low in human breast epithelial carcinoma cell lines and tissue, but is expressed ubiquitously at high levels in normal breast epithelia. Thus, beclin 1 is a mammalian autophagy gene that can inhibit tumorigenesis and is expressed at decreased levels in human breast carcinoma. These findings suggest that decreased expression of autophagy proteins may contribute to the development or progression of breast and other human malignancies.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"402","prism.number":"6762","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"672","prism.endingPage":"676","prism.copyright":"1999 Macmillian Magazines Ltd.","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/45257","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/45257","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/45257.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/45257","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Induction of autophagy and inhibition of tumorigenesis by beclin 1","citation_volume":"402","citation_issue":"6762","citation_publication_date":"1999/12","citation_firstpage":"672","citation_lastpage":"676","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/45257","DOI":"10.1038/45257","citation_doi":"10.1038/45257","description":"The process of autophagy, or bulk degradation of cellular proteins through an autophagosomic-lysosomal pathway1, is important in normal growth control and may be defective in tumour cells2. However, little is known about the genetic mediators of autophagy in mammalian cells or their role in tumour development. The mammalian gene encoding Beclin 1 (ref. 3), a novel Bcl-2-interacting, coiled-coil protein, has structural similarity to the yeast autophagy gene, apg6/vps30  (refs 4, 5), and is mono-allelically deleted in 40\u201375% of sporadic human breast cancers and ovarian cancers6. Here we show, using gene-transfer techniques, that beclin 1 promotes autophagy in autophagy-defective yeast with a targeted disruption of agp6/vps30, and in human MCF7 breast carcinoma cells. The autophagy-promoting activity of beclin 1 in MCF7 cells is associated with inhibition of MCF7 cellular proliferation, in vitro clonigenicity and tumorigenesis in nude mice. Furthermore, endogenous Beclin 1 protein expression is frequently low in human breast epithelial carcinoma cell lines and tissue, but is expressed ubiquitously at high levels in normal breast epithelia. Thus, beclin 1 is a mammalian autophagy gene that can inhibit tumorigenesis and is expressed at decreased levels in human breast carcinoma. These findings suggest that decreased expression of autophagy proteins may contribute to the development or progression of breast and other human malignancies.","dc.creator":["Liang, Xiao Huan","Jackson, Saadiya","Seaman, Matthew","Brown, Kristy","Kempkes, Bettina","Hibshoosh, Hanina","Levine, Beth"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Trends Cell Biol.; citation_title=Autophagy and related mechanisms of lyosomal-mediated protein degradation. ; citation_author=WAJ Dunn; citation_volume=4; citation_publication_date=1994; citation_pages=139- 143; citation_doi=10.1016/0962-8924(94)90069-8; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Carcinogenesis; citation_title=Reduced autophagic activity in primary rat hepatocellular carcinoma and ascites hepatoma cells.; citation_author=GO Kisen; citation_volume= 14; citation_publication_date=1993; citation_pages=2501-2505; citation_doi=10.1093/carcin/14.12.2501; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=J.

Normal and KHC rabbits aged 10\u201312, 22\u201324 and 34\u201336 months were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (30\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121, intravenous). Pulse waves at the ascending aorta were recorded simultaneously with those at the proximal, middle and distal thoracic and abdominal aortas by moving a catheter with three micromanometers (40-mm intervals) at 80-mm intervals from the origin of the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic diameter was measured using an intravascular imaging system at the same aortic position at which the pulse waves were measured. LPWV was the greatest in the aortic arch, decreased gradually in the thoracic aorta and increased again in the abdominal aorta in KHC rabbits, whereas it was the lowest in the aortic arch, increased slightly in the thoracic aorta and increased gradually in the abdominal aorta in normal rabbits. LPWV increased significantly with age in most aortic segments. The change pattern of LPWV resembled that of the percent fractional lesioned area where LPWV was determined. The significant increase in LPWV with age was mainly due to the increase in the elastic modulus of the aortic wall with atherosclerotic progression as well as the increase in wall thickness.

Here, we propose \u2018digital metamaterials\u2019 through two steps. First, we present \u2018coding metamaterials\u2019 that are composed of only two types of unit cells, with 0 and \u03c0 phase responses, which we name \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 elements, respectively. By coding \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 elements with controlled sequences (i.e., 1-bit coding), we can manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves and realize different functionalities. The concept of coding metamaterials can be extended from 1-bit coding to 2-bit coding or higher. In 2-bit coding, four types of unit cells, with phase responses of 0, \u03c0/2, \u03c0, and 3\u03c0/2, are required to mimic the \u201800\u2019, \u201801\u2019, \u201810\u2019 and \u201811\u2019 elements, respectively. The 2-bit coding has greater freedom than 1-bit coding for controlling EM waves. Second, we propose a unique metamaterial particle that has either a \u20180\u2019 or \u20181\u2019 response controlled by a biased diode. Based on this particle, we present \u2018digital metamaterials\u2019 with unit cells that possess either a \u20180\u2019 or \u20181\u2019 state. Using a field-programmable gate array, we realize digital control over the digital metamaterial. By programming different coding sequences, a single digital metamaterial has the ability to manipulate EM waves in different manners, thereby realizing \u2018programmable metamaterials\u2019. The above concepts and physical phenomena are confirmed through numerical simulations and experiments using metasurfaces. Smart materials offering great freedom in manipulating electromagnetic radiation have been developed. This exciting new concept was realized by Tie Jun Cui and co-workers at the Southeast University, China, who developed digital metamaterials consisting of two kinds of unit cells whose different phase responses allow them to act as \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 bits. These cells can be judiciously arranged in sequences to enable controlled manipulation of electromagnetic waves. This is one-bit coding; higher-bit coding is possible by employing more kinds of unit cells. The researchers developed a metamaterial cell whose binary response can be controlled by a biased diode. By using a field-programmable gate array, they demonstrated that this digital metamaterial can be programmed. Such metamaterials are attractive for controlling radiation beams in antennas and for realizing other \u2018smart\u2019 metamaterials.","prism.publicationName":"Light: Science & Applications","prism.publicationDate":"2014-10-24","prism.volume":"3","prism.number":"10","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"e218","prism.endingPage":"e218","prism.copyright":"2014 The Author(s)","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201499","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2014.99","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201499.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201499","citation_journal_title":"Light: Science & Applications","citation_journal_abbrev":"Light Sci Appl","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"2047-7538","citation_title":"Coding metamaterials, digital metamaterials and programmable metamaterials","citation_volume":"3","citation_issue":"10","citation_publication_date":"2014/10","citation_online_date":"2014/10/24","citation_firstpage":"e218","citation_lastpage":"e218","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2014.99","DOI":"10.1038/lsa.2014.99","citation_doi":"10.1038/lsa.2014.99","description":"Metamaterials are artificial structures that are usually described by effective medium parameters on the macroscopic scale, and these metamaterials are referred to as \u2018analog metamaterials\u2019.
