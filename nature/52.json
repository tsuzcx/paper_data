Although it is with great diffidence that I venture to differ from Professor Newton, I still cannot help considering Dr. Baidamus' theory as \u201cwild\u201d, not perhaps as it appears under the manipulation of Professor Newton, for he seems to me to have pruned and pared it down so nicely that there is but little of the original left; and I think he would not much differ from me in my opinion as to the wildness of the theory, if he had to accept all the allegations in Dr. Baldamus' paper published in Naumannia.* For instance, compare the following passage in Professor Newton's paper in No. III. of NATURE with some passages from Dr. Baldamus' paper:\u2014 \u201cHaving said thus much, and believing as I do the Doctor to be partly justified in the carefully-worded enunciation of what he calls \u2018a law of nature,\u2019 I must now declare that it is only \u2018approximately,\u2019 and by no means universally true, that the Cuckow's egg is coloured like those of the victims of her imposition. Increase as we may by renewed observations the number of cases which bear in favour of his theory, yet, as almost every bird's-nesting boy knows, the instances in which we cannot, even by dint of straining our fancy, see resemblances where none exist, are still so numerous as to preclude me from believing in the generality of the practice imputed to the Cuckow. In proof of this I have only to mention the many eggs of that bird which are yearly found in nests of the Hedge-Sparrow in this country, without ever bearing the faintest similarity to its well-known green-blue eggs. One may grant that an ordinary English Cuckow's egg will pass well enough, in the eyes of the dupe, for that of a Titlark, a Pied Wagtail, or a Reed Wren, which according to my experience are the most common foster-parents of the Cuckow in this country; and indeed one may say, perhaps, that such an egg is a compromise between the three, or a resultant, perhaps, of the three opposing forces; but any likeness between the Hedge-Sparrow's egg and the Cuckow's so often found alongside of it, or in its place, is not to be traced by the most fertile imagination. We must keep, therefore, strictly to the letter of the law laid down by Dr. Baldamus, and the practice imputed to the Cuckow is not universally, but only approximately true.\u201d This certainly is very different from Dr. Baldamus' own statement:\u2014 \u201cIf Mr. Braune, the forester of Griezland, had not cut this large Willow Wren's (Shippolais) egg (as it seems) out of the ovary of the Cuckoo, which was killed as she was flying out of the Willow Wren's nest; if Count R\u00f6dern, of Breslau, was not a reliable authority that this apparent Redstart's egg was taken out of the nest of the Redstart (Ruticilla ph\u0153nicurus); if M. Halricht had not taken this large Tree Pipit's egg out of the nest of a Tree Pipit (Anthus arboreus); if I myself had not taken out of the nests of the Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio) this reddish and this green-greyish peculiarly marked Cuckoo's egg, one might indeed entertain doubts whether this variously-coloured collection\u2014these green eggs, with and without markings; these on white, grey, green, greenish, brownish, yellowish, reddish, and brown-reddish ground; these grey, green, olive green, ash grey, yellow brown, yellow red, wine red, brown red, dark brown and black; these spotted, streaked, speckled, grained and marbled eggs could one and all be the eggs of our Cuckoo! And yet this is indeed the fact!\u201d How different this from the much more cautious and limited statement of Professor Newton, first quoted, which would entirely sweep away some of these varieties, especially those resembling the eggs of the Redstart or the Hedge-Sparrow, for the eggs of these two species do not differ much from each other, and what might be said of the eggs of the one would apply equally to those of the other; yet these are two of Dr. Baldamus' selected species, for, a little further on, he gives a list of the various species from the nests of which Cuckoo's eggs have been taken resembling those of the foster-parent. Of the eggs of the Redstart he says:\u2014\u201cThese four specimens, which were found in the nests of Ruticilla ph\u0153nicurus, are all of a light-green ground colour; two of them have the larger and more or less brownish spots, which on one of them form a zone; the third has similar markings, but only sparingly scattered over the whole surface, whilst the fourth is without any marking at all\u2014herein it is identical with one in the possession of Dr. Dehne, which is uniformly light-greenish blue, without any markings whatsoever.\u201d","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"1","prism.number":"9","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"242","prism.endingPage":"243","prism.copyright":"1869 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/001242a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/001242a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/001242a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/001242a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Colouring of the Cuckow's Egg","citation_volume":"1","citation_issue":"9","citation_publication_date":"1869/12","citation_firstpage":"242","citation_lastpage":"243","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/001242a0","DOI":"10.1038/001242a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/001242a0","description":"As I see Professor Newton has, in his very interesting paper on Dr. Baldamus' theory of the colour of Cuckoo's eggs, noticed my \u201cstigmatising\u201d the Doctor's theory as \u201cwild\u201d, in my \u201cBirds of Somerset\u201d, will you be kind enough to allow me space for a few lines on the subject?

On arriving at the \u201cscene of operations\u201d at the appointed time, I found that the flags had been fixed, and that the spirit-level had been adjusted for some time before my arrival. I immediately protested, and demanded that I and the friends with me should go and measure the altitude of each flag, but an obstinate resistance was offered to this, and also to any interference with the adjustment of the \u201clevel.\u201d I therefore at once declined to be longer present, and returned to Norwich, where the whole matter was exposed at a public meeting. Notwithstanding the manifest injustice of the attempt, and my refusal to have anything to do with it the moment I discovered its unfairness, these wise and clever and very just Newtonians would have the world believe that they had once and for ever settled the question of the earth's true form and magnitude. Such tricks are unworthy of the cause, and the men who can condescend to deal in them can do no real service to the school to which they belong.","dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Rotundity of the Earth","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Rotundity of the Earth&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"002295b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Meyer in No. 116, vol. v. of NATURE, respecting earthquakes in the Island of Celebes, he states that the often-repeated story of the keepers of permanent magnets detaching themselves, and falling at the moment of an earthquake shock, was never verified in his experience. If I remember rightly, this peculiar action was first mentioned by a Frenchman living on the west coast of South America, and much doubted by many at the time.

Meyer in No. 116, vol. v. of NATURE, respecting earthquakes in the Island of Celebes, he states that the often-repeated story of the keepers of permanent magnets detaching themselves, and falling at the moment of an earthquake shock, was never verified in his experience. If I remember rightly, this peculiar action was first mentioned by a Frenchman living on the west coast of South America, and much doubted by many at the time.

Carpenter states that the average specific gravity of surface-water, at a sufficient distance from land to be unaffected by local disturbances, was 1\u00b702779, At p. 513, Dr. Frankland gives the specific gravity of four samples of surface-water, the mean of which is only 1\u00b70267, even less than the minimum value as given by Mr. Carpenter. Both results are said to be for temperature 60\u00b0 F. I should have expected Dr. Frankland's determination to have been the higher, from possible loss by evaporation. The difference may probably be due to want of identity of indication between the instruments used.

Carpenter states that the average specific gravity of surface-water, at a sufficient distance from land to be unaffected by local disturbances, was 1\u00b702779, At p. 513, Dr. Frankland gives the specific gravity of four samples of surface-water, the mean of which is only 1\u00b70267, even less than the minimum value as given by Mr. Carpenter. Both results are said to be for temperature 60\u00b0 F. I should have expected Dr. Frankland's determination to have been the higher, from possible loss by evaporation. The difference may probably be due to want of identity of indication between the instruments used.

Prof. Barrett supplied me with many useful references, and with one at least the want of which led me to misrepresent his connection with the discovery of sensitive properties in suitably adjusted wire-gauze flames, for which I had sought in magazines and journals for some months previously in vain. A note of the original description of Mr. Barry's experiment in NATURE, vol. v. p. 30, had in the meantime been pointed out to me in another record of very similar experiments, which is itself also, I have no doubt, the same account of \u201cfurther experiments with the same kind of flame,\u201d that Prof. Barrett cites as appearing in the Journal of the Franklin Institute for April 1872, to which I have not been able to obtain access. The nearer channel to which I was referred for its perusal is the Philosophical Magazine for June 1872, where a paper is briefly extracted from the American Journal of Science of the preceding month, describing new experiments with Barry's sensitive flame, by Mr. W. E. Geyer, of the Stevens Institute of Technology, in the United States. By placing a wide tube over the flame at a proper height it became sounding, or, if silent, might be made sensitive in such a way as to sound at the slightest hiss or rustle, and on producing any jingling or tinkling sounds in its neighbourhood. Thus the flame sounded twice on pronouncing to it the word \u201csensitive,\u201d showing its instantaneous affection even by momentary sibilant sounds. By varying the experiment, an opposite condition of the flame was obtained, in which it continued sounding until checked by a hiss or rustle from without. It is observed by the editor of the American Journal of Science, in a note to Mr. Geyer's paper, that in the number for September 1871, of the Moniteur Scientifique, a form of apparatus and experiment apparently identical with Mr. Barry's is noticed as having been made by Prof. Govi at Turin, and this was a few months prior to the letter in which the account of his experiments is given by Mr. Barry to Prof. Tyndall. Thus the sensitive properties of certain wire-gauze flames, like the property of such flames to excite very readily musical vibrations, may have had many independent discoverers; the value of such discoveries is now, as it must have ever been, the new light which one is capable of throwing upon another. The rapid publication of results urgently requires their frequent collection and comparison together; and this process, pressing and urgent as it is, seldom fails in experienced hands to prove a connection, to bind together a chain of consequences, and to leave a subject in general better explored and embellished with new-found illustrations than it was before. Such was the successful treatment, a few years ago, by Prof. Tyndall, of the question of sounding and sensitive flames, when it was shown by beautiful illustrations of Savart's sensitive water-jets, and by equally ingenious and new experiments with smoke-jets as substitutes for flames, that sensitiveness is a residing property of liquid veins and gas-jets, independently, in the latter case, of their being lighted. The laws of fluid pressure and motion, and apparently foremost of all those of capillary attraction in liquids and of mutual friction and diffusion in gases, and not the energies of heat and combustion of a flame, preside principally over the observed phenomena. The bifurcated head, or low ruffled brush to which the tall wand-like sensitive jet is suddenly reduced, is but the glowing representation of the form which, if it were visible to the eye, the unlighted jet would, under the same circumstances, be observed to take. This is at least in general terms, and perhaps also in plain and fairly accurate statement of the real facts, the simple result which the collection and elucidation of the most brilliant then known experiments illustrating sensitive flames, led a philosopher of Prof. Tyndall's enlightened sagacity and skill in physical investigations to adopt. There can be no doubt of its substantial correctness in the increasing array of cases to which it may be successfully applied. The flame is but an illuminuated effigy of some of the lowest parts of the issuing gas column, whether tranquil or disturbed, whose upper parts it removes and replaces by products of combustion. The lower parts are also marred in their form by heat, but not so much as to obliterate the original character, shape, and dimensions of the part of the gas column that it represents. The flame terminates upwards, and ceases to represent the unlighted column further when it has found surface of contact enough with the outer air to effect the complete combustion of the gas. The up-draught of violently heated products of combustion near the base impedes the access of fresh air to parts near the summit of the flame, and it must, besides, deform them otherwise, sometimes even rhythmically, as in the unsteady throbbing flame of an ill-trimmed lamp or of a candle burning in its socket. The noisy roar with which flaring of gas-flames is attended tells us also of the uneven mixture of the gas and air supplies with each other in the flame, and reminds us of the rapid fire of small explosions that must probably introduce new sources of confusion in its form. If these explosions, however, are regularly timed, they can be made to maintain the simple musical note of harmonic flames ; and these flames again, wholly dependent as they appear to be on their combustion for the musical sounds that they emit, must, it appears from Count Schaffgotch's and Prof. Tyndall's well-known experiments, when placed in certain circumstances of silence and indifference in an open tube, be aided by the voice at a distance to commence their song. The signal-note first raises certain mechanical vibrations in the gas-current of the narrow jet, that are necessary in the outset to produce commotions enough of the singing flame to make it able to continue and maintain them. The sensitive sounding-flame of Mr. Geyer bears a similar explanation, for not being regularly adjusted, although very nearly so, to continued sounding, a rustle sufficient to flurry the sensitive wire-gauze flame under the open tube creates in it so many brisk explosions, that the resonance of the sounding-tube is excited, and is at once exalted to a loud note by the rhythmical expansions of the flame ; but with the cessation of the external sound the maintaining impulse ceases, and the wire-gauze flame whose commotions must be kept up in order to maintain the note immediately becomes as silent as before.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"11","prism.number":"262","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"6","prism.endingPage":"8","prism.copyright":"1874 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/011006b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/011006b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/011006b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/011006b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Sounding and Sensitive Flames","citation_volume":"11","citation_issue":"262","citation_publication_date":"1874/11","citation_firstpage":"6","citation_lastpage":"8","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/011006b0","DOI":"10.1038/011006b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/011006b0","description":"A SEVERE indisposition, which disabled me from correspondence during nearly the whole of last month, prevented me from acknowledging as soon as it appeared in NATURE (vol. x. p. 244) Prof. Barrett's excellent communication on Sounding and Sensitive Flames, replying to my letter on the same subject at page 233 of this volume.

I had looked, if not for new geological facts, at least for something novel in the treatment of what was already known, instead of which the geological speakers seem, for the most part, to have merely reiterated opinions with which their names have been for some time identified. Thus my able opponent, Prof. Boyd Dawkins, does no more than restate views and conclusions which have already been controverted more than once, and to which, therefore, I need not reply here, as in so doing I should be only summarising what has been stated at length elsewhere. Mr. Dawkins's \u201ccase\u201d and my own are now so fully before our fellow-hammerers that we may be well content to leave them for judgment to the future\u2014a future which is probably not far off. Prof. Prestwich, again, while quite open to conviction that man may have lived in England in pre-glacial times, is yet strongly of opinion that all the human relics hitherto obtained in the south of England are of post-glacial age, because they occur in deposits that overlie \u201cthe boulder-clay.\u201d Now this conclusion would certainly follow if it could be shown that the \u201cchalky boulder-clay\u201d of East Anglia represents, as Prof. Prestwich thinks it does, the glacial period. Unfortunately it only represents one phase of that period. There is an older boulder-clay than that \u201cchalky till,\u201d and there are two separate boulder-clays which are younger, as Mr. S. V. Wood has demonstrated. The East Anglian chalky boulder-clay was laid down, as I believe, during the climax of glacial cold, and is consequently much older than the upper boulder-clays that occupy the surface of Scotland and the North of England. For the evidence which has weighed with me incoming to this conclusion I must refer Prof. Prestwich to the account of the English glacial deposits, which is given in the second edition of my work on the Ice Age. The proofs and argument are too long to recapitulate here. That the East Anglian chalky till belongs to a much more ancient date than the upper boulder clays of Yorkshire and the North, must strike any one who will take the trouble to compare them. The East Anglian deposit has been subjected to long-continued and powerful erosion, and everywhere bears the impress of extreme antiquity, while the younger tills of the North have a comparatively recent appearance. Nor is this by any means all, for between the accumulation of the chalky till and the formation of the most recent boulder-clay or till of the North there certainly intervened one mild inter-glacial period. (There were in reality, as I believe, two such periods.) Now during the \u201clast inter-glacial period\u201d\u2014that, namely, which preceded the deposition of the youngest boulder-clay of Yorkshire and the North\u2014there certainly existed a land-surface in England over which the pleistocene mammalia roamed. The proofs of this are found in certain fresh-water and estuarine deposits which are met with near Hull and elsewhere, and which have yielded mammalian remains, and thousands of Cyrena fluminalis and other shells. Prof. Prestwich has himself described these beds and classified them as post-glacial, partly because they repose upon boulder-clay and partly on account of their fossil contents. But since the date of Prof. Prestwich's visit to the locality in question, the section (near Burstwick) has been much better opened up, and now one may see resting upon these so-called post-glacial deposits a thick mass of tumultuous boulder-clay. This boulder-clay is in my opinion as truly the product of glacier-ice as any ground-moraine or till in Scotland, Norway, or Switzerland, and points to a time when all Scotland and the northern districts of England, down as far as the valley of the Humber, were shrouded in snow and ice.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"16","prism.number":"399","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"141","prism.endingPage":"142","prism.copyright":"1877 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/016141b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/016141b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/016141b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/016141b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Antiquity of Man","citation_volume":"16","citation_issue":"399","citation_publication_date":"1877/06","citation_firstpage":"141","citation_lastpage":"142","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/016141b0","DOI":"10.1038/016141b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/016141b0","description":"HAVING carefully perused the proceedings that took place at the recent \u201cConference\u201d on the subject of the antiquity of man at the Anthropological Institute, I confess to a feeling of disappointment.

In an instrument exhibited at the Royal Society soir\u00e9e, 1876, I could have left the matter resting at this point, but I am induced to write by the letter of your correspondent, \u201cB\u201d, in vol. xvii. p. 486, who says, \u201cThe chief merit in this matter will belong to the person who puts the idea into a working form which can be proved capable of giving accurate results.\u201d As I think that I have fairly attained this end, or at least pointed out the way to it, with your permission I will describe the means which appears by the correspondence interesting to many of your readers. In my cumulative temperature clock the important element, the pendulum, is constructed as follows:\u2014A steel cylindrical tube 32 inches long, 1\u00be inch internal diameter, is hermetically closed at both ends. A rod is attached to one of the ends, which is placed uppermost, to connect this pendulum with the clockwork in the ordinary manner. An airtight division is made across the tube or chamber at 5 inches from the upper end. A small tube leads from this division to the bottom of the chamber. A conical plug is inserted in the upper chamber, to be hereafter described. A screw plug is placed under the small tube in the outer tube to enable the upper chamber to be filled with mercury. When the pendulum is so constructed, the lower screw plug is removed, and the upper chamber and leading tube filled with mercury by means of a small funnel. In this full state the mercury is boiled, and the whole inverted. It then becomes a steel barometer. To convert it into a thermometer, a small air-hole is made in the outer tube (this is not shown in the engraving), and this hole is closed up with a small air-tight cock filled with a porous material. When this is screwed on and turned off, it is isolated from atmospheric pressure, and the mercury rises into the upper chamber by any increase of temperature causing expansion of air in the tube, and sinks in the same manner by loss of temperature, so that the pendulum becomes simply an air thermometer. The pressure of the air by expansion within the tube in the rising of the mercury changes the centre of oscillation of the pendulum and accelerates the clock, and vice vers\u00e2.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"18","prism.number":"445","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"41","prism.endingPage":"41","prism.copyright":"1878 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/018041a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/018041a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/018041a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/018041a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Cumulative Temparature","citation_volume":"18","citation_issue":"445","citation_publication_date":"1878/05","citation_firstpage":"41","citation_lastpage":"41","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/018041a0","DOI":"10.1038/018041a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/018041a0","description":"ATTENTION has been called in your valuable paper to the idea of registering cumulative temperatures by means of a pendulum, by M. von Sterneck, vol. xvii. p. 308, and this has called forth several letters.

Both Minos and Rhadanianthus evidently seemed to listen to the debate.

On my removal from Blackheath to Dublin, I placed him for a few weeks in the Zoological Society's Gardens, Regent's Park. Being in London in May I brought him with me on my return to this city. I went to the Gardens for him myself, and was interested and somewhat pleased to find, on speaking to him, that he had apparently forgotten me. On my way, in a cab, to the hotel where I was staying, he was very friendly; but on my arrival there, as soon as I took off my hat, it was evident that he recognised me, for his old manner at once returned. On arrival here he appeared to remember my children, and resumed his former friendliness towards them, but he still regards me as his enemy.","dc.creator":["WHITMEE, S.

BOTTOMLEY'S extremely interesting experiments briefly described in NATURE, vol. xxiii. pp. 218 and 243, appear to have a very important bearing on the question of atmospheric electricity; for if such high vacua are good conductors of electricity we have reason for thinking that the electrical conditions of our globe will be very different from what we have been accustomed to regard them. The layers of denser air surrounding the conducting matter of the globe will act like the glass of Mr. Bottomley's tubes in maintaining by a Leyden-jar-like action any difference of potential that there may be between their inner and their outer surface. Again, in the piercing of the glass tube by a minute spark, we have the analogue of the lightning flash between the clouds and the earth; the insulating layer in each case giving way, when, owing to an excessive increase in the surface density of the charge at any point, the dielectric stress exceeds the limits of the dielectric strength of the medium. The internal luminous effects observed by Mr. Bottomley as the result of change in the distribution of the external charge of electricity will be the physical analogues of the aurora, with this difference, that they take place in the ultra-gaseous interior, whereas in the case of our globe the luminous phenomena take place in the ultra-gaseous (i.e. highly rarefied) exterior regions of the atmosphere. It would be interesting to learn whether such discharges present any other analogies with auroral phenomena. I should be particularly interested in learning whether the conditions under which such luminous effects are obtained give any support to the theory which I think to be the only consistent one, that the aurora is due not to electrical discharges from regions of less atmospheric density to regions of a greater density (or vice vers\u00e2), but to electrical discharges in a region of pretty uniform (and small) density, and in which region differences of electric potential exist. According to this view the auroral streaks which appear to be radial should in reality lie approximately parallel to the earth's surface, and not stand (as most persons imagine) normal to it. A series of horizontal parallel lines drawn across the sky in a direction approximately north and south would necessarily appear to an observer on the earth's urface foreshortened into a set of lines diverging in fan-like forms at either the north point or the south point of the horizon.

Nevertheless this occurs with the non-parasitic North American cuckoo. If it had not been for this latter case, it might have been argued that the habit of the common cuckoo to lay her eggs at much longer intervals of time than do most other birds, was an adaptation to give her time to search for foster-parents. The Rhea or South American ostrich is believed likewise to lay her eggs at intervals of two or three days, and several hens deposit their eggs in the same nest on which the male sits; so that one hen may almost be said to be parasitic on another hen. These facts formerly made me very curious to learn how the several species of Molothrus, which are parasitic on other birds in very varying degrees, laid their eggs; and I have just received a letter from Mr. W. Nation, dated Lima, September 22, 1881, giving me information on this head. He says that he has there kept in confinement for a long time Molothrus perpurascens, and has likewise observed its habits in a state of nature. It is a resident species of Western Peru, and lays its eggs exclusively in the nests of a sparrow (Zonotrichia), starling (Sturnella bellicosa), and a pipit (\u00c6nthus chii). He then proceeds: \u201cThe eggs of the sparrow are very much like those of the Molothrus in size and colour. The eggs of the starling are larger and somewhat different in colour; while the eggs of the pipit are very different both in size and colour. Generally one egg of the Molothrus is found in a nest, but I have found as many as six. The young Molothrus does not always eject its foster-brothers; for I have seen a young one nearly fully feathered in a nest with two young starlings. I have also found two young birds of the Molothrus nearly fully feathered in the nest of a starling; but in this instance the young starlings had been ejected from the nest.\u201d He then states that he had long kept in confinement a male and female of this species of Molothrus, which are now six years old. The hen began to lay at the age of two years, and has laid each time six eggs, which is the number laid by Icterus, a near ally of Molothrus. The dates on which the eggs were laid this year are as follows:\u2014 February 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, and 26; so that there was an interval of exactly four clear days between the laying of each egg. Later in the season she laid six additional eggs, but at much longer intervals and irregularly, viz. on March 8, April 6 and 13, May 1, 16, and 21. These interesting facts, observed by Mr. Nation in relation to a bird so widely distinct from the cuckoo as is the Molothrus, strongly support the conclusion that there is some close connection between parasitism and the laying of eggs at considerable intervals of time. Mr. Nation adds that in the genus Molothrus, out of every three young birds he has invariably found two to be males; whereas with Sturnella, which lays only three eggs, two of the young birds are, without any exception, females.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"25","prism.number":"629","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"51","prism.endingPage":"52","prism.copyright":"1881 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/025051b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/025051b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/025051b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/025051b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Parasitic Habits of Molothrus","citation_volume":"25","citation_issue":"629","citation_publication_date":"1881/11","citation_firstpage":"51","citation_lastpage":"52","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/025051b0","DOI":"10.1038/025051b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/025051b0","description":"IN the \u201cOrigin of Species\u201d I adopted the view maintained by some writers, that the cuckoo lays her eggs in other birds' nests, owing to her habit of laying them at intervals of two or three days; for it could hardly fail to be disadvantageous to her, more especially as she has to migrate at a very early period, to have young birds of different ages and eggs all together in the same nest.

Seeking for an explanation, led me to recognise a new fact about colour perception which may be of interest to your readers. The reason of the hand appearing blue when in rapid motion was because the continual use of the red light had fatigued that part of the retina responsive to it, and the light reflected from the hand impinging for a very short time on the retina, was not strong enough to excite the sensation of red, but was quite sufficient for blue, the nerves responding to this colour having been rendered acutely sensitive by complete rest. To test this hypothesis, I obtained some dark blue glass and applied it to the window of the dark room, removing the red. On repeating the experiment, the eye with its blue sense exhausted, saw rapidly-moving objects reddish. Now from this it is clear that it takes a longer time to cause a sensation in an exhausted than in a fresh organ. It also gives a direct proof of Helmholtz's suggestion, \u201cthat actual coloured light does not produce sensations of absolutely pure colour; that red, for instance, even when completely freed from all admixture of white light, still does not excite those nervous fibres alone which are sensitive to impressions of red, but also to a very slight degree those which are sensitive to green, and perhaps to a still smaller extent those which are sensitive to violet rays\u201d (\u201cPopular Scientific Lectures,\u201d first series, p. 223). These observations have led me to an explanation of a very curious phenomenon brought under my notice by my friend, Mr. Napier Smith. When discs of paper on which black spaces have been marked, so that on rotation the eye receives impressions of black and white too rapidly to notice the pattern, but too slowly to combine into a neutral gray, the rotating card appears to be distinctly coloured, especially when it is looked at without keen attention, or as we may say passively. All colours may be seen, but red and blue were the most distinct to me. I at first thought that the colour might arise out of the paper and ink, the former being perhaps tinted with blue to whiten it in manufacture, and the latter probably a dark brown; but on looking several times at the rotating discs, and acquiring the power of looking passively the intensity of the colours could not be so accounted for. The true explanation is found, I believe, in the fact that the different colour organs require longer or shorter periods of excitation before responding to the stimulus, and that those which require the longest periods also retain the sensation longest. I have only made very rough trials, but they point to the fact that the eye responds quickest to red, so that the most rapid alternation will appear reddish, a little slower green will come in, and cause some indescribable colours, such as are seen in the polariscope, and lastly, when green and red are about equal, and producing white, blue will be seen. The blue is best seen with a slow rotation, and a large amount of black, because the red and green impressions have time to die out, and the blue (the most persistent) remains alone, showing like a fine fluorescent layer overlying the disc. I have not at present the time, or I would attempt to find out the excitation-periods for the different colours by this method, and I believe that a finer mode of applying it might determine the real number of colour-sensations, and allow of a decision being arrived at between the theories of Young and Hering.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"25","prism.number":"652","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"604","prism.endingPage":"605","prism.copyright":"1882 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/025604c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/025604c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/025604c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/025604c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Colour Perception","citation_volume":"25","citation_issue":"652","citation_publication_date":"1882/04","citation_firstpage":"604","citation_lastpage":"605","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/025604c0","DOI":"10.1038/025604c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/025604c0","description":"WHILE working at dry-plate photography in a ruby light, I noticed that when any light-coloured article, such as the hand, was rapidly moved, it appeared of a brilliant greenish-blue, in which blue predominated, while, when slowly moved, it appeared of the same colour as the other objects in the room.

The sun had set about half an hour. I happened at the time to be looking intently at that part of the north-east sky in which it appeared. What struck me most was the brilliant sparkling silvery light given off by the fragments into which it divided just before disappearing.

Experiments had been made with some degree of success with burners having one and two wicks, but all attempts to burn paraffin efficiently in the large concentric-wick burners were unsuccessful until Capt. Doty solved the problem. Unaware of what had been done in France, Messrs. Stevenson, early in 1870, had been conducting a train of experiments on paraffin, and had reached important conclusions on the subject, and good flames were got with the single and double Argand lamps, when Capt. Doty submitted his burners to them. The Doty burners were then subjected to crucial tests in Edinburgh, and also to actual trial for a month in a first-order lighthouse. The conclusions Messrs. Stevenson then arrived at and reported to the Scottish Lighthouse Board may be summarized as follows: that paraffin as now manufactured, with a high flashing-point, is safe and suitable as a lighthouse illuminant; the flames of the Doty burners are of great purity and intensity, and easily maintained at the standard height; the lamp-glasses and lamps in use for colza are equally suitable for paraffin; the varying state of the atmosphere does not affect the penetrability of the paraffin light more than the colza light; no structural alterations on the existing apparatus are necessary; the initial power of the lights will be exalted from 10 per cent, in the four-wick burner to fully 100 per cent, in the single-wick burner; and that the use in the Scottish lighthouses of the new illuminant would effect an annual saving of \u00a33478.

About a year ago it became necessary to examine this demonstration for the purpose of having it reported upon in an historical work. The University Libraries in Scotland were applied to in succession, but no copy could be heard of. Inquiries made at the more important libraries in Cambridge by friends resident there, or by letter, ended in the same unsatisfactory way. Letters, followed by an actual visit, to several libraries in London, brought no better result; and after every possible biographical scrap about Mollweide had been ferreted out in the British Museum, the suspicion began to form itself that some curious error had crept into Baltzer's footnote. In order to get to the bottom of the matter, the excellent mathematical library of G\u00f6ttingen University was next applied to, and the library of Giessen University, where Baltzer was Professor; but in both cases in vain. A last effort was then made about a month ago in a letter to the University Library of Leipzig, where the reputed author Mollweide had taught, and where the \u201cDemonstratio\u201d (or Demon, as it had for more than one reason come to be called) had been published. Even here, at first, there was failure. But Prof. Virchl, who most kindly interested himself in the matter, was soon successful in his quest. What he found, however, was not a \u201cDemonstratio\u201d by Mollweide; the title was simply as follows: \u201cAd memoriam Kregelio-Sternbachianam in auditorio philosophorum die xviii. Julii, MDCCCXI. h. ix. celebrandam invitant ordinum Academi\u00e6 Lips. Decani seniores c\u00e6terique adsessores\u2014\u2018Demonstratio eliminationis Cramerian\u00e6.\u2019 \u201d Either, therefore, no author should have been mentioned by Baltzer, or an indication should have been given that Mollweide's name was an interpolation in the title. One or other of these courses would likewise have been less hurtful to Baltzer's reputation for accuracy; for, after all, Mollweide was not the author. In the Leipzig Library Catalogue the work is entered under the name of De Prasse, and Prof. Virchl had no doubt whatever, for perfectly conclusive reasons which he gave, that De Prasse was the author. The work extends to only 15 pages quarto, and is considered by the same authority to be very rare.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"37","prism.number":"950","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"246","prism.endingPage":"247","prism.copyright":"1888 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/037246c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/037246c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/037246c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/037246c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"An Incorrect Footnote and its Consequences","citation_volume":"37","citation_issue":"950","citation_publication_date":"1888/01","citation_firstpage":"246","citation_lastpage":"247","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/037246c0","DOI":"10.1038/037246c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/037246c0","description":"IN all the five editions of Baltzer's \u201cTheorie und Anwendung der Determinanten\u201d there stands at the foot of the first page an historical note, in which reference is made to a work entitled, \u201cDemonstratio eliminationis Cramerian\u00e6,\u201d by Mollweide (Leipzig, 1811).

A last effort was then made about a month ago in a letter to the University Library of Leipzig, where the reputed author Mollweide had taught, and where the \u201cDemonstratio\u201d (or Demon, as it had for more than one reason come to be called) had been published. Even here, at first, there was failure. But Prof. Virchl, who most kindly interested himself in the matter, was soon successful in his quest. What he found, however, was not a \u201cDemonstratio\u201d by Mollweide; the title was simply as follows: \u201cAd memoriam Kregelio-Sternbachianam in auditorio philosophorum die xviii. Julii, MDCCCXI. h. ix. celebrandam invitant ordinum Academi\u00e6 Lips. Decani seniores c\u00e6terique adsessores\u2014\u2018Demonstratio eliminationis Cramerian\u00e6.\u2019 \u201d Either, therefore, no author should have been mentioned by Baltzer, or an indication should have been given that Mollweide's name was an interpolation in the title. One or other of these courses would likewise have been less hurtful to Baltzer's reputation for accuracy; for, after all, Mollweide was not the author. In the Leipzig Library Catalogue the work is entered under the name of De Prasse, and Prof. Virchl had no doubt whatever, for perfectly conclusive reasons which he gave, that De Prasse was the author. The work extends to only 15 pages quarto, and is considered by the same authority to be very rare.","dc.creator":["MUIR, THOMAS"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MUIR, THOMAS"],"citation_author_institution":["Bothwell, Glasgow"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"An Incorrect Footnote and its Consequences","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;An Incorrect Footnote and its Consequences&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"037275a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It will be seen that he lays the-oysters one by one carefully in tiers up to the top of the barrel, and then lays another tier rising above the level of the top. Having done this, he places the lid of the barrel on this exuberant tier, and thumps and rattles the barrel on a stone pavement or other solid ground until, by close packing of the whole, it descends to the level of the barrel top. The mass of oysters being thus compressed so as to render the slightest gaping of any one quite impossible, he firmly nails down the head of the barrel.","dc.creator":["WILLIAMS, W.

To verify this conclusion Mr. Kidd hacked out a piece with the axe, and we prepared a rough plate six inches long and three thick, which we examined in the polariscope. The rings and cross were easily seen, and the plate proved to be all one crystal with the optic axis vertical in situ.","dc.creator":["MCCONNEL, JAMES C."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MCCONNEL, JAMES C."],"citation_author_institution":["Davos Platz"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Crystallization of Lake Ice","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Crystallization of Lake Ice&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"039390a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It has been observed about fifteen times on the summit of Ben Nevis during the last five years, and these cases are described, and the accompanying weather discussed, in a paper by Mr. Rankin, of the Ben Nevis Observatory, published in the last number of the Journal of the Scottish Meteorological Society.

Obviously, they would all be attracted to it and discharge against it. Suppose the positive charge of this conductor to be continually renewed, and the negatively-charged molecules continually supplied, which conditions can be obtained by connecting the middle plate to the positive electrode of the lamp, the obvious result will be to produce a current of electricity flowing through the wire or galvanometer, by means of which this middle plate is connected to the positive electrode of the lamp. If, however, the middle plate is connected to the negative electrode of the lamp, the negatively-charged molecules can give up no charge to it, and produce no current in the interpolated galvanometer.

The interesting fact he records of the spontaneous invention and use of child-names for objects is not unknown to philologists. The phenomenon has been previously noticed, among others, by Miss Watson, of Boston, and Dr. E. R. Hun, of Albany, U.S.A.; by Archdeacon Farrar, in the case of Indian children left by themselves for days together in Canadian villages; and by M. Taine, in his work \u201cDe l'Intelligence.\u201d Numerous examples of children's language are given by Dr. Horatio Hale (philologist to the U.S. Wilkes Exploring Expedition), who has made a special study of the spontaneous development of roots among children the basis of his remarkable theory of the origin of linguistic stocks. Full details will be found in a paper on the \u201cDevelopment of Language,\u201d read before the Canadian Institute of Toronto, April 1888, and in an address on the \u201cOrigin of Languages and the Antiquity of Speaking Man,\u201d in the Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Buffalo, 1886, vol. xxxv. The occurrence has been often noticed in the families of philologists\u2014the most noteworthy instance being that of the young nephew of the well-known Sinologist Dr. George von Gablentz. This boy, before he learned his mother-tongue, called things by names of his own invention. The constant elements were the consonants, the vowels being varied, and employed as they were deeper or higher to denote greatness or smallness. The root for round objects was m-m; a watch, plate, and the moon was mem, a large round dish or table, mum, and the stars mim mim mim; an ordinary chair was lakail, a great arm-chair lukull, and a little doll's chair likill. A distinguished Accadian, Chinese, and Semitic scholar, the Rev. C. J. Ball, makes no secret of the fact that, between the ages of six and eight, he and his young brother had names of their own devising\u2014perfectly arbitrary monosyllables and dissyllables for several of the small tools and toys they valued most. Mary Howitt relates in her autobiography (edited by her daughters) that the silent sadness of the Quaker home circle extended to the nursemaids, and that in consequence of this the eldest child, her sister Anna, did not learn to talk until she was four years old. Long after they could talk, \u201cbeing left chiefly to converse together, our ignorance of the true appellations for many ordinary sentiments and actions compelled us to coin and use words of our own invention. To sneeze was to us both okis-kow, the sound which one of our parents must have made in sneezing.\u201d Here we get a true onomatop\u00e6ia, as in the monosyllable mea, employed by one American child for \u201ccat\u201d; in another child's vocabulary the extraordinary trisyllable shindikik designated that animal. The association of ideas and extension of meaning are often very suggestive\u2014viz. migno migno = water, wash, bath; waia waiar = black, darkness, Negro. As in the case of the name for water, bhumboo, cited by Mr. Stillman, the vocables are often of two syllables, rarely of three. It is interesting to note the continued use of the little boy's own name for water as a means of identifying the acquired Italian aqua for the same object, as frequently happens with adults struggling to express themselves in a foreign tongue. Reduplication seems also to characterize these \u201cchild languages\u201d like those of some savage tribes, and plurals are formed by repetition. The syntax, Dr. Hale remarks, resembles that of deaf-mutes and gesture language. If left to themselves there seems no reason why children with this aptitude should not develop a vocabulary at least as extensive as that of Dr. Farrar's three peasants, \u201cwho conversed for a long while without employing more than one hundred words.\u201d Many cases of \u201cchild language,\u201d no doubt, have passed away unrecorded. Soon after the children mix much with adults, the special vocabulary begins to die out. It is possible that the use of such spontaneously developed root-words might be prolonged among the children of the poorer classes, so often cared for by children but little older than themselves.

KARAMATE, in a letter which appears in your issue of March 3 (p. 416), alludes to a new form of heat engine described by me in your issue of January 28 (p. 294). He states that my device is similar to one by Prof. Stefan. I wish to point out that the two heat engines are quite different in design. The engine of Prof. Stefan has a step by step action; that described by me is under certain conditions absolutely continuous in its-action. The contrast is shown by Mr. Karamate's description of Prof. Stefan's engine; he writes:\u2014\u201cNickel plates were fixed on a wheel, like that of a water-mill, and a magnet was placed before it. By heating a nickel plate before the magnet, it was repulsed by the magnet, and a succeeding plate was attracted, so that the wheel commenced to rotate.\u201d From this it seems clear that the action of the machine must be step by step, since the different pieces of nickel must come successively under the influence of the magnet and the flame. In my disk form of engine, the action, when the disk has a certain thickness, is continuous. Mr. Croft has recently shown that when the disk is not so thick as mine was the disk starts in one direction, then stops, and sets off in the opposite direction. It will also be noticed that the distribution of the magnetic field due to twopoles is entirely different from that in the machine of Prof. Stefan. Mr. Karamate writes: \u201cBy heating a nickel plate before the magnet, it was repulsed by the magnet.\u201d I hardly see how this repulsion takes place. Faraday, writing about the behaviour of nickel, states (\u201cExperimental Researches,\u201d vol. iii., 2346): \u201cUpon being heated the nickel soon became indifferent to ordinary magnets, but, however high the temperature, still it pointed to and was attracted by the electro-magnet.\u201d Surely the action of the engine is due to one piece of nickel becoming partly non-magnetic owing to a rise of temperature, thus upsetting equilibrium, and allowing the next piece of nickel to approach the magnet and consequently the flame.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"45","prism.number":"1168","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"464","prism.endingPage":"464","prism.copyright":"1892 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/045464b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/045464b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/045464b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/045464b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Nickel Heat Engine","citation_volume":"45","citation_issue":"1168","citation_publication_date":"1892/03","citation_firstpage":"464","citation_lastpage":"464","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/045464b0","DOI":"10.1038/045464b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/045464b0","description":"MR.

Mr. Karamate writes: \u201cBy heating a nickel plate before the magnet, it was repulsed by the magnet.\u201d I hardly see how this repulsion takes place. Faraday, writing about the behaviour of nickel, states (\u201cExperimental Researches,\u201d vol. iii., 2346): \u201cUpon being heated the nickel soon became indifferent to ordinary magnets, but, however high the temperature, still it pointed to and was attracted by the electro-magnet.\u201d Surely the action of the engine is due to one piece of nickel becoming partly non-magnetic owing to a rise of temperature, thus upsetting equilibrium, and allowing the next piece of nickel to approach the magnet and consequently the flame.","dc.creator":["SMITH, FREDERICK J."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["SMITH, FREDERICK J."],"citation_author_institution":["Trinity College, Oxford"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Nickel Heat Engine","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Nickel Heat Engine&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"045486c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

How does it happen that equilibrium can exist with the small pressure in these corners, and a larger pressure required near the flat surfaces? In the first place it may be that equilibrium cannot exist, and that all foam is essentially unstable; and it would be almost impossible to disprove this by a direct experiment. If, however, foam can be stable, it seems as if the only conclusion possible were that the flat surfaces will evaporate and thin down, the liquid condensing in the corners, until the flat parts are so thin that they are in equilibrium with a smaller vapour pressure than a thick liquid surface would require. In other words, that the vapour pressure near a very thin film may be less than it can be near a thick one at the same temperature.

In the first place it may be that equilibrium cannot exist, and that all foam is essentially unstable; and it would be almost impossible to disprove this by a direct experiment. If, however, foam can be stable, it seems as if the only conclusion possible were that the flat surfaces will evaporate and thin down, the liquid condensing in the corners, until the flat parts are so thin that they are in equilibrium with a smaller vapour pressure than a thick liquid surface would require. In other words, that the vapour pressure near a very thin film may be less than it can be near a thick one at the same temperature. It is evident that inside or outside a solid box stability must be possible, so that the second alternative is the only solution.","dc.creator":["FITZGERALD, G.

For a detailed account on the former distribution of Aporia crat\u00e6gi in this country, I would refer Mr. Warde Fowler to my article on the subject in the Entomologists' Monthly Magazine for March 1887.","dc.creator":["GOSS, H."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["GOSS, H."],"citation_author_institution":["Surbiton Hill"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"\u201cThe Black-veined White Butterfly\u201d","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&#8220;The Black-veined White Butterfly&#8221;&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"051413a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Perhaps the following considerations may show that the evidence is not conclusive in this respect.","dc.creator":["SCHUSTER, ARTHUR"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["SCHUSTER, ARTHUR"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"On R\u00f6ntgen's Rays","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;On R&#246;ntgen&#39;s Rays&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"053461a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Where it originates is quite uncertain, as there are in the counties several mountains assigned therefor. The sounds are heard of same intensity in variously distant places.\u201d Further, the author recites a folk-tale current in his time among the villagers of Kurotori, in Co. Kambara, which attributes these sounds to the head and body of a hero, Kurotori Hy\u00f4e [killed in 1062?]; separately interred under a Shintoist temple in this village, they ever strive to unite once more. \u201cThe marvel, it is said, is now seldom met with; still it occurs frequently within two or three miles of the village, proceeding doubtless from the precinct of the temple. And the fact is more wonderful that the inhabitants of Kurotori themselves never hear the sounds unless they go out of the village.\u201d Concluding the narrative, the author, from his personal observation, argues the action of the tide-waves upon the earth to be the real cause of these curious sounds.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"54","prism.number":"1387","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"78","prism.endingPage":"78","prism.copyright":"1896 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/054078a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/054078a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/054078a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/054078a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Remarkable Sounds","citation_volume":"54","citation_issue":"1387","citation_publication_date":"1896/05","citation_firstpage":"78","citation_lastpage":"78","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/054078a0","DOI":"10.1038/054078a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/054078a0","description":"IN a Japanese work, \u201cHokuetsu Kidan,\u201d by Tachibana no Mochiyo (published circa 1800, tom, ii., fol. 5, seqq.), I have found some remarkable sounds described.

As to the remiges and rectrices of birds generally, one feather overlies and to a great extent protects the next; but still, the outer webs are always very much narrowed in the outermost and most exposed feathers, less narrowed in the next, and so on till in the middle of the wing and tail (where they are well protected on both sides) they are not narrowed at all. But, while normal wing and tail feathers are exposed to attrition on one web only, long feathers standing well out from the rest are liable to have the web frayed on both sides of the shaft as far as they project beyond the other feathers, and to some extent where they rest upon the other feathers through friction against the latter.

E. Hutchins and Mr. F. R. Mallet have recently appeared in NATURE, suggesting the possibility of there being some other route for infection in malaria besides that by the bite of Anopheles. Suggestions of this kind always appear to me to give rise to the questions, (a) whether the facts are really as stated? and (b) whether, if even this is the case, they cannot be explained by the mosquito theory? The notion that clearing jungle causes fever is very widely spread; but this does not prove that it is true. Granting that it is true, it may possibly be explained on the ground (a) that persons engaged in clearing jungle and laying out new plantations are not likely to be so well housed as those who live in established settlements; (b) that any hard labour encourages relapses of fever among coolies and others who have already been infected; and (c) that, as shown by Christophers and Stephens, jungle often contains large numbers of Anopheles. The frequent statements one sees, to the effect that malaria has prevailed largely when mosquitoes were few, are generally too vague to be of value, because it is not added whether the cases were relapses or fresh infections, or to what kind the \u201cfew\u201d mosquitoes present belonged. When a man says that mosquitoes are numerous he generally refers to the genus Culex, which probably assert themselves more than do Anopheles. The idea that the water of the rivers of western India can cause fever when it is drunk is certainly opposed to my personal experience. In 1891 I went fishing with Mr. G. Tait, of Bangalore, in the River Bhawani, near Ootacamund. I remember that at the time I did not think that fever could be acquired by drinking such water, and I used daily to drink the unboiled water of this river (which flows amongst thick jungle). I remained quite free from fever, without taking quinine; but Mr. Tait was afterwards attacked. So far as I remember (but I am not sure), he had refused to drink Bhawani water; but I am not certain that his fever was malarial. Again, the idea that malaria is absent in the Nilgiri Hills round Ootacamund unless the soil is turned does not accord with my personal experiences. I acquired fever at Kalhutti (5000 feet above sea-level) in 1897, when I was investigating the disease in the Sigur Ghat. I thought at the time that I had acquired it in the plains below, but, in the light of our present knowledge, have little doubt that I became infected in the dak-bungalow at Kalhutti, where a succession of kitmutgars and their families had been taken ill. I noted particularly at the time that there was no freshly turned soil in the neighbourhood of the bungalow. Lastly, the case mentioned by Mr. D. E. Hutchins, namely that of a medically authenticated case of malaria being produced by fresh earth carried past a window in baskets by coolies, seems to me to be open to criticism. Which fact was medically authenticated\u2014the fact that the patient suffered from malaria, or that his malaria was caused by the earth carried past in baskets? I can understand the first fact being certified by a doctor, but scarcely the second. How did the doctor prove that the fever was produced by the earth in the baskets? It seems to me that the only way in which he could have done so in a trustworthy and scientific manner would have been to infect a second person by having the baskets carried past a second time. I doubt whether such instances\u2014and we see hundreds of them in the Press\u2014will bear close examination. Those who cite cases of fever apparently due to freshly-turned earth, seem to forget that there are millions of people constantly engaged in digging without suffering from the disease more than others do.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"63","prism.number":"1636","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"440","prism.endingPage":"440","prism.copyright":"1901 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/063440c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/063440c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/063440c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/063440c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Malaria and Mosquitoes","citation_volume":"63","citation_issue":"1636","citation_publication_date":"1901/03","citation_firstpage":"440","citation_lastpage":"440","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/063440c0","DOI":"10.1038/063440c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/063440c0","description":"INTERESTING letters by Mr. D.

There has been some little confusion between the abdominal ribs and the ventral moieties of the true ribs in Lacertilia, which is cleared up by Dr. Gadow in his contribution to the \u201cCambridge Natural History.\u201d Dr. Gadow correctly observes of the geckos that they possess very, long and slender post-thoracic ribs, \u201cwhich meet each other, in the middle line, in this case bearing an extra-ordinary resemblance to the so-called \u2018abdominal ribs\u2019 of other Reptiles.\u201d The statements as to \u201cabdominal ribs\u201d made by M. Boulenger in his catalogue of the lizards in the British Museum appear to me to refer to true ribs. Of the Scincid\u00e6, he remarks that ossified abdominal ribs are absent.\u201d Curiously enough, it is precisely in this group that I find a parasternum.

There has been some little confusion between the abdominal ribs and the ventral moieties of the true ribs in Lacertilia, which is cleared up by Dr. Gadow in his contribution to the \u201cCambridge Natural History.\u201d Dr. Gadow correctly observes of the geckos that they possess very, long and slender post-thoracic ribs, \u201cwhich meet each other, in the middle line, in this case bearing an extra-ordinary resemblance to the so-called \u2018abdominal ribs\u2019 of other Reptiles.\u201d The statements as to \u201cabdominal ribs\u201d made by M. Boulenger in his catalogue of the lizards in the British Museum appear to me to refer to true ribs.

Canadian and other vessels crossing the North Pacific, in cases of emergency have new harbours of refuge which can be approached with comparative safety.

I may add that he is also a keen surveyor, and his maps of the islands in these \u201cForbidden Seas\u201d were so far back as 1895 published for the use of sailors by our Admiralty. By the publication of these charts, the shortest routes between Vancouver and certain ports on the Asiatic coast have been freed from uncertainties and dangers. Canadian and other vessels crossing the North Pacific, in cases of emergency have new harbours of refuge which can be approached with comparative safety. Snow's charts show new rocks and shoals, take out others, adjust islands in longitude, indicate anchorages, tide rips, watering places, seal and seal-lion rookeries, and, in short, make the unknown known. Sailing directions go with the charts.","dc.creator":["MILNE, JOHN"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MILNE, JOHN"],"citation_author_institution":["Shide, Newport, Isle of Wight"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"\u201cIn Forbidden Seas\u201d","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&#8220;In Forbidden Seas&#8221;&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"086009b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The precaution was naturally taken to observe closely the diminishing cusp and to arrange to give the necessary time signals from the cusp data mentioned by Dr. Downing in the above letter. Unfortunately, however, while the cusp was visible nearly up to second contact, the image of it on the screen had been oscillating so violently (due to air tremors) that the officer in charge had previously decided to give the necessary signals at the computed times from the chronometer. (See page 17 of my report for details of the actual procedure.)

The precaution was naturally taken to observe closely the diminishing cusp and to arrange to give the necessary time signals from the cusp data mentioned by Dr. Downing in the above letter. Unfortunately, however, while the cusp was visible nearly up to second contact, the image of it on the screen had been oscillating so violently (due to air tremors) that the officer in charge had previously decided to give the necessary signals at the computed times from the chronometer. (See page 17 of my report for details of the actual procedure.) It is true that no inquiry was made by me to find out what error might be expected, but it was assumed that if such a large error had been approximately known it would have been published.

Even when the a\u00ebrial was reduced to 6 ft. of wire the signals were just audible, but very faint.","dc.creator":["HANSARD, ARNOLD G."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["HANSARD, ARNOLD G."],"citation_author_institution":["Limpsfield, Surrey"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Antenn\u00e6 for Wireless Telegraphy","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Antenn&#230; for Wireless Telegraphy&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"091400a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

For the points raised by Prof. Osborne, according to what we gather from your short report (p. 322), are of great and vital interest. He emphasises the importance of the readings of the wet-bulb thermometer as indications of what one might call the evaporative quality of the atmosphere as it affects the economy of the human body.

For the points raised by Prof. Osborne, according to what we gather from your short report (p. 322), are of great and vital interest. He emphasises the importance of the readings of the wet-bulb thermometer as indications of what one might call the evaporative quality of the atmosphere as it affects the economy of the human body. Unfortunately the wet-bulb thermometer is untrustworthy for several reasons, and it is well known that physicists treat it with scant respect.

Higher plants, however, were thought to lack cytochrome c6 (refs 1,2) until the existence of a modified form in several species was inferred from genomic evidence3.

The little-studied ant Myrmelachista schumanni has an uncompromising way of carving a niche in Amazonian rainforests. It lives in treelets (called Duroia hirsuta) that stand in clumps, or \u2018devil's gardens\u2019.

Simplifying laws are useful, she says, but the universal laws of physics may need to yield to more specific tools to explain living systems.","dc.creator":["Fox Keller, Evelyn"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["Fox Keller, Evelyn"],"citation_author_institution":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA","Blaise Pascal chair in Paris, France"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"A clash of two cultures","twitter:description":"Nature - A mountain of data, new instruments to track living systems in unprecedented detail, systems biology and other new tools mean that many techniques familiar in the physical sciences are now...","twitter:image":"https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2F445603a/MediaObjects/41586_2007_Article_BF445603a_Figa_HTML.jpg","WT.z_primary_atype":"Comments & Opinion"},{"_id":"44586","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Their potential biological effects, such as toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and endocrine disrupter activity, are generally enantiomer-selective, and different enantiomers are preferentially degraded (transformed) by micro-organisms in various environments1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Here we use field and laboratory experiments to demonstrate that environmental changes in soils can alter these preferences, and to suggest that the preferences shift owing to different groups of related microbial genotypes being activated by different environmental changes.

Their potential biological effects, such as toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and endocrine disrupter activity, are generally enantiomer-selective, and different enantiomers are preferentially degraded (transformed) by micro-organisms in various environments1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Here we use field and laboratory experiments to demonstrate that environmental changes in soils can alter these preferences, and to suggest that the preferences shift owing to different groups of related microbial genotypes being activated by different environmental changes. In Brazilian soils, almost all pasture samples preferentially transformed the non-herbicidal enantiomer of dichlorprop ((RS)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propionic acid), while most forest samples either transformed the herbicidal enantiomer more readily or as rapidly as the non-herbicidal enantiomer.

Each level is split owing to spin interactions, and its degeneracy is proportional to the magnetic field strength. When the ratio, \u03bd (or \u2018filling factor\u2019), of the number of electrons and the degeneracy of a Landau level takes an integer or particular fractional values, quantum Hall effects1 occur, characterized by a vanishingly small longitudinal resistance and a quantized (transverse) Hall voltage2. The quantum Hall regime may be used for the controlled study of many-particle cooperative phenomena, such as order\u2013disorder phase transitions (analogous to those observed in conventional magnets). Both isotropic and anisotropic ferromagnetic ground states have been predicted3,4,5,6,7,8 to occur in the quantum Hall regime, some of which have been investigated experimentally9,10,11,12,13 in samples with different geometries and filling factors.

Each level is split owing to spin interactions, and its degeneracy is proportional to the magnetic field strength. When the ratio, \u03bd (or \u2018filling factor\u2019), of the number of electrons and the degeneracy of a Landau level takes an integer or particular fractional values, quantum Hall effects1 occur, characterized by a vanishingly small longitudinal resistance and a quantized (transverse) Hall voltage2. The quantum Hall regime may be used for the controlled study of many-particle cooperative phenomena, such as order\u2013disorder phase transitions (analogous to those observed in conventional magnets). Both isotropic and anisotropic ferromagnetic ground states have been predicted3,4,5,6,7,8 to occur in the quantum Hall regime, some of which have been investigated experimentally9,10,11,12,13 in samples with different geometries and filling factors. Here we report evidence for first-order phase transitions in quantum Hall states (\u03bd = 2,4) confined to a wide gallium arsenide quantum well.

Changes in the endocrinology of development are central to this hypothesis. The three stages of the ancestral insect species\u2014pronymph, nymph and adult\u2014are proposed to be equivalent to the larva, pupa and adult stages of insects with complete metamorphosis. This proposal has general implications for insect developmental biology.","dc.creator":["Truman, James W.","Riddiford, Lynn M."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology.

Here, we investigated its roles and epigenetic mechanisms regulating CLDN4 expression in gastric cancer. We show that increased membranous expression of claudin-4 in gastric carcinoma is associated with better patient prognosis, whereas cytoplasmic claudin-4 expression did not show a significant association with prognosis. Consistent with the correlation of increased membranous claudin-4 with favorable clinicopathological factors, claudin-4 overexpression inhibited the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells; in contrast, it did not affect cell growth. Claudin-4 expression also increased the barrier function of TJs. Claudin-4 upregulation was strongly correlated with DNA hypomethylation in both gastric tissues and gastric cancer cells. Moreover, CLDN4 expression was repressed in normal gastric tissues in association with bivalent histone modifications, and loss of repressive histone methylations and gain of active histone modifications were associated with CLDN4 overexpression in gastric cancer cells. Interestingly, CLDN4 repression could be markedly derepressed by combined treatments that simultaneously target both histone modifications and DNA demethylation in CLDN4-hypermethylated cells, whereas concomitant changes in histone methylations and acetylations are required for CLDN4 induction in CLDN4-repressed cells with low DNA methylation. Taken together, this study reveals that membranous claudin-4 expression is associated with gastric cancer progression and that it is an independent positive prognosis marker in gastric carcinoma. Furthermore, our findings suggest that epigenetic derepression may be a possible mechanism underlying CLDN4 overexpression in gastric cancer and that claudin-4 may have potential as a promising target for the treatment of gastric cancer.","prism.publicationName":"Laboratory Investigation","prism.publicationDate":"2011-08-15","prism.volume":"91","prism.number":"11","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"1652","prism.endingPage":"1667","prism.copyright":"2011 United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc.","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/labinvest2011117","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/labinvest.2011.117","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/labinvest2011117.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/labinvest2011117","citation_journal_title":"Laboratory Investigation","citation_journal_abbrev":"Lab Invest","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1530-0307","citation_title":"Claudin-4 overexpression is associated with epigenetic derepression in gastric carcinoma","citation_volume":"91","citation_issue":"11","citation_publication_date":"2011/11","citation_online_date":"2011/08/15","citation_firstpage":"1652","citation_lastpage":"1667","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/labinvest.2011.117","DOI":"10.1038/labinvest.2011.117","citation_doi":"10.1038/labinvest.2011.117","description":"The tight junction (TJ) protein claudin-4 is aberrantly upregulated in gastric cancer, but its clinical significance and the molecular mechanisms underlying claudin-4 overexpression in gastric cancer remain unclear.

Furthermore, our findings suggest that epigenetic derepression may be a possible mechanism underlying CLDN4 overexpression in gastric cancer and that claudin-4 may have potential as a promising target for the treatment of gastric cancer.","dc.creator":["Kwon, Mi Jeong","Kim, Seok-Hyung","Jeong, Hae Min","Jung, Hun Soon","Kim, Sung-Su","Lee, Jae Eun","Gye, Myung Chan","Erkin, \u00d6zg\u00fcr Cem","Koh, Sang Seok","Choi, Yoon-La","Park, Cheol Keun","Shin, Young Kee"],"dc.subject":["Epigenetics","Gastric cancer"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Cancer Res;

The researchers have now shown that a plasmonic metasurface comprising an array of nano-antennas can couple spin-to-orbital angular momentum at thickness much smaller than the wavelength of the light with an efficiency of around 3%. The conversion takes place due to the birefringence present in the nanostructure array. This approach could yield ultrathin generators of visible light with orbital angular momentum, for potential applications in spectroscopy, imaging, sensing and quantum information.","prism.publicationName":"Light: Science & Applications","prism.publicationDate":"2014-05-09","prism.volume":"3","prism.number":"5","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"e167","prism.endingPage":"e167","prism.copyright":"2014 The Author(s)","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201448","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2014.48","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201448.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201448","citation_journal_title":"Light: Science & Applications","citation_journal_abbrev":"Light Sci Appl","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"2047-7538","citation_title":"Generating optical orbital angular momentum at visible wavelengths using a plasmonic metasurface","citation_volume":"3","citation_issue":"5","citation_publication_date":"2014/05","citation_online_date":"2014/05/09","citation_firstpage":"e167","citation_lastpage":"e167","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2014.48","DOI":"10.1038/lsa.2014.48","citation_doi":"10.1038/lsa.2014.48","description":"Light beams with a helical phase-front possess orbital angular momentum along their direction of propagation in addition to the spin angular momentum that describes their polarisation.

The researchers have now shown that a plasmonic metasurface comprising an array of nano-antennas can couple spin-to-orbital angular momentum at thickness much smaller than the wavelength of the light with an efficiency of around 3%. The conversion takes place due to the birefringence present in the nanostructure array. This approach could yield ultrathin generators of visible light with orbital angular momentum, for potential applications in spectroscopy, imaging, sensing and quantum information.","dc.creator":["Karimi, Ebrahim","Schulz, Sebastian A","De Leon, Israel","Qassim, Hammam","Upham, Jeremy","Boyd, Robert W"],"dc.subject":["Applied optics","Metamaterials","Nanophotonics and plasmonics"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=Optical Angular Momentum;

However, most currently available dual output laser sources rely on the costly and complicated optical parametric generation approach. In this report, we detail a relatively simple and low cost diamond Raman laser pumped by a ytterbium fiber amplifier emitting at 1055\u2009nm, which generates a first Stokes emission centered at 1240\u2009nm with a pulse width of 100\u2009fs. The two excitation wavelengths of 1055 and 1240\u2009nm, along with the effective two-color excitation wavelength of 1140\u2009nm, provide an almost complete coverage of fluorophores excitable within the range of 1000\u20131300\u2009nm. When compared with 1055\u2009nm excitation, two-color excitation at 1140\u2009nm offers a 90% increase in signal for many far-red emitting fluorescent proteins (for example, tdKatushka2). We demonstrate multicolor imaging of tdKatushka2 and Hoechst 33342 via simultaneous two-color two-photon, and two-color three-photon microscopy in engineered 3D multicellular spheroids. We further discuss potential benefits and applications for two-color three-photon excitation. In addition, we show that this laser system is capable of in vivo imaging in mouse cortex to nearly 1\u2009mm in depth with two-color excitation. A diamond Raman laser pumped by a ytterbium-fiber amplifier is a convenient and stable optical source for multiphoton imaging. Andrew Dunn and his co-workers from the University of Texas at Austin in the USA and Macquarie University in Australia used the combined outputs from a diamond Raman laser at 1240 nanometers and a ytterbium-fiber amplifier at 1055 nanometers to perform both two-color, two-photon and two-color, three-photon imaging of biological samples. In particular, they demonstrated multicolor microscopy of cells labeled with a far-red fluorescent protein and a blue-emitting stain. In addition, deep in vivo microscopy of the vasculature in the brain of an adult mouse perfused with a red dye was performed at cortex depths of up to 1 millimeter using the system for two-color, two-photon excitation.","prism.publicationName":"Light: Science & Applications","prism.publicationDate":"2017-06-01","prism.volume":"6","prism.number":"11","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"e17095","prism.endingPage":"e17095","prism.copyright":"2017 The Author(s)","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201795","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2017.95","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201795.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa201795","citation_journal_title":"Light: Science & Applications","citation_journal_abbrev":"Light Sci Appl","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"2047-7538","citation_title":"Two-color multiphoton in vivo imaging with a femtosecond diamond Raman laser","citation_volume":"6","citation_issue":"11","citation_publication_date":"2017/11","citation_online_date":"2017/06/01","citation_firstpage":"e17095","citation_lastpage":"e17095","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2017.95","DOI":"10.1038/lsa.2017.95","citation_doi":"10.1038/lsa.2017.95","description":"Two-color multiphoton microscopy through wavelength mixing of synchronized lasers has been shown to increase the spectral window of excitable fluorophores without the need for wavelength tuning.
