The statement objected to by Mr. Hope was an expression, not of individual opinion, but of the fact\u2014long accepted as beyond question\u2014that the practical value of liquid town sewage as manure, that is to say, its value to the farmer, cannot be computed solely from the amount of manure material it may contain, and that, in forming such an estimate, the positive element afforded by chemical analysis must be controlled by the negative element introduced by extreme dilution, and varying under different local circumstances. This fact has been recognised by authorities too numerous to name, and so decisively, that Mr. Hope's assertion as to the value of the ammonia in sewage being affected only in a very minor degree by the amount of water mixed with it, seems to have no other merit than that of being \u201csensational.\u201d I am at a loss to conceive what ground Mr. Hope could have for objecting to the statement that \u201cit is a great mistake, and likely to prove a very ruinous one,\u201d to estimate the value of dilute sewage by calculation solely from the amount of manure material it may contain. Yet this is what Mr. Hope characterises as a \u201cstrange paradox.\u201d Why it has puzzled him, as he admits, I will not stop to inquire; but I must protest against his representing \u201cthe obligation of applying water to crops at all times of the year, whether they want it or not,\u201d as having been one of the reasons given for the statement he objects to. In doing that he has at least fallen into a great error, and he has at the same time evaded the point to which attention was directed in tbe article, viz., the agricultural difficulty attending the \u201ccontinuous daily application of sewage to land.\u201d That is a difficulty not to be disposed of ex cathedra\u2014it would obtain whether the land destined to receive sewage were under crops or lying fallow. In the one case the application of sewage might be inadmissible during great part of the year; in the other case the land under fallow would be unproductive meanwhile. Indeed the need for applying sewage to fallow land, which Mr. Hope seems to suggest, would enhance the difficulty of disposing of sewage by irrigation, since it would involve the want of a still larger area of land for its reception, day by day throughout the year. Such a mode of application usight well necessitate an area of twenty-five acres for every 100 persons, and that necessity, if it existed, would be, I imagine, a very serious matterin the case of ninny towns.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"1","prism.number":"18","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"459","prism.endingPage":"459","prism.copyright":"1870 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/001459a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/001459a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/001459a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/001459a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Valuation of Liquid Town Sewage","citation_volume":"1","citation_issue":"18","citation_publication_date":"1870/03","citation_firstpage":"459","citation_lastpage":"459","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/001459a0","DOI":"10.1038/001459a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/001459a0","description":"THOUGH I consider it highly unbecoming for one member of a committee, charged with an important inquiry, to criticise publicly and in a controversial nsanner, views expressed by another member of that committee in regard to the subject it has to investigate, still some of the remarks made by Mr. Hope at the Society of Arts last Wednesday seem so unmistakeably to refer to the article which appeared in NATURE on the 23rd December last, that I feel constrained, as the writer of that article, to reply to them.

At page 240 of \u201cThe Origin of Species\u201d (fourth edition), after alluding to the part that insects play in the fertilisation of flowers, by their \u201cunconscious selection\u201d rendering them conspicuous and beautiful, he continues: \u201cA similar line of argument holds good with many kinds of beautiful fruits. That a ripe strawberry or cherry is pleasing to the eye as to the palate, that the gaily-coloured fruit of the spindle-wood tree and the scarlet berries of the holly are beautiful objects, will be admitted by everyone. But this beauty serves merely as a guide to birds and beasts, that the fruit may be devoured and the seeds thus disseminated. I infer that this is the case from having as yet found in every instance that seeds which are imbedded within a fruit of any kind, that is within a fleshy or pulpy envelope, if it be coloured by any brilliant tint, or merely rendered conspicuous by being coloured white or black, are always disseminated by being first devoured.\u201d And again (\u201cVariation under Domestication,\u201d vol. ii., p. 230): \u201cThe white Tartarian cherry, owing either to its colour being so much like that of the leaves, or to the fruit always appearing from a distance unripe, is not so readily attacked by birds as other sorts. The yellow-fruited raspberry, which generally comes nearly true by seed, is little molested by birds, who are evidently not fond of it; so that nets may be dispensed with in places where nothing else will protect the red fruit (\u2018Bull. de la Soc. d'Acclimat., tom. vii., 1860, p.359). This immunity, though a benefit to the gardener, would be a disadvantage in a state of nature both to the cherry and raspberry, as their dissemination depends on birds.

At page 240 of \u201cThe Origin of Species\u201d (fourth edition), after alluding to the part that insects play in the fertilisation of flowers, by their \u201cunconscious selection\u201d rendering them conspicuous and beautiful, he continues: \u201cA similar line of argument holds good with many kinds of beautiful fruits. That a ripe strawberry or cherry is pleasing to the eye as to the palate, that the gaily-coloured fruit of the spindle-wood tree and the scarlet berries of the holly are beautiful objects, will be admitted by everyone. But this beauty serves merely as a guide to birds and beasts, that the fruit may be devoured and the seeds thus disseminated. I infer that this is the case from having as yet found in every instance that seeds which are imbedded within a fruit of any kind, that is within a fleshy or pulpy envelope, if it be coloured by any brilliant tint, or merely rendered conspicuous by being coloured white or black, are always disseminated by being first devoured.\u201d And again (\u201cVariation under Domestication,\u201d vol. ii., p. 230): \u201cThe white Tartarian cherry, owing either to its colour being so much like that of the leaves, or to the fruit always appearing from a distance unripe, is not so readily attacked by birds as other sorts. The yellow-fruited raspberry, which generally comes nearly true by seed, is little molested by birds, who are evidently not fond of it; so that nets may be dispensed with in places where nothing else will protect the red fruit (\u2018Bull. de la Soc. d'Acclimat., tom. vii., 1860, p.359). This immunity, though a benefit to the gardener, would be a disadvantage in a state of nature both to the cherry and raspberry, as their dissemination depends on birds. I noticed during several winters that some trees of the yellow-berried holly, which were raised from seed from a wild tree found by my father, remained covered with fruit, whilst not scarlet berry could be seen on the adjoining trees of the common kind. A friend informs me that a mountain ash (Pyrus aucuparia) growing in his garden bears berries which, though not differently coloured, are always devoured by birds before those on the other trees. This variety of the mountain-ash would thus be more freely disseminated, and the yellow-berried variety of the holly less freely, than the common varieties of these two trees.\u201d It appears to me that a hollyberry falling by its own weight from the bush would be borne vertically downwards; and though nourished by a soil impregnated with the decayed leaves of the parent tree, the young plant would be almost entirely deprived of light, and would soon succumb to its more vigorous rivals in \u201cthe struggle for existence.\u201d Perhaps in a country where but little land is left uncultivated, \u201cthe great majority\u201d of seeds transported by birds \u201cwould be deposited on arable or pasture land,\u201d and thus succeed no better than the others; but so far as my limited experience extends, the most usual positions in which seedlings of the holly naturally spring up, seem to be at the bases of steep rocks or of trees whose branches are not sufficiently low and spreading to exert an unfavourable influence.

It is known* that at some parts of the earth's surface there exists an atmospheric pressure capable of sustaining a column of mercury in the barometer of upwards of 30 inches in height; at the same time there are certain areas over which this pressure is only such as to raise the barometric column to a little over 29 inches. Now if we compare the difference of absolute weight sustained by two such areas, we shall see that in the space over which the higher atmospheric pressure exists, there is an excess of weight of air, amounting in round numbers to 1,000,000 of tons on each square mile. Applying this fact to the region of the ocean in which the surface currents are best known, the North Atlantic, we find from the isobaric chart that there is throughout the year over a large portion of the eastern side of this sea, next the coast of North Africa, a pressure (to use the convenient mode of expressing it) of upwards of 30.2 inches. To westward of this space, towards the Gulf of Mexico and the coast of the United States, the average pressure decreases; between Newfoundland and the British Isles the pressure is still diminished, till in the wide channel between Iceland, Norway, and Spitzbergen, we arrive at a yearly pressure of less than 29.6 inches. It is reasonable to believe that the waters which lie under the high pressure area have a tendency to escape from under the excessive weight, towards the space over which the pressure is less. But the high pressure area next the African coast is precisely that upon which the north-east trade winds descend, and the waters, aided in their choice of an exit, will naturally flow off to south-westward before the wind. Their continuance in this direction is barred, however; for across the whole of the southward passage between Africa and South America, there exists another belt of high pressure, out of which the south-easterly trade winds blow. The only course left for the escaping waters (allowing for the moment that the excess of pressure is a cause of their movement) is to westward, where the pressure is lessened, towards the Gulf of Mexico, and the east coast of America, and thence towards the low pressure space between Iceland and Norway. But this is exactly the course that the Gulf Stream, or rather the North Atlantic warm stream of which the Gulf Stream is the most prominent feature, is seen to take. Are we not then warranted in concluding that the difference of atmospheric pressure has some power both in originating and in directing the course of this ocean current?","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"3","prism.number":"64","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"227","prism.endingPage":"227","prism.copyright":"1871 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003227a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/003227a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003227a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003227a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Ocean Currents","citation_volume":"3","citation_issue":"64","citation_publication_date":"1871/01","citation_firstpage":"227","citation_lastpage":"227","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/003227a0","DOI":"10.1038/003227a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/003227a0","description":"ATTENTION has been much drawn of late to the subject of Ocean Currents and their causes, and it has occurred to me that there is a directing if not an originating cause of these streams, which has, so far as I am aware, been overlooked by physicists. It is known* that at some parts of the earth's surface there exists an atmospheric pressure capable of sustaining a column of mercury in the barometer of upwards of 30 inches in height; at the same time there are certain areas over which this pressure is only such as to raise the barometric column to a little over 29 inches. Now if we compare the difference of absolute weight sustained by two such areas, we shall see that in the space over which the higher atmospheric pressure exists, there is an excess of weight of air, amounting in round numbers to 1,000,000 of tons on each square mile.

S.\u201d had asserted that it had in a letter appearing in the Astronomical Register for December 1868. He further gives two reasons for the unhesitating credit which he had given to the assertion of \u201cP.

The account in question occurs in an article \u201cA Week at Plain Creek, Queensland\u201d, by Mr. E. B. Kennedy, which appeared in the issue of that journal for September 20, 1873. It runs as follows:\u2014\u201c. . . Whilst so engaged we heard our dogs making a tremendous noise, high up the bank in the scrub, and upon going to ascertain the cause found them scratching, yelling, and pulling at a porcupine which was half imbedded in a hole; we were at least ten minutes digging him out with sharp-pointed sticks, such was his tenacity in holding on and burrowing. The quills were not nearly so long as the Cape of Good Hope species (of course a true Hystrix), and he differed from that quadruped in having a sort of beak instead of a regular jaw.\u201d It is to be regretted that Mr. Kennedy did not preserve his specimen, which was ultimately cooked and eaten!

The account in question occurs in an article \u201cA Week at Plain Creek, Queensland\u201d, by Mr. E. B. Kennedy, which appeared in the issue of that journal for September 20, 1873. It runs as follows:\u2014\u201c. . . Whilst so engaged we heard our dogs making a tremendous noise, high up the bank in the scrub, and upon going to ascertain the cause found them scratching, yelling, and pulling at a porcupine which was half imbedded in a hole; we were at least ten minutes digging him out with sharp-pointed sticks, such was his tenacity in holding on and burrowing. The quills were not nearly so long as the Cape of Good Hope species (of course a true Hystrix), and he differed from that quadruped in having a sort of beak instead of a regular jaw.\u201d It is to be regretted that Mr. Kennedy did not preserve his specimen, which was ultimately cooked and eaten! I should have mentioned that Plain Creek lies in 21 lat. S., so that this is certainly the northernmost locality on the Australian continent, where we have certain knowledge that the Echidna occurs. As we now know that many North Australian species of birds range also into southern New Guinea, it would hardly be surprising if the Tachyglossus of the Fly River and south New Guinea were nothing more than the well-known Tachyglossus hystrix.

We find it even, in the new edition of the \u201cEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\u201d, art. \u201cAustralia\u201d, given as an established fact in the following words:\u2014\u201cOn the north side of the continent, except around the Gulf of Carpentaria, the edge of the sandstone table-land has a great elevation; it is cut by the Alligator River into gorges 3,800 ft. deep\u201d.","dc.creator":["WALLACE, ALFRED R."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["WALLACE, ALFRED R."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"A Twenty Years' Error in the Geography of...","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;A Twenty Years&#39; Error in the Geography of Australia&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"018384a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

They will find a very interesting spectrum in the electric lamps now being used for `lighting some of the principal public places in the city. One might have expected to have found from the brilliant spark inclosed in a white opaline globe a continuous spectrum such as is afforded by the voltaic arc. But the contrary is the case. The Jablochkoff candle now in use in Paris, even when viewed by one of Browning's small pocket instruments, presents a very complicated and highly interesting spectrum. I had no chart with me for comparison, nor did I, as I intended subsequently, make even a rough record of the spectrum; but speaking from memory, I may say that several lines in the blue and green were very marked and distinct, and, in fact, the whole spectrum was traversed by bright and dark lines. I thought, probably, some of these dark lines might be due to absorption by the white opaline glass globe, but I have tested several specimens of this white glass, and I find it does not alter in any way (except by generally reducing its brilliancy) a continuous spectrum, nor does it change the character of the solar spectrum. We must, then, turn to the light itself and to the atmosphere surrounding it for the cause of these phenomena. I believe that in a chemical sense there is no difference between the ordinary electric arc between the carbon points and the arc of the Jablochkoff candle, except that between the carbon points of the latter is a rod of kaolin, which has, I think, a calcium base. This kaolin is intensely heated by the current, and is volatised at the same rate as the carbon rods by the alternative current which this form of candle requires. The light, therefore, is a combination of the electric and the lime light, the current taking the place of the oxy-hydrogen elements. The surrounding atmosphere will be the same in both cases, but the products of combustion will obviously be different, and partly so from the composition of the kaolin. Still, I confess that I cannot suggest the cause of this complicated spectrum, and I hope that some observers who have more accurate means and more experience will give us the rationale of the phenomena.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"18","prism.number":"458","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"384","prism.endingPage":"384","prism.copyright":"1878 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/018384a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/018384a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/018384a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/018384a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Spectrum of the Electric (Jablochkoff) Light","citation_volume":"18","citation_issue":"458","citation_publication_date":"1878/08","citation_firstpage":"384","citation_lastpage":"384","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/018384a0","DOI":"10.1038/018384a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/018384a0","description":"I WOULD suggest that when your readers visit Paris they should take their pocket spectroscopes.

Prof. Watson expresses his \u201castonishment at the claim now made that he (Mr. Gray) anticipated Mr. Bell in the invention of the speaking telephone\u201d, and speaks of the \u201cerroneous statement of facts\u201d contained in the article in question (NATURE, vol. xviii. p. 696). Unfortunately Prof. Watson has not specified the statements which are erroneous, and appears to have overlooked the fact that the article is a review of the works of Mr. Prescott and M. du Moncel on the telephone, and that the \u201cstatements of facts\u201d are chiefly quotations from those works.

My own observations hitherto on this species have been uniformly to the effect that unimpregnated females lay always barren eggs, and that one intercourse with the male renders fruitful all eggs subsequently laid. I bred the female in question from the egg this year, and have kept her isolated since her exclusion as an imago. She has laid, up to the present, about twenty batches of eggs consisting of about thirty-four and fifty-one alternately in the batch. Of these, some fifteen batches have been observed; and only in one of these, No. 10, to wit, consisting of thirty-four eggs, and in one of these thirty-four only were any traces of development observed. This batch was laid between the 2nd and 4th of August. On the 5th I noticed in one an appearance which is usual about this time in fertilised egg, which I have been accustomed to think about as the \u201cembryonic scroll,\u201d and which, on reference to Huxley's \u201cAnatomy of In-vertebrated Animals,\u201d pp. 444\u2013445, I am inclined to think may be what is there called \u201cthe sternal band (Keimstreif of the German embryologists).\u201cThis scroll is invariably present in gastrophysa eggs regularly developing, and enables one to predict with certainty the position of the ventral aspect, and of the head and tail of the future larva. On the 6th this same appearance was more distinctly marked. On August 10 a further well-defined stage of development had been reached. On the 11th the ocelli were plainly visible. Next day I noted the antennae, mandibles, palpi, and legs. The segments, warts, and spiracles were also to be seen. On the 12th and some subsequent days I saw plainly somewhat feeble but unmistakable and decided movements of the legs, especially of the tarsi and ungues. At this season of the year the egg should have been hatched in about ten or twelve days. I have no longer any hope of this, and all larval movements appear to have ceased. All the other (thirty-three) eggs have undergone the usual degeneration, but this one presents a striking contrast to them, showing all the external parts perfectly formed and distinctly visible, as far as the position of the larva (which is just the reverse of the usual one, namely, with the dorsum in place of the venter next the surface of attachment) allows them to be seen. There is an un-unsual appearance of brownish coloration towards the caudal end, the nature of which I have not made out. The failure to hatch out, however, does not hinder this from being a decided case of embryonal development in an egg laid by a female of Gastrophysa raphani whose virginity is assured; and it is a solitary instance occurring among some eight or nine hundred eggs laid by the same beetle both before and after and along with it, all of which (as far as observed) were normally and uniformly barren.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"20","prism.number":"514","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"430","prism.endingPage":"430","prism.copyright":"1879 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/020430a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/020430a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/020430a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/020430a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Parthenogenesis in a Beetle","citation_volume":"20","citation_issue":"514","citation_publication_date":"1879/09","citation_firstpage":"430","citation_lastpage":"430","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/020430a0","DOI":"10.1038/020430a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/020430a0","description":"I DO not know whether any instances have been recorded of parthenogenesis in the coleoptera, nor does the interest of the case I am about to relate consist in the discovery of the operation of a not uncommon mode of insect reproduction in a new field, but rather in its altogether abnormal and fortuitous character in the species of beetle concerned, viz., Gastrophysa raphani.

I used no clock-work arrangement with the camera, but allowed the moon to traverse the plate, and I have since then taken several photographic observations under various conditions. I have taken the moon in all her phases, with long and short exposures, in clear and cloudless sky, and never could get a ring even faintly defined. I have also heated the camera and screwed the cold lens into it, carried it into a colder atmosphere in order to produce condensation of dew. I have placed two small separate openings in front of the lens; on one occasion I dusted puff-ball spores upon the lens; on another I breathed warm breath upon it, but never got anything but decided burr, which was always densest near the limb of the moon and gradually tapered away towards the circumference like a bright light seen through a thick fog, but no appearance of ring. I have also taken observations when scud was passing rapidly over the moon, when perfect prismatic halos were visible to the naked eye, but no ring was ever impressed on the photographs; nothing more than a haze, such as that produced by breathing on the lens. The next full moon (September 29) was totally obscured, so that I failed to get an observation then; but last evening (October 29), at 10 P.M., I was fortunate to get one fine, clear exposure of one-and-a-half minute, and was pleased to see a clear and well-defined ring rise up on the plate during development, similar in every respect to that obtained on August 29, showing clearly that this unusual appearance is dependent upon the position of the moon in her orbit, she being in opposition when she manifests ring-giving power and shows us a crown. But why is this? What is the cause of this unusual, and, I believe, hitherto undescribed, appearance? Why should this ring be invisible to the naked eye and yet give a luminous impression on a photographic plate? Why should it appear only at full moon period and not at any other phase? Can it have any connection with what Mr. Newall saw round Mars through his huge telescope? If the moon had an atmosphere similar to that of the earth, and a star of some magnitude were occulted by the moon at that particular time, it is possible that its light in passing through the lunar atmosphere might be refracted so as to show a corona round the moon; but it is pretty generally acknowledged that there is no atmosphere surrounding it, therefore there can be no refraction.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"21","prism.number":"524","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"33","prism.endingPage":"33","prism.copyright":"1879 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/021033a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/021033a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/021033a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/021033a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Lunar Ring","citation_volume":"21","citation_issue":"524","citation_publication_date":"1879/11","citation_firstpage":"33","citation_lastpage":"33","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/021033a0","DOI":"10.1038/021033a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/021033a0","description":"WHILE experimenting on the actenic power of lunar light on August 30 last (period of full moon), at 9.30 P.M., I obtained, with a minute-and-a-half exposure, a photographic negative of the moon, which shows a distinct and well-defined ring or glory around it which was not visible to the naked eye on looking directly at the moon in a clear and cloudless sky, nor was there any halo on the ground glass of the camera, nor on the lens, at the time of observation This is a copy of it from the negative.

I had further, following up a theory submitted by me to the Royal Irish Academy, on the Correlation of Coast-Line Directions, and published by that body, drawn up on a Geikie's Geological Map of Scotland certain of those correlated lines, and on a smaller map of the British Isles had indicated both the lines in question and the localities wherein earthquakes have been noticed in later times, more essentially since 1860.

Lippmann, which appears in the current issue of NATURE, with the acknowledgment that his quotation from the Comptes rendus of 1876 establishes in the most conclusive manner his priority of date in the enunciation of the doctrine of the Conservation of Electricity. As to my own independent enunciation of this doctrine, it was arrived at without any knowledge of the comparison drawn by M. Lippmann in 1876 between the cyclical flow of heat (of Carnot's theorem) and the cyclical flow of electricity. I approached the matter upon somewhat different and less clearly defined lines, and finally struck upon the fundamental notion of the Conservation of Electricity when endeavouring to think out the relations between electromotive and ponderomotive force in an electric theory of radiation based upon Clerk-Maxwell's Electromagnetic Theory of Light. My speculations on this point were committed to writing some weeks ago, and will shortly be published. I content myself in the meantime with pointing out how near Clerk-Maxwell came to a similar conclusion. In Article 35 of his well-known treatise, he says emphatically: \u201cWhile admitting electricity, as we have now done, to the rank of a physical quantity, we must not too hastily assume that it is, or is not, a substance, or that it is, or is not, a form of energy, or that it belongs to any known category of physical quantities. All that we have hitherto proved is that it cannot be created or annihilated\u201d (the italics are mine). Nevertheless the immediate and logical conclusion that electricity, like matter and like energy, is subject to a law of conservation, appears to have been rejected by Clerk-Maxwell for reasons explained in Article 574 of his treatise, consequent on his inability to discover whether an electric current possessed momentum or could exert a mechanical reaction upon the matter of the conductor through which it flows. The unfortunate dilemma which suggested this experiment could hardly have been raised if it had then been as clearly understood as it now is that there is the same distinction between electro-kinetic and ponderokinetic energy as between electromotive and ponderomotive force.

This single ray was perpendicular, and appeared to be little, if at all affected, in its brilliancy by the approaching dusk of evening, but continued to exhibit itself with little-diminished brilliancy for nearly half an hour, finally disappearing with the twilight.","dc.creator":["GIBNEY, ROBERT DWARRIS"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["GIBNEY, ROBERT DWARRIS"],"citation_author_institution":["Glan-y-dwr, South Wales"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Zodiacal Light(?)","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Zodiacal Light(?)&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"028031a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

On going to the spot where it had settled, it was found to be alive and crouching in the long grass. The keeper ran in and placed his hand on it, when the bird struggled and tried to get away; he killed it seeing that it was wounded.

The other pellet had entered behind and below the left eyeball, and, passing forward, had emerged on the other side, passing above the upper mandible. The brain was uninjured, but the lower part of the left eyeball was cut and distended with blood. There was no other injury. No doubt the shock had confused the bird, and caused its strange flight, which, though upward, was very different in its character from that of ordinary towering where the lungs are perforated, and unconsciousness is the result of the circulation of non-a\u00ebrated blood.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"29","prism.number":"733","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"55","prism.endingPage":"56","prism.copyright":"1883 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029055d0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/029055d0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029055d0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029055d0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Towering of Birds","citation_volume":"29","citation_issue":"733","citation_publication_date":"1883/11","citation_firstpage":"55","citation_lastpage":"56","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/029055d0","DOI":"10.1038/029055d0","citation_doi":"10.1038/029055d0","description":"WHEN shooting in Fifeshire last October I fired at a partridge at a distance of about forty yards; the bird flew on for a short distance, and then began to rise, not in the manner in which a towering bird generally ascends, but soaring as if it did so voluntarily.

No doubt the shock had confused the bird, and caused its strange flight, which, though upward, was very different in its character from that of ordinary towering where the lungs are perforated, and unconsciousness is the result of the circulation of non-a\u00ebrated blood.","dc.creator":["FAYRER, J."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["FAYRER, J."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Towering of Birds","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Towering of Birds&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"029076a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

I have had frequent occasion to note the intensity of the so-called \u201crain-band,\u201d an absorption-band of terrestrial origin, due probably to the dust and water-vapour present in the atmosphere, and of just less refrangibility than the less refrangible of the D lines, and have at present two continuous records of observations taken, in the main, five times a day, running back a year and a half or so. I have also a very thorough list of the auroral displays which have occurred for the same period in this vicinity. Granting that the aurora is an electric discharge in high regions of the atmosphere, or, more accurately, where its density is inappreciable compared with that at the earth's surface, and knowing that according to these recent experiments an electric discharge is capable of precipitating the dust-particles in the atmosphere, it should follow that at times of auroral display, or immediately following, the intensity of this rain-band should be at a mininum. Searching the records to ascertain if any such correspondence could be noticed, it is quite astonishing to find how distinct and well marked this variation in the intensity of the rain-band at times of auroral occurrence is. The atmosphere is full of fine dust-particles, and our very general, though not yet decisively proven, belief is that the aurora is somewhat of a glow-like discharge from electrified air strata, in whose vicinity the density of the dielectric is inconsiderable. The direct inference is that at such times the fine dust and vapour particles are deposited, made to settle, or, uniting together, form an agglomeration, and become perhaps cloud-nuclei.

I have had frequent occasion to note the intensity of the so-called \u201crain-band,\u201d an absorption-band of terrestrial origin, due probably to the dust and water-vapour present in the atmosphere, and of just less refrangibility than the less refrangible of the D lines, and have at present two continuous records of observations taken, in the main, five times a day, running back a year and a half or so. I have also a very thorough list of the auroral displays which have occurred for the same period in this vicinity. Granting that the aurora is an electric discharge in high regions of the atmosphere, or, more accurately, where its density is inappreciable compared with that at the earth's surface, and knowing that according to these recent experiments an electric discharge is capable of precipitating the dust-particles in the atmosphere, it should follow that at times of auroral display, or immediately following, the intensity of this rain-band should be at a mininum. Searching the records to ascertain if any such correspondence could be noticed, it is quite astonishing to find how distinct and well marked this variation in the intensity of the rain-band at times of auroral occurrence is. The atmosphere is full of fine dust-particles, and our very general, though not yet decisively proven, belief is that the aurora is somewhat of a glow-like discharge from electrified air strata, in whose vicinity the density of the dielectric is inconsiderable. The direct inference is that at such times the fine dust and vapour particles are deposited, made to settle, or, uniting together, form an agglomeration, and become perhaps cloud-nuclei. Perhaps other evidence on this matter can be elicited. The records at hand show very plainly just such an agreement as was anticipated.","dc.creator":["MCADIE, ALEXANDER"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MCADIE, ALEXANDER"],"citation_author_institution":["Cambridge, U.S.A."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Atmospheric Dust","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Atmospheric Dust&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"030216c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It settled on the fly, and when I came to look at the butchery\u2014for I cannot call it a fight\u2014the poor fly was minus its head, and I was in time to see one of its wings fluttering down to the ground. The wasp was stretching over its victim and holding him as a spider might do, and on my approach he spread his wings and carried off the body to the other end of the room, presumably to eat it.

A very bright after-glow was visible here on October 27 last. I believe the date is correct, although I have unfortunately mislaid my day-book; the facts, however, I can vouch for otherwise, as they were detailed at the time. At 5 p.m. a heavy bank of cumulus was to be seen extending along the south-western sky-line, about 5\u00b0 above and closely parallel to the horizon. High over this bluish bank of cloud rose the yellow haze of departing sunlight. This diffused after-glow was plainly intersected by numerous (I counted twenty-two) delicate streaks of nebulous stratus. These intersecting lines (they were scarcely \u201cbands\u201d) were horizontal and parallel, piled up, as it were, above one another as high as 25\u00b0 from the sea-line. The lowest hung apparently about half a degree above the gilded upper edge of the dark cumulus. On November 4, just before sunset, I exposed a gelatine plate, and succeeded in obtaining a photograph, in which seven of these narrow horizontal cloud-streaks can be faintly seen. On December 1 the following note was made:\u20144.20 p.m. Wind light, N. N. W. Sunset-glow intersected by five horizontal dark cloud-streaks in the west. On the 2nd inst., at 4.20 p. m., five cumulostrati were visible in the west, separated by parallel and horizontal orange-coloured bands. Above these were numerous (probably twenty) delicate dark lines traversing\u2014also horizontally\u2014the upper roseate after-glow. On the 10th and 11th inst., somewhat similar phenomena were visible here. On the 15th inst., with a light southerly air, eleven cloud-hands were seen by me 4.30 p.m. In this case only, they were not parallel to the sea-line, but followed the direction of the west-north-west horizon. I have seen the same appearances once or twice since the last date. The above phenomena are new to me, and I have not met with any detailed account of them elsewhere.

Any person would suppose that a large swarm of bees was in motion, and playing about over his head. This noise was heard last week on June 28.\u201d","dc.creator":["BATH, W.

With the tiny drops composing a fog, the discrepancy is so marked that the bow receives a new name\u2014the fog-bow, or \u201carc-en-ciel blanc.\u201d Mr. Mohn's (NATURE, February 23, p. 391) nearly simultaneous measurements of the fog-bow and Ulloa's rings afford a capital opportunity of putting the theory to the test, for from the latter phenomenon we can readily calculate the average size of the particles.","dc.creator":["MCCONNEL, JAMES C."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MCCONNEL, JAMES C."],"citation_author_institution":["St. Moritz, Switzerland"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Fog Bow","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Fog Bow&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"037559a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The right lower extremity was normal in every respect; the left appeared on superficial examination to be absent. An incision made through the skin over the left flank at once disclosed the left limb, the joints being flexed to their utmost extent, and the thigh adducted, so that it lay in contact with the abdominal muscles, of the left side; at the tibio-tarsal joint the limb passed through the wall of the abdomen, a few millimetres above the symphysis pubis. A portion of the yolk-sac protruded at the aperture by which the foot penetrated the abdominal wall. Opening the abdomen showed the remainder of the yolk-sac, its connection with the ileum, and the left foot lying upon the surface of the intestines. This included foot was fully developed, having a complete web, and being covered with scales.

The right lower extremity was normal in every respect; the left appeared on superficial examination to be absent. An incision made through the skin over the left flank at once disclosed the left limb, the joints being flexed to their utmost extent, and the thigh adducted, so that it lay in contact with the abdominal muscles, of the left side; at the tibio-tarsal joint the limb passed through the wall of the abdomen, a few millimetres above the symphysis pubis. A portion of the yolk-sac protruded at the aperture by which the foot penetrated the abdominal wall. Opening the abdomen showed the remainder of the yolk-sac, its connection with the ileum, and the left foot lying upon the surface of the intestines. This included foot was fully developed, having a complete web, and being covered with scales. An adhesion existed between the outer surface of the yolk-sac and the left leg in the region of its tibio-tarsal joint, and there were also adhesions of the sac to the skin of the abdomen, covering the lower part of the tibial muscles. This adhesion of the yolk-sac to the leg had apparently taken place after the full development of the limb; and the yolk-sac, in the course of its withdrawal into the cavity of the abdomen, had apparently drawn the foot in with it. The withdrawal of the yolk-sac is generally held to be brought about by the absorption of its contents; if the above explanation of the existing condition be correct, a considerable force must be exerted by this act of absorption if it is capable of dragging the foot, from its normal position, into the cavity of the abdomen.","dc.creator":["REID, E.

The purpose of such diffusion should be to afford, as far as possible, to every individual the opportunity of obtaining such a training as would qualify him or her to take part in the development of some branch of knowledge, or at any rate to follow with appreciation and interest the advance made by others.","dc.creator":["ROBERTS, R.

This correspondence to the time of a synodic revolution of the sun, to which attention has been called by the writer many times within a few years past, is interesting, showing as it does that the motion of rotation is concerned to an important extent in the recurrence of magnetic storms and their accompanying auroras. The evidence is accumulating constantly showing that solar disturbances have their maximum effect upon terrestrial magnetism when at the eastern limb and at or near the latitude of the plane of the earth's orbit.

This correspondence to the time of a synodic revolution of the sun, to which attention has been called by the writer many times within a few years past, is interesting, showing as it does that the motion of rotation is concerned to an important extent in the recurrence of magnetic storms and their accompanying auroras. The evidence is accumulating constantly showing that solar disturbances have their maximum effect upon terrestrial magnetism when at the eastern limb and at or near the latitude of the plane of the earth's orbit. If the great sun-spot to which the aurora of February 13 has so generally been ascribed was really responsible for that outbreak, there should have been a series of displays, for this spot was very large and apparently active throughout its transit. As a matter of fact, whatever auroral effect the disturbed region in its vicinity was able to exercise fell about February 2\u20134 and February 29.

I have just returned thence from a visit made expressly for the purpose of searching for further remains of this bird, of which I received at first only the cranium. I have been very fortunate in my search, and have procured several most perfect crania, with tibi\u00e6 and femora, which I have no doubt belong to the same bird, as more than once I discovered these bones in the immediate neighbourhood of the crania. The bones have been disinterred from the lower beds of a sandbank facing the shore. Some years ago, a great storm, followed, as I am told, by a tidal wave of great height, broke the Eurybiaprotected shore bluff; and now the wind, having carried off the upper bed of light-coloured sand into the lands behind, is continually planing down more and more the brown lower bed in which these bones seem mostly to be entombed. They are in a most perfect state of preservation, and very complete, though deprived of all their animal matter. Of the Aphanapteryx crania some are considerably larger and some much smaller than A. Brackei, the larger reaching to within 1/20 inch of 6 inches from the top of the slender arched upper mandible to the occiput. The tibi\u00e6 and femora vary in size corresponding to the differences in the crania; but they present the main characters of the bones figured by M. Milne-Edwards in his \u201c Oiseaux fossiles de la France.\u201d It may yet turn out that more than one species of Aphanapteryx inhabited the Chatham Islands. It is very singular that, among the thousands of bones that have been collected from different swamps, Maori middens, and caves in various parts of New Zealand, not a single bone of this bird should have come to light. In one refuse heap from a Moriori feast laid bare by the wind on the beach of Petre Bay, I found several specimens of Aphanapteryx hawkinsi, along with crania and other bones of ducks, swan, sea-birds, seals, whales, &c. Swan-bones were everywhere very abundant in this brown sand bed; some of them indicating birds equal in size to Chenopis atrata, others considerably exceeding it. In one very ancient midden the remains I dug up consisted almost entirely of swan-bones, with the intermixture of only a few duck-bones. The Aphanapteryx must, I think, be the wingless bird spoken of by the Morioris as Mehiriki, although those to whom the skull has been shown fail to recognize the bird at all. They speak also of another flightless bird by the name of Mehunui. This bird, one old and very intelligent Moriori informed me, was the same as the Maoris called Kakapo. Mr. Alexander Shand, an old resident in the Chatham Islands, and the sole European living versed in Moriori customs and traditions, and capable of speaking their language with fluency, also confirmed this information, and told me that the Kakapo (according to the Morioris) was very abundant in the islands prior to 1836. He himself in the early days had seen their burrows often. I had observed, while collecting, several Psittacine bones, and on learning this fact I felt sure that those I had picked up and packed away must belong to Stringops. On my arrival here, however, I find so far that there are no Kakapo bones in the collection, the Psittacine bones being the head and beaks of Nestor notabilis, the Kea. I have as yet had time to do no more than run through the collection I have brought back; but there appear to be in it several large Ralline tibi\u00e6 of species unknown to me.

Nor are these differences consistently explicable by taking into consideration the interatomic distances, as measured by atomic volume, for the molecular volume of the normal propyl glycerate with its greater rotation is less than that of the isopropyl compound with its smaller rotation, whilst the molecular volumes of the isobutyl and secondary butyl glycerates are almost exactly equal, although the rotation of the former is much greater than that of the latter.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"47","prism.number":"1222","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"510","prism.endingPage":"511","prism.copyright":"1893 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/047510c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/047510c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/047510c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/047510c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Van't Hoff's \u201cStereochemistry\u201d","citation_volume":"47","citation_issue":"1222","citation_publication_date":"1893/03","citation_firstpage":"510","citation_lastpage":"511","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/047510c0","DOI":"10.1038/047510c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/047510c0","description":"THE review of the above by \u201cF.

COCKERELL'S letter (NATURE, vol. xlvii. p. 608) suggests the possibility that the following fact bearing on the connection between a coccid and another member of the Aculeate Hymenoptera may be interesting.

In music and form we have well-established and very satisfactory terms to describe definite sense perceptions, and it would be difficult to conceive how we could dispense with them; but for colour perceptions we have neither any well-defined concepts for those terms which have become well established, nor any definite and well-arranged system of colour terms for common use. Those terms which have acquired a somewhat definite significance are nevertheless used for a very wide range of variation. Vermilion and ultramarine, terms which have been used by many of our best authorities on colour, for want of anything better, as a basis for comparison and analysis, are nevertheless used for very variable concepts. The difference between a Chinese and a German vermilion in pigments is very noticeable.

In music and form we have well-established and very satisfactory terms to describe definite sense perceptions, and it would be difficult to conceive how we could dispense with them; but for colour perceptions we have neither any well-defined concepts for those terms which have become well established, nor any definite and well-arranged system of colour terms for common use. Those terms which have acquired a somewhat definite significance are nevertheless used for a very wide range of variation. Vermilion and ultramarine, terms which have been used by many of our best authorities on colour, for want of anything better, as a basis for comparison and analysis, are nevertheless used for very variable concepts. The difference between a Chinese and a German vermilion in pigments is very noticeable.

At 11.30, rapid beams of light were seen following the curve of the bow from west to east, each succeeded by straight arrow-like flashes above the bow in the opposite direction; 11.36, streaks again appeared on the eastern side; 11.39, the bow threw off clouds, of light radially, first on the western, then on the eastern side; 11.42, the phenomena observed at 11.30 again set in on the western side; 11.49, the bow became very sharp towards the west and threw out streaks of light, while towards the east it became broken and flickering; 11.55, streamers appeared on the eastern side, and the bow became contracted on this side and smaller, striking the horizon at a higher angle; 11.58, the bow thickened and threw off radial clouds again; 12.1, a fine streamer appeared on the extreme eastern side; 12.3, the bow became very irregular, and for the first time the streamers appeared to start below the bow, three very sharp ones forming towards the east; 12.7, a second bow formed below the original one; 12.9, the bow broke up entirely towards the east into fine streamers, radial clouds of light being thrown off in the west; 12.20, bow became very indistinct in the west, and streamers gave place to clouds of light in the east; 12.22, streamers reappeared in the east; 12.25, arc of the bow reformed; 12.27, bow narrowed down and broke into two bows; 12.30, bow became irregular and sank down towards the horizon; 12.37, bow disappeared and faint streamers formed. After this a gradual fading set in, but the light was still visible though feeble at 1 a.m. The atmosphere had been exceptionally clear all through the day.","dc.creator":["M., A.

Prof. Poulton (NATURE, December 3, p. 100) seeks to justify his action on the ground that \u201cin a matter of such great importance \u2026 it is probably fair to conclude that, with the great majority of physicists, \u2018silence gave consent.\u2019\u201d This doctrine of silence is surely untenable. If an authority on acoustics pronounces views even on the fundamentals of sound, is an electrician to be held consenting when he forms no opinion or reserves it to himself?

Prof. Poulton (NATURE, December 3, p. 100) seeks to justify his action on the ground that \u201cin a matter of such great importance \u2026 it is probably fair to conclude that, with the great majority of physicists, \u2018silence gave consent.\u2019\u201d This doctrine of silence is surely untenable. If an authority on acoustics pronounces views even on the fundamentals of sound, is an electrician to be held consenting when he forms no opinion or reserves it to himself?

Through the kindness of a friend and the courtesy of the Excise authorities, we received certain samples direct from a bonded warehouse; we were informed that the spirit had been returned at 42 per cent over proof, equivalent to 74.6 per cent, alcohol by weight; our determinations showed the assessment to be correct.

WILLIS'S inference that some Bielan meteors may be visible this year seems quite in accordance with the historical facts of the stream. The parent comet was observed between 1772 and 1852, and its mean period from twelve revolutions was 6.71 years. If this also represents its mean orbital time since 1852, perihelion would occur in September 1899. But the last four observed returns from 1826 to 1852 averaged 6.62 years, which would indicate perihelion at the end of January 1899. On the whole it seems highly probable that when the earth crossed the comet's orbit in November 1898 it was too far in advance of the cometary nucleus for any meteoric shower to result. It also appears likely that at the meeting, now imminent, of the earth and cometary orbit, the former will encounter a section of the stream too far in the wake of the comet for it to be very thickly strewn with its material. However, this remains to be seen. The apparition of a fine shower of these meteors on November 23, 1892, sufficiently proves that the period of thirteen years intervening between the rich displays of 1872 and 1885 did not exactly represent two returns of the same part of the meteoric group. In 1872 the earth passed through a section of the stream following the comet, while in 1885 it encountered a part preceding the comet. Intervals of twenty years (equivalent to about three periodical revolutions of the comet) seem favourable to recurrences of the meteoric shower as it was observed in 1798 and 1838 (including two periods of twenty years) and in 1872 and 1892.

In experiments on the absorption spectrum of ozone made by me in 1881, it was found that strong sulphuric acid free from all the usual impurities was not absolutely clear, but by being kept in an atmosphere containing a large proportion of ozone it became perfectly brilliant and absolutely colourless when seen in volumes of half a gallon to two gallons at a time.

Those of us who are not mathematicians feel themselves to be very much at the mercy of those who are, and we can only beg the physicists to remember our infirmity and to put their statements before us in the clearest, simplest, and most carefully chosen language. Sir Oliver Lodge, as Clerk Maxwell did before him, throws out to psychologists the suggestion that mind may act upon body by exerting guidance without doing work. Such guidance, we are told, may be effected by the application of force to moving masses in the nervous system in directions perpendicular to the direction of the movements of those masses. \u201cGuidance is a passive exertion of force without doing work; as a quiescent rail can guide a train to its destination, provided an active engine propels it.\u201d This is the sentence that I find so indigestible. And my confusion is but increased by Sir Oliver Lodge's further illustrations. He distinguishes two kinds of force. \u201cForce in motion is a power, it does work and transfers energy from one body to another. But a force at rest\u2014a mere statical stress, like that exerted by a pillar or a watershed\u2014does no work, and alters no energy; yet the one sustains a roof which would otherwise fall, thereby screening a portion of ground from vegetation; while the other deflects a rain-drop into the Danube or the Rhine.\u201d And, again, we read that life can exert \u201cthe same kind of force which can constrain a stone to revolve in a circle instead of in a straight line; a force like that of a groove or slot or channel or guide.\u201d My first question is, Is it fair to say that the pillar supporting the roof exerts a force in the same sense as the rail which guides the train, the roof which guides the rain-drop, or the hand which holds the string? In the first case there is no motion, and therefore no change of direction of motion, no alteration of energy; in the other cases there is motion and alteration of direction of motion. Secondly, is it fair to call the rail quiescent? In guiding the train round a curve does not the rail, and the mass to which it is made fast, suffer an acceleration or a change of motion in the direction opposite to that of the train? When I swing round a heavy ball on a string, and feel it pulling my hand centrifugally, and when by muscular effort I resist the pull, is that \u201ca passive exertion of force without doing work\"? Or, if the string is fastened to the end of an upright pole, is there not movement of the mass to which the pole is fixed in the direction opposite to the deflection of the movement of the ball? Every kind of mechanical guidance that I can picture to myself seems to imply action and reaction, change of direction of one momentum seems to imply always an opposite change of direction of an equivalent momentum. This is, I suppose, the mechanical law of conservation of momentum, of which Prof. James Ward tells us that it is incompatible with the conception of guidance without work. I ask Sir Oliver Lodge whether we are to understand that he is prepared to throw this one mechanical law to the wolves in order to preserve the rest of the creed of the physicists unharmed by Prof. Ward's attack? Or are we to understand that he repudiates the law of conservation of momentum in toto? In that case, I ask him to describe for us clearly a single case of mechanical guidance in which momentum is not conserved, or, since my use of the phrase may be technically incorrect, I ask him to describe a case of change of direction of motion of any mass produced without expenditure of energy or opposite change of direction of motion of other mass or masses.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"68","prism.number":"1750","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"32","prism.endingPage":"33","prism.copyright":"1903 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/068032a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/068032a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/068032a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/068032a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Psychophysical Interaction","citation_volume":"68","citation_issue":"1750","citation_publication_date":"1903/05","citation_firstpage":"32","citation_lastpage":"33","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/068032a0","DOI":"10.1038/068032a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/068032a0","description":"As a psychologist I have read with deep interest Sir Oliver Lodge's paper in your issue of April 23, and I write to ask him to make clear some points which his paper leaves obscure to my mind.

This method is very satisfactory from most points of view, and will perhaps continue to be used by astronomers. Nevertheless, I think it worth while to direct attention to another method, which is more simple, and which, I believe, will be found equally accurate. It consists in observing with the naked eye the gradual disappearance of the blue colour of the sky as darkness comes on. It is surprising how accurate a person of good sight can make this observation when the atmosphere is perfectly clear.

This method is very satisfactory from most points of view, and will perhaps continue to be used by astronomers. Nevertheless, I think it worth while to direct attention to another method, which is more simple, and which, I believe, will be found equally accurate. It consists in observing with the naked eye the gradual disappearance of the blue colour of the sky as darkness comes on. It is surprising how accurate a person of good sight can make this observation when the atmosphere is perfectly clear. The time of sunset should be noted, and the time of the last sensible blue of the sky. With the data in the Nautical Almanac a simple computation by spherical trigonometry gives the depression of the sun at the instant the blue fades out into black, and we at once calculate the height of the illuminated particles overhead.

With regard to the discovery of this remarkable beast, there are perhaps other names which should be associated with it as well as those of the late Sir Henry M. Stanley and myself. No mention of this forest-pig appears in Sir Henry Stanley's published works, but in conversation with myself and others he frequently told us that, in addition to hearing of a \u201cdonkey-like animal with large ears\u201d (which afterwards turned out to be the okapi), he once saw a huge black pig, and he had reason to believe that a strange new species or genus of pig inhabited that portion of the Congo Forest near the Semliki River. I heard and transmitted similar stories told me by the natives of that forest; but even more detailed accounts were collected and sent later on by the late W. G. Doggett, who, to the great loss of zoological collecting in Africa, was drowned in the River Kagera in the early part of the present year. But I think the first definite accounts of this pig (or at any rate of Hylochoerus meinertzhageni) were transmitted by Mr. C. W. Hobley, C.M.G., a sub-commissioner of the East Africa Protectorate, who has recently been acting as Commissioner after the departure of Sir Charles Eliot. Mr. Hobley sent a drawing of the skull and a description of the creature from imperfect specimens he had seen on the slopes of Mount Kenia. Unfortunately his letters were delayed in transmission, so far as their reaching the Zoological Society was concerned. Mr. Hobley is now in England, and it is to be hoped that he will furnish the Zoological Society in detail with the extremely interesting particulars he has given me in conversation regarding this remarkable animal.

B. Poulton recorded the capture of twenty-two specimens of this rare slug upon a wall in Oxford. On that occasion there had been exceptionally heavy rains, and it was suggested that the, animals had been driven out of their usual habitat, the earth, as it became sodden with moisture. I am in a position to confirm the accuracy of this suggestion. Last evening I captured five specimens of Testacella haliotidea upon a stone wall near Charterhouse.

B. Poulton recorded the capture of twenty-two specimens of this rare slug upon a wall in Oxford. On that occasion there had been exceptionally heavy rains, and it was suggested that the, animals had been driven out of their usual habitat, the earth, as it became sodden with moisture. I am in a position to confirm the accuracy of this suggestion. Last evening I captured five specimens of Testacella haliotidea upon a stone wall near Charterhouse. The slugs were apparently crawling out of the ivy which thickly clothes the top of the wall, and were making their way back to the earth. During the previous eight days no less than 3.80 inches of rain fell at this place.

White-shelled eggs are laid only by birds which make a good nest\u2014those which make it in a secluded spot, or which take the precaution of covering their eggs with leaves, &c., when they are off the nest. It is a strange fact, therefore, that the non-sitting breeds of our domestic fowls lay white-shelled eggs, whereas in the eggs of the sitting or Asiatic breeds the protective colouring is retained in the shell of the egg.

White-shelled eggs are laid only by birds which make a good nest\u2014those which make it in a secluded spot, or which take the precaution of covering their eggs with leaves, &c., when they are off the nest. It is a strange fact, therefore, that the non-sitting breeds of our domestic fowls lay white-shelled eggs, whereas in the eggs of the sitting or Asiatic breeds the protective colouring is retained in the shell of the egg. This loss of colour cannot be merely the result of centuries of domestication, or all breeds of domestic fowls would lay white-shelled eggs. The systematic repression of the maternal instincts of the hen carried on by man for a number of years has certainly produced the white-shelled egg.

Reasoning from Kirchhoff's law, it is frequently assumed that the Wien-Paschen function must be an envelope to the radiation spectrum of any gas, at least for certain selected lines.

This material is then slowly burnt before the breaking of the monsoon.","dc.creator":["FLETCHER, F."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["FLETCHER, F."],"citation_author_institution":["School of Agriculture, Gizeh, Egypt"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Fertilising Influence of Sunlight","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Fertilising Influence of Sunlight&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"083312c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

On the evening of August 21, which he mentions, thunderstorms of extreme violence came over the region of Lugano and its environs. That region is due south-east of Beatenberg, as is also the Mnch. The flashes seen were most certainly those of lightning, and the auroral appearance is very easily explained.

On the evening of August 21, which he mentions, thunderstorms of extreme violence came over the region of Lugano and its environs. That region is due south-east of Beatenberg, as is also the Mnch. The flashes seen were most certainly those of lightning, and the auroral appearance is very easily explained.

The water in one half was cooled by means of ice in varying amounts, and on removing the partition the cold water always flowed over the hot.","dc.creator":["AITKEN, JOHN"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["AITKEN, JOHN"],"citation_author_institution":["Ardenlea, Falkirk"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Influence of Icebergs on the Temperature of...","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Influence of Icebergs on the Temperature of the Sea&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"090543d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

But whenever that time does arrive, mankind in general and medical mankind in particular will have no other refuge against the ravages of cancer than its treatment with genuine strong injections of trypsin and amylopsin. Scientifically, what evidences are there of this? In the first place, among others, three successful cases treated by Major Lamballe were described in my book on cancer, published two years ago. It is quite four years since the patients were treated. Two of them are certainly alive and well, and I believe that this is also so with the third. More recently, I have pointed out, in a paper on the occurrence of dextro-rotatory albumins in organic nature, noticed not long ago in your columns, that the asexual generations, such as the malaria parasite, &c, which induce disease, are the same in nature as cancer-cells, and have foretold their total destruction by the ferments, trypsin and amylopsin. In a memoir, which is about to be published, Major F. W. Lamballe, R.A.M.C., has demonstrated the scientific truth of this. He has shown in a way which must carry complete conviction, that cases of benign and malignant tertian malaria, even very grave cases with cerebral symptoms, in all of which, as his results show, quinine had proved quite useless to stem the disease and to prevent relapses, from one to three injections of pancreatic enzymes sufficed not merely to kill all the parasites, but to cure the patient. Relapses in the patients\u2014which had been the rule in very nearly all the cases\u2014did not occur after this brief treatment, and the men (British soldiers) were able to return to duty at once, even in some instances on the day of the second or third injection. That is to say\u2014and it is a matter for great scientific satisfaction\u2014the original work, which I began in 1888, has now resulted in the easy and complete conquest of malaria. What this means can be understood from the facts concerning the treatment of malignant malaria, which at present is the rule in the Army. This entails a course of treatment by quinine lasting at least four months, and very often, if not always, even then the patient is not cured. But I understand that during this time the soldier is regarded as unfit for active service, and sometimes 25 per cent, of a regiment stationed in the tropics may be in this condition. In contrast to this the pancreatic treatment of malignant malaria in the hands of Major Lamballe entails not more than three injections, costing at the outside three shillings, it need not last two weeks, and the patient can return to duty at once, and so far as we know is then free from all danger of relapse, but not immune to a new infection. The facts here outlined indicate that, properly applied, that which cures malignant malaria must cure cancer.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"92","prism.number":"2290","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"60","prism.endingPage":"61","prism.copyright":"1913 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/092060c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/092060c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/092060c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/092060c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Nature and Treatment of Cancer and Malaria","citation_volume":"92","citation_issue":"2290","citation_publication_date":"1913/09","citation_firstpage":"60","citation_lastpage":"61","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/092060c0","DOI":"10.1038/092060c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/092060c0","description":"MAY I ask your courtesy for a brief reference to the article by Dr. C.

This entails a course of treatment by quinine lasting at least four months, and very often, if not always, even then the patient is not cured. But I understand that during this time the soldier is regarded as unfit for active service, and sometimes 25 per cent, of a regiment stationed in the tropics may be in this condition. In contrast to this the pancreatic treatment of malignant malaria in the hands of Major Lamballe entails not more than three injections, costing at the outside three shillings, it need not last two weeks, and the patient can return to duty at once, and so far as we know is then free from all danger of relapse, but not immune to a new infection. The facts here outlined indicate that, properly applied, that which cures malignant malaria must cure cancer.","dc.creator":["BEARD, J."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["BEARD, J."],"citation_author_institution":["Edinburgh"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Nature and Treatment of Cancer and Malaria","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Nature and Treatment of Cancer and Malaria&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"092346a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

R.

The specimen has been mounted by Mr. Gerrard, of Camden Town, and is still in his workshop, whilst the skull has been purchased by the Royal College of Surgeons. I have been given the opportunity of examining both the mounted skin and the skull. The skull is of an individual of nearly the same size and age as that presented to the Natural History Museum by the late Captain Boyd Alexander, carefully figured under my superintendence with many other skulls of the okapi in the atlas of my \u201cMonograph of the Okapi,\u201d published in 1910 by the trustees of the British Museum. With the new skull acquired by the College of Surgeons, and apparently belonging to the same animal as the skin, is a pair of small ossicones, not yet ankylosed to the skull, measuring about 2 in. along the longer side from point to base. They are of the same shape and little shorter than those of Boyd Alexander's specimen. In neither skull is there as yet a tuberculated surface of the frontal bone developed for the attachment of the ossicone. In the Boyd Alexander specimen each ossicone stood up as a projecting cone, and was covered with the hairy skin except for a small area at the free end, where the hair seems to have been rubbed away, or removed in preparing the skin, as may be seen in the mounted specimen in the Natural History Museum. In Major Powell-Cotton's specimen, of which both skin and skeleton are in the museum, each ossicone is longer, slightly compressed from side to side, and claw-like in shape, the point curved downward and backward; and each ossicone rests on a pitted and tuberculated surface of the frontal bone, to which it is closely fitted but not yet ankylosed.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"95","prism.number":"2368","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"64","prism.endingPage":"65","prism.copyright":"1915 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/095064a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/095064a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/095064a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/095064a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Supposed Horn-Sheaths of an Okapi","citation_volume":"95","citation_issue":"2368","citation_publication_date":"1915/03","citation_firstpage":"64","citation_lastpage":"65","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/095064a0","DOI":"10.1038/095064a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/095064a0","description":"MR.

I have been given the opportunity of examining both the mounted skin and the skull. The skull is of an individual of nearly the same size and age as that presented to the Natural History Museum by the late Captain Boyd Alexander, carefully figured under my superintendence with many other skulls of the okapi in the atlas of my \u201cMonograph of the Okapi,\u201d published in 1910 by the trustees of the British Museum. With the new skull acquired by the College of Surgeons, and apparently belonging to the same animal as the skin, is a pair of small ossicones, not yet ankylosed to the skull, measuring about 2 in. along the longer side from point to base. They are of the same shape and little shorter than those of Boyd Alexander's specimen. In neither skull is there as yet a tuberculated surface of the frontal bone developed for the attachment of the ossicone. In the Boyd Alexander specimen each ossicone stood up as a projecting cone, and was covered with the hairy skin except for a small area at the free end, where the hair seems to have been rubbed away, or removed in preparing the skin, as may be seen in the mounted specimen in the Natural History Museum. In Major Powell-Cotton's specimen, of which both skin and skeleton are in the museum, each ossicone is longer, slightly compressed from side to side, and claw-like in shape, the point curved downward and backward; and each ossicone rests on a pitted and tuberculated surface of the frontal bone, to which it is closely fitted but not yet ankylosed.","dc.creator":["LANKESTER, E.

Wilson, and transmitted to me by Mr. F. H. Ward, I find a beautifully preserved tsetse-fly. The insect is intermediate in size between the two fossil species previously fpund (both of which may be seen in the British Museum), and is evidently distinct. It may be called Glossina veterna, n.sp., and will be best distinguished by the following measurements in millimetres: length 12.5, length of wing 10.9, length of proboscis 4.1, length and width of abdomen each 5.6. The body and legs are brown or black, the abdomen without dark bands; the wings are hyaline, faintly brownish. The scutellum has long marginal and apical bristles, exactly as in the living species. The post-alar and first dorso-central bristles are also well preserved and normal.

Wilson, and transmitted to me by Mr. F. H. Ward, I find a beautifully preserved tsetse-fly. The insect is intermediate in size between the two fossil species previously fpund (both of which may be seen in the British Museum), and is evidently distinct. It may be called Glossina veterna, n.sp., and will be best distinguished by the following measurements in millimetres: length 12.5, length of wing 10.9, length of proboscis 4.1, length and width of abdomen each 5.6. The body and legs are brown or black, the abdomen without dark bands; the wings are hyaline, faintly brownish. The scutellum has long marginal and apical bristles, exactly as in the living species. The post-alar and first dorso-central bristles are also well preserved and normal. The anterior basal cell of the wing is about 0.6 mm. broad at end, its truncate apical end is short, and the lower margin does not bulge much near the end. The abdomen is hairy, as in living species. This excellent specimen affords additional evidence for the existence of two tsetse-flies in the American Miocene, astonishing as the fact is. The new species is nearest to G. osborni, but is too large to be the female of that form.","dc.creator":["COCKERELL, T. D.

This digital response is due to photo-isomerization of the molecule, which may eventually find application in erasable optical data-storage elements.","dc.creator":["Irie, Masahiro","Fukaminato, Tuyoshi","Sasaki, Takatoshi","Tamai, Naoto","Kawai, Tsuyoshi"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=J.

Gas bubbles and liquid drops can exist in stable, non-spherical shapes if the fluid surface is covered with a close-packed monolayer of particles of polymethylmethacrylate, gold or zirconium oxide. When spherical particle-covered bubbles fuse, the particles on the interface are jammed together, supporting the unequal stresses that stabilize a non-spherical shape.

Little is known about the intracellular mechanism by which the directional signal is transduced. Ca2+ is a key second messenger in growth cone extension3,4 and has been implicated in growth-cone turning5,6. Here I report that a direct, spatially restricted elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) on one side of the growth cone by focal laser-induced photolysis (FLIP) of caged Ca2+ consistently induced turning of the growth cone to the side with elevated [Ca2+]i (attraction).

Little is known about the intracellular mechanism by which the directional signal is transduced. Ca2+ is a key second messenger in growth cone extension3,4 and has been implicated in growth-cone turning5,6. Here I report that a direct, spatially restricted elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) on one side of the growth cone by focal laser-induced photolysis (FLIP) of caged Ca2+ consistently induced turning of the growth cone to the side with elevated [Ca2+]i (attraction). Furthermore, when the resting [Ca2+]i at the growth cone was decreased by the removal of extracellular Ca2+, the same focal elevation of [Ca2+]i by FLIP induced repulsion. These results provide direct evidence that a localized Ca2+ signal in the growth cone can provide the intracellular directional cue for extension and is sufficient to initiate both attraction and repulsion.

The difference is explicable in terms of a lithosphere of order 100 km thick which can support gravitationally unbalanced features up to 100 km or so in lateral extent, but is underlain by a yielding asthenosphere, so that larger scale features are isostatically balanced. It is therefore natural to seek a deep-seated source for the broad-scale features of the geoid. Depths greater than about 900 km become implausible, however, because the implied stresses increase very sharply with the fineness of the detail of the gravitational field which density variations are required to match, that is, with increasing order of the geoid harmonics. We can, of course, suppose that mass anomalies are distributed at all depths in the mantle, but if it can be shown that the geoid is explicable in terms of an appropriate mass distribution at a single depth, such that the stresses are approximately equal for all harmonic orders in the spherical harmonic representation of the surface, then this is strong evidence that we have found the depth of the most significant anomalies. We have reported such an analysis1 in which the plausible range of depths allowed by the uncertainty in the data was 250 km to 900 km.
