I may, however, be permitted to suggest that the test of covering up a plant with a bell-glass is not conclusive on the point of cross-fertilisation, as it is quite probable that with plants that are ordinarily self-fertilised, the mere fact of a complete stoppage of a free circulation of air may prevent the impregnation taking place.

By tearing sharply a piece of twilled calico into strips in a room well guarded from light, a perceptible luminosity was clearly distinguishable, which appeared at its maximum at the final parting of the fabric.

Survival impolicy, and indiscipline, are all so naturally formed, that, whether old or new, they are \u201cwelcome to stay.\u201d My end was answered by putting a brand on Mr. Wallace's prolificness, by way of contrast. If he is bent on using that monster, he will help to naturalise it by spelling it with ck (instead of c) like thickness.

Over all the north of England and south of Scoland basalt is so called. Here we have the whin-sill or stratiform basalt\u2014whin-dykes, or geological fissures filled with basalt. The vocabularies in treatises on geology give no derivation of this prevalent mining term. In Scotland whin seems to typify the hardest mineral known.

Unfortunately, however, the weather was very unfavourable for observation at this city, and but very few of the meteors constituting the \u201cshower\u201d came under my notice. The first shooting star was noticed at 5h. 50m. It was a very brilliant one, and must have equalled Venus when at her maximum. This meteor passed down the northern sky near Dubhe, in Ursa Major, and left sparks in its flight. Very soon afterwards\u2014at about 5h. 55m.\u2014four other bright meteors, succeeding each other very rapidly, were visible. The most remarkable fact in connection with them was the great coincidence in their apparent courses among the stars. They all appeared to diverge from a point westward a few degrees from Polaris, and passing downwards became extinct in Ursa Major. At 6h. 5m. I commenced a careful watch of the sky in conjunction with a friend, and during the interval from that time until 6h. 30m. seventy-four additional meteors came under our observation. At 6h. 30m. the sky was much overcast, and though all the stars were invisible, yet for a short time subsequently I saw several flashes of light in some portion of the heavens, which must have been originated by the bursting of meteors of considerable magnitude. During the time that I was enabled to witness the appearance of meteors, the sky was very much obscured by clouds and niist which rendered nearly all the stars imperceptible. I could, however, faintly see Polaris, Vega, \u03b1 and \u03b2 Persei, \u03b4 and \u03b1 Cassiopei\u00e6, and \u03b3 Andromed\u00e6;, and was enabled from the paths of the various meteors seen, to find the exact situation of the radiant point. This was situated at a place between Perseus and Andromeda, and about 5\u00b0 north of the brilliant star Almaach (\u03b3) in the latter constellation. This is at Right Ascension 1h. 56m. Declination 46\u00b0 North. I saw several meteors in close proximity to this point. They had very short paths. I also noticed two meteors which were apparently quite stationary, and after brightening disappeared. The largest that were seen passed between Ursa Minor and Ursa Major, and several were also noticed in the neighbourhood of\u00b1 Lyras (Vega). No shooting stars were seen in the western sky, as it was overcast. I did not notice any trail of light after the disappearance of any of the brightest meteors, nor did I hear any noise as of an explosion, subsequently to the extinction of any one of them. I principally directed my attention to the accurate determination of the radiant point, and to the numbers of meteors visible.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"7","prism.number":"162","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"85","prism.endingPage":"86","prism.copyright":"1872 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/007085e0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/007085e0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/007085e0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/007085e0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Great Meteoric Shower","citation_volume":"7","citation_issue":"162","citation_publication_date":"1872/12","citation_firstpage":"85","citation_lastpage":"86","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/007085e0","DOI":"10.1038/007085e0","citation_doi":"10.1038/007085e0","description":"A VERY well sustained shower of meteors was observed here and at many other stations in the early part of Wednesday evening last, Nov. 27.

They may be found fully detailed in the Edin. New Phil. Journal 1843, or in the \u201cLife and Letters of James David Forbes, 1873.\u201d They are as follows:\u2014In 1841 Forbes enjoyed the pleasure of a visit to Agassiz on the Unteraar Glacier. On the first day of their sojourn (August 9), their only companion was Mr. Heath, of Cambridge. They were afterwards joined by friends of Agassiz. On this first day Forbes pointed out to Agassiz the veined structure of the ice. Agassiz had spent five summers studying the glaciers (see Mr. Alexander Agassiz' letter in NATURE), but he replied \u201cthat it must be a superficial phenomenon, that he had on a previous occasion noticed such markings, and that they were caused by the sand of the moraines causing channels of water to run.\u201d Forbes showed him that the structure was general, even in the body of the glacier. Agassiz expressed a doubt \u201cwhether the structure had not been superinduced since the previous year.\u201d Forbes afterwards showed him that in a crevasse three or four years old the markings extended across the crevasse and were visible in continuation from one side to the other. Further, Forbes insisted upon its intimate connection with the theory of glaciers. When in the ensuing winter M. Desor wrote to Prof. Forbes denying his claims to the discovery, the latter sent him a statement of the above facts, begging that M. Agassiz should state whether they were correct or not. M. Agassiz wrote an answer to this letter. He does not deny a single one of the facts supplied by Forbes in connection with the observations of August 9. This letter was printed and circulated by M. Agassiz. Furthermore, when these facts were published by Forbes, even then M. Agassiz did not deny any of them. Moreover, Mr. heath, the only other witness, gives his evidence in support of the accuracy of the above facts (see \u201cLife of Forbes,\u201d Appendix B, Extract L). Other friends of Agassiz, who joined them afterwards, wrote to Forbes stating their belief that to him alone belonged the discovery. After leaving the Aar glacier Forbes extended his observations. He showed (1), that the structure was common to most, if not all, glaciers (see \u201cForbes' Life,\u201d p. 550, note); (2), that this was the cause of the sand lying its lines (\u201cLife,\u201d p. 548); (3), that this was also the cause of the supposed horizontal stratification of the terminal face of some glaciers (Royal Soc. Edin., 1841, Dec. 6); (4), he showed that these blue markings were the outcroppings of blue ice that formed lamellar surfaces in the interior of the glacier; (5), he actually determined the shape of these surfaces in the case of the Rhone glacier (R. S. E., 1841, Dec. 6); (6), he remarked that \u201cthe whole phenomenon has a good deal the air of being a structure induced perpendicular to the lines of greatest pressure,\u201d though he did not assert the statement to be general. This was in 1841. In later years he extended these observations. I have said enough to prove (1), that although Agassiz carried with him \u201ca geologist, a microscopic observer, a secretary, a draughtsman, and many workmen,\u201d and though he had spent five summers studying the glaciers, he did not see these markings (or at any rate recognise them as a structure of the ice) until Forbes showed them to him; and (2), that Forbes recognised this structure as an important \u201cindication of an unknown cause\u201d (\u201cOccasional Papers,\u201d p. 4), and worked out the subject thoroughly.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"8","prism.number":"186","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"64","prism.endingPage":"65","prism.copyright":"1873 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/008064b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/008064b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/008064b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/008064b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Forbes and Agassiz","citation_volume":"8","citation_issue":"186","citation_publication_date":"1873/05","citation_firstpage":"64","citation_lastpage":"65","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/008064b0","DOI":"10.1038/008064b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/008064b0","description":"In the review of Dr. Tyndall's book on the \u201cForms of Water\u201d which appeared in NATURE, vol. vii. p. 400, the following words occur:\u2014\u201cBut surely it was not unnecessary to rake up again the Forbes-Rendu controversy, nor to renew the claims of Agassiz and Guyot.\u201d Mr. Alexander Agassiz takes exception to this (see NATURE, vol. viii. p. 24) and makes the following assertions:\u2014That when a guest of Agassiz on the glacier of the Aarin 1841, Forbes returned the hospitality of Agassiz \u201cby appropriating what he could\u201d from the work of the latter, and \u201cmisrepresenting the nature of his intercourse with Agassiz.\u201d This refers to a matter of facts and may be proved or disproved by the facts.

OSCAR PESCHEL, in his recently published \u201cV\u00f6lkerkunde\u201d (p. 137), calls attention to a remark by the late Dr. von Martius, of much interest to anthropologists. It is well known that this distinguished naturalist avowed in the strongest terms his belief that the savage tribes of Brazil were the fallen descendants of more cultured nations. In 1838 he said:\u2014\u201cEvery day I spent among the Indians of Brazil increased my conviction that they had once been in quite another state, but that in the lapse of dark ages there had broken in upon them manifold catastrophes, which had brought them down to their actual condition, that of a peculiar decline and degeneration. The Americans are not a wild race, they are a race run wild and degraded.\u201d To students of civilisation (myself for example) Dr. Martius' views have been most embarrassing. It was not strange that the theory of savages being the degraded offspring of primeval civilised men should have been advocated by Archbishop Whately, who did not even take the trouble to examine his own evidence. Nor is it surprising that the Bishop of Ely, in the \u201cSpeaker's Commentary,\u201d should still appeal to Whately as an unrefuted authority, for one hardly expects an orthodox commentator to test the arguments on his own side. But the case with Dr. Martius was quite different. Here was an eminent ethnologist, intimately acquainted with savage thought and life, declaring that it seemed to him not to indicate natural wildness, but to show traces of decay from an ancient higher culture. What made the matter more puzzling, was that Dr. Martius, in his researches, had come upon facts which he acknowledged to be evidence of progress taking place from savage toward civilised institutions.

OSCAR PESCHEL, in his recently published \u201cV\u00f6lkerkunde\u201d (p. 137), calls attention to a remark by the late Dr. von Martius, of much interest to anthropologists. It is well known that this distinguished naturalist avowed in the strongest terms his belief that the savage tribes of Brazil were the fallen descendants of more cultured nations. In 1838 he said:\u2014\u201cEvery day I spent among the Indians of Brazil increased my conviction that they had once been in quite another state, but that in the lapse of dark ages there had broken in upon them manifold catastrophes, which had brought them down to their actual condition, that of a peculiar decline and degeneration. The Americans are not a wild race, they are a race run wild and degraded.\u201d To students of civilisation (myself for example) Dr. Martius' views have been most embarrassing. It was not strange that the theory of savages being the degraded offspring of primeval civilised men should have been advocated by Archbishop Whately, who did not even take the trouble to examine his own evidence. Nor is it surprising that the Bishop of Ely, in the \u201cSpeaker's Commentary,\u201d should still appeal to Whately as an unrefuted authority, for one hardly expects an orthodox commentator to test the arguments on his own side. But the case with Dr. Martius was quite different. Here was an eminent ethnologist, intimately acquainted with savage thought and life, declaring that it seemed to him not to indicate natural wildness, but to show traces of decay from an ancient higher culture. What made the matter more puzzling, was that Dr. Martius, in his researches, had come upon facts which he acknowledged to be evidence of progress taking place from savage toward civilised institutions. Thus, among the forest tribes of Brazil he found the rudest form of the \u201cvillage community,\u201d with its tribe-land common to all, but the huts and patches of tilled ground treated as acquired private property, not indeed of individuals, but of families. It was manifest that these tribes were passing through stages of that very development of the law of real property which is so clearly shown in the history of European law. This is a strong argument in favour of the development-theory of civilisation, but how could an ethnologist who understood the force of such arguments, remain an upholder of the degeneration-theory?","dc.creator":["TYLOR, EDWARD B."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["TYLOR, EDWARD B."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Degeneracy of Man","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Degeneracy of Man&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"010205b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A piece of cardboard with four parallelnarrow openings, each some 12 in. long, was hung against the glass roof of a photographic studio so as to be projected against the background of a bright sky. One of the slits or openings was covered with a piece of red glass, another was glazed with blue glass, the third was left entirely uncovered, and the fourth was covered by a piece of thin tracing paper. The slits in the cardboard screen were carefully focused, and over-exposed photographs were taken with a camera in which no stops were used. Upon the collodion film and immediately in contact with it was laid a piece of platinum foil quite thick enough to be perfectly opaque. The camera was so placed that the images of the slits fell partly upon the platinum foil and partly upon the collodion film. I have now before me two of the plates, each taken with an exposure of five minutes. The first was coated in the ordinary manner with a single collodion film, but the other was coated three times successively with collodion, so that the film was rendered very thick; but the eating in or encroachment of the photographic images of the slits under the platinum foil is hardly perceptible in either plate; indeed, I feel that I cannot say with certainty whether there is any encroachment of the image proper, though there are very marked brush-like extensions from the ends of the images, as well as a cloudy semicircular field symmetrical with the end of each image, evidently arising from reflections from the back of the plate. At first sight the brush-like semi-opaque extensions might be taken for the ordinary photographic irradiation eating under the platinum foil; but on more closely examining the ends of the images, the hazy opacity is seen to extend farther in some directions than in otheis, and to be broken up in some cases into live or six little streams or brushes. The decrease in the opacity of the brushes is also less uniform than the decrease in the opacity of the ordinary irradiation border.

COPPOCK'S explanation (NATURE, vol. xix. p. 484) has occurred also to me; but may I be allowed to remind him that in consequence of the internal construction of the marine barometer (the pipette and the contraction in the tube), when it is sloped the mercury rises and falls very slowly.

In some cases, the meta-morphism has taken place only near the surface, as if produced by atmospheric agencies; in others the crystallisation occurs in nests, while in others there is a gradual transition in mass from a compact to a granitic structure. This passage of h\u00e4lleflinta into granite has obviously important theoretical applications.","dc.creator":["CALLAWAY, C."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["CALLAWAY, C."],"citation_author_institution":["Wellington, Salop"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"On the Origin of Certain Granitoid Rocks","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;On the Origin of Certain Granitoid Rocks&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"020243d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Among them are a few white flints, evidently from the Chalk, and indeed with some chalk attached to them. This is worthy of remark, as there is no chalk nearer than the North of Ireland, nor are there any chalk flints among the boulders here, where the drift was unmistakably derived from the limestone, Silurian, mica slate, and syenite rocks of the west and south-west.

A small sandstone slab, quite smooth on one side, lay among the flints, but it was either taken away or thrown into one of the turf holes filled with water before I came to the place, and I failed to find it. By its impression in the turf which remained untouched it appeared that one surface was quite polished. The other was described as rough.

His supposition that \u201cthe rapid gyratory motion of a shining object\u201d leads on to the debilitating nervous attack, is open to debate. In displays of fireworks such motion occurs before crowds without making any one sick or frightened or inclined to rush into the middle of a Catharine-wheel. However then the motions of the snake, whether swift or slow, may avail in attracting and fixing attention, the final catastrophe is probably due to pure fright, according to the old saying, Multis ipsum metuisse nocet. We may safely infer that your correspondent himself would have felt no squeezing round his temples had he known at first that the snake was for him a harmless one, and not a viper nearly five feet long!","dc.creator":["STEBBING, THOMAS R.

G. Smith (NATURE, vol. xxiv. p. 582), to learn that I have succeeded in building up a core out of Neolithic flakes. When searching the sandhills at Dundrum, Co. Down, last August, with my friend Mr. J. S. Hyland, I noticed a number of flakes of a similar colour lying on the slightly raised shingly beach on which the sandhills stand, at a point where the sand had apparently been recently blown away. Seeing from an imperfection in the stone that several fragments had formed part of the same flint, I collected all the pieces I could find, some of which were at a yard or two's distance from the rest. Without much trouble I was able the same evening to put them together, and have so fixed twenty-two flakes into position, forming about three-fourths of the original pebble. The operator had first broken the pebble into two halves, and then chipped two-thirds of one half away in flakes, of which I found thirteen; the remainder of that half he threw down as useless. Of the other half I have nine flakes, and one is missing; the unbroken remainder is also gone. Perhaps the workman threw it away to a distance in disgust, as he does not seem to have got a single satisfactory flake out of the whole flint.

G. Smith (NATURE, vol. xxiv. p. 582), to learn that I have succeeded in building up a core out of Neolithic flakes. When searching the sandhills at Dundrum, Co. Down, last August, with my friend Mr. J. S. Hyland, I noticed a number of flakes of a similar colour lying on the slightly raised shingly beach on which the sandhills stand, at a point where the sand had apparently been recently blown away. Seeing from an imperfection in the stone that several fragments had formed part of the same flint, I collected all the pieces I could find, some of which were at a yard or two's distance from the rest. Without much trouble I was able the same evening to put them together, and have so fixed twenty-two flakes into position, forming about three-fourths of the original pebble. The operator had first broken the pebble into two halves, and then chipped two-thirds of one half away in flakes, of which I found thirteen; the remainder of that half he threw down as useless. Of the other half I have nine flakes, and one is missing; the unbroken remainder is also gone. Perhaps the workman threw it away to a distance in disgust, as he does not seem to have got a single satisfactory flake out of the whole flint. The appearance of the half which I have almost complete is extremely like the illustration of the core made up out of a modern flint-knapper's flakes in Evans' \u201cStone Implements,\u201d except that the crowns of the flakes are triangular instead of quadrangular. There are the same small interstices between the crowns of the flakes, showing that the blow splinters off on each side of the bulb of percussion a small fragment, as well as the flake itself. This explains why the average concavity on the core is slightly less than the average convexity of the flake at the top of the bulb of percussion.","dc.creator":["ARCHER, F."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["ARCHER, F."],"citation_author_institution":["Crosby, Liverpool"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Replacing Flint Flakes","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Replacing Flint Flakes&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"025052a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The sky was partially covered with light cirrus clouds, and some small fleecy drift was rapidly moving from the north-west at a low altitude. I saw a bright bow at about 45\u00b0 from the sun nearly due north, extending over a clear portion of the sky; this gradually extended till it formed a circle with the sun in the most southern point of its circumference.

The case which forms the object of the present note is quite the reverse of those mentioned by Dr. Noll, as the branch of order n, or the exterior part of the normal fruit, is not developed independently, being represented by its parent-branch of order, n - 1.","dc.creator":["ERNST, A."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["ERNST, A."],"citation_author_institution":["Car\u00e1cas"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"An Abnormal Fruit of Opuntia Ficus-Indica","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;An Abnormal Fruit of Opuntia Ficus-Indica&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"027078f0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Altogether there is something mysterious about it. It is evident that since it appeared to reach the greatest apparent length of about 30\u00b0 at York, then from all places further south it ought to have attained a length exceeding this, the more so the further south they are. The ends of the beam appeared very well defined from here, and there was very little room for estimates varying according to the observer's sensitiveness to light. If we take the observations made from Clifton, Cirencester, East Clevedon, Woodbridge, and Windsor, as they nearly all agree in estimating the length as over 30\u00b0, some considerably over, then these may all relate to the same object. But its appearance from York is flatly contradicted by Mr. Batson's observation from Hungerford, that from Halstead, Essex (which seems to agree with Mr. Batson's), also those from Lincoln's Inn Fields, Greenwich, and Cambridge. All these agree in contradicting the others named above, by assigning a much smaller angular length. Mr. Batson describes a sudden foreshortening which the meteoroid underwent when passing the moon, and since I saw it pass below the moon at practically the same time, then (on the supposition that we beheld the same object) the same shortening ought to have been visible to me; but there was not the slightest trace of any such thing. I noticed that it very gradually shortened in length (after allowing for perspective) in its journey towards the west, which is significant, and explainable if we suppose the body to have been encountering resistance to its momentum. It is impossible to reconcile all the observations, and yet most extraordinary that no single observer is known to have witnessed more than one such phenomenon at about that time except Mr. Worthington, who says he san two at once. I have reason to believe that a rather similar thing was seen below the moon at about 5.30 on that night from here. I see that from Ziericksee, in Holland, a similar phenomenon was seen to transit Pegasi (which would be at about 50\u00b0 altitude, and on the magnetic meridian from there). If this was the one that I saw, then at the time that it was seen transit Pegasi, from Holland, it would appear to me to be just forming in the south-east, where it appeared to be about 10\u00b0 above the horizon, it which ease it would have to be under seventy miles high when over Belgium. But it is aim almost certain that it attained a height of over 150 miles during the latter part of its course. As yet (figuratively speaking) the spectra of these auroral phenomena have not thrown as much light on these things as that which enters the narrow slip of the spectroscope to print its uncertain record on the retina. I only hope that some one with a clear bead and much patience will succeed in unravelling the tangled skeins of evidence which surround the mysterious meteoroid of November 17, 1882.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"27","prism.number":"694","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"365","prism.endingPage":"365","prism.copyright":"1883 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/027365b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/027365b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/027365b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/027365b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Meteor of November 17","citation_volume":"27","citation_issue":"694","citation_publication_date":"1883/02","citation_firstpage":"365","citation_lastpage":"365","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/027365b0","DOI":"10.1038/027365b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/027365b0","description":"I THINK now that more observations of the remarkable phenomenon of November 17 have been brought forward, that we cannot but candidly acknowledge that the evidence is extremely contradictory and impossible to reconcile, that is as applying to one and the same object.

If this was the one that I saw, then at the time that it was seen transit Pegasi, from Holland, it would appear to me to be just forming in the south-east, where it appeared to be about 10\u00b0 above the horizon, it which ease it would have to be under seventy miles high when over Belgium. But it is aim almost certain that it attained a height of over 150 miles during the latter part of its course. As yet (figuratively speaking) the spectra of these auroral phenomena have not thrown as much light on these things as that which enters the narrow slip of the spectroscope to print its uncertain record on the retina. I only hope that some one with a clear bead and much patience will succeed in unravelling the tangled skeins of evidence which surround the mysterious meteoroid of November 17, 1882.","dc.creator":["TAYLOR, H.

In NATURE, Vol. xxvii. p. 121, there was an interesting paper by Mr. Geikie on the metamorphic origin of granite and on the crystalline schists. Last autumn I became satisfied of a conclusion which I had long suspected\u2014that the large granitic district in the Ross of Mull, adjacent to the Island of Iona, is a great mass of granite formed by the metamorphism of an old stratified deposit belonging to crystalline schists. It is well known to geologists that the Isle of Mull consists almost entirely of the series of (Tertiary) volcanic rocks which have been admirably described by Prof. Judd. These traps, tuffs, and lavas rest in some places on chalk, and where the chalk had been previously denuded they rest on Oolitic and Liassic beds. Older rocks, belonging, I think, to the Cambrian series, appear at one place subjacent to the traps. But the limit of all these volcanic rocks to the south-west is sharply defined by the deep hay and harbour of Bunessan, called Loch Laigh. As we enter that loch in a boat, we have on our left the trap headland of Ardtun, where I found the Tertiary leaf-bed many years ago, and on the right a headland of massive red granite. But the shores at the end or head of the bay, including all the hills above the village of Bunessan, are neither trap nor granite, but are composed of the regular crystalline mica schists which constitute the great bulk of the county of Argyll. This is the only part of Mull, so far as I know, where these rocks appear. They stretch right across the long promontory of the Ross to the southern shore. At the head of Loch Laigh they are more highly crystalline than in most parts of the mainland of the county. Very fine crystals of tourmaline have been found above Bunessan, and the achists near the new pier are highly micaceous and in some places full of coarse garnets. These schists dip at a high angle, and indeed are in some places nearly perpendicular. On the southern coast of the promontory (which is here very narrow) they occupy a considerable space between the traps which terminate on the farm of Scoor, and the granite which begins on the farm of Ardalanish. The point of contact between these schists and the granite is obscured at the head of Loch Laigh, and I have not visited it on the southern shore. But the point of most interest will be found in the granitic headland which forms the south-western shore of Loch Laigh. Along part of this shore the granitic masses at the top of the hill have all the appearance of standing upon legs. These legs at a little distance seem granitic, and although they have a suspicious appearance of tilted strata, I had passed them over and over again under a general impression that they were nothing but granite divided by unusually narrow lines of cleavage. On examining them, however, carefully, in August, 1882, I found that they are (in my judgment) beyond all doubt crystalline bedded schists exhibiting the phenomena of metamorphism in the most curious and instructive form. The metamorphic action has often segregated the mineral constituents of the old sedimentary rock in bands transverse to the line of bedding, so that in one stratum we have bands of pure quartzite and of hornblende gneiss, between bands of granitoid and of pure granitie composition. These beds pass up without a break into the amorphous granite of the great bulk of the hill; and how pure and typical that granite will be acknowledged when I add that the columns of the memorial to the Prince Consort in Hyde Park are made of it. Since discovering this passage I have found some other spots on the coast where the relation of the two rocks to each other is well seen. The best is on the deeply indented shore of the farm of Knockvoligan, behind the Island of \u201cGilan Giraid,\u201d on which the Northern Light Commissioners have placed their establishment in the Sound of Iona. Boats can be hired at Iona, and at high tide there is a beautiful passage behind Gilan Giraid to the shore I refer to. There a dark hornblendic gneiss will he seen underlying, involved in, and passing into granite in every form of complication and variety. An interesting question arises as to the horizon to which this hornblendic rock belongs. As lona belongs unquestionably, as I believe, to the Laurentian series, and the Bunessan schists to the metamorphosed Silurian, the sub-granite gneiss which intervenes may be assigned to either the one or the other. My impression is that it represents some of those gneissose beds of the Silurian series which are highly developed in Sutherland, and lie high above the \u201cfundamental\u201d or Laurentian gneiss, so well known in that county. I should be very glad if some competent geologist could investigate this district of the Ross of Mull, and could confirm or check my observations.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"27","prism.number":"703","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"578","prism.endingPage":"579","prism.copyright":"1883 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/027578a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/027578a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/027578a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/027578a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Metamorphic Origin of Granite.\u2014Prehistoric \u201cGiants\u201d","citation_volume":"27","citation_issue":"703","citation_publication_date":"1883/04","citation_firstpage":"578","citation_lastpage":"579","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/027578a0","DOI":"10.1038/027578a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/027578a0","description":"I HAVE for some time intended to send you a few notes on two matters, both connected a with geology, though very different in kind.

Under these circumstances I can hardly believe there could have arisen the mistake suggested by Dr. Ingleby.","dc.creator":["MORRIS, D."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MORRIS, D."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"A Complete Solar Rainbow","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;A Complete Solar Rainbow&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"029007b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It is interesting to note that the donkey conducts by his own intelligence all the business of water distributor, while Bob has sunk to the condition of mere pumper and of money collector attached to and led by the shafts, which latter duty might be done by an intelligent dog.","dc.creator":["M."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["M."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Intelligence in Animals","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Intelligence in Animals&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"030361b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It is well known that the adult Antedon rosaceus is abundant at Lamlash, and that young specimens in the pentacrinoid stage are common on Laminaria in the earlier part of the summer; but I have always found the \u201cpentacrinoids\u201d rare or absent during August, and I have certainly never before found one in September. I find that the late Sir Wyville Thomson states, in his memoir \u201cOn the Embryogeny of Antedon rosaceus\u201d (Phil. Trans. 1865, p. 513), that the ova are mature towards the end of May or beginning of June, and that, although the time spent in the larval stages may be to a certain extent shortened or prolonged by surrounding conditions, the disengagement of Antedon rosaceus from its stalk \u201cconstantly occurs between the middle of August and the middle of September\u201d (p. 517). From this one would not expect to find any specimens in the pentacrinoid stage after the middle of September. This season, however, while dredging chiefly in the southern part of the bay near King's Cross Point, I obtained young stalked Antedons nearly every day between September 15 and 25. I generally got one, two, or three specimens in a forenoon's dredging (usually four or five hauls of the dredge).

The last were evidently just ready to be set free, and in fact several of them became disengaged from their stalks while I was watching them in a glass dish during the afternoon. The smaller specimens obtained that day were, from their structure, evidently very much younger, and could not have become free for a considerable time: how long I do not know, and would be glad to learn.

At the Brocken, as well as at the Ben, the great difference from the Alps is not in summer, but in the colder months of the year.

Ryder's letter induces me to summarise the facts which have been brought forward, and the conclusions to be drawn from them. The condition of the oysters examined by me can only be explained by inferring that they were quite free, and resting on a flat bottom with the right valve downwards. The specimens of Pecten opercularis which I had before me were in the same condition, and doubtless rested in the same position. Of Pecten maximus I cannot speak with certainty, and therefore leave to Mr. Arthur Hunt the responsibility of stating that there is a difference in respect of position in the two species. Prof. M\u00f6bius also finds that the left valves of oysters are usually covered by fixed animals, but as far as I understand his letter he thinks this does not prove that the left valves in this condition were uppermost: in the oysters I examined, the right valves were so clean that they must have been in close contact with the bottom.

Mr. Ryder says it is well known that the right valve of the oyster is always the most deeply pigmented, while the left one is paler in the oysters I examined, the condition of the valves was exactly the reverse of this. It seems to me that when a young oyster is attached to the under-surface of a stone or shell by its left valve its right valve is lower, and if it drops from its attachment, or grows much larger than the stone or shell to which it is fixed, the surface of its right valve will come into close contact with the sea-bottom. I have seen oysters which still retained a piece of shell attached near the umbo of the left valve, while the rest of the valve was covered with fixed animals, and the right valve was quite clean and light in colour. There are no crowded oyster-banks in the Firth of Forth, and it might even be said that the oysters which came under my observation had been dredged and thrown overboard again at some time of their lives. But I do not think oysters are often returned to the water when once taken in the Firth. In my former letter I implied that probably in the normal position of an adult oyster the right valve was in contact with the bottom.

At the posterior end is a conical protuberance resembling the adhesive organ described by Bateson in his creeping larva. The position of the mouth was not ascertained, but was probably between the two anterior bands of cilia. The water vessel and tuft of cilia at the apex of the pr\u00e6oral lobe were not observed. This larva may not have been Tornaria, but I think it really was that form; and naturalists who are spending an autumn holiday at the seaside would probably, if they undertook the search, succeed in finding Balanoglossus in the littoral sands, and its larv\u00e6 in the shore waters.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"34","prism.number":"877","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"361","prism.endingPage":"361","prism.copyright":"1886 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/034361c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/034361c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/034361c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/034361c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Tornaria and Actinotrocha of the British Coasts","citation_volume":"34","citation_issue":"877","citation_publication_date":"1886/08","citation_firstpage":"361","citation_lastpage":"361","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/034361c0","DOI":"10.1038/034361c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/034361c0","description":"THREE species of Balanoglossus are known to occur on the shores of North-West Europe.

Two species of Lepus are quite abundant in this vicinity, viz. the Mexican hare (L. callotis callotis), and the sage hare, which is really a medium-sized rabbit (L. sylvaticus Nuttalli), while the first-mentioned is a big hare. It is not uncommon to find here, in certain localities, a stretch of perfectly level prairie extending for a distance of 3 or 4 miles, and when this is covered by an even layer of 1 inch or more of snow, it offers an admirable surface on which to take account of the distance which may separate any two tracks of one of these animals, either one made by a hare or one made by one of the rabbits. On such a prairie as I have just referred to, I have on numerous occasions fired at these animals when they have been running, and at the same time beyond the range of my fowling-piece; such a shot almost invariably has the effect of so alarming the game as to make it run at its very best rate of speed, and upon coming up with the tracks they have left on the snow at such times, I have been surprised at the distances they can clear at each individual leap.

Two species of Lepus are quite abundant in this vicinity, viz. the Mexican hare (L. callotis callotis), and the sage hare, which is really a medium-sized rabbit (L. sylvaticus Nuttalli), while the first-mentioned is a big hare. It is not uncommon to find here, in certain localities, a stretch of perfectly level prairie extending for a distance of 3 or 4 miles, and when this is covered by an even layer of 1 inch or more of snow, it offers an admirable surface on which to take account of the distance which may separate any two tracks of one of these animals, either one made by a hare or one made by one of the rabbits. On such a prairie as I have just referred to, I have on numerous occasions fired at these animals when they have been running, and at the same time beyond the range of my fowling-piece; such a shot almost invariably has the effect of so alarming the game as to make it run at its very best rate of speed, and upon coming up with the tracks they have left on the snow at such times, I have been surprised at the distances they can clear at each individual leap. Under these conditions I once measured the spaces cleared by an old Mexican hare, and found the first two equalled 12 feet apiece, while the third effort was rather more than 13 feet, and I have never known this species to exceed this, although I have tested not a few of them. Of course the rabbit cannot compete with such magnificent gymnastics as this: it will, however, when thus frightened, make leaps of fully 6 feet; and on one occasion I measured one on the dead-level prairie, which was rather more than 7 feet.

In the first place, it is quite apparent that he has never used the \u201cAuthenticated British List\u201d published by the Conchological Society, where he would have found Clausilia parvula, C. solida, and Zonites draparnaldi excluded, doubtless, on reliable authority; while Bulimus Goodallii, Vertigo tumida, and Planorbis dilatatus are included, also, doubtless, on reliable authority, as recognized members of the British fauna, even if they be \u201ccasuals.\u201d He has also, it is quite apparent, never read Prof. Macalister's \u201cIntroduction to Animal Morphology,\u201d where he will find it stated on p. 286 that \u201cthe operculum has always more conchiolin in its composition than the shell whose mouth it closes.\u201d He does not know, it is also quite apparent, that Pisidium and Sph\u00e6rium are British fresh-water mussels, and siphonated British fresh-water mussels too, there being one siphon in the former and two in the latter genus (cp. the description of these genera in Westerlund's \u201cFauna of Sweden and Denmark\u201d). He can scarcely know that the epiphragm has been called by some authors (as instance Macalister) the clausilium; and although recognizing this on p. 5 of my \u201cHand-book,\u201d I have described in a footnote to the genus Clausilium (p. 44) the only structure which we recognize to-day under that name. He does not know, it is evident, that Prof. Milnes Marshall (\u201cPractical Zoology,\u201d p. 106) states that \u201cthe periostracum or outer layer is horny and uncalcified. To it the colour of the shell is due,\u201d and that \u201cthe middle layer\u201d \u201cis densely calcified, and has an opaque porcellanous appearance.\u201d And he scarcely knows that in Huxley and Martin's \u201cCourse of Elementary Instruction in Practical Biology,\u201d p. 274, the aperture of the shell is spoken of as the peritreme and not as the peristome, and that in the majority of works on comparative anatomy it is also solely mentioned under that name.

In the first place, it is quite apparent that he has never used the \u201cAuthenticated British List\u201d published by the Conchological Society, where he would have found Clausilia parvula, C. solida, and Zonites draparnaldi excluded, doubtless, on reliable authority; while Bulimus Goodallii, Vertigo tumida, and Planorbis dilatatus are included, also, doubtless, on reliable authority, as recognized members of the British fauna, even if they be \u201ccasuals.\u201d He has also, it is quite apparent, never read Prof. Macalister's \u201cIntroduction to Animal Morphology,\u201d where he will find it stated on p. 286 that \u201cthe operculum has always more conchiolin in its composition than the shell whose mouth it closes.\u201d He does not know, it is also quite apparent, that Pisidium and Sph\u00e6rium are British fresh-water mussels, and siphonated British fresh-water mussels too, there being one siphon in the former and two in the latter genus (cp. the description of these genera in Westerlund's \u201cFauna of Sweden and Denmark\u201d). He can scarcely know that the epiphragm has been called by some authors (as instance Macalister) the clausilium; and although recognizing this on p. 5 of my \u201cHand-book,\u201d I have described in a footnote to the genus Clausilium (p. 44) the only structure which we recognize to-day under that name. He does not know, it is evident, that Prof. Milnes Marshall (\u201cPractical Zoology,\u201d p. 106) states that \u201cthe periostracum or outer layer is horny and uncalcified. To it the colour of the shell is due,\u201d and that \u201cthe middle layer\u201d \u201cis densely calcified, and has an opaque porcellanous appearance.\u201d And he scarcely knows that in Huxley and Martin's \u201cCourse of Elementary Instruction in Practical Biology,\u201d p. 274, the aperture of the shell is spoken of as the peritreme and not as the peristome, and that in the majority of works on comparative anatomy it is also solely mentioned under that name. I think it also my duty to tell your reviewer that the teeth-formul\u00e6 were not copied from Lankester, as he supposes, but from Woodward, and that upon comparison I find the copy correct (cp. Jeffrey Bell, \u201cComparative Anatomy and Physiology,\u201d p. 136).","dc.creator":["WILLIAMS, J.

The question is therefore set at rest as to whether the clouds are self-luminous, for it is evident that at such a height their brightness is fully accounted for by the sun shining upon them. In 1886, Herr Jesse had, upon this supposition, ascertained their brightness to be from 49 to 54 kilometres, and that the lower the sun descended the smaller was the illumination needed to show them as the atmosphere darkened, so that the calculated height increased with the sun's depression below the horizon.

D. Webster, in your issue of November 20 (p. 57), states that the male catkins of the above tree are extremely rare as compared with the fruiting cones. If this is the case, though my own observations would have led me to the contrary opinion\u2014the following instances may be of interest.

In the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, for April 1, 1890, the writer published quite an exhaustive memoir upon the entire morphology of this famous reptile, and among other parts of its anatomy reference was made to its poison apparatus. Fig. 4 of Plate xvi., of the contribution in question, showed a superficial dissection of the under side of the head of a large Heloderm, and upon the left side of the same the submaxillary gland is turned outwards, thus rendering it possible to be seen the four structures leading from (or to) this gland to separate and as many foramina opposite them, which exist upon the external aspect of the ramus of the lower jaw. Heretofore, these four structures have very generally been looked upon as the four poison ducts leading from this gland to the hollow space in the mandible, which latter in turn had its upper outlets in the minute foramina, found one each at the base of the teeth of this jaw. The poison was supposed to pass from the gland through these four ducts into the body of the ramus, then through the above-noted foramina, whence it was conducted into any wound the reptile might inflict with its teeth, along the grooves which have for many years been known to exist upon them. Without making any especial microscopical description, this is practically the view I supported in my memoir in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society, and I added that \u201cFischer found in his specimen that these ducts branched as they quit the gland; this was not the case in the reptile examined by me. Each duct passes obliquely upwards and inwards through the lower jaw, and its internal opening within the mouth is found at the base of the tooth it supplies, near the termination of the groove of the tooth\u201d (p 207). Dr. Fischer's paper was published in Hamburg in 1882, and in it he also gives a figure showing the ducts I have just mentioned; and he is largely responsible for the view that has been adopted in regard to them As early as 1857, however, John Edward Gray evidently leaned in the same direction, and he speaks of \u201cHeloderma horrida, in which all the teeth are uniformly furnished with a basal cavity and foramen,\u201d \u2014structures which he compared with the poison fangs and associated parts of venomous serpents. Dr. C. K. Hoffmann had the same ideas about the poison apparatus of the Helodermas (Bronn's \u201cKlassen des Thier-Reichs,\u201d Bd. vi., iii. Abth., 30\u201332 Lief., pp. 890\u2013892), and he republished Fischer's figures; and thus running through the similar views of numerous other leading herpetologists, we find, even as late as 1890, Prof Samuel Garman, of Harvard University, quoting Fischer's description of the poison glands of Heloderma without question (author's reprint from Bull. Essex Inst., vol. xxii., Nos. 4\u20136, 1890, p. 9), and he adds that \u201cno glands have been found on the upper\u201d jaw. With all this in my mind, I was not a little surprised when Prof. C. Stewart, on January 20 last, in a paper read before the Zoological Society of London, claimed that he believed \u201cthat he had shown that in both species [H. horridum and suspectum] the ducts of the gland did not enter the lower jaw, but passed directly to openings situated under a fold of mucous membrane between the lip and the jaw. He thought that the structures previously described as ducts were only the branches of the inferior dental nerve-and blood vessels.\u201d Upon hearing this, I at once took a large specimen of Heloderma suspectum to my friend Dr. E. M. Schaeffer, the well-known microscopist in Washington, D.C., who kindly examined the structures, and found them to be exactly as Prof. Stewart had described. It now remains to be said of what use are the foramina at the base of the teeth in these lizards. Why are the upper teeth grooved when there is no poison gland upon the upper jaw? Would not such a severe bite as a Heloderma is enabled to give kill \u201cfrogs and insects,\u201d even were no poison injected into such wounds?

In the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, for April 1, 1890, the writer published quite an exhaustive memoir upon the entire morphology of this famous reptile, and among other parts of its anatomy reference was made to its poison apparatus. Fig. 4 of Plate xvi., of the contribution in question, showed a superficial dissection of the under side of the head of a large Heloderm, and upon the left side of the same the submaxillary gland is turned outwards, thus rendering it possible to be seen the four structures leading from (or to) this gland to separate and as many foramina opposite them, which exist upon the external aspect of the ramus of the lower jaw. Heretofore, these four structures have very generally been looked upon as the four poison ducts leading from this gland to the hollow space in the mandible, which latter in turn had its upper outlets in the minute foramina, found one each at the base of the teeth of this jaw. The poison was supposed to pass from the gland through these four ducts into the body of the ramus, then through the above-noted foramina, whence it was conducted into any wound the reptile might inflict with its teeth, along the grooves which have for many years been known to exist upon them. Without making any especial microscopical description, this is practically the view I supported in my memoir in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society, and I added that \u201cFischer found in his specimen that these ducts branched as they quit the gland; this was not the case in the reptile examined by me. Each duct passes obliquely upwards and inwards through the lower jaw, and its internal opening within the mouth is found at the base of the tooth it supplies, near the termination of the groove of the tooth\u201d (p 207). Dr. Fischer's paper was published in Hamburg in 1882, and in it he also gives a figure showing the ducts I have just mentioned; and he is largely responsible for the view that has been adopted in regard to them As early as 1857, however, John Edward Gray evidently leaned in the same direction, and he speaks of \u201cHeloderma horrida, in which all the teeth are uniformly furnished with a basal cavity and foramen,\u201d \u2014structures which he compared with the poison fangs and associated parts of venomous serpents. Dr. C. K. Hoffmann had the same ideas about the poison apparatus of the Helodermas (Bronn's \u201cKlassen des Thier-Reichs,\u201d Bd. vi., iii. Abth., 30\u201332 Lief., pp. 890\u2013892), and he republished Fischer's figures; and thus running through the similar views of numerous other leading herpetologists, we find, even as late as 1890, Prof Samuel Garman, of Harvard University, quoting Fischer's description of the poison glands of Heloderma without question (author's reprint from Bull. Essex Inst., vol. xxii., Nos. 4\u20136, 1890, p. 9), and he adds that \u201cno glands have been found on the upper\u201d jaw. With all this in my mind, I was not a little surprised when Prof. C. Stewart, on January 20 last, in a paper read before the Zoological Society of London, claimed that he believed \u201cthat he had shown that in both species [H. horridum and suspectum] the ducts of the gland did not enter the lower jaw, but passed directly to openings situated under a fold of mucous membrane between the lip and the jaw. He thought that the structures previously described as ducts were only the branches of the inferior dental nerve-and blood vessels.\u201d Upon hearing this, I at once took a large specimen of Heloderma suspectum to my friend Dr. E. M. Schaeffer, the well-known microscopist in Washington, D.C., who kindly examined the structures, and found them to be exactly as Prof. Stewart had described. It now remains to be said of what use are the foramina at the base of the teeth in these lizards. Why are the upper teeth grooved when there is no poison gland upon the upper jaw? Would not such a severe bite as a Heloderma is enabled to give kill \u201cfrogs and insects,\u201d even were no poison injected into such wounds? Are the grooves on the teeth there to conduct a poison into the wounds inflicted by the teeth of this lizard? Here in America the evidence would seem to be rapidly leading to the demonstration of the now entertained theory that the saliva of this heretofore much-dreaded reptile is possibly almost entirely innocuous. If it be proven, it is unnecessary to add that it leaves the great order Lacertilia, in so far as our present acquaintance goes with it, without a single representative possessed of the power of inflicting a venomous wound by the means of its bite.","dc.creator":["SHUFELDT, R.

According to Prof. Arcangelo Scacchi, this increasd condensation of vapour is due to the carbon dioxide produced in the combustion; this gas causing condensation from the highly saturated medium in the same way as fumes become visible when concentrated hydrochloric acid is exposed to ordinary air. My experiments of 1883 tend to show that not only carbon dioxide, but (in accordance with the views of Dr. Aitken on the formation of cloud or mist) the increase of solid corpuscles made to float in the vapour-laden air inside or near the fumarole, might be the cause of a rapid and continuous condensing of the invisible vapour.

The late Sir Andrew Ramsay was the first, so far back as 1855, to suggest that the Permian conglomerate of Abberley and the Clent hills was an ancient glacial deposit.

Having devoted a considerable portion of the last twenty years to the study of glacial phenomena, I early this year paid my first visit to the district.

Many of the stones have flattened faces, and in general shape resemble glaciated boulders, but the stri\u00e6, so far as I could observe in the limited time at my disposal, were not very pronounced.

The volcanic rocks of the lake district of which these gravels are composed break up into very similar shapes, and are planed and striated in a very similar way to those of Abberley. I also brought home from Abberley two specimens of the \u201cpaste\u201d which fills up the interstices of the finer gravel. On washing and riddling this clayey matter, well waterworn and smooth gravel was separated from it up to about the size of a bean, and on many of these minute pebbles, with the aid of a microscope of low power, beautifully-developed stri\u00e6 are to be seen, sometimes on more than one face.

The next night the phosphorescence was very feeble, and on the morning following the insect was dead.","dc.creator":["THOMAS, ROSE HAIG"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["THOMAS, ROSE HAIG"],"citation_author_institution":["The White House, Basildon"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"A Luminous Centipede","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;A Luminous Centipede&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"053175d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

When Prof. Lippmann's success with the interferential method was made known some five or six years ago, and his first results exhibited in this country, many of those who were acquainted with the previous methods of producing coloured spectra by direct impression came to the conclusion that all the earlier workers had unconsciously been producing the Lippmann effect.","dc.creator":["MELDOLA, R."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MELDOLA, R."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Becquerel and Lippmann's Colour Photographs","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Becquerel and Lippmann&#39;s Colour Photographs&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"054125c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

I could not find at what point it had got on to the curve, which ran at one end into a damp part of the concrete, but, in four hours from the time I first saw the slug, it had made three complete circuits and two-thirds of a fourth, always keeping the whole of its body on the trail. The latter, of a uniform breadth of 3/16 inch, varied considerably in curvature, but nowhere presented any very sharp corners, and measured, roughly, forty inches round. Though the rate of progression was sufficiently slow, the slug rested on the track for seven hours, after which, thinking it dead, I touched it and found it had not quite dried up.

I could not find at what point it had got on to the curve, which ran at one end into a damp part of the concrete, but, in four hours from the time I first saw the slug, it had made three complete circuits and two-thirds of a fourth, always keeping the whole of its body on the trail. The latter, of a uniform breadth of 3/16 inch, varied considerably in curvature, but nowhere presented any very sharp corners, and measured, roughly, forty inches round. Though the rate of progression was sufficiently slow, the slug rested on the track for seven hours, after which, thinking it dead, I touched it and found it had not quite dried up. Indeed, without elongating its body, it began to move and laboriously shifted its position by about an inch. There it remained (the time being then 10 p.m.), waiting, perhaps, for the influence of a more humid atmosphere, for morning found it moist and healthy, breakfasting more than a yard from the near and damp end of the track, which it must have reached by completing the fourth circuit, as there was no trail other than the closed one alluded to.

The central line, between the numbers 10 and 11, shows where the various curves of distribution cross the 50 per cent, line, and consequently indicates the scheme of growth of the mean boy.","dc.creator":["H., C."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["H., C."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Physical Measurement of Public Schoolboys","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Physical Measurement of Public Schoolboys&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"060222c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

I found it a few days ago in the decaying trunks of trees (presumably beech), and have since collected between twenty and thirty specimens. The species resembles the well-known P. novaezealandiae in shape and size, but is at once distinguished both from it and from the other New Zealand species, P. sutteri, by the possession of only fourteen pairs of walking legs, and by the presence on the dorsal surface of fifteen pairs of green spots arranged segmentally, one pair over each pair of legs, and one pair over the oral papill\u00e6. The general coloration of the dorsal surface is dark grey mottled with orange, with a dark median band and a black or nearly black triangular patch between each two successive green spots on each side. There are also pale orange or whitish papill\u00e6, very regularly arranged. The ventral surface is mottled grey or violet, with pale areas between the legs. The antenn\u00e6 are grey, ringed with orange. One specimen is almost jet black on the dorsal surface except for he green spots. Adult females are at once distinguished by the presence of an elongated protuberance between the legs of the last pair. This organ is yellowish in colour and bears the genital aperture, closely resembling the ovipositor of the egg-laying Victorian species, P. oviparus. The males are rather smaller than the females, and have a white papilla at the base of each leg of the last nine pairs. I propose for this species the name Peripatus viridimaculatus.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"61","prism.number":"1584","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"444","prism.endingPage":"444","prism.copyright":"1900 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/061444a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/061444a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/061444a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/061444a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"A New Peripatus from New Zealand","citation_volume":"61","citation_issue":"1584","citation_publication_date":"1900/03","citation_firstpage":"444","citation_lastpage":"444","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/061444a0","DOI":"10.1038/061444a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/061444a0","description":"As the genus Peripatus is always regarded with exceptional interest by zoologists, I should like to make known through the medium of your column's the discovery of a new and very beautiful species in the dense beech forest at the head of Lake Te Anau, in the South Island of New Zealand.

The general coloration of the dorsal surface is dark grey mottled with orange, with a dark median band and a black or nearly black triangular patch between each two successive green spots on each side. There are also pale orange or whitish papill\u00e6, very regularly arranged. The ventral surface is mottled grey or violet, with pale areas between the legs. The antenn\u00e6 are grey, ringed with orange. One specimen is almost jet black on the dorsal surface except for he green spots. Adult females are at once distinguished by the presence of an elongated protuberance between the legs of the last pair. This organ is yellowish in colour and bears the genital aperture, closely resembling the ovipositor of the egg-laying Victorian species, P. oviparus. The males are rather smaller than the females, and have a white papilla at the base of each leg of the last nine pairs. I propose for this species the name Peripatus viridimaculatus.","dc.creator":["DENDY, ARTHUR"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["DENDY, ARTHUR"],"citation_author_institution":["Lake Te Anau"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"A New Peripatus from New Zealand","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;A New Peripatus from New Zealand&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"061541c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A. H. Evans and T. E. Buckley's \u201cFauna of the Shetlands\u201d (NATURE, May 24, 1900, pp. 75 and 76), your reviewer regrets that the authors are silent in regard to the special characters of the Shetland field-mouse, in view of my own recent recognition of a peculiar representation of this type in St. Kilda. It may be interesting to point out that in a recent paper on geographical and individual variation in Mus sylvaticus and its allies (P.Z.S., 1900, p. 387), I found myself unable to separate the Shetland field-mouse (specimens of which I had fortunately been able to examine), at least at present, from that of Great Britain generally.

A. H. Evans and T. E. Buckley's \u201cFauna of the Shetlands\u201d (NATURE, May 24, 1900, pp. 75 and 76), your reviewer regrets that the authors are silent in regard to the special characters of the Shetland field-mouse, in view of my own recent recognition of a peculiar representation of this type in St. Kilda. It may be interesting to point out that in a recent paper on geographical and individual variation in Mus sylvaticus and its allies (P.Z.S., 1900, p. 387), I found myself unable to separate the Shetland field-mouse (specimens of which I had fortunately been able to examine), at least at present, from that of Great Britain generally. I would not, however, therefore necessarily bind myself to follow your reviewer in his suggestion that the comparative distinctness of the local forms of wren and field-mouse may guide us in forming a decision as to the relative periods during which St. Kilda and the Shetlands have been separated from the mainland.

Without intending any disparagement, will you allow me to point out that the cell, with the exception of the special form of copper oxide for which the company justly claim credit, was invented long ago by Lalande, but does not appear to be known so widely as its merits deserve. I have used the cell for a considerable time, the positive plate taking the form of a plate of copper faced on one side with granular copper oxide held in its place by a piece of copper gauze, and can corroborate the statements as to its very low resistance and great constancy.

Without intending any disparagement, will you allow me to point out that the cell, with the exception of the special form of copper oxide for which the company justly claim credit, was invented long ago by Lalande, but does not appear to be known so widely as its merits deserve. I have used the cell for a considerable time, the positive plate taking the form of a plate of copper faced on one side with granular copper oxide held in its place by a piece of copper gauze, and can corroborate the statements as to its very low resistance and great constancy. For elementary work, where resistances of a few hundredths of an ohm are to be compared and a galvanometer of negligible resistance used, I have found it most valuable.

In this paper attention was directed to a horny membrane lining the hollow tube which forms the axis of the colony, and the suggestion was made that this horny membrane is secreted by the Neohelia itself. The single specimen which Miss Pratt had to investigate was, unfortunately, a small one, and in the criticisms which appeared some doubts were expressed as to whether this horny membrane was not secreted by some tubicolous worm which formerly inhabited the hollow tube of the corallum, and not by the Neohelia itself. I have recently had the opportunity of examining specimens of two species of the closely related genus Amphihelia, one (A. oculata) from a depth of 240 fathoms off the coast of Florida, the other (A. ramea) obtained by H.M.S. Porcupine in the Faeroe Channel, 363 fathoms. In both of them there is a horny membrane similar in character and position to that described for Neohelia. Now it is difficult to believe that a worm forming the same kind of tube, with the same habit of mysteriously disappearing when the corals are preserved, occurs in such widely separated districts as Florida, deep water. New Britain, shallow water, and the Faeroe Channel, deep water.

In this paper attention was directed to a horny membrane lining the hollow tube which forms the axis of the colony, and the suggestion was made that this horny membrane is secreted by the Neohelia itself. The single specimen which Miss Pratt had to investigate was, unfortunately, a small one, and in the criticisms which appeared some doubts were expressed as to whether this horny membrane was not secreted by some tubicolous worm which formerly inhabited the hollow tube of the corallum, and not by the Neohelia itself. I have recently had the opportunity of examining specimens of two species of the closely related genus Amphihelia, one (A. oculata) from a depth of 240 fathoms off the coast of Florida, the other (A. ramea) obtained by H.M.S. Porcupine in the Faeroe Channel, 363 fathoms. In both of them there is a horny membrane similar in character and position to that described for Neohelia. Now it is difficult to believe that a worm forming the same kind of tube, with the same habit of mysteriously disappearing when the corals are preserved, occurs in such widely separated districts as Florida, deep water. New Britain, shallow water, and the Faeroe Channel, deep water. The only reasonable conclusion is that these madrepores do actually secrete this horny membrane themselves.","dc.creator":["HICKSON, SYDNEY J."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["HICKSON, SYDNEY J."],"citation_author_institution":["Owens College, Manchester"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Horny Membrane of Neohelia porcellana","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;Emphasis Type=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;The Horny Membrane of...","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"067558d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In pure seismology\u2014apart from applications of elastic solids to earth problems\u2014Prof. Milne's reading is doubtless more extensive than mine, but if he is correct in regarding my first letter as containing nothing new to seismologists, they must, as a class, be singularly prone to a policy of meliora scio deteriora sequor. Novelty in results is, of course, much a matter of opinion. When Prof. Milne says, however, that there is no occasion for my warning as to Young's modulus, I must in reply give a quotation from his first letter, relating to the material of his hypothetical core, \u201cit follows that the density is 5.96, or approximately 6. The elastic modulus for a core of this density which conveys vibrations with a speed of at least 9.5 km. per second is 451 \u00d7 1010 C.G.S., or roughly speaking, a little more than twice the Young's modulus for Bessemer steel.\u201d The italics are mine. If \u201cthe modulus\u201d is not Young's modulus, E, a comparison between it and the E for steel is misleading, because a comparison of numerical results naturally implies that they refer to the same physical quantity.

If, as one would infer from Prof. Milne's second letter, \u201cthe\u201d modulus was intended for the wave modulus m+n, the futility of the comparison becomes obvious when we remember that on the ordinary theory (m+n)/E may have any value between 1 and, according to the value of Poisson's ratio. As a matter of fact, \u201cthe\u201d modulus must, I think, have been intended at the time for Young's, though this must have escaped Prof. Milne's memory.

The amount of chemicals now consumed in educational laboratories must be enormous, and, as regards ordinary materials, quite sufficient to employ a large factory. A very large proportion comes from Germany. Let the universities start their own cooperative factory for the manufacture of the acids and salts they require.

The amount of chemicals now consumed in educational laboratories must be enormous, and, as regards ordinary materials, quite sufficient to employ a large factory. A very large proportion comes from Germany. Let the universities start their own cooperative factory for the manufacture of the acids and salts they require. Let chemical students both have free access to it and put in part of their chemical course as workers there.

As a maker of microscopes, I come into close contact with many branches of work the requirements of which are totally different. To make but one form would be a fatal mistake. The metallurgist cannot use the instrument which is best suited for the bacteriologist, neither will the Rosenhain metallurgical microscope suit the biologist.

Universal experience indicates that a good depth of rich soil is essential for successful vegetable growing; this can only be obtained by trenching and liberal manuring, and nothing in our results should be taken as discountenancing such a practice.","dc.creator":["PICKERING, SPENCER"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["PICKERING, SPENCER"],"citation_author_institution":["Harpenden, Herts"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Trenching Ground and Spraying Potatoes","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Trenching Ground and Spraying Potatoes&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"095342b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Ritchie's communication, it would seem well to await the published paper of Messrs. Anderson and Rennie before making detailed remarks. Also, as Dr. Ritchie is not the direct author of the paper, it is inadvisable to bring in a third party. However, it is most surprising, to say the least, to learn that \u201cIsle of Wight\u201d bee disease is not considered to be infectious. How, then, has the disease spread all over Great Britain and most of Ireland during the last ten years? The statement of the noninfectivity of the disease is emphatically inaccurate. Dr. Ritchie writes of the \u201cunmistakable symptoms\u201d of the disease. But, what are the characteristic symptoms? The investigators working under the Board of Agriculture, in their reports of 1912 and 1913, Showed conclusively that there were no well-marked differential symptoms of \u201cIsle of Wight\u201d bee disease. This was also pointed out in my article in NATURE, and the reason for this is obvious, namely, the limited range of expression of the bee, as was also mentioned in my article. Of the workers contributing to the reports of the Board of Agriculture, two were bacteriologists, two were protozoologists, and one was an expert bee-keeper. Many field experiments as to the pathogenicity of Nosema apis were conducted, and the investigators were unanimously of the opinion that \u201cIsle of Wight\u201d bee disease,is microsporidiosis.

Ritchie's communication, it would seem well to await the published paper of Messrs. Anderson and Rennie before making detailed remarks. Also, as Dr. Ritchie is not the direct author of the paper, it is inadvisable to bring in a third party. However, it is most surprising, to say the least, to learn that \u201cIsle of Wight\u201d bee disease is not considered to be infectious. How, then, has the disease spread all over Great Britain and most of Ireland during the last ten years? The statement of the noninfectivity of the disease is emphatically inaccurate. Dr. Ritchie writes of the \u201cunmistakable symptoms\u201d of the disease. But, what are the characteristic symptoms? The investigators working under the Board of Agriculture, in their reports of 1912 and 1913, Showed conclusively that there were no well-marked differential symptoms of \u201cIsle of Wight\u201d bee disease. This was also pointed out in my article in NATURE, and the reason for this is obvious, namely, the limited range of expression of the bee, as was also mentioned in my article. Of the workers contributing to the reports of the Board of Agriculture, two were bacteriologists, two were protozoologists, and one was an expert bee-keeper. Many field experiments as to the pathogenicity of Nosema apis were conducted, and the investigators were unanimously of the opinion that \u201cIsle of Wight\u201d bee disease,is microsporidiosis. Apparently Dr. Ritchie and Messrs. Anderson and Rennie have quite over-looked the importance of parasite carriers, a subject which was carefully pointed out in my article and in the Journal of the Board of Agriculture, Supplements Nos. 8 and 10. Healthy carriers of most parasitic diseases are known.","dc.creator":["F."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["F."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Isle of Wight Disease in Bees","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Isle of Wight Disease in Bees&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"097361d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

To explore the role of IL-1 in chronic stress-induced depression and some of its underlying biological mechanisms, we used the chronic mild stress (CMS) model of depression. Mice subjected to CMS for 5 weeks exhibited depressive-like symptoms, including decreased sucrose preference, reduced social exploration and adrenocortical activation, concomitantly with increased IL-1\u03b2 levels in the hippocampus. In contrast, mice with deletion of the IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1rKO) or mice with transgenic, brain-restricted overexpression of IL-1 receptor antagonist did not display CMS-induced behavioral or neuroendocrine changes. Similarly, whereas in wild-type (WT) mice CMS significantly reduced hippocampal neurogenesis, measured by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and by doublecortin immunohistochemistry, no such decrease was observed IL-1rKO mice. The blunting of the adrenocortical activation in IL-1rKO mice may play a causal role in their resistance to depression, because removal of endogenous glucocorticoids by adrenalectomy also abolished the depressive-like effects of CMS, whereas chronic administration of corticosterone for 4 weeks produced depressive symptoms and reduced neurogenesis in both WT and IL-1rKO mice. The effects of CMS on both behavioral depression and neurogenesis could be mimicked by exogenous subcutaneous administration of IL-1\u03b2 via osmotic minipumps for 4 weeks. These findings indicate that elevation in brain IL-1 levels, which characterizes many medical conditions, is both necessary and sufficient for producing the high incidence of depression found in these conditions. Thus, procedures aimed at reducing brain IL-1 levels may have potent antidepressive actions.","prism.publicationName":"Molecular Psychiatry","prism.publicationDate":"2007-08-14","prism.volume":"13","prism.number":"7","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"717","prism.endingPage":"728","prism.copyright":"2008 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/4002055","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/sj.mp.4002055","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/4002055.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/4002055","citation_journal_title":"Molecular Psychiatry","citation_journal_abbrev":"Mol Psychiatry","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-5578","citation_title":"Brain interleukin-1 mediates chronic stress-induced depression in mice via adrenocortical activation and hippocampal neurogenesis suppression","citation_volume":"13","citation_issue":"7","citation_publication_date":"2008/07","citation_online_date":"2007/08/14","citation_firstpage":"717","citation_lastpage":"728","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/sj.mp.4002055","DOI":"10.1038/sj.mp.4002055","citation_doi":"10.1038/sj.mp.4002055","description":"Several lines of evidence implicate the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the etiology and pathophysiology of major depression.

AMPA receptors are known to mediate fast synaptic responses and NMDA receptors to mediate slow synaptic responses at most excitatory synapses in the brain2. Kainate receptors are formed from a separate set of genes (GluR5\u20137, KA-1 and KA-2) and are widely distributed throughout the brain3,4,5,6,7,8.

Species diversity reduces \u2018current shading\u2019 (that is, the deceleration of flow from upstream to downstream neighbours), allowing diverse assemblages to capture a greater fraction of suspended resources than is caught by any species monoculture. The fundamental nature of this form of hydrodynamic facilitation suggests that it is broadly applicable to freshwater and marine habitats; in addition, it has several analogues in terrestrial ecosystems where fluxes of energy and matter can be influenced by biophysical complexity3,5,6. Thus, changes in species diversity may alter the probability of positive species interactions, resulting in disproportionately large changes in the functioning of ecosystems.","dc.creator":["Cardinale, Bradley J.","Palmer, Margaret A.","Collins, Scott L."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Science; citation_title=Plant diversity and productivity experiments in European grasslands.; citation_author=A Hector; citation_volume=286; citation_publication_date=1999; citation_pages=1123-1127; citation_doi=10.1126/science.286.5442.1123; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=Partitioning selection and complementarity in biodiversity experiments.; citation_author=M Loreau, A Hector; citation_volume=412; citation_publication_date=2001; citation_pages=72-76; citation_doi=10.1038/35083573; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Proc.

Here we report that the \u2018Daka\u2019 calvaria's metric and morphological attributes centre it firmly within H. erectus. Daka's resemblance to Asian counterparts indicates that the early African and Eurasian fossil hominids represent demes of a widespread palaeospecies. Daka's anatomical intermediacy between earlier and later African fossils provides evidence of evolutionary change. Its temporal and geographic position indicates that African H.\u00a0erectus was the ancestor of Homo sapiens.","dc.creator":["Asfaw, Berhane","Gilbert, W.

This results in an abundance of n-3 and a reduction in n-6 fatty acids in the organs and tissues of these mice, in the absence of dietary n-3.

Restrictions in a cell's ability to halt the cell cycle might, in turn, cause mitotic catastrophe, a delayed type of cell death with distinct morphological features. Here, we have investigated the contribution of p53 and caspase-2 to apoptotic cell death and mitotic catastrophe in cisplatin-treated ovarian carcinoma cell lines. We report that both functional p53 and caspase-2 were required for the apoptotic response, which was preceded by translocation of nuclear caspase-2 to the cytoplasm. In the absence of functional p53, cisplatin treatment resulted in caspase-2-independent mitotic catastrophe followed by necrosis. In these cells, apoptotic functions could be restored by transient expression of wt p53. Hence, p53 appeared to act as a switch between apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe followed by necrosis-like lysis in this experimental model. Further, we show that inhibition of Chk2, and/or 14-3-3\u03c3 deficiency, sensitized cells to undergo mitotic catastrophe upon treatment with DNA-damaging agents. However, apoptotic cell death seemed to be the final outcome of this process. Thus, we hypothesize that the final mode of cell death triggered by DNA damage in ovarian carcinoma cells is determined by the profile of proteins involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, such as p53- and Chk2-related proteins.","prism.publicationName":"Cell Death & Differentiation","prism.publicationDate":"2007-12-07","prism.volume":"15","prism.number":"3","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"555","prism.endingPage":"566","prism.copyright":"2008 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/4402286","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/sj.cdd.4402286","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/4402286.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/4402286","citation_journal_title":"Cell Death & Differentiation","citation_journal_abbrev":"Cell Death Differ","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-5403","citation_title":"DNA damage induces two distinct modes of cell death in ovarian carcinomas","citation_volume":"15","citation_issue":"3","citation_publication_date":"2008/03","citation_online_date":"2007/12/07","citation_firstpage":"555","citation_lastpage":"566","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/sj.cdd.4402286","DOI":"10.1038/sj.cdd.4402286","citation_doi":"10.1038/sj.cdd.4402286","description":"Activation of p53 by cellular stress may lead to either cell cycle arrest or apoptotic cell death.

DARPP-32 (dopamine and cyclic AMP-regulated phospho-protein, relative molecular mass 32,000) is converted into an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) at threonine 34 (refs 2, 3). We find that DARPP-32 is converted into an inhibitor of PKA when phosphorylated at threonine 75 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). Cdk5 phosphorylates DARPP-32 in vitro and in intact brain cells. Phospho-Thr\u200975 DARPP-32 inhibits PKA in vitro by a competitive mechanism. Decreasing phospho-Thr\u200975 DARPP-32 in striatal slices, either by a Cdk5-specific inhibitor or by using genetically altered mice, results in increased dopamine-induced phosphorylation of PKA substrates and augmented peak voltage-gated calcium currents.

In the thyroid, TTF-1 is essential for thyroid organogenesis and governs thyroid functions by regulating various thyroid-specific genes. We previously demonstrated that most differentiated thyroid neoplasms, including follicular adenomas/carcinomas and papillary carcinomas, express TTF-1 at both protein and mRNA levels. However, certain subtypes of thyroid cancers have shown low or negative expression of TTF-1. The aim of our study was to investigate the function of epigenetic modification in dysregulation of TTF-1 in thyroid carcinoma cells. We evaluated the expression of TTF-1 in primary thyroid tissues (normal thyroid, papillary carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma) and in thyroid carcinoma cell lines using immunohistochemistry and RT\u2013PCR. Methylation-specific PCR targeting CpG islands of TTF-1 and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for histone H3 lysine 9 (H3-lys9) were applied to clarify the correlation of the TTF-1 expression profile and epigenetic status. We also explored whether epigenetic modifiers, including 5-aza-deoxycytidine, could restore TTF-1 expression in thyroid carcinoma cells. In our current study, immunohistochemistry and RT\u2013PCR showed positive expression of TTF-1 in normal thyroids and papillary carcinomas. Meanwhile, most of the undifferentiated carcinomas and the cell lines lost TTF-1 expression. No methylation in the CpG of TTF-1 promoter was detected in normal thyroids or papillary carcinomas. In contrast, DNA methylation was identified in 60% of the undifferentiated carcinomas (6/10) and 50% of the cell lines (4/8). ChIP assay demonstrated that acetylation of H3-lys9 was positively correlated with TTF-1 expression in thyroid carcinoma cells. Finally, DNA demethylating agents could restore TTF-1 gene expression in the thyroid carcinoma cell lines. Our data suggest that epigenetics is involved with inactivation of TTF-1 in thyroid carcinomas, and provide a possible means of using TTF-1 as a target for differentiation-inducing therapy through epigenetic modification.","prism.publicationName":"Laboratory Investigation","prism.publicationDate":"2009-06-08","prism.volume":"89","prism.number":"7","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"791","prism.endingPage":"799","prism.copyright":"2009 United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc.","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/labinvest200950","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/labinvest.2009.50","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/labinvest200950.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/labinvest200950","citation_journal_title":"Laboratory Investigation","citation_journal_abbrev":"Lab Invest","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1530-0307","citation_title":"Epigenetic silencing of TTF-1/NKX2-1 through DNA hypermethylation and histone H3 modulation in thyroid carcinomas","citation_volume":"89","citation_issue":"7","citation_publication_date":"2009/07","citation_online_date":"2009/06/08","citation_firstpage":"791","citation_lastpage":"799","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/labinvest.2009.50","DOI":"10.1038/labinvest.2009.50","citation_doi":"10.1038/labinvest.2009.50","description":"Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), also known as NKX2-1, is a homeodomain containing transcriptional factor identified in thyroid, lung and central nervous system.

In the past decade, metamaterials with effective medium parameters or gradient phases have been studied to control terahertz waves and realize functional devices.

We propose a general coding unit based on a Minkowski closed-loop particle that is capable of generating 1-bit coding (with two phase states of 0 and 180\u00b0), 2-bit coding (with four phase states of 0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and 270\u00b0), and multi-bit coding elements in the terahertz frequencies by using different geometric scales.

Hyperentangled photon states (that is, states showing entanglement in multiple DOFs) have demonstrated significant implications for both fundamental physics tests and quantum communication and computation. Increasing the number of qubits of photonic experiments requires miniaturization and integration of the basic elements, and functions to guarantee the setup stability, which motivates the development of technologies allowing the precise control of different photonic DOFs on a chip. We demonstrate the contextual use of path and polarization qubits propagating within an integrated quantum circuit. We tested the properties of four-qubit linear cluster states built on both DOFs, and we exploited them to perform the Grover's search algorithm according to the one-way quantum computation model.

Here we present a laser-probe-based method that enables two-dimensional videography at ultrafast timescales (femtosecond and shorter) of single, non-repetitive events. The method is based on superimposing a structural code onto the illumination to encrypt a single event, which is then deciphered in a post-processing step. This coding strategy enables laser probing with arbitrary wavelengths/bandwidths to collect signals with indiscriminate spectral information, thus allowing for ultrafast videography with full spectroscopic capability. To demonstrate the high temporal resolution of our method, we present videography of light propagation with record high 200 femtosecond temporal resolution. The method is widely applicable for studying a multitude of dynamical processes in physics, chemistry and biology over a wide range of time scales.
