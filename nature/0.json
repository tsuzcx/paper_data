TAIT need not wonder if an attack that is \u201ctotally unexpected\u201d should seem \u201cappallingly sudden.\u201d In the absence of a statute of limitations restricting to two years and a half the right to take up a gage, there can be no reason why an attack should not be made, save its personal bearings; and the circumstances of the challenge might be cited in bar of any exception taken on that ground. I thank the Professor for his explanations. I could not have guessed that under cover of his challenge to produce a metaphysician who was also a mathematician, lurked the assumptions, that every mathematician was a metaphysician, and that every metaphysician was either a mathematician or (in the old sense) a physician. Well, he has a perfect right, for his own private convenience or pleasure, to identify two names which he had from the first asserted to be eternally distinct. Accepting his classification, then, for the sake of argument\u2014certainly not for fruitless controversy\u2014to wit, that everyone is either a mathematician or a non-mathematician, and that every true metaphysician must be either mathematician or physician (Faraday did not hate the term \u201cphysicist\u201d worse than I do) we are confronted with some surprising results. Leibnitz, the author of the Monadologie and the Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e, works that are known to contain the germs of the Kritik der reinen Vernunft, was a spurious metaphysician. Why, in the name of common sense? \u201cBecause,\u201d says Prof. Tait, \u201che was a non-mathematician; there is no medium, you know; he must have been either a non-mathematician or a mathematician, and a mathematician he was not\u201d What! Leibnitz not a mathematician? \u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d says Prof. Tait; \u201c for he was, I fear, simply a thief as regards mathematics, and in physics he did not allow the truth of Newton's discoveries.\u201d I do not object to the Professor calling a spade a spade; but I assure him that this charge is made just twenty years too late. It is exactly that time since the last vestige of presumption against the fair fame of the great German was obliterated.

TAIT need not wonder if an attack that is \u201ctotally unexpected\u201d should seem \u201cappallingly sudden.\u201d In the absence of a statute of limitations restricting to two years and a half the right to take up a gage, there can be no reason why an attack should not be made, save its personal bearings; and the circumstances of the challenge might be cited in bar of any exception taken on that ground. I thank the Professor for his explanations. I could not have guessed that under cover of his challenge to produce a metaphysician who was also a mathematician, lurked the assumptions, that every mathematician was a metaphysician, and that every metaphysician was either a mathematician or (in the old sense) a physician. Well, he has a perfect right, for his own private convenience or pleasure, to identify two names which he had from the first asserted to be eternally distinct. Accepting his classification, then, for the sake of argument\u2014certainly not for fruitless controversy\u2014to wit, that everyone is either a mathematician or a non-mathematician, and that every true metaphysician must be either mathematician or physician (Faraday did not hate the term \u201cphysicist\u201d worse than I do) we are confronted with some surprising results. Leibnitz, the author of the Monadologie and the Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e, works that are known to contain the germs of the Kritik der reinen Vernunft, was a spurious metaphysician. Why, in the name of common sense? \u201cBecause,\u201d says Prof. Tait, \u201che was a non-mathematician; there is no medium, you know; he must have been either a non-mathematician or a mathematician, and a mathematician he was not\u201d What! Leibnitz not a mathematician? \u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d says Prof. Tait; \u201c for he was, I fear, simply a thief as regards mathematics, and in physics he did not allow the truth of Newton's discoveries.\u201d I do not object to the Professor calling a spade a spade; but I assure him that this charge is made just twenty years too late. It is exactly that time since the last vestige of presumption against the fair fame of the great German was obliterated. If Prof. Tait does not understand me, or, understanding me, disputes the unqualified truth of my statement, I promise to be more explicit in a future letter. But I incline to think the question is not susceptible of proof until the Council of the Royal Society, who so grossly disgraced themselves in 1712, shall do the simple act of justice and reparation required of them, viz., publish the letters and papers relating to this controversy, which since that date have slumbered in the secret archives.

Roughly extemporising a sextant with a postcard and paper-vector, I took three observations on the semi-diameter, and found the mean to be 22\u00b06. So I conclude this to be the ice-halo, whose deviation is 23\u00b0, being formed of hexagonal crystals.

During a visit to the late Sir William Hamilton in 1855, this subject came up for discussion. Sir William was then engaged on his edition of the works of Dugald Stewart. I called his special attention to Stewart's doctrine regarding the operation of Will in acts which are usually ascribed to Habit. Stewart asserts that all habitual actions are really voluntary. As he had no acquaintance with the modern doctrine of \u201clatent mental modifications,\u201d he would naturally take for granted that there can be neither a volition nor any other act of mind without accompanying consciousness. He accounted for the non-remembrance of that consciousness by the extreme rapidity of the volitional, action. (Collected Works, vol. ii. chap, ii.) To this Sir William objected. He went on to show that in many cases an act, or even a long series of acts, originally voluntary, have ceased to be so. The habit or habitude, which is a mental tendency, though not a power, generated by custom, supplies the place of volition. In illustration, he referred particularly to the well-known fact that in India soldiers will march long distances when they are asleep. Now, it seems to me that this decides Mr. Bennett's question. Here we have regulated action, determined, not by volition, but by habit. Sir William, however, failed to meet all my difficulties, because, as I afterwards saw, of his unsatisfactory theory of causation. He so frequently confounded conditions with causes. With him a cause denoted anything without which an effect could not be; hence his doctrine of con-causes, a plurality of causes for each effect. Thus, when I will to move my hand, and the movement follows, Sir William would call the volition one cause of the movement, whereas it is merely a condition. It is remarkable that he should fall into this error since he rejected Biran's doctrine regarding the efficiency of volition. In a subsequent conversation we discussed the points of similarity and the points of difference between Habits and Instincts. It would, however, be trespassing on your space to give the details.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"6","prism.number":"155","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"492","prism.endingPage":"492","prism.copyright":"1872 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/006492b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/006492b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/006492b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/006492b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Consciousness and Volition","citation_volume":"6","citation_issue":"155","citation_publication_date":"1872/10","citation_firstpage":"492","citation_lastpage":"492","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/006492b0","DOI":"10.1038/006492b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/006492b0","description":"THE question raised by Mr. Bennett in last week's NATURE is of great importance, and of no small difficulty.

As he had no acquaintance with the modern doctrine of \u201clatent mental modifications,\u201d he would naturally take for granted that there can be neither a volition nor any other act of mind without accompanying consciousness. He accounted for the non-remembrance of that consciousness by the extreme rapidity of the volitional, action. (Collected Works, vol. ii. chap, ii.) To this Sir William objected. He went on to show that in many cases an act, or even a long series of acts, originally voluntary, have ceased to be so. The habit or habitude, which is a mental tendency, though not a power, generated by custom, supplies the place of volition. In illustration, he referred particularly to the well-known fact that in India soldiers will march long distances when they are asleep. Now, it seems to me that this decides Mr. Bennett's question. Here we have regulated action, determined, not by volition, but by habit. Sir William, however, failed to meet all my difficulties, because, as I afterwards saw, of his unsatisfactory theory of causation. He so frequently confounded conditions with causes. With him a cause denoted anything without which an effect could not be; hence his doctrine of con-causes, a plurality of causes for each effect. Thus, when I will to move my hand, and the movement follows, Sir William would call the volition one cause of the movement, whereas it is merely a condition. It is remarkable that he should fall into this error since he rejected Biran's doctrine regarding the efficiency of volition. In a subsequent conversation we discussed the points of similarity and the points of difference between Habits and Instincts. It would, however, be trespassing on your space to give the details.","dc.creator":["MOORE, JOHN"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MOORE, JOHN"],"citation_author_institution":["near Manchester"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Consciousness and Volition","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Consciousness and Volition&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"006514b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It seems to me that the dog during its journey by water must have had a constant perception of the bearing of its old home; and on the other hand that it made its way back not by any blind instinct but by trial and error and by recognition of the character of the forest.","dc.creator":["S., F.

When in Brazil in 1859, I collected some of these caterpillars. They are very similar in appearance to the larv\u00e6 of the British Arctia, but when their hairs are examined under a microscope, they are found to consist of a series of barbed points, the point of each succeeding barb fitting into the divergence of the preceding barbs; at least, that is my recollection, for I have not examined them since then, and cannot find any specimens to do so now.

But first I must return my best thanks to your correspondents, as well as to some gentlemen who have written direct to me, and to whom I have not had time to send separate answers. Secondly, I must plead guilty to the high crime of inaccuracy. As the stalks from which the flowers had been cut were shrivelled, I mistook, in a manner now inexplicable to me, the base of the ruptured or removed ovarium for the summit; a remnant of the shrivelled placenta being mistaken for the base of the pistil. I have now looked more carefully, and find that on twelve stalks only three had any remnant of the ovarium left. I have also examined sixteen bits of the calyx which had been cut off by a caged bullfinch, presently to be noticed, and in fifteen of these not only had the ovarium been torn into fragments or quite destroyed, but all the ovules had been devoured, excepting sometimes one or two. In several cases the calyx had been split open longitudinally. The ovarium was in the same state in thirteen small portions of the calyx lying on the ground near a wild cowslip plant. It is therefore clear that the ovules are the chief attraction; but the birds in removing by pressure the ovules could not fail to squeeze out the nectar at the open end, as occurred when I squeezed similar bits between my fingers. The birds thus get a dainty morsel, namely, young ovules with sweet sauce. I still think that the nectar is, in part, the attraction, as caged bullfinches and canary birds much like sugar; but more especially because Mr. C. J. Monro has sent me some flowers from a cherry-tree near Barnet, which during several years has been attacked; and he finds many of the flowers, both those on the tree and on the ground, with rather large ragged holes in the calyx, like, but much larger than, those often made by humble bees when they rob flowers in an illegitimate manner.

But first I must return my best thanks to your correspondents, as well as to some gentlemen who have written direct to me, and to whom I have not had time to send separate answers. Secondly, I must plead guilty to the high crime of inaccuracy. As the stalks from which the flowers had been cut were shrivelled, I mistook, in a manner now inexplicable to me, the base of the ruptured or removed ovarium for the summit; a remnant of the shrivelled placenta being mistaken for the base of the pistil. I have now looked more carefully, and find that on twelve stalks only three had any remnant of the ovarium left. I have also examined sixteen bits of the calyx which had been cut off by a caged bullfinch, presently to be noticed, and in fifteen of these not only had the ovarium been torn into fragments or quite destroyed, but all the ovules had been devoured, excepting sometimes one or two. In several cases the calyx had been split open longitudinally. The ovarium was in the same state in thirteen small portions of the calyx lying on the ground near a wild cowslip plant. It is therefore clear that the ovules are the chief attraction; but the birds in removing by pressure the ovules could not fail to squeeze out the nectar at the open end, as occurred when I squeezed similar bits between my fingers. The birds thus get a dainty morsel, namely, young ovules with sweet sauce. I still think that the nectar is, in part, the attraction, as caged bullfinches and canary birds much like sugar; but more especially because Mr. C. J. Monro has sent me some flowers from a cherry-tree near Barnet, which during several years has been attacked; and he finds many of the flowers, both those on the tree and on the ground, with rather large ragged holes in the calyx, like, but much larger than, those often made by humble bees when they rob flowers in an illegitimate manner. Now the inside of the flower of the cherry, round the ovarium, is bedewed (if protected from the visits of insects) with drops of nectar, which sometimes collect so as almost to fill up the bottom of the flower.

Some time must still elapse before the results can be presented as a whole. Meanwhile I should be obliged if you would give insertion to the facts with regard to two points which seem at present to have a special interest to the public.","dc.creator":["HUNTER, W.

I have found, first about nine years ago, and have more systematically observed lately, that fresh sections of many fruits, such as the apple and pear, and other vegetable structures as the potato, turnip, &c., give the reactions considered to be characteristic of ozone, viz., causing separation of iodine from iodide of potassium, and turning tincture of guaiacum blue, the intensity of these reactions varying in different samples of the vegetable substances, but depending mainly on their comparative freshness. I have further found that the same structures contain a substance which acts as an Ozontr\u00e4ger, to use Sch\u00f6nbein's expression, a substance which transfers ozone from peroxide of hydrogen and similar articles. This is shown by the fact that if the guaiacum is not blued at all, or only to a slight extent, the blue colour becomes very marked when a drop of ethereal solution of peroxide of hydrogen is added. I infer from these observations (1) that the oxygen inhaled by living plants, and even by pulled fruits for a time, is ozonised or rendered active, probably by entering into loose combination, as is the case with the oxygen in the blood of animals; and (2) that it is probable, though not proved, that the ozone-transferring substance existing in almost every fresh vegetable structure is that with which it is loosely combined, as the oxygen in the blood is with the h\u00e6moglobin of the red corpuscles, which is a very active Ozontr\u00e4ger. This element in plants is gradually destroyed as decay comes on, and ceases to perform its ozone transferring function when the fruit, &c., containing it is cooked. It is not chlorophyll, as is shown by its situation, and it seems to be intimately associated with the vascular tissue. From analogy with the animal substances h\u00e6moglobin, fibrin, myosin, &c., which have a similar action, it may be presumed to be proteinaceous, though I am unable to indicate its chemical and other characters more exactly.

In NATURE, vol. xviii. p. 562, Prof. Boyd Dawkins drew attention to this subject, and urged the necessity of issuing the \u201cMemoirs\u201d at a reasonable price; but this last publication shows that the Stationery Office does not intend to mend its ways, but will still try and put the information it issues as far as possible out of the reach of the public. The fact I should like to draw attention to as regards the price of the \u201cMemoirs\u201d is the absurdity of the amount charged for some of the volumes, as proved by others issued by the Survey; and a glance at the facts seems to show that the prices are fixed without any regard to the size or quality of the book. Mr. Skertchley's pamphlet consists of 80 pp. and 71 figs., and this, in a paper wrapper, is priced 17s. 6d.! Now, take Prof. Judd's \u201cGeology of Rutland,\u201d this contains 320 pp. (or exactly four times as many as Mr. Skertchley's) 11 plates and 19 woodcuts, and the price of this, in cloth, is 12s. 6d., or 5s. less than the one of 80 pp. Another example is Mr. De Ranee's Memoir on the \u201cSuperficial Geology of the Coasts of Southwest Lancashire,\u201d which consists of 139 pp., and 20 woodcuts, and for which we have to pay 17s.; compare with this Mr. Woodward's \u201cEast Somerset and Bristol Coalfield,\u201d containing 271 pp., 9 plates, and 23 woodcuts, which is only one shilling more than the last-named, and is issued in cloth.

In NATURE, vol. xviii. p. 562, Prof. Boyd Dawkins drew attention to this subject, and urged the necessity of issuing the \u201cMemoirs\u201d at a reasonable price; but this last publication shows that the Stationery Office does not intend to mend its ways, but will still try and put the information it issues as far as possible out of the reach of the public. The fact I should like to draw attention to as regards the price of the \u201cMemoirs\u201d is the absurdity of the amount charged for some of the volumes, as proved by others issued by the Survey; and a glance at the facts seems to show that the prices are fixed without any regard to the size or quality of the book. Mr. Skertchley's pamphlet consists of 80 pp. and 71 figs., and this, in a paper wrapper, is priced 17s. 6d.! Now, take Prof. Judd's \u201cGeology of Rutland,\u201d this contains 320 pp. (or exactly four times as many as Mr. Skertchley's) 11 plates and 19 woodcuts, and the price of this, in cloth, is 12s. 6d., or 5s. less than the one of 80 pp. Another example is Mr. De Ranee's Memoir on the \u201cSuperficial Geology of the Coasts of Southwest Lancashire,\u201d which consists of 139 pp., and 20 woodcuts, and for which we have to pay 17s.; compare with this Mr. Woodward's \u201cEast Somerset and Bristol Coalfield,\u201d containing 271 pp., 9 plates, and 23 woodcuts, which is only one shilling more than the last-named, and is issued in cloth. But perhaps the most curious two to take together are Mr. Skertchley's volume on the \u201cFenland,\u201d and Prof. Green's \u201cReport on the Yorkshire Coalfield.\u201d The former of these contains 335 pp., 24 plates, and 36 woodcuts, and is published at 2l., the latter has 823 pp., 26 plates, and 125 woodcuts, and yet the price is only 2l. 2s. It is certainly hard to understand why we should be charged 2l. for Mr. Skertchley's volume, if one the size of Prof. Green's can be produced for 2l. 2s.

Here and there, however, small spots of the surface, near to the shore, resisted the frost longer, and when they did freeze the ice was very thin.

On the other hand, if a so-called element show a plurality of spectroscopic lines or hues, I do not think it at all doubtful that there is a plurality of units moving to produce these, since they thus show effects of different modes of moving of bodies; all our different states of sensual consciousness of colours are necessarily dependent on differences in the modes of moving of the agents that excite in us such plurality of lines and hues. As the motions of atoms, or rather of groups of atoms, excite in us sensations of sound, so the motions of units, or rather of groups of units, excite in us sensations of colour, and of course the lower-pitched movements of dark heat.

On the other hand, if a so-called element show a plurality of spectroscopic lines or hues, I do not think it at all doubtful that there is a plurality of units moving to produce these, since they thus show effects of different modes of moving of bodies; all our different states of sensual consciousness of colours are necessarily dependent on differences in the modes of moving of the agents that excite in us such plurality of lines and hues. As the motions of atoms, or rather of groups of atoms, excite in us sensations of sound, so the motions of units, or rather of groups of units, excite in us sensations of colour, and of course the lower-pitched movements of dark heat. Then again, we may hold that the more lines that persist in a spark or a sun, the less easily reducible are the portions of the elements showing them, as far as these lines' constituents are concerned\u2014the lines being still undissociated material.\u201d (Proc.

H. Pepys drew attention to a section then being made through beds of river gravel and brick earth near the West Drayton Station of the Great Western Railway. I had an opportunity of going to West Drayton on July 27, 1880, so I walked through the cutting towards Langley. My quest was for relics of prim\u00e6val man, and I was rewarded by finding not only several flint flakes, but the batt end of a massive implement broken in Pal\u00e6olithic times. This was just north of Langley Station, in Buckinghamshire, and the first Pal\u00e6olithic relics, as far as I know, detected in that county. The workmen in the cutting for the new canal were such a rough lot that I found it impossible to fraternise with them, so my subsequent visits were all made on Sundays. During these walks I lighted on ten implements and a large number of flakes at Langley and Iver, all in the valley of the Coin, and a river until now (as far as I know) not described as implementiferous. In gravel brought from the pit close to Taplow Station I found a single implement, a large trimmed flake, and numerous simple flakes; this position is also in the county of Buckingham. At West Drayton, in Middlesex, in the valley of the Coln, I lighted on five implements and numerous flakes. East of West Drayton, in a pit near Botwell, in the valley of the Yedding Brook, hitherto undescribed as implement-bearing, I found a single implement; this was in the pit near Bull's Bridge. In the same valley at Hillington, and other places I have found several other implements. In all the excavations from Slough to Acton I have found both implements and flakes. In the new railway cutting from Gunnersbury to Hounslow I have found four implements, one close to Hounslow, a massive butt, and many flakes. This cutting has been a very interesting one, from the abundance of the fossil shells of fresh-water molluscs found in the sands, especially near the bridge under the Hanwell Road. One shell very abundant, and, as far as my observation goes, absent from the sands of North-east London, is Achatina acicula, M\u00fcll., kindly named for me by Dr. J. Gwyn Jeffreys. I believe this is the first record of fresh-water shells from the Pal\u00e6olithic sands of the Ealing district. Since my paper on the Valley of the Brent was read before the Anthropological Institute, in June, 1879, I have found many more implements in the positions there mentioned. At North-east London, and especially in the Valley of the Lea, I have been able to greatly extend the range of Pal\u00e6olithic man. In addition to the localities mentioned in my paper read before the Anthropological Institute, in June, 1878, and published in February, 1879, I am now able to mention London Fields, Homerton, in the south, a position south of Dalston Junction, and nearer the Thames than the places first given by me, Hackney, near the railway station, Abney Park Cemetery, South Hornsey, Highbury, Stamford Hill, Upper Edmonton, Lower Edmonton, Bush Hill Park, Forty Hill, Enfield, and Cheshunt; the pit at the last place, which formerly produced flakes only, has since furnished three implements\u2014one an example of the first class. On the east side of the Lea I have found implements in the gravels of Stratford, Leyton, Leytonstone, Wanstead, Walthamstow, and Higham Hill\u2014a magnificent example from the last place. Further east, and in the Valley of the Roding (first pointed out by me as a river bearing implements in its gravels)\u2014at Barking\u2014I have found two implements, and elsewhere in the neighbourhood, as at Ilford and Upton, numerous flakes. Still further east, at Gray's Thurrock, West Tilbury, and Southend, I have evidence of the presence of prim\u00e6val man; at the latter place, a rude make-shift implement, and a scrapingtool with twin bulbs of percussion. These were found by my two sons. I have not mentioned all the positions I know in this letter, or re-mentioned those given in my two papers, but rather the positions I can afford to dispense with. It shows, however, especially when considered with the discoveries at Reading and Oxford, what a vast cohort of men once lived all along the Thames and its northern tributaries in Pal\u00e6olithic times.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"26","prism.number":"665","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"293","prism.endingPage":"293","prism.copyright":"1882 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/026293a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/026293a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/026293a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/026293a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Pal\u00e6olithic Implements\u2014New Localities in the Thames Valley, near London","citation_volume":"26","citation_issue":"665","citation_publication_date":"1882/07","citation_firstpage":"293","citation_lastpage":"293","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/026293a0","DOI":"10.1038/026293a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/026293a0","description":"IN NATURE, for July 15, 1880, p. 253, Mr. P.

They were moderately common in both localities close to the shore, where corals are comparatively scarce, and are mainly of the massive kinds, such as the Astr\u00e6as, against which the tentacles of a Holothurian would be useless. There were a few branching Oculinas here and there, but not enough to support the Holothurians. But further, some of the latter bury their bodies in the mud or sand, leaving only the tentacles exposed; and I have watched these thrusting their tentacles into their stomachs right up to the base in the comical way described by Mr. Kent. It is quite clear that these were not feeding on living coral. I did not, however, see them actually taking up sand and shell and thrusting it down, as Mr. Kent did; in fact I was puzzled as to what they were feeding on. From the way the tentacles were set, standing nearly erect, I fancied they were catching swimming Creatures, as other tentacled animals do. This idea is supported, though not proved, by a fine specimen from the zoological Station at Naples, which has a half-swallowed fish protruding from its mouth. The specimen is in the Bristol Musenm. It proves at all events that they do not reject this kind of food. Possibly in default of it they may fall back upon sand and shell, and the minute organisms contained in these. Some of my experiences with these creatures were interesting. At Bermuda two large kinds used to lie quite exposed in shallow water. I might have guessed from this that they would probably he protected in some way. I used to wade along shore carrying a fishing-basket and a landing-net, and one day, as my basket was full, I put a couple into the landing-net to carry home. As their skins were quite hard, I thought they would travel well so. After handling them, I found my hands smarted a little, and the irritation lasted till bedtime. I found that little bits of their skin had got under mine, and this caused the irritation. As I was going home, I found my Holothurians were literally melting away; long streamers of a colourless gelatinous substance were hanging down between the meshes. Of course I threw the nasty things away, and had a dreadful job to get the net clean. I attributed my misfortune to the sun, so another day I packed a couple up comfortably at the bottom of my basket, which is very closely made. After an hour or two I was horrified to find long streamers hanging down from the basket of the same horrible substance. They had literally gone to pieces again, and spoilt everything in the basket. Shortly after, I left for Jamaica, and there I took out a wide-mouthed bottle and brought one home in triumph. Being engaged that evening, I left the Holothurian in the bottle all night. Next morning the creature was all there, but he had cleared out the whole of his inside; his intestinal canal and the beautiful tree-like organ were perfect. The latter was still alive and was waving about in the water in the prettiest way, and looking remarkably like branchi\u00e6. Some accessory organs along the intestinal canal were exhibiting rhythmical pulsations. Altogether it was a most interesting sight. But my poor Holothurian was only a tube. I did not know at the time that he could grow a complete new inside.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"27","prism.number":"700","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"508","prism.endingPage":"508","prism.copyright":"1883 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/027508a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/027508a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/027508a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/027508a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Holothurians","citation_volume":"27","citation_issue":"700","citation_publication_date":"1883/03","citation_firstpage":"508","citation_lastpage":"508","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/027508a0","DOI":"10.1038/027508a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/027508a0","description":"MY experience of about three months in Bermuda and Jamaica fully bears out Mr. Guppy and Mr. Kent's view that the Holothurians do not feed on living coral.

Possibly the following instance of reasoning power in an elephant may not be without interest:\u2014Some years ago I was ascending the lower part of the Darjeeling Hill Road, in the Himalaya Mountains, from Terai. At a certain part of the road, where we met a string of bullock carts, the outer few feet was encumbered by a long flat-topped heap of small rounded boulders, piled there to be broken up for road metal; from the outer edge there was a steep, almost precipitous, slope. On the inner side of the road was a small drain, and then a few feet of comparatively level ground between the drain and the slope above. The carts just mentioned were of the usual kind, the body (constructed of bamboo) about 12 feet long and 31/2 feet broad, with the wheels near the middle, each cart being drawn by a pair of bullocks. The mahaut (driver) of the elephant I was riding having halted the animal close up to the heap of boulders, there was just room left between the elephant and the chain for the carts to pass. These carts were the ordinary vehicles of the country, and under ordinary circumstances an elephant would no more think of \u201cshying\u201d at them than a London dray horse would think of shying at a cab. Yet as the carts went by one by one my elephant became more and more uneasy, and finally, in spite of the efforts of the mahaut to restrain her, mounted on the heap of boulders, at the risk (which, considering how cautious elephants are in treading on suspicious ground, I believe she must have seen quite as clearly as the mahaut or I) of rolling down the slope below the road, if the rounded boulders shifted and gave way beneath her weight. It was some time before I perceived the cause of her fear. Elephants, even in India, are uncommon, and bullocks, as well as other domestic animals, generally feel considerable dread of them from their unusual appearance as well as their size. The bullocks in question were greatly frightened at having to pass so close to the bulky brute, and several of them in passing tried to get away from her by jumping the drain. It required all the efforts of the drivers to prevent their doing it. The elephant evidently saw that the bullocks were frightened and that they were trying to jump the drain, and she further calculated that if they did so the long tail of the cart would swing sharply round in the opposite direction and strike her violently across the fore legs.

TAIT appears to have misunderstood my object in writing the letter published in your issue of January 24 (p. 287). It refers distinctly to his letter of December 27, and not directly to the review which began the correspondence. In that letter Prof. Tait stated publicly that he had not received certain publications of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. I desired, as secretary, to explain that it was not due to the neglect of the officers of the Society. He also says:\u2014\u201cNATURE would do a real service to science by collecting statistics as to the numbers of different centres... at which the Transactions of various scientific societies were freely accessible in 1883 (say) and also in 1853.\u201d It was in my power to give the statistics for \u201cTransactions or Proceedings or both\u201d for the year 1883; in answer to part of Prof. Tait's suggestion I did so. There is no reference in my letter to the year 1854, so that Prof. Tait is not correct in stating (NATURE, January 31, p. 311) that the question between us is, \u201cWhat was the state of matters in 1854?\u201d The year 1869 was the earliest for which, with the data ready to hand, I could obtain the numbers, I therefore gave statistics for that year in addition; I had no knowledge of what may have been the case in 1854, and I said nothing about it. Prof. Tait referred to a malady and suggested a cure. I merely wished to show that the cure had already been applied. My remarks were addressed solely to that point, and were not \u201cbeside the question.\u201d Prof. Tait, in your last issue, has an elaborate argument to prove that about one-third of the centres receiving publications receive Proceedings only. In this he is entirely mistaken. At present the number of such centres is 6; in 1854 it was o. The history of the case is as follows. Until the year 1843 the Cambridge Philosophical Society published no Proceedings. Between that year and 1864 short accounts of the papers read and of the discussions were published in the Phil. Mag., and separate copies were supplied to the Society. In 1864 these were collected, and form vol. i. of the Proceedings. At the time they were not circulated separately; circulation was given them in the Phil. Mag. In that year the arrangement with the Phil. Mag. came to an end, and notices of the same kind were printed by the secretaries and distributed to resident Fellows. Almost without an exception all the important papers published by the Society appeared in the Transactions. There was no need therefore to circulate Proceedings, and it was not done. This practice was continued up to 1876, when the second volume of the Proceedings was closed, and a new system begun. Thus up to 1876 all centres receiving publications necessarily received Transactions, and as a matter of fact nothing else. A few copies of vols. i. and ii. of the Proceedings have since been issued. Vol. iii. of the Proceedings was commenced in 1876, and both it and succeeding volumes contain in full the shorter or the less important communications made to the Society, as well as abstracts of matter published in full in the Transactions. Vols. iii. and iv., then, of the Proceedings have, as a general rule, been sent with the Transactions, and the centres have usually, since 1876, received both. Within the last few years, however, 6 centres have been added to the list which receive the Proceedings only. Thus in 1883 (omitting the honorary Fellows) 114 centres received Transactions only, or Transactions and Proceedings, in most cases the latter, and 6 received Proceedings only; while in 1853 all the publications distributed were Transactions. I do not pretend to know what the number of centres was at that date, and my first letter made no direct reference to it.

It is evident that Prof. Hagen's statements are very far from proving what he asserted in his former letter, viz. that between 1830 and 1840 Sprengel's discoveries were known to every student in Prusia, and I think it would be easy to any one resident in Germany to prove the contrary by simply confronting what the manuals of botany published at that time say about the fertilisation of flowers. Thus, as I learn from Delpino's \u201cUlteriori Osservazioni\u201d (p. 88), Link (\u201cElem. Philos. Bot.,\u201d ii. 1837, p. 222) and Treviranus (\u201cPhysiol. der Gew.,\u201d ii. 1838, p. 343), both of whom, according to Hagen, were entirely acquainted with Sprengel's discoveries, adopt Cassini's erroneous view of the fertilisation of Campanula being effected through the collecting-hairs of the style instead of through the stigmatic papill\u00e6; and this must have been almost impossible for any one acquainted with Sprengel's excellent account of Campanula rotundifolia (\u201cEntdeckte Geheimniss,\u201d p. 109). What Prof. Kunth, in his lectures at the Berlin University, taught about the fertilisation of flowers may be seen in his \u201cLehrbuch der Botanik\u201d (1847, p. 422). Almost every line contains errors splendidly and convincingly refuted by Sprengel.

It is evident that Prof. Hagen's statements are very far from proving what he asserted in his former letter, viz. that between 1830 and 1840 Sprengel's discoveries were known to every student in Prusia, and I think it would be easy to any one resident in Germany to prove the contrary by simply confronting what the manuals of botany published at that time say about the fertilisation of flowers. Thus, as I learn from Delpino's \u201cUlteriori Osservazioni\u201d (p. 88), Link (\u201cElem. Philos. Bot.,\u201d ii. 1837, p. 222) and Treviranus (\u201cPhysiol. der Gew.,\u201d ii. 1838, p. 343), both of whom, according to Hagen, were entirely acquainted with Sprengel's discoveries, adopt Cassini's erroneous view of the fertilisation of Campanula being effected through the collecting-hairs of the style instead of through the stigmatic papill\u00e6; and this must have been almost impossible for any one acquainted with Sprengel's excellent account of Campanula rotundifolia (\u201cEntdeckte Geheimniss,\u201d p. 109). What Prof. Kunth, in his lectures at the Berlin University, taught about the fertilisation of flowers may be seen in his \u201cLehrbuch der Botanik\u201d (1847, p. 422). Almost every line contains errors splendidly and convincingly refuted by Sprengel. Thus he considers as contrivances serving to aid the self-fertilisation of the flowers the collecting-hairs on the style of Campanulace\u00e6 and Composit\u00e6 (see Sprengel, pp. 109 and 370), the pollen-masses of Orchide\u00e6 and Asclepiade\u00e6 being fixed near the stigma (Sprengel, pp. 401 and 139), the movements of the stamens of Parnassia, Ruta, and Saxifraga (Sprengel, pp. 166, 236, and 242), as well as the movements of the stigmas of Nigella, Passiflora, and Epilobium (Sprengel, p. 280, 160, and 224). I do not know how to reconcile these errors with Prof. Hagen's statement that Kunth was \u201cbeyond doubt acquainted with the facts\u201d discovered by Sprengel. He \u201cbeyond doubt\u201d never read Sprengel's book, and I can explain those numerous and crass errors of one of the most celebrated botanists only by the assumption that at that time Sprengel had fallen into almost complete oblivion among German botanists, and remained so till, as Prof. M\u00f6bius justly remarks (NATURE, vol. xxix. p. 406), \u201cthe value of his treatise in its bearing on the theory of selection was first recognised by Charles Darwin.\u201d","dc.creator":["M\u00dcLLER, FRITZ"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["M\u00dcLLER, FRITZ"],"citation_author_institution":["Blumenau, Santa Catharina, Brazil"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Christian Conrad Sprengel","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Christian Conrad Sprengel&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"030289a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Crookes, Odling, and Tidy, of some experiments which they have made on the vitality of the Bacillus anthracis in water, with regard to which I should like to call attention to the fact that this subject has during the past three years been investigated by various experimenters, including Koch, Cornil, and Babes, Nicati and Rietsch. Within the past two months no less than three papers have been published on this subject, two of them in Germany by Dr. Wolfh\u00fcgel and Meade Bolton respectively, whilst the third, by myself, \u201cOn the Multiplication of Micro-organisms,\u201d was communicated to the Royal Society at the meeting in June last. In this paper I have recorded a number of experiments made both with the mixtures of organisms found in various natural waters, as well as with three well-characterised forms which are associated with disease, viz. Koch's \u201cComma\u201d spirillum of Asiatic cholera, Finkler-Prior's \u201cComma\u201d spirillum of European cholera, and the Bacillus pyocyaneus, which produces the greenish-blue colouring matter frequently present in abscesses. The methods of research which have been independently selected both by Wolfh\u00fcgel, Meade Bolton, and myself, are identical, and consist in the examination, by gelatine platecultivation, of waters purposely impregnated with the organisms in question.

Crookes, Odling, and Tidy, of some experiments which they have made on the vitality of the Bacillus anthracis in water, with regard to which I should like to call attention to the fact that this subject has during the past three years been investigated by various experimenters, including Koch, Cornil, and Babes, Nicati and Rietsch. Within the past two months no less than three papers have been published on this subject, two of them in Germany by Dr. Wolfh\u00fcgel and Meade Bolton respectively, whilst the third, by myself, \u201cOn the Multiplication of Micro-organisms,\u201d was communicated to the Royal Society at the meeting in June last. In this paper I have recorded a number of experiments made both with the mixtures of organisms found in various natural waters, as well as with three well-characterised forms which are associated with disease, viz. Koch's \u201cComma\u201d spirillum of Asiatic cholera, Finkler-Prior's \u201cComma\u201d spirillum of European cholera, and the Bacillus pyocyaneus, which produces the greenish-blue colouring matter frequently present in abscesses. The methods of research which have been independently selected both by Wolfh\u00fcgel, Meade Bolton, and myself, are identical, and consist in the examination, by gelatine platecultivation, of waters purposely impregnated with the organisms in question. This method is obviously the one which most recommends itself for the purpose, as it not only enables one to ascertain the presence or absence of the organisms, but also to quantitatively follow their multiplication or reduction. I may mention that these three organisms present great differences in their behaviour under similar circumstances; thus the Bacillus pyocyaneus is possessed of far greater vitality in water than either of the other two, its presence being demonstrable even in distilled water after fifty-three days, in numbers exceeding manyfold those originally introduced. Koch's \u201cComma\u201d spirillum, on the other hand, was in the purest forms of potable water no longer demonstrable after the ninth day, whilst in London sewage it was found in largely multiplied numbers after twentynine days; whilst Finkler's spirillum could in no case be detected after the first day, and frequently not even on the day of inoculation.

In the first case the effect cannot be due to the surface-tension, which is much diminished by the oil. Has the viscosity of the oil anything to do with it? Also in the case of a soap-bubble, is the effect due to viscosity, and not to surface-tension; and what is the difference between surface-tension and surface-viscosity?

The unit-mass is defined as the mass in which unit-acceleration is produced by unit force, which, of course, gives about 32 pounds as the mass-unit for the British gravitation system.","dc.creator":["SLATE, FREDERICK"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["SLATE, FREDERICK"],"citation_author_institution":["University of California,"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Absolute and Gravitation Systems","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Absolute and Gravitation Systems&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"044518a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This natural order of plants forms the most conspicuous feature in the vegetation of some of the islands, as may be seen in the excellent views illustrating the cruise of the U.S. ship Albatross; yet Darwin, so far as I can discover, is the only naturalist who ever brought away any specimens, or contributed to any more exact knowledge than can be got from photographs on a very small scale. The presence and abundance of Cactace\u00e6 in these islands is highly interesting, especially in relation to the age and origin of the flora, and to the fact that none exist in Juan Fernandez, though they abound in Chili. They are also of great importance to the animal kingdom during long droughts, as they are then the only source of water. As we learn from Darwin, the succulent branches are eagerly devoured by the large tortoises, lizards, and various other animals. He found that lizards four feet in length were easily enticed whenever he threw them a piece of a branch, and small birds would come within a few feet of him and peck at one end whilst a lizard was eating at the other.1 Darwin also regarded the Cactace\u00e6 as a source of food; and it is noteworthy that animals were mainly dependent on the branches broken off by wind. Opuntia galapageia was found by Darwin on James's Island, growing from six to ten feet high, with a trunk a foot in diameter, and so densely covered with strong spines as to be protected from destruction by predatory animals. The younger branches bear only long elastic bristles. Dr. N. J. Andersson, a Swedish botanist, who visited the islands in 1851, states (Eugenies Resa, \u201cBotanik,\u201d p. 95) that this cactus grows in all the islands, and he adds that he observed at least four or five other species, but had not time to collect specimens or to sketch them. In another place (\u201cLinn\u00e6a,\u201d xxxi., 1861\u20132, pp. 571\u2013631) he particularly mentions the Opuntia growing in lava where nothing else would grow, forming huge candelabra-like objects with pretty red, shining fruits. It is evident, too, from the photographic views reproduced in the \u201cGeneral Sketch of the Expedition of the Albatross\u201d that one (or more) species of Cereus attains a height of ten or twelve feet, and is equally prominent in the landscape. Perhaps the next botanist who visits the islands may find time to study the Cactace\u00e6. But when will any Government think it of sufficient importance to attach a really qualified botanist to such expeditions? I ought to add that Dr. Baur is not a botanist, but he appears to have done his best as a botanical collector.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"53","prism.number":"1359","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"31","prism.endingPage":"31","prism.copyright":"1895 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/053031a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/053031a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/053031a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/053031a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Cactace\u00e6 in the Galapagos Islands","citation_volume":"53","citation_issue":"1359","citation_publication_date":"1895/11","citation_firstpage":"31","citation_lastpage":"31","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/053031a0","DOI":"10.1038/053031a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/053031a0","description":"IN my notice (NATURE, p. 623) of Dr. Baur's botanical collections from the Galapagos Islands, I intended to add a few words respecting the Cactace\u00e6, but forgot it at the last moment.

They were related to me by the late Prof. C. J.

On July 23, 1890, I was present at a meeting of the Royal Horticultural Society, at Chiswick, and heard Mr. E. J. Lowe give an interesting address on ferns. In the course of it, he told how he had a great number of varieties of the hart's-tongue fern, which, on changing his place of residence, he moved into new and poorer soil. They all reverted to the typical form, and it was not until they were again transplanted to good soil that they consented to exhibit their varietal characters ! Now in the case of the sheep, the fine wool of the Ohio breed is not a specific character, but a varietal one produced under domestication; and it is not surprising, therefore, that removal to a locality less favourable, and, perhaps, more resembling that of the original type of the species, should produce reversion. But it is probable that, as in the case of Mr. Lowe's ferns, the varietal character could be made to reappear by transference to the former kind of environment. The precise explanation of such facts as these may probably be found in Dr. Weismann's principle of germinal selection, which has surely been more or less understood for a long time. The sheep is born with two or three distinct possibilities, as to its wool; one locality favours one of these possible developments, one another.

It is possible that the pleural ganglion may in most cases be represented by but a few ganglion cells the presence of which is not discernible to the unaided eye.","dc.creator":["LATTER, OSWALD H."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["LATTER, OSWALD H."],"citation_author_institution":["Charterhouse, Godalming"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Nervous System of Anodonta cygnea","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Nervous System of Anodonta cygnea&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"069005c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This activity increased to about three times Its original value in the course of thirty minutes after the removal of the active copper, and then decayed regularly to zero.","dc.creator":["BROOKS, HARRIET"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["BROOKS, HARRIET"],"citation_author_institution":["McGill University, Montreal"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"A Volatile Product from Radium","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;A Volatile Product from Radium&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"070395d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

An explanation has also to be found for the fact, established in the course of this investigation, that if polished iron is immersed in a solution of potassium dichromate, rusting is completely inhibited, and the surface of the metal remains perfectly bright (Dunstan, Jowett, and Goulding, Journ. Chem. Soc., 1905).","dc.creator":["DUNSTAN, WYNDHAM R."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["DUNSTAN, WYNDHAM R."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Rusting of Iron","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Rusting of Iron&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"076222d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

One day when I met him accidentally he told me that he had found a college student who had been a pupil of mine using the word \u201cradial\u201d for a unit-angle, and that, while agreeing with me as to the need of such a word, he had doubts as to the suitability of the terminal syllable. My reply, as may be guessed from my recent communication, was that \u201cradial\u201d, \u201cradian\u201d, \u201crad\u201d, had all something to be said for them, and I referred him to my letter to NATURE dated April 4, 1870. On at least two subsequent occasions we spoke of such things, and he supported the termination -an in this particular case, because of a supposed analogy with the geometrical term \u201cmedian\u201d. All this, you will see, does not preclude the possibility of an independent origination of the term by him in July, 1871, as stated by Mr. Thomson, and I therefore regret that here there is no chance of me having the satisfaction of seeing the printed word in the Calendar of Queen's College, Belfast, for 1873\u20134.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"83","prism.number":"2120","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"459","prism.endingPage":"460","prism.copyright":"1910 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/083459d0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/083459d0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/083459d0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/083459d0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Term \u201cRadian\u201d in Trigonometry","citation_volume":"83","citation_issue":"2120","citation_publication_date":"1910/06","citation_firstpage":"459","citation_lastpage":"460","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/083459d0","DOI":"10.1038/083459d0","citation_doi":"10.1038/083459d0","description":"NATURE of April 21, containing Mr. Thomson's letter, has just reached me, and I hasten to say that, had I known that his father had ever claimed to have originated the word \u201cradian\u201d I should, of course, have mentioned the claim in my communication to NATURE of April 7.

All this, you will see, does not preclude the possibility of an independent origination of the term by him in July, 1871, as stated by Mr. Thomson, and I therefore regret that here there is no chance of me having the satisfaction of seeing the printed word in the Calendar of Queen's College, Belfast, for 1873\u20134.","dc.creator":["MUIR, THOS."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MUIR, THOS."],"citation_author_institution":["Cape Town, South Africa"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Term \u201cRadian\u201d in Trigonometry","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Term &#8220;Radian&#8221; in Trigonometry&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"083460b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

So, too, would a deeper bank which had been raised to a similar level by the raining down upon it of pelagic organisms, if it can be shown that such action is capable of producing any considerable thicknesses of rock.

We used positron emission tomography with [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to quantify regional cerebral glucose metabolism, an index of brain function, during performance of a vigilance task. A total of 10 methamphetamine-dependent subjects were tested after 5\u20139 days of abstinence, and after 4 additional weeks of supervised abstinence. A total of 12 healthy control subjects were tested at corresponding times. Global glucose metabolism increased between tests (P=0.01), more in methamphetamine-dependent (10.9%, P=0.02) than control subjects (1.9%, NS). Glucose metabolism did not change in subcortical regions of methamphetamine-dependent subjects, but increased in neocortex, with maximal increase (>20%) in parietal regions. Changes in reaction time and self-reports of negative affect varied more in methamphetamine-dependent than in control subjects, and correlated both with the increase in parietal glucose metabolism, and decrease in relative activity (after scaling to the global mean) in some regions.

We used positron emission tomography with [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to quantify regional cerebral glucose metabolism, an index of brain function, during performance of a vigilance task. A total of 10 methamphetamine-dependent subjects were tested after 5\u20139 days of abstinence, and after 4 additional weeks of supervised abstinence. A total of 12 healthy control subjects were tested at corresponding times. Global glucose metabolism increased between tests (P=0.01), more in methamphetamine-dependent (10.9%, P=0.02) than control subjects (1.9%, NS). Glucose metabolism did not change in subcortical regions of methamphetamine-dependent subjects, but increased in neocortex, with maximal increase (>20%) in parietal regions. Changes in reaction time and self-reports of negative affect varied more in methamphetamine-dependent than in control subjects, and correlated both with the increase in parietal glucose metabolism, and decrease in relative activity (after scaling to the global mean) in some regions. A robust relationship between change in self-reports of depressive symptoms and relative activity in the ventral striatum may have great relevance to treatment success because of the role of this region in drug abuse-related behaviors. Shifts in cortical\u2013subcortical metabolic balance either reflect new processes that occur during early abstinence, or the unmasking of effects of chronic methamphetamine abuse that are obscured by suppression of cortical glucose metabolism that continues for at least 5\u20139 days after cessation of methamphetamine self-administration.","dc.creator":["Berman, S M","Voytek, B","Mandelkern, M A","Hassid, B D","Isaacson, A","Monterosso, J","Miotto, K","Ling, W","London, E D"],"dc.subject":["Medicine/Public Health, general","Psychiatry","Neurosciences","Behavioral Sciences","Pharmacotherapy","Biological Psychology"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Arch Gen Psychiatry;

We conclude that mycorrhizal fungi have evolved to be multi-genomic.","dc.creator":["Kuhn, Gerrit","Hijri, Mohamed","Sanders, Ian R."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=Contemplating life without sex.; citation_author=J Maynard Smith; citation_volume=324; citation_publication_date=1986; citation_pages=300-301; citation_doi=10.1038/324300a0; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Science; citation_title=Evidence for the evolution of bdelloid rotifers without sexual reproduction or genetic exchange.; citation_author=DM Welch, M Meselson; citation_volume=288; citation_publication_date=2000; citation_pages=1211-1215; citation_doi=10.1126/science.288.5469.1211; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Trends Ecol.

The same timescale can be identified in a dipole-like pattern of North Atlantic sea-level pressure variability1,7,12. We propose a mechanism which may connect these oceanic and atmospheric fluctuations, possibly as part of a coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere mode of variability7. Our results are encouraging for the prospects of forecasting natural fluctuations in the climate of the North Atlantic region several years in advance.","dc.creator":["Sutton, R. T.","Allen, M.

Our findings indicate that these 'non-climatic' changes have a systematic effect that overwhelms the reported difference in trends and therefore calls Kalnay and Cai's central conclusion into question.","dc.creator":["Vose, Russell S.","Karl, Thomas R.","Easterling, David R.","Williams, Claude N.","Menne, Matthew J."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_author=E Kalnay, M Cai; citation_volume=423; citation_publication_date=2003; citation_pages=528-531; citation_doi=10.1038/nature01675; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=J.

No athlete wants an inside lane in the 200-metre sprint. To compensate for an increase in effective body weight as body mass is propelled around a sharp bend, a sprinter increases the time that each foot spends on the ground, and runs more slowly. Canine bend runners suffer no such problem. The limbs of greyhounds withstand forces much higher than those experienced by human athletes by keeping foot-contact times constant. Unlike humans, greyhounds power locomotion by torque about the hips \u2014 human cyclists do the same \u2014 so the muscles providing the power are independent of the weight-supporting structures. Maximum running speed is constrained by the speed at which the limbs can be swung forwards and backwards, and by the force they can withstand while in contact with the ground. Humans sprinting around banked bends change the duration of foot contact to spread the time over which the load is applied, thereby keeping the force on their legs constant1. We show here that, on entering a tight bend, greyhounds do not change their foot-contact timings, and so have to withstand a 65% increase in limb forces. This supports the idea that greyhounds power locomotion by torque about the hips, so \u2014 just as in cycling humans \u2014 the muscles that provide the power are mechanically divorced from the structures that support weight.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.publicationDate":"2005-12-07","prism.volume":"438","prism.number":"7069","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"753","prism.endingPage":"754","prism.copyright":"2005 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/438753a","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/438753a","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/438753a.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/438753a","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"No force limit on greyhound sprint speed","citation_volume":"438","citation_issue":"7069","citation_publication_date":"2005/12","citation_online_date":"2005/12/07","citation_firstpage":"753","citation_lastpage":"754","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/438753a","DOI":"10.1038/438753a","citation_doi":"10.1038/438753a","description":"Unlike human athletes, these dogs do not need to slow down when racing round a tight bend.

Unlike humans, greyhounds power locomotion by torque about the hips \u2014 human cyclists do the same \u2014 so the muscles providing the power are independent of the weight-supporting structures. Maximum running speed is constrained by the speed at which the limbs can be swung forwards and backwards, and by the force they can withstand while in contact with the ground. Humans sprinting around banked bends change the duration of foot contact to spread the time over which the load is applied, thereby keeping the force on their legs constant1. We show here that, on entering a tight bend, greyhounds do not change their foot-contact timings, and so have to withstand a 65% increase in limb forces. This supports the idea that greyhounds power locomotion by torque about the hips, so \u2014 just as in cycling humans \u2014 the muscles that provide the power are mechanically divorced from the structures that support weight.","dc.creator":["Usherwood, James R.","Wilson, Alan M."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=J.

The effect relies on the Rabi oscillations of two polariton polarized fields excited by two counter-polarized and delayed pulses. The superposition of the oscillating fields result in the precession of the Stokes vector of the emitted light while polariton lifetime imbalance results in its drift from a circle of controllable radius on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere to a single point at long times. The positioning of the initial circle and final point allows to engineer the type of polarization spanning, including a full sweeping of the Poincar\u00e9 sphere. The universality and simplicity of the scheme should allow for the deployment of time-varying full-Poincar\u00e9 polarization fields in a variety of platforms, timescales, and regimes. An international team has generated light pulses whose polarization varies in time over selected areas of the Poincar\u00e9 sphere. Beam shaping generally involves tailoring the phase and amplitude of a beam, but to fully exploit the vectorial nature of light it is desirable to extend this degree of control to polarization. Lorenzo Dominici and co-workers theoretically propose a new type of pulsed polarized light\u2014one that adopts all polarization states during the pulse duration.

The effect relies on the Rabi oscillations of two polariton polarized fields excited by two counter-polarized and delayed pulses. The superposition of the oscillating fields result in the precession of the Stokes vector of the emitted light while polariton lifetime imbalance results in its drift from a circle of controllable radius on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere to a single point at long times. The positioning of the initial circle and final point allows to engineer the type of polarization spanning, including a full sweeping of the Poincar\u00e9 sphere. The universality and simplicity of the scheme should allow for the deployment of time-varying full-Poincar\u00e9 polarization fields in a variety of platforms, timescales, and regimes. An international team has generated light pulses whose polarization varies in time over selected areas of the Poincar\u00e9 sphere. Beam shaping generally involves tailoring the phase and amplitude of a beam, but to fully exploit the vectorial nature of light it is desirable to extend this degree of control to polarization. Lorenzo Dominici and co-workers theoretically propose a new type of pulsed polarized light\u2014one that adopts all polarization states during the pulse duration. They then demonstrate it experimentally in a semiconductor microcavity that has strong exciton\u2013photon coupling. Since the mechanism is based on a ubiquitous effect of light\u2013matter interactions, namely Rabi oscillations, it can be realized in both classical and quantum regimes as well as on various platforms and time scales. It can also be extended to non-optical systems.","dc.creator":["Colas, David","Dominici, Lorenzo","Donati, Stefano","Pervishko, Anastasiia A","Liew, Timothy CH","Shelykh, Ivan A","Ballarini, Dario","de Giorgi, Milena","Bramati, Alberto","Gigli, Giuseppe","Valle, Elena del","Laussy, Fabrice P","Kavokin, Alexey V","Sanvitto, Daniele"],"dc.subject":["Polaritons","Ultrafast photonics"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Opt Lett;

Potential applications include enhanced light harvesting for solar cells and improved photocatalysis.","dc.creator":["Wang, Lei","Chen, Qi-Dai","Cao, Xiao-Wen","Buividas, Ri\u010dardas","Wang, Xuewen","Juodkazis, Saulius","Sun, Hong-Bo"],"dc.subject":["Laser material processing","Nonlinear optics"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=Surface plasmon subwavelength optics; citation_author=WL Barnes, A Dereux, TW Ebbesen; citation_volume=424; citation_publication_date=2003; citation_pages=824-830; citation_doi=10.1038/nature01937; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Sci Rep; citation_title=Magnetic light; citation_author=AI Kuznetsov, AE Miroshnichenko, YH Fu, JB Zhang, B Luk'Yanchuk; citation_volume=2; citation_publication_date=2012; citation_pages=492; citation_doi=10.1038/srep00492; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Science; citation_title=Light propagation with phase discontinuities: generalized laws of reflection and refraction; citation_author=NF Yu, P Genevet, MA Kats, F Aieta, JP Tetienne; citation_volume=334; citation_publication_date=2011; citation_pages=333-337; citation_doi=10.1126/science.1210713; citation_id=CR3","citation_journal_title=Science; citation_title=Dielectric gradient metasurface optical elements; citation_author=DM Lin, PY Fan, E Hasman, ML Brongersma; citation_volume=345; citation_publication_date=2014; citation_pages=298-302; citation_doi=10.1126/science.1253213; citation_id=CR4","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=Three-dimensional optical metamaterial with a negative refractive index; citation_author=J Valentine, S Zhang, T Zentgraf, E Ulin-Avila, DA Genov; citation_volume=455; citation_publication_date=2008; citation_pages=376-379; citation_doi=10.1038/nature07247; citation_id=CR5","citation_journal_title=Science; citation_title=A hybridization model for the plasmon response of complex nanostructures; citation_author=E Prodan, C Radloff, NJ Halas, P Nordlander; citation_volume=302; citation_publication_date=2003; citation_pages=419-422; citation_doi=10.1126/science.1089171; citation_id=CR6","citation_journal_title=Science; citation_title=Optically resonant dielectric nanostructures; citation_author=AI Kuznetsov, AE Miroshnichenko, ML Brongersma, YS Kivshar, B Lukyanchuk; citation_volume=354; citation_publication_date=2016; citation_pages=aag2472; citation_doi=10.1126/science.aag2472; citation_id=CR7","citation_journal_title=Light Sci Appl; citation_title=Excitation and propagation of surface plasmon polaritons on a non-structured surface with a permittivity gradient; citation_author=X Wang, Y Deng, QT Li, YJ Huang, ZL Gong; citation_volume=5; citation_publication_date=2016; citation_pages=e16179; citation_doi=10.1038/lsa.2016.179; citation_id=CR8","citation_journal_title=J Appl Phys; citation_title=Semiconductor surface damage produced by ruby lasers; citation_author=M Birnbaum; citation_volume=36; citation_publication_date=1966; citation_pages=3688-3689; citation_doi=10.1063/1.1703071; citation_id=CR9","citation_journal_title=Phys Rev B; citation_title=Growth of spontaneous periodic surface structures on solids during laser illumination; citation_author=GS Zhou, PM Fauchet, AE Siegman; citation_volume=26; citation_publication_date=1982; citation_pages=5366-5381; citation_doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.26.5366; citation_id=CR10","citation_journal_title=Phys Rev B; citation_title=Laser-induced periodic surface structure.

Schilling1 gives geochemical data which indicate that the incompatible elements TiO2, P2O5, K2O and La decrease regularly southwards from Iceland along the Reykjanes Ridge axis to about 61\u00b0 N. The rare earth element pattern for Icelandic tholeiites shows a high normalised La/Sm ratio which steadily decreases to less than 1 along the ridge.
