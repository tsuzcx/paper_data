I began to notice the existence of a zodiacal light. Some time later, probably about 6.40, it was considerably brighter than any portion of the galaxy in sight at the time, though this might not have been the impression of an inattentive spectator, as the gradual melting away of its edges produced much less contrast with the ground of the sky than the better denned outline of the Milky Way. Its light was, in fact, so imperceptibly diffused that it was impossible to fix its boundaries or extent with any accuracy. Its general position was, however, undoubtedly a Utile below the square of Pegasus (where its upper edge fell short of \u03b1 and \u03b3), and beneath the three stars of Aries; but its light was here so enfeebled that its termination was quite uncertain, and it could only be said that the direction of its axis was towards the Pleiades. Its breadth where most brilliant, near Pegasus, might probably be estimated at 8\u00b0 or 9\u00b0, from comparison with the distance from \u03b1 to \u03b2, and with the length of the belt of Orion; but this determination was liable to great uncertainty. It was thought to show a ruddy tinge, not unlike the commencement of a crimson Aurora Borealis; this may have been a deception, but it was certainly redder or yellower than the galaxy. At 7 I examined it with a little pocket spectroscope, which shows very distinctly the greenish band of the aurora; but nothing of the kind was visible, nor could anything be traced beyond a slight increase of general light, which, in closing the slit, was extinguished long before the auroral band would have become imperceptible. It was still visible at 8.30.

P. Oliver, appears to have been mistaken as to the character of the phenomenon seen by him on February 5, and noticed in NATURE (vol. ix. p. 313). At the hour he has indicated, the somewhat rare phenomenon an auroral arch was formed, which remained visible for about half an hour, and is doubtless the luminous \u201cmeteor cloud\u201d seen by him. The description Captain Oliver has given of it is sufficiently accurate, though he does not mention that it drifted slowly southward, a well-known characteristic of the phenomenon. Its direction was of course at right angles to the magnetic meridian, and its position in the heavens, as seen from this locality, was more northward than that observed by your correspondent. During the whole time that I observed it, the arch crossed some portion of the constellation Ursa Major, the star \u03b4 Urs\u00e6 Majoris being in its midst when first seen, and the entire arch having retreated southward as far as \u03b6 Urs\u00e6 Majoris before it disappeared. It was of uniform breadth and intensity, and spanned the sky from west to east (magnetic), passing not much to the north of the zenith.

P. Oliver, appears to have been mistaken as to the character of the phenomenon seen by him on February 5, and noticed in NATURE (vol. ix. p. 313). At the hour he has indicated, the somewhat rare phenomenon an auroral arch was formed, which remained visible for about half an hour, and is doubtless the luminous \u201cmeteor cloud\u201d seen by him. The description Captain Oliver has given of it is sufficiently accurate, though he does not mention that it drifted slowly southward, a well-known characteristic of the phenomenon. Its direction was of course at right angles to the magnetic meridian, and its position in the heavens, as seen from this locality, was more northward than that observed by your correspondent. During the whole time that I observed it, the arch crossed some portion of the constellation Ursa Major, the star \u03b4 Urs\u00e6 Majoris being in its midst when first seen, and the entire arch having retreated southward as far as \u03b6 Urs\u00e6 Majoris before it disappeared. It was of uniform breadth and intensity, and spanned the sky from west to east (magnetic), passing not much to the north of the zenith. Although I have been fortunate enough to have seen auroral arches upon several occasions, and once succeeded in obtaining the spectrum, I have never seen a brighter or more complete arch than this one; but what made it quite unique, at least as far as my experience goes, was the fact that the ordinary aurora with a well-defined \u201cdark segment\u201d was visible in the north-north-west at the same time, from which, at an earlier period, brilliant streamers had proceeded.

Last summer I spent a considerable time in attempting to find this out, but without success. In every flower which I gathered in the mature state, I found the style broken off at the articulation immediately above the ovary, as if to prevent the possibility of fertilisation after a certain period.

Last summer I spent a considerable time in attempting to find this out, but without success. In every flower which I gathered in the mature state, I found the style broken off at the articulation immediately above the ovary, as if to prevent the possibility of fertilisation after a certain period.

If Mr. Smyth will refer to Prof. Loomis's chart of magnetic oscillations given in Prof. Balfour Stewart's paper on the subject in NATURE (vol. xvi. p. 10), he will see that there are exactly seven minimum-periods from 1787 to 1871, the mean of which is twelve years; the mean of the seven corresponding maximum-periods is 11.8 years.

PIAZZI SMYTH will no doubt welcome from any quarter a satisfactory answer to his question about the discrepancy between Dr. Wolf's sun-spot period, 11.1 years, and the supposed 10.5 years' period for the magnetic needle. If Mr. Smyth will refer to Prof. Loomis's chart of magnetic oscillations given in Prof. Balfour Stewart's paper on the subject in NATURE (vol. xvi. p. 10), he will see that there are exactly seven minimum-periods from 1787 to 1871, the mean of which is twelve years; the mean of the seven corresponding maximum-periods is 11.8 years. The true magnetic declination-period is then the mean of these, viz., 11.9 years. In exactly the same manner I have found that the mean period of sun-spots is 11.9 years.

Suppose, now, one only of these streams of motion to be flowing past the section, the rate of transference of momentum being 1/2 e E, where e is the geometrical ratio of extension, or the strain. The rate of transference of energy remains to be calculated. The material may be either at rest or in motion. In fact whether it is to be considered at rest, or at what velocity it is to be considered moving, depends altogether upon the set of bodies relatively to which the motion is to be measured. Its relative velocity may also be either uniform or variable. The relative velocity of the centre of inertia of the material lying between two given sections will be uniform if the whole of the motion measured in any quantitative way flowing in through one of these sections is equal to that simultaneously flowing out at the other.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"19","prism.number":"481","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"242","prism.endingPage":"244","prism.copyright":"1879 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/019242d0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/019242d0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/019242d0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/019242d0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Force and Energy1","citation_volume":"19","citation_issue":"481","citation_publication_date":"1879/01","citation_firstpage":"242","citation_lastpage":"244","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/019242d0","DOI":"10.1038/019242d0","citation_doi":"10.1038/019242d0","description":"IN consequence of energy not being a directed quantity we come at once upon an important distinction between transference of energy and transference of momentum.

Suppose, now, one only of these streams of motion to be flowing past the section, the rate of transference of momentum being 1/2 e E, where e is the geometrical ratio of extension, or the strain. The rate of transference of energy remains to be calculated. The material may be either at rest or in motion. In fact whether it is to be considered at rest, or at what velocity it is to be considered moving, depends altogether upon the set of bodies relatively to which the motion is to be measured. Its relative velocity may also be either uniform or variable. The relative velocity of the centre of inertia of the material lying between two given sections will be uniform if the whole of the motion measured in any quantitative way flowing in through one of these sections is equal to that simultaneously flowing out at the other.","dc.creator":["SMITH, ROBERT H."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["SMITH, ROBERT H."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Force and Energy1","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Force and...","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"019315c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Some years ago I was overlooking a penguin \u201crookery\u201d as it is called, at the Falklands, and watching the goings on of the numerous colony below me. It was breeding season, and the birds were sitting on their eggs on the bare earth, crowded together with hardly walking room between them.

Some years ago I was overlooking a penguin \u201crookery\u201d as it is called, at the Falklands, and watching the goings on of the numerous colony below me. It was breeding season, and the birds were sitting on their eggs on the bare earth, crowded together with hardly walking room between them. Amongst the birds stepped a pretty Sheath-bill (Chionis alba) with a quiet jaunty stride, picking what he could, and apparently perfectly indifferent to the motions of the penguins, who drove at him with their beaks as he passed, but never struck him.

His statement, however, that ice could be raised to a temperature of 180\u00b0 without melting was so amazing that many a one could not accept it without repeating the experiments. Soon after the first short notice of Dr. Carnelley appeared in NATURE we took up the matter, but as the method used by Dr. Carnelley seemed to us to be somewhat troublesome, we made use of quite a different method. In the axis of a glass tube A B, 16 mm. in diameter, and 56 c.m. in length was fixed a thermometer t by means of two strips s s of elastic brass sheet. One of the ends of the tube was 22 mm. in diameter, while the other end had the shape of a bulb, and was drawn out in a narrow tube, a b, about 50 c.m. in length. The tube was placed in an inclined position with the end b in a glass filled with water that was kept boiling. The bottom of the glass was covered with a layer of mercury. Next the tube was heated by a Bunsen burner; a part of the air was driven out, and, after retiring the burner, the tube was partly filled with the boiling water of the glass. The water in the tube was then boiled, a still greater part of the air escaped, and by removing the burner the tube filled itself nearly entirely. The heating and cooling were repeated three or four times, and in this manner the tube could be filled with the boiling water, not a single air-bubble being left. The end b of the narrow tube was now dipped in the mercury, and by heating the tube so much of the water was driven out that the remainder filled the enlarged part A for three-fourths. The tube being now slowly cooled, the mercury rose in the tube a b, and it was very easy to seal the tube at a with the blowpipe. The water in A was now frozen, and by gently warming with the hand the ice-cylinder was loosened from the tube; by inverting the tube the molten ice was brought into the bulb B, where it was fixed by freezing. This part of the process presents some difficulty. When the heating by the hand was not stopped in time, too much of the ice was converted into water. However, by placing the bulb B in a freezing mixture of snow and salt the melting can be almost instantly arrested. The bulb of the thermometer being in this way surrounded with an ice cylinder 12 mm. in diameter, the bulb B had only to be placed in the freezing mixture to have the apparatus ready for the appliance of heat. The results of our experiments confirm those of Dr. Carnelley, inasmuch as the ice did not melt, notwithstanding the heating of the tube at A was in one instance so strong that the glass was softened and gave way to the external pressure of the air. They differ, however, as regards the temperature of the ice, which remained generally at \u20137\u00b0. By very strong heating the thermometer rose to 0\u00b0, but never exceeded thai point; when, not, the bulb of the thermometer, by the volatilising of the ice, was partly laid bare. As it appears by the detailed description of Dr. Carnelley's experiments in NATURE, vol. xxiii. p. 341, that the success depends for a great part on the size of the condenser, we have made another apparatus with a condenser of half a litre; the results we may obtain therewith will be related shortly.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"24","prism.number":"601","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"4","prism.endingPage":"5","prism.copyright":"1881 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/024004b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/024004b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/024004b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/024004b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Hot Ice","citation_volume":"24","citation_issue":"601","citation_publication_date":"1881/05","citation_firstpage":"4","citation_lastpage":"5","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/024004b0","DOI":"10.1038/024004b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/024004b0","description":"THAT the experiments of Dr. Carnelley on hot ice have excited much interest is not to be wondered at.

In this you are quite right, but I do not think you are right in estimating that this air was saturated at a certain height above Ben Nevis. The fact is this: the increase of temperature from a certain height above sea-level to the latter being de facto much less than the dynamical increase of a stratum of air, due to compression sinking down, a downward current of air will be generally warm, and relatively dry. It does not matter if it sinks along the slopes of mountains (as the foehn), or vertically, as modern meteorology considers it to be the case in anticyclones.

In this you are quite right, but I do not think you are right in estimating that this air was saturated at a certain height above Ben Nevis. The fact is this: the increase of temperature from a certain height above sea-level to the latter being de facto much less than the dynamical increase of a stratum of air, due to compression sinking down, a downward current of air will be generally warm, and relatively dry. It does not matter if it sinks along the slopes of mountains (as the foehn), or vertically, as modern meteorology considers it to be the case in anticyclones. There is only one great difference the air currents down a slope may be, and often are, very violent, and only when they are so, their relative heat and dryness are felt, while the downward currents in an anticyclone are so gentle that they are seldom felt or directly registered, and that mostly the thermometer and hygrometer are our only means of detecting them.

But each successive inferior stratum moves with less velocity. And thus they must tend to retard the superior strata with which they may be assumed to be in contact.

GLAZEBROOK, in commenting at the Physical Society on my use of Kohlrausch's meter-bridge with the telephone for the measurement of the resistance of the human body, suggested that the latter instrument was too sensitive, and that from self-induction perfect silence could not be obtained.

When the peculiarity first appeared I can not myself say, but I noticed it first at 10.43 when I went out to look for the almost invisible moon with the aid of a good opera-glass. In the accompanying diagram, which I have constructed from the data given in the almanacs, the moon is represented as just having emerged slightly from the shadow at 10.50 or so, when the peculiarity showed very distinctly, the moon having the appearance which is roughly represented in the diagram, being apparently divided into two halves by a tolerably distinct line of demarcation (b c) running north and south (or towards the celestial pole), the right hand or westerly half appealing much darker than the left or easterly half. It is evident that an appearance like this, so striking when once noticed, could be produced in two ways, first, by the western hemisphere of the moon being actually darker than the left or eastern half; in which case the moon would have exhibited this appearance more or less throughout totality; but it did not, as I noticed nothing of the sort at 10.15, when looking through the same glasses, so that the second explanation must be resorted to. In the diagram the larger outer circle represents the border of the earth's shadow (in the case of this eclipse about 5750 miles in diameter) which is cast by the earth, irrespective of its atmosphere. The inner circle represents the border of an inner and darker shadow of the earth, cast by those of the sun's rays which succeed in being refracted or bent round through our atmosphere (the amount of bending of the light extending to a maximum of about 70\u2032 in the lowest strata of the atmosphere). Into this inner circle, in this case about 2525 miles in diameter at the distance of the moon, no rays of light can stray except those which are scattered by our atmosphere as a sun-illumined envelope. It is now very evident that the position of the dark patch bordered by the line (b-c) and lying partly over the western half of the moon, with respect to the earth's shadow, is very anomalous. If the line (b c) had been curved concentrically to the centre of the shadow, it would have been less surprising. The only way in which it can be accounted for is by supposing the earth's atmosphere to have been very opaque about the regions of the earth within the Arctic circle, allowing very little light, if any, to be refracted, and, tracing southwards that meridian along which the moon would be setting at the time, the atmosphere getting clearer and clearer, first in the upper strata and then in the lowest as we go southwards, until the equator is nearly reached. At 10.50 the moon would be illuminated by solar rays refracted by the earth's atmosphere and tangential to the earth's surface along the meridian 105\u00b0 east of Greenwich (or thereabouts), which passes through Irkutsk (in Siberia), Mongolia, Tonquin, and Siam, along which line the inhabitants would see the moon going down inveiled in its mysterious obscurity. It would be interesting to know whether any observers noticed, at about the middle of the eclipse, any contrast between the inner and darker shadow, in which the moon would be largely immersed, and the outer regions of the shadow which are illuminated dimly by both refracted and scattered light. The unusual darkness of this eclipse, surprising, as it must have done, all spectators, must be taken as a strong indication of great opacity in our atmosphere. Another noticeable feature was the unsymmetrical appearance of the illuminated crescent at 10.50, when the northern cusp (b) exhibited a bluish-white, shading off gradually from the brilliant white to the obscurity of the shadow, while the other cusp seemed quite sharp and distinct. Observing the eclipse both with the naked eye and through a 41/2\u2033 equatorial, neither my fellow observers nor myself noticed any other indication of a blue fringe than that appearing just at b, which seemed to me therefore to be a real appearance, and not a subjective effect of contrast, as there was not complementary copper colour anywhere on the moon sufficiently strong to suggest the blue, and if there had been I ought to have noticed the blue fringe all along the edge of the shadow bordering on the crescent, but it appeared to me of a neutral grey.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"30","prism.number":"783","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"632","prism.endingPage":"633","prism.copyright":"1884 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/030632c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/030632c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/030632c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/030632c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Recent Lunar Eclipse","citation_volume":"30","citation_issue":"783","citation_publication_date":"1884/10","citation_firstpage":"632","citation_lastpage":"633","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/030632c0","DOI":"10.1038/030632c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/030632c0","description":"I WONDER whether any of the readers of NATURE who were witnesses to the almost total annihilation of the moon on Saturday night, October 4, noticed a rather strange peculiarity which was visible at about 10.50 p.m., both before and after second internal contact with shadow.

Then, p. 18, col. 2, F.: \u201cThe breadth of the fall, as it runs in a semicircle, is reckoned to be about 6 arpents. The island is in the middle of the fall, and from it to each side is almost the same breadth\u201d (barely 350 feet then, but in his engraving not half that). \u201cThe breadth of the island at its lower end is two-thirds of an arpent or thereabouts.\u201d His view makes it but one-third the height, i.e., one-third of \u201c137 feet.\u201d","dc.creator":["GARBETT, E.

Examination of oysters from the Firth of Forth has convinced me that this statement is erroneous. I do not know on what evidence the current belief of conchologists is founded.

I have never seen a young oyster in the attached condition: Huxley states that it is the left valve which is fixed; in papers on the embryology of the oyster I have not yet been able to find any definite information on the point. Whether it is the right or left valve that becomes attached when the larva assumes the sessile condition I cannot therefore say of my own knowledge, but with regard to the adult oyster it seems to me certain that the current belief is caused by the repetition of an error.

These volcanic cones are situated in two localities especially: in Mandricirano, on the western side of Lake Itasy, and in the neighbourhood of Betafo in Vakin Ankaratra; the former being from 50 to 60 miles west, and the latter from 70 to 80 miles south-west, of Antananarivo, the capital. Both localities are about 130 miles from the sea on the eastern side of the island, and 150 on the western side. It is hardly necessary to say that all these volcanoes are extinct, and that there are none in activity at the present time in any part of Madagascar.1 On the west side of Itasy the volcanic cones exist in great numbers, and these, therefore, shall be first described.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"33","prism.number":"853","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"415","prism.endingPage":"417","prism.copyright":"1886 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/033415a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/033415a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/033415a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/033415a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Notes on the Volcanic Phenomena of Central Madagascar","citation_volume":"33","citation_issue":"853","citation_publication_date":"1886/03","citation_firstpage":"415","citation_lastpage":"417","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/033415a0","DOI":"10.1038/033415a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/033415a0","description":"MADAGASCAR is as yet almost a terra incognita to the geologist; nothing, so far as I am aware, but notices of the most vague and fragmentary kind ever having appeared in regard to its geological features.

In the first instance Mr. Galton understood Prof. Max M\u00fcller to have argued that in no individual human mind can any process of thought be ever conducted without the mental rehearsal of words, or the verbum mentale of the Schoolmen. Now, although this is the view which certainly appears to pervade the Professor's work on \u201cThe Science of Thought,\u201d there is one passage in that work, and several passages in his subsequent correspondence with Mr. Galton, which express quite a different view\u2014namely, that when a definite structure of conceptual ideation has been built up by the aid of words, it may afterwards persist independently of such aid; the scaffolding was required for the original construction of the edifice, but not for its subsequent stability. That these two views are widely different may be shown by taking any one of the illustrations from the NATURE correspondence. In answer to Mr. Galton, Prof. Max M\u00fcller says, \u201cIt is quite possible that you may teach deaf-and-dumb people dominoes; but deaf-and-dumb people, left to themselves, do not invent dominoes, and that makes a great difference. Even so simple a game as dominoes would be impossible without names and their underlying concepts.\u201d Now, assuredly it does \u201cmake a great difference\u201d whether we are supporting the view that dominoes could not be played without names underlying concepts, or the view that without such means dominoes could not have been invented. That there cannot be concepts without names is a well-recognized doctrine of psychology, and that dominoes could not have been invented in the absence of certain simple concepts relating to number no one could well dispute. But when the game has been invented, there is no need to fall back upon names and concepts as a preliminary to each move, or for the player to predicate to himself before each move that the number he lays down corresponds with the number to which he joins it. The late Dr. Carpenter assured me that he had personally investigated the case of a performing dog which was exhibited many years ago as a domino-player, and had fully satisfied himself that the animal's skill in this respect was genuine\u2014i.e. not dependent on any code of signals from the showman. This, therefore, is a better case than that of the deaf-mute, in order to show that dominoes can be played by means of sensuous association alone. But my point now is that two distinct questions have been raised in your columns, and that the ambiguity to which I have referred appears to have arisen from a failure to distinguish between them. Every living psychologist will doubtless agree with Prof. Max M\u00fcller where he appears to say nothing more than that if there had never been any names there could never have been any concepts; but this is a widely different thing from saying what he elsewhere appears to say, i.e. that without the mental rehearsal of words there cannot be performed in any case a process of distinctively human thought. The first of these two widely different questions may be dismissed, as one concerning which no difference of opinion is likely to arise. Touching the second, if the Professor does not mean what I have said he appears in some places to say, it is a pity that he should attempt to defend such a position as that chess, for instance, cannot be played unless the player \u201cdeals all the time with thought-words and word-thoughts.\u201d For the original learning of the game it was necessary that the powers of the various pieces should have been explained to him by means of words; but when this knowledge was thus gained, it was no longer needful that before making any particular move he should mentally state the powers of all the pieces concerned, or predicate to himself the various possibilities which the move might involve. All these things he does by his specially-formed associations alone, just as does a draught-player, who is concerned with a much simpler order of relations: in neither case is any demand made upon the verbum mentale.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"36","prism.number":"921","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"171","prism.endingPage":"172","prism.copyright":"1887 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/036171d0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/036171d0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/036171d0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/036171d0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Thought without Words","citation_volume":"36","citation_issue":"921","citation_publication_date":"1887/06","citation_firstpage":"171","citation_lastpage":"172","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/036171d0","DOI":"10.1038/036171d0","citation_doi":"10.1038/036171d0","description":"THERE appears to be some ambiguity about this matter as discussed in the correspondence which has recently taken place in your columns.

For more than a month, i.e. from June 1 to July 12, we watched them here. On the fine evenings about forty of them (the males I believe), ascended high into the air at about 9 o'clock, and after wheeling about for a minute or two, screaming loudly, fled straight away, sometimes in one direction, sometimes in another.

My apology for thus trespassing upon valuable space is my desire to meet Mr. Dodgson's natural wish, and by pointing out what I thought were faults in his \u201cinteresting\u201d brochure, to enable him to make it more perfect in after editions.","dc.creator":["TUCKER, R."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["TUCKER, R."],"citation_author_institution":["University College School,"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Mr. Dodgson on Parallels","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Mr. Dodgson on Parallels&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"039197c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Supposing the attacks of the insects to be constant, trees in their evolution would have to adapt themselves to these circumstances, just as they have adapted themselves to the environment of soil, air, light, wind, and so forth. But the fallacy (as it seems to me) of Mr. Wetterhan's argument lies in the supposition that the life of an oak-tree as such, and the life of an insect, may rightly be compared. A tree is really a sort of socialistic community of plants, which continually die and are supplanted by fresh. Bud-variation is a well-known thing, and in oaks A. de Candolle found many variations on the same tree. Now is it unreasonable to suppose that internal-feeding insects might take advantage of such variation\u2014or rather, be obliged to take advantage of it, if it were in a direction to benefit the tree? I will give two purely hypothetical instances, to illustrate the points involved. Imagine two oak-trees, each with three branches, and each attacked by three internal-feeding insects. The insects infesting one tree are borers; those on the other tree are gall-makers. The borers bore into the branches, which they kill while undergoing their transformations: the tree possibly does not die that year, but next year the progeny of the three, being more numerous while the tree is weaker, effect its destruction, and finally the insects perish for want of food. On the other tree, the gall-makers do no appreciable damage, and the tree is able to support them and their progeny without great difficulty. Now a little consideration will show that the longer the life and the slower the reproduction of the trees, the greater will be the contrast. If the plant infested by the borers had been an annual herb, it might have contrived to perfect its seeds, and the death of the old stem would be but a natural and inevitable process, and fresh plants might have been produced in sufficient numbers to continue the species in spite of all insect attacks. But in the case of trees\u2014oak-trees especially, the rate of growth and reproduction is such that, unless the insect-borers can live in galls, they will destroy the plants entirely, and themselves in consequence. Indeed, I have no doubt, that if all the gall-makers now existing could suddenly be transformed into stem-borers, the genera Quercus, Rosa, and Salix, now so dominant, would shortly disappear from off the face of the earth. The other hypothesis\u2014here assuming that the production of galls is due more to the tree than the insect\u2014is this. Suppose an oak-tree with four branches, all attacked by internal-feeding insects. Two of the branches produce swellings in which the insects live, while the other two produce none, and the insects have to devour the vital parts. Now the two branches which produced no swellings would quickly be killed by the insects, but those which produced galls would live, and the more perfect the galls, the greater the insect-population they would be able to support. Hence the tree would finally, by the survival of its gall-producing branches, become purely gall-producing, and we may assume that its progeny would inherit the peculiarity.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"41","prism.number":"1068","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"559","prism.endingPage":"560","prism.copyright":"1890 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/041559c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/041559c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/041559c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/041559c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Galls","citation_volume":"41","citation_issue":"1068","citation_publication_date":"1890/04","citation_firstpage":"559","citation_lastpage":"560","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/041559c0","DOI":"10.1038/041559c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/041559c0","description":"THE difficulty raised by Mr. Wetterhan (NATURE, February 27, p. 394) appears at first sight a serious one, but I think it vanishes on examination.

Whether Mr. Worthington Smith has quite apprehended the nature of that purpose may be an open question. The majority of the species in the genus Hygrophorus are glutinous, and this genus, as a whole, is about the latest in its time of appearance in the autumn. It is very suggestive to observe them apparently unharmed by frost, whilst the Agarics have collapsed, and are in rapid decay. That the glutinous coating is in this instance a protection from frost can scarcely be denied. Dr. Quelet, the French mycologist, has stated that in the Vosges some species of Hygrophorus do not appear until the early frosts have commenced, and he has borne testimony to the fact that they flourish in frosty weather without apparent injury. Both the species of Agaric to which Mr. Smith alludes, Agaricus mucidus and Agaricus radicatus, may be found late in the season, apparently indifferent to the frost, which affords a suspicion that the glutinous coating is a protection from frost. Agaricus carbonarius is viscid, but much more so as cold increases, and for two consecutive years we have watched it growing uninjured far into January, when no other Agaric could be seen. We do not contend that the \u201cuseful purpose\u201d is in all cases a protection from frost, because in some early species we imagine it serves primarily as a protection against evaporation. Presuming that Agarics may contain more than 80 per cent of water, such a protection would be of service to species growing in exposed situations. If Mr. Smith's suggestion as to Agaricus mucidus is accepted, it can only apply to that species, and Agaricus adiposus, and one or two others, as the majority of tufted species growing on trunks are not glutinous. Another explanation must be found for the whole Myxacium section of Cortinarius, for Gomphidius, for many of the Boleti, and for such Agarics as Agaricus aruginosus, Agaricus semiglobatus, Agaricus lentus, Agaricus glutinosus, Agaricus roridus, and many others. The idea that gluten \u201ccauses fertilization\u201d is a novel one, and may be held as a private opinion, but cannot be accepted generally without evidence much stronger than individual belief; hence, although put forward by so experienced a mycologist as Mr. Worthington Smith, it must not be accepted as an admitted fact, but only as an individual opinion.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"43","prism.number":"1106","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"224","prism.endingPage":"224","prism.copyright":"1891 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/043224b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/043224b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/043224b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/043224b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Attractive Characters in Fungi","citation_volume":"43","citation_issue":"1106","citation_publication_date":"1891/01","citation_firstpage":"224","citation_lastpage":"224","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/043224b0","DOI":"10.1038/043224b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/043224b0","description":"UNDOUBTEDLY there are numerous glutinous fungi, and the coating of gluten has a useful purpose.

It was seen at intervals, whenever the clouds broke away, until after midnight. This display is specially interesting, because it forms the continuation of a series of recurrences, at the precise interval of twenty-seven days, which began in December, the dates being as follows: December 9, January 5, February 2, February 29, March 27, and April 23. Some of these displays have been brilliant, and all of them have been well defined. In the table of auroras which I have constructed, based upon a periodicity corresponding to the time of a synodic revolution of the sun\u2014namely, twenty-seven days, six hours, and forty minutes\u2014there was, for several years preceding the sun spot minimum in 1889 and 1890, a return each spring of series of recurrences associated with the same part of the sun as that above described. A corresponding systematic tabulation of the records of solar conditions shows that this association bears a direct relation to reappearances at the eastern limb of an area which has been much frequented by spots and facul\u00e6, and which has been located persistently south of the sun's equator. In like manner there are other areas located in the sun's northern hemisphere which have been much disturbed, and whose reappearances at the eastern limb have been attended year after year by series of recurrences of the aurora, in the autumn months chiefly, if not exclusively. From this it would appear that, in order that a solar disturbance may have its full magnetic effect upon the earth, it is necessary that it should be at the sun's eastern limb, and as nearly as possible in the plane of the earth's orbit. It appears, also, that the disturbances which recur upon certain parts of the sun so persistently year after year have greater magnetic effect than those of comparatively sporadic character located elsewhere.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"46","prism.number":"1176","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"29","prism.endingPage":"29","prism.copyright":"1892 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/046029a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/046029a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/046029a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/046029a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Aurora","citation_volume":"46","citation_issue":"1176","citation_publication_date":"1892/05","citation_firstpage":"29","citation_lastpage":"29","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/046029a0","DOI":"10.1038/046029a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/046029a0","description":"THERE was a fine aurora visible in this locality on Saturday night, April 23.

From this it would appear that, in order that a solar disturbance may have its full magnetic effect upon the earth, it is necessary that it should be at the sun's eastern limb, and as nearly as possible in the plane of the earth's orbit. It appears, also, that the disturbances which recur upon certain parts of the sun so persistently year after year have greater magnetic effect than those of comparatively sporadic character located elsewhere.","dc.creator":["VEEDER, M.

Of course it is true that my knowledge of my own psychology does differ in kind from my knowledge of that of animals, but it differs in exactly the same way from my knowledge of that of all other men.

ROBERT RIDGWAY, curator of the bird department of the U. S. National Museum, has just published (in separate form), in the report of that institution for 1890, his monograph of the Trochili. Coming from such an authority and essaying to deal with such an interesting group, this work will undoubtedly command the attention of ornithologists, and be studied with the care it no doubt merits. It makes its appearance in octavo form, of some 130 pages, being illustrated by 46 full-page plates, and has besides a number of cuts in the text. The plates give us many species of humming-birds and their nests; they being all of the \u201celectro-process\u201d variety, and chiefly copied from Gould's princely work upon the Trochili. As is usually the case, most of the figures given have suffered by the method of reproduction employed, and not being coloured, they offer us, at the best, with but a poor idea of the \u201cliving gems\u201d they are supposed to portray. With more or less thoroughness Mr. Ridgway has touched upon the early history and the literature of his subject; upon the geographical distribution of the various species; upon their number, which he makes out to be about 500; upon their natural history in general (treated in various brief sections); and there are descriptions of their external characters and a short note upon a few of their internal ones. It is with the statements made in the latter that I chiefly propose to deal in the present connection, and, aware as I am of our author's knowledge of the literature of what we may call the natural history and classification of the humming-birds, as contra-distinguished from their morphology and affinities, I must confess my surprise at his ignorance of the latter part of his subject. Mr. Ridgway remarks (p. 290) that \u201cthe humming-birds possess nothing absolutely peculiar, although certain features, shared by other groups of birds, notably the swifts (Micropodid\u0153\"), are developed to an extreme degree; as, for example, the very high keel to the sternum and consequent excessive development of the pectoral muscles, the short armwing (humerus) and extremely long handwing (manus), and minute feet with relatively large, strongly curved, and sharp claws.

ROBERT RIDGWAY, curator of the bird department of the U. S. National Museum, has just published (in separate form), in the report of that institution for 1890, his monograph of the Trochili. Coming from such an authority and essaying to deal with such an interesting group, this work will undoubtedly command the attention of ornithologists, and be studied with the care it no doubt merits. It makes its appearance in octavo form, of some 130 pages, being illustrated by 46 full-page plates, and has besides a number of cuts in the text. The plates give us many species of humming-birds and their nests; they being all of the \u201celectro-process\u201d variety, and chiefly copied from Gould's princely work upon the Trochili. As is usually the case, most of the figures given have suffered by the method of reproduction employed, and not being coloured, they offer us, at the best, with but a poor idea of the \u201cliving gems\u201d they are supposed to portray. With more or less thoroughness Mr. Ridgway has touched upon the early history and the literature of his subject; upon the geographical distribution of the various species; upon their number, which he makes out to be about 500; upon their natural history in general (treated in various brief sections); and there are descriptions of their external characters and a short note upon a few of their internal ones. It is with the statements made in the latter that I chiefly propose to deal in the present connection, and, aware as I am of our author's knowledge of the literature of what we may call the natural history and classification of the humming-birds, as contra-distinguished from their morphology and affinities, I must confess my surprise at his ignorance of the latter part of his subject. Mr. Ridgway remarks (p. 290) that \u201cthe humming-birds possess nothing absolutely peculiar, although certain features, shared by other groups of birds, notably the swifts (Micropodid\u0153\"), are developed to an extreme degree; as, for example, the very high keel to the sternum and consequent excessive development of the pectoral muscles, the short armwing (humerus) and extremely long handwing (manus), and minute feet with relatively large, strongly curved, and sharp claws. The humming birds and swifts further agree in numerous anatomical characters, and there can be no doubt that they are more closely related to each other than are either to any other group of birds. In fact, except in the shape of the bill and structure of the bones of the face, the humming-birds and swifts present no definite differences of osteological structure.\u201d As the present writer has probably published double the number of accurate figures illustrating the entire anatomy of a great many species of humming-birds as compared with any ether worker; and, further, has published correct accounts of the same to the extent exceeding that of any three living avian-morphologists, and those figures and descriptions having been very extensively accepted as correct, perhaps our author will consider me competent to criticize the statement which I have just quoted from his work. Notwithstanding the extensive and painstaking labour I have given to such matters, I reckon it but as little when compared with the opinions given us by Huxley and Kitchen Parker in the same premises.","dc.creator":["SHUFELDT, R.

R. I. POCOCK'S interesting paper in your issue of November 16, leads me to place on record an observation I made last summer in the island of Arran. Sitting by a little clear pool in the granite of Glen Sannox, I noticed a spider whose web was spun in the heather which partly overhung the stream.

R. I. POCOCK'S interesting paper in your issue of November 16, leads me to place on record an observation I made last summer in the island of Arran. Sitting by a little clear pool in the granite of Glen Sannox, I noticed a spider whose web was spun in the heather which partly overhung the stream. On disturbing her, she dropped on to the granite a few inches above the water, and running rapidly down, entered the pool and hid under a tuft of weed. After remaining thus hidden for 2\u00bd minutes, she returned to the surface and, reeling herself up by her thread, regained the web.

Many think that this sharp definition of the southern limit of the glacial drift is so improbable that they would fain attribute some deposits in North Kent to the glacial period, or at any rate would expect to find a few sporadic boulders stranded on the slopes of the North Downs; and there far-transported fragments do not unfrequently occur.","dc.creator":["HUGHES, T.

By the sodium light the outmost three circles appear, when the rotation is one way, to be dark brown, the inmost three dark leaden grey, while the intermediate circles are paler brown. Reversing the direction of rotation interchanges the appearances of the outmost and inmost three circles. I cannot see any red or blue, or green, in any case. Other people here seem to see much the same as I do when the top is illuminated by the sodium flame only. With certain black and white figures of my own, I can get a pink appearance in the sodium light, but no green or blue. With spiral figures, which are worrying to look at, I find that some people can see a play of colour even with the sodium light, but I do not see it myself. Using a turn-table, by which the rate of rotation can be regulated at will, I have found that the speed, in white light, required to bring out the colours is decidedly different for different people. This fact convinced me that the explanation of these very curious appearances must be looked for in some physiological cause. It is perhaps worth remark that a sodium flame, when there is much sodium in it to make it bright, is by no means monochromatic, though sufficiently so to make the experiment with the top a very interesting one; and as Mr. Benham sees colours by this light which some others fail to see, it goes far to prove the phenomenon to be subjective.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"51","prism.number":"1313","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"200","prism.endingPage":"200","prism.copyright":"1894 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/051200d0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/051200d0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/051200d0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/051200d0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The Artificial Spectrum Top","citation_volume":"51","citation_issue":"1313","citation_publication_date":"1894/12","citation_firstpage":"200","citation_lastpage":"200","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/051200d0","DOI":"10.1038/051200d0","citation_doi":"10.1038/051200d0","description":"I HAVE examined Mr. Benham's top by the light of a bright sodium flame, but have failed to see anything like the colours which I see by daylight or by the light of an incandescent electric lamp.

The doors were all closed against the storm, and I went out and, for cool air, opened one. On returning, I saw a globular light, about the size of the full moon, in the air between Wallis and Taylor, and almost instantly I heard in the room a terrific clap of thunder like a cannon. I suffered afterwards from acute pain down the left side of my face. Taylor, who had an iron-headed golf stick in his hand, felt a twinge up his right arm, and a sensation as of singeing in his hair. Wallis felt nothing at all. We all experienced a sulphurous smell. In the adjoining room, leaning against one corner, were two Martini-Henry rifles in leather cases. One was untouched. The stock of the other was almost shattered, splinters lying about the room. The leather covering of the splintered rifle was torn, but the metal part of the rifle quite unhurt. At the point of the wall where the muzzle of the shattered rifle touched the wall, there was a hole 5 \u00d7 2\u00bd and 1\u00bd to 2 inches deep. The wall is of mud and plaster. In the room above were two holes in one wall; that is, the wall above that in which the hole appeared below. These holes were smaller than the one below. Just below the two holes stood a wooden case, iron-bound, and at its foot the matting was torn up, but the floor and the case were untouched.

I am of course aware that the particular formula given may be regarded as an abbreviated statement of the approximate geometrical proposition that the rectangle contained by the diameter of the earth and the height of the observer above its surface equals the square on a line equal to the distance of the visible horizon, in which case, of course, Prof. Lodge's description of the symbols would be accurately true; but I do not think that the formula with this interpretation really illustrates his meaning.","dc.creator":["CUMMING, L."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["CUMMING, L."],"citation_author_institution":["Rugby"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Distance of the Visible Horizon","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Distance of the Visible Horizon&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"055294b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

At p. 156 of the same number there appears an excellent commentary on Mr. Balfour's speech to the students of the Goldsmiths' Institute at New Cross on December 12. With your comments I am in thorough sympathy, and would beg leave to point out that the two subjects are far more closely connected than might at first appear. Excellence and superiority in manufactures and commerce depends on very many elements, as you know, one of the most important of which is the \u201citem\u201d \u201ccarriage or transport.\u201d British superiority in many manufactures and markets has depended, and will henceforth largely depend, on that one item principally (take the case of iron ores), and to maintain superiority it must receive in the immediate future more careful attention and scientific treatment. Roads in their different forms enter largely as factors into the general question of \u201ctransport,\u201d and if trade superiority is to be maintained they must be looked after and treated, all over these countries, in a more scientific and skilled manner than that now prevalent in the United Kingdom. For that end there must be attained, as soon as possible, uniformity of make, treatment and control, and the highest efficiency as regards care and maintenance, and to ensure these results they should be placed under the charge of a body of trained engineers, such as those of the \u201cponts et chauss\u00e9es\u201d of France. The question to a certain extent resembles that of the currency of the realm, and as there is a perfectly uniform coinage for every part of it, so should the make and use of the roads be of one standard all over the kingdom, in the best interests of all who travel or convey goods. The Board of Trade controls the railways, why not a Board or Department for the roads? and thus obviate the many absurd and scandalous practices which exist and are allowed to prevail, to the great discomfort and loss of the community. Allow me to give my experience of what is taking place in the township of Pembroke (Dublin). The road \u201cmetal\u201d mostly in use is simply the coarser riddlings from the drift gravel so abundantly and cheaply worked in the neighbourhood of the Town Hall. The stones, perfectly rounded, incapable of taking bond and largely composed of entirely rotten elements, are loosely thrown here and there, where prominent holes appear. Mr. Beete Jukes, the former head of the Geological Survey of Ireland, remarked when he saw the material used, that boiled potatoes might as well be employed, and the rapid wear fully bears out the correctness of this judgment, and hence a large staff of scavengers and carts, discomfort for all classes of road-users, and steady increase of rates. In a southern county I have seen the road surface worn into the form of the section of an inverted arch, and was informed by a competent authority that the county surveyor, a Whitworth scholar, secured the place as the result of a Civil Service examination, the pay being about 800l. per annum, and thus secured, proceeded to develop a private practice as civil engineer, leaving the roads to attend to themselves. Many other examples of this nature might be given. As to the importance of good roads from a military point of view, it should be unnecessary for me to refer to it. I see from time to time the Dublin garrison companies and battalions out on marching exercise and notice the draggled appearance in which the men come home when the weather is in any way moist or rainy, and reasonably associate this condition with the bad state of the roads about Dublin. The Romans certainly knew better on this branch of military engineering, and might still be copied. As for agriculture, the Americans have gone thoroughly and systematically into the question, and are taking effective measures to put their road systems into a proper working state, and to have them kept up to it. I trust, Sir, that you will excuse these rather extended observations and that you will see your way to urging the pressing importance of a uniform and general system of road making and maintenance for the kingdom on the grounds of high State utility, commercial importance and agricultural necessity.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"65","prism.number":"1680","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"222","prism.endingPage":"223","prism.copyright":"1902 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/065222e0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/065222e0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/065222e0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/065222e0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Roads and National Welfare","citation_volume":"65","citation_issue":"1680","citation_publication_date":"1902/01","citation_firstpage":"222","citation_lastpage":"223","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/065222e0","DOI":"10.1038/065222e0","citation_doi":"10.1038/065222e0","description":"IN NATURE of December 19, 1901 (p. 149) is given a criticism of a work, in which some essential points in the making and maintenance of roads are strongly insisted on.

Excellence and superiority in manufactures and commerce depends on very many elements, as you know, one of the most important of which is the \u201citem\u201d \u201ccarriage or transport.\u201d British superiority in many manufactures and markets has depended, and will henceforth largely depend, on that one item principally (take the case of iron ores), and to maintain superiority it must receive in the immediate future more careful attention and scientific treatment. Roads in their different forms enter largely as factors into the general question of \u201ctransport,\u201d and if trade superiority is to be maintained they must be looked after and treated, all over these countries, in a more scientific and skilled manner than that now prevalent in the United Kingdom. For that end there must be attained, as soon as possible, uniformity of make, treatment and control, and the highest efficiency as regards care and maintenance, and to ensure these results they should be placed under the charge of a body of trained engineers, such as those of the \u201cponts et chauss\u00e9es\u201d of France. The question to a certain extent resembles that of the currency of the realm, and as there is a perfectly uniform coinage for every part of it, so should the make and use of the roads be of one standard all over the kingdom, in the best interests of all who travel or convey goods. The Board of Trade controls the railways, why not a Board or Department for the roads? and thus obviate the many absurd and scandalous practices which exist and are allowed to prevail, to the great discomfort and loss of the community. Allow me to give my experience of what is taking place in the township of Pembroke (Dublin). The road \u201cmetal\u201d mostly in use is simply the coarser riddlings from the drift gravel so abundantly and cheaply worked in the neighbourhood of the Town Hall. The stones, perfectly rounded, incapable of taking bond and largely composed of entirely rotten elements, are loosely thrown here and there, where prominent holes appear. Mr. Beete Jukes, the former head of the Geological Survey of Ireland, remarked when he saw the material used, that boiled potatoes might as well be employed, and the rapid wear fully bears out the correctness of this judgment, and hence a large staff of scavengers and carts, discomfort for all classes of road-users, and steady increase of rates. In a southern county I have seen the road surface worn into the form of the section of an inverted arch, and was informed by a competent authority that the county surveyor, a Whitworth scholar, secured the place as the result of a Civil Service examination, the pay being about 800l. per annum, and thus secured, proceeded to develop a private practice as civil engineer, leaving the roads to attend to themselves. Many other examples of this nature might be given. As to the importance of good roads from a military point of view, it should be unnecessary for me to refer to it. I see from time to time the Dublin garrison companies and battalions out on marching exercise and notice the draggled appearance in which the men come home when the weather is in any way moist or rainy, and reasonably associate this condition with the bad state of the roads about Dublin. The Romans certainly knew better on this branch of military engineering, and might still be copied. As for agriculture, the Americans have gone thoroughly and systematically into the question, and are taking effective measures to put their road systems into a proper working state, and to have them kept up to it. I trust, Sir, that you will excuse these rather extended observations and that you will see your way to urging the pressing importance of a uniform and general system of road making and maintenance for the kingdom on the grounds of high State utility, commercial importance and agricultural necessity.","dc.creator":["O'REILLY, J.

This movement was largest in the horizontal force, where there was a sudden increase of about 60 \u03b3 (1 \u03b3\u22611\u00d7 10-5 C.G.S. unit).

The statement made last week, that there is only an insignificant amount of thorium present, must be modified. On re-determining the equivalent of the crude oxalate, prepared after the yttrium metals had been separated by treatment with potassium sulphate, it has come out higher than I expected; indeed, assuming the metal present to be a tetrad, its atomic weight is even higher than that of thorium\u2014about 240, as the mean of two closely concordant determinations. The lower equivalents mentioned in the previous letter were determined as fractions of the double potassium sulphate, prepared on a large scale.

The statement made last week, that there is only an insignificant amount of thorium present, must be modified. On re-determining the equivalent of the crude oxalate, prepared after the yttrium metals had been separated by treatment with potassium sulphate, it has come out higher than I expected; indeed, assuming the metal present to be a tetrad, its atomic weight is even higher than that of thorium\u2014about 240, as the mean of two closely concordant determinations. The lower equivalents mentioned in the previous letter were determined as fractions of the double potassium sulphate, prepared on a large scale. This high atomic weight points to the presence of unknown elements of higher atomic weight than thorium; indeed, the mineral appears to be of very complex composition. It may be incidentally remarked that the crude oxalate mentioned above must have contained all the cerium group, and if any considerable proportion of the elements of this group is present, the amount of the element with higher atomic weight than that of thorium would have to be proportionately increased.

HOOKER, in NATURE of March 21, seems not to have quite appreciated my principal contention in the letters \u201cOne Vote, One Value\u201d and \u201cVox Populi\u201d of February 28 and March 7 respectively. It was to show that the verdict given by the ballot-box must be the Median estimate, because every other estimate is condemned in advance by a majority of the voters. This being the case, I examined the votes in a particular instance according to the most appropriate method for dealing with medians, quartiles, &c. I had no intention of trespassing into the technical and much-discussed question of the relative merits of the Median and of the several kinds of Mean, and beg to be excused from not doing so now except in two particulars. First, that it may not be sufficiently realised that the suppression of any one value in a series can only make the difference of one half-place to the median, whereas if the series be small it may make a great difference to the mean; consequently, I think my proposal that juries should openly adopt the median when estimating damages, and councils when estimating money grants, has independent merits of its own, besides being in strict accordance with the true theory of the ballot-box. Secondly, Mr. Hooker's approximate calculation from my scanty list of figures, of what the mean would be of all the figures, proves to be singularly correct; he makes it 1196 lb, (which is the mean of the deviates at 5\u00b0, 15\u00b0 95\u00b0) whereas it should have been 1197 lb.

HOOKER, in NATURE of March 21, seems not to have quite appreciated my principal contention in the letters \u201cOne Vote, One Value\u201d and \u201cVox Populi\u201d of February 28 and March 7 respectively. It was to show that the verdict given by the ballot-box must be the Median estimate, because every other estimate is condemned in advance by a majority of the voters. This being the case, I examined the votes in a particular instance according to the most appropriate method for dealing with medians, quartiles, &c. I had no intention of trespassing into the technical and much-discussed question of the relative merits of the Median and of the several kinds of Mean, and beg to be excused from not doing so now except in two particulars. First, that it may not be sufficiently realised that the suppression of any one value in a series can only make the difference of one half-place to the median, whereas if the series be small it may make a great difference to the mean; consequently, I think my proposal that juries should openly adopt the median when estimating damages, and councils when estimating money grants, has independent merits of its own, besides being in strict accordance with the true theory of the ballot-box. Secondly, Mr. Hooker's approximate calculation from my scanty list of figures, of what the mean would be of all the figures, proves to be singularly correct; he makes it 1196 lb, (which is the mean of the deviates at 5\u00b0, 15\u00b0 95\u00b0) whereas it should have been 1197 lb. This shows well that a small orderly sample is as useful for calculating means as a very much larger random sample, and that the compactness of a table of centiles is no hindrance to their wider use. I regret to be unable to learn the proportion of the competitors who were farmers, butchers, or non-experts. It would be well in future competitions to have a line on the cards for \u201coccupation.\u201d Certainly many non-experts competed, like those clerks and others who have no expert knowledge of horses, but who bet on races, guided by newspapers, friends, and their own fancies.","dc.creator":["GALTON, FRANCIS"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["GALTON, FRANCIS"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Ballot-Box","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Ballot-Box&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"075559a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It was found that the maximum volume of the emanation per gram of radium was in good accord with that to be expected from calculation (about 0.6 cubic mm.), and the initial volume was about one-tenth of that determined by Ramsay and Cameron (Journ.

In the course of this work we have had occasion to test the purity of the emanation by the spectroscope, passing an electric discharge in the capillary in which the volume was measured. We have on four different occasions during the last two months determined the spectrum of the radium emanation by visual observations, using a direct-reading Hilger spectroscope, leaving a more accurate determination of its spectrum until the measurements of the volume had been completed. We have now photographed the emanation spectrum, using a prism of 2 inches base. Pure emanation, corresponding to the equilibrium amount from 130 mg. of radium, was condensed by liquid air in an exhausted spectrum tube of about 50 cubic millimetres capacity, provided with thin platinum electrodes. Two photographs were immediately taken, one giving about thirty of the more intense lines, and the other, with much longer exposure, showing more than one hundred lines.

Jean Capart's valuable volume on \u201cPrimitive Art in Egypt\u201d (English edition), I noted that he has determined certain birds, delineated on a series of decorated vases, as ostriches. The vases I refer to are to be found on p. 116, Fig. 88; p. 118, Fig. 91; p. 119, Fig. 92; p. 120, Fig. 93; p. 121, Fig. 94; and p. 123, Fig. 96. I venture to suggest that the birds intended to be represented are not ostriches, but flamingos. The inbent beak, the dorsal body-contour, the horizontal ventral region, and the long, lanky legs, uncovered by feathers in the tibial region as in ostriches, all so characteristic of the flamingo, are delineated with great truthfulness on a large scale on the vase illustrated on p. 123, Fig. 96. The crosier-staff-like head is common to all the drawings I have indicated.

Jean Capart's valuable volume on \u201cPrimitive Art in Egypt\u201d (English edition), I noted that he has determined certain birds, delineated on a series of decorated vases, as ostriches. The vases I refer to are to be found on p. 116, Fig. 88; p. 118, Fig. 91; p. 119, Fig. 92; p. 120, Fig. 93; p. 121, Fig. 94; and p. 123, Fig. 96. I venture to suggest that the birds intended to be represented are not ostriches, but flamingos. The inbent beak, the dorsal body-contour, the horizontal ventral region, and the long, lanky legs, uncovered by feathers in the tibial region as in ostriches, all so characteristic of the flamingo, are delineated with great truthfulness on a large scale on the vase illustrated on p. 123, Fig. 96. The crosier-staff-like head is common to all the drawings I have indicated. Although the representation of the bird on p. 120, Fig. 93, is rather too small and ill-defined to base much upon, the curvature of the neck is yet more that of a ciconiiform than of a struthious bird. Indeed, on p. 119, Fig. 92, the group of birds at the right-hand corner of the vase is actually in proximity to water, which would hardly be the case if the artist intended it for one of ostriches; while on the vase illustrated on p. 121, Fig. 94, the four birds delineated have very characteristic horizontal flamingo tails, especially the individual on the extreme left of the row, in which it is spread.

The difficulty, appreciable in Europe, becomes very serious in a climate where the laboratory temperature lies between 30\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 C., and for this reason\u2014it is probable that practically all accumulators sent to tropical countries by European manufacturers are filled by their recipients with dilute sulphuric acid of a density (1,190) which corresponds to a 20 per cent. mixture in north Europe at 15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 C., but at a temperature of 30\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 C. indicates a mixture which is far too rich in acid for the health of the cells.

The difficulty, appreciable in Europe, becomes very serious in a climate where the laboratory temperature lies between 30\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 C., and for this reason\u2014it is probable that practically all accumulators sent to tropical countries by European manufacturers are filled by their recipients with dilute sulphuric acid of a density (1,190) which corresponds to a 20 per cent. mixture in north Europe at 15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 C., but at a temperature of 30\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 C. indicates a mixture which is far too rich in acid for the health of the cells.

I hasten, therefore, to explain that it was written in a spirit of \u201cchaff\u201d, without any intention to give umbrage. Apart from this, there is nothing in my contributions to the question of the distastefulness of Anosia plexippus which, in my opinion, needs explanation or qualification. The statistics Mr. Banta quotes to prove that North American birds do not eat butterflies are full of interest.

I hasten, therefore, to explain that it was written in a spirit of \u201cchaff\u201d, without any intention to give umbrage. Apart from this, there is nothing in my contributions to the question of the distastefulness of Anosia plexippus which, in my opinion, needs explanation or qualification. The statistics Mr. Banta quotes to prove that North American birds do not eat butterflies are full of interest. They show at all events that the birds examined had not eaten butterflies within a few hours of being shot, and they justify the belief that the birds in the areas investigated do not trouble themselves to catch butterflies when other insects are obtainable. It would be very interesting to know if the Department of Agriculture found empty stomachs in any birds shot in districts where butterflies of various kinds were plentiful and other insects scarce.

The coefficient of attenuation \u03ba of radiation of wave-length \u03bb travelling through a gas containing n0 molecules per unit volume was given by Rayleigh1 so long ago as 1871 in the form \u03ba=84, \u03c0 3(\u00b520 \u2013 I)2\u03bb\u22124/n0, \u00b50 being the refractive index of the gas. It is of importance to notice that the law in question is one of the most fundamental results of molecular dynamics, its final expression being an invariant with respect to the theories of the \u00e6ther or of the molecule employed2, while in its derivation there is no need to draw on resources outside classical dynamics and continuous energy-flow.

In a recent paper, Natanson4 has subjected the derivation of Rayleigh's law to minute criticism on the grounds of the classical electromagnetic theory, allowing for a damping term arising from the mechanical reaction due to radiation, and taking into special consideration the summation of the aggregate radiation from the random distribution of doublets which are supposed to constitute the molecules of the gas; the final result is a vindication of the above expression for the coefficient of attenuation to a very high order of accuracy.

The total range shown by the horizontal force at Kew was about 460\u03b7 (I\u03b7 = 1 \u00d7 10\u00e25 C.G.S.), the maximum occurring about 5.42 p.m., and the minimum about 9.30 a.m.","dc.creator":["CHREE, C."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["CHREE, C."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Magnetic Storm and Solar Disturbance of...","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Magnetic Storm and Solar Disturbance of June 17, 1915&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"095589a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Fortunately, he has worked with comrades and assistants who- will not fail to keep his lamp alight, nor let any of his last counsels be forgotten.","dc.creator":["A., C."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["\u00e2\u201c\u0153Diseases of the Arteries,\u00e2\u201d 1915."],"citation_author":["A., C."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Sir Lauder Brunton, BT., F.R.S.","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;Emphasis Type=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Sir Lauder Brunton, BT.,...","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"098337b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Our results provide evidence for the importance of sexual recombination for increasing and maintaining the level of adaptation of a population.","dc.creator":["Bachtrog, Doris","Charlesworth, Brian"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Phil.

Naturally occurring point mutations found in patients with the disease familial hypercholesterolaemia6 alter residues that directly coordinate Ca2+or that serve as scaffolding residues of LR5.","dc.creator":["Fass, Deborah","Blacklow, Stephen","Kim, Peter S.","Berger, James M."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Annu.

Although kin selection, reciprocal altruism and indirect reciprocity explain relevant forms of human cooperation5,6,7, they do not ultimately explain strong reciprocity8.","dc.creator":["Fehr, Ernst","G\u00e4chter, Simon"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=Game Theory Evolving; citation_publication_date=2000; citation_id=CR1; citation_author=H Gintis","citation_journal_title=J.

Both KSQ and chain-length factor are similar to the ketosynthase domains that catalyse polyketide chain extension in modular multifunctional PKSs and in aromatic PKSs, respectively, except that the ketosynthase domain active-site cysteine residue is replaced by a highly conserved glutamine in KSQ and in chain-length factor.

The first-in-class proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, was initially approved for treatment of patients in the relapsed/refractory setting as a single agent, and was recently shown to induce even greater benefits as part of rationally designed combinations that overcome chemoresistance. Modulation of proteasome function is also a rational approach to achieve chemosensitization to other antimyeloma agents, and bortezomib has now been incorporated into the front-line setting.

The first-in-class proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, was initially approved for treatment of patients in the relapsed/refractory setting as a single agent, and was recently shown to induce even greater benefits as part of rationally designed combinations that overcome chemoresistance. Modulation of proteasome function is also a rational approach to achieve chemosensitization to other antimyeloma agents, and bortezomib has now been incorporated into the front-line setting. Bortezomib-based induction regimens are able to achieve higher overall response rates and response qualities than was the case with prior standards of care, and unlike these older approaches, maintain efficacy in patients with clinically and molecularly defined high-risk disease. Second-generation proteasome inhibitors with novel properties, such as NPI-0052 and carfilzomib, are entering the clinical arena, and showing evidence of antimyeloma activity.

Recent research has focused on targeting ubiquitin receptors upstream of 20S proteasome, with the aim of generating less toxic therapies.

CRISPR/Cas9 Rpn13-knockout demonstrates that RA190-induced activity is dependent on Rpn13. RA190 decreases viability in MM cell lines and patient MM cells, inhibits proliferation of MM cells even in the presence of bone marrow stroma and overcomes bortezomib resistance. Anti-MM activity of RA190 is associated with induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis and unfolded protein response-related apoptosis. MM xenograft model studies show that RA190 is well tolerated, inhibits tumor growth and prolongs survival. Combining RA190 with bortezomib, lenalidomide or pomalidomide induces synergistic anti-MM activity.

Our preclinical data validates targeting Rpn13 to overcome bortezomib resistance, and provides the framework for clinical evaluation of Rpn13 inhibitors, alone or in combination, to improve patient outcome in MM.","dc.creator":["Song, Y","Ray, A","Li, S","Das, D S","Tai, Y T","Carrasco, R D","Chauhan, D","Anderson, K C"],"dc.subject":["Apoptosis","Myeloma","Targeted therapies"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Nat Rev Cancer;

Here, for the first time, we demonstrate optical nonlinear endoscopic tweezers (ONETs) for directly controlling and manipulating aquatic micro- and nanobeads as well as gold nanorods. It is found that two-photon absorption can enhance the trapping force on fluorescent nanobeads by up to four orders of magnitude compared with dielectric nanobeads of the same size. More importantly, two-photon excitation leads to a plasmon-mediated optothermal attracting force on nanorods, which can extend far beyond the focal spot. This new phenomenon facilitates a snowball effect that allows the fast uploading of nanorods to a targeted cell followed by thermal treatment within 1\u00a0min. As two-photon absorption allows an operation wavelength at the center of the transmission window of human tissue, our work demonstrates that ONET is potentially an unprecedented tool for precisely specifying the location and dosage of drug particles and for rapidly uploading metallic nanoparticles to individual cancer cells for treatment. Two-photon absorption can dramatically enhance the trapping force applied to fluorescent nanobeads and metallic nanoparticles. Min Gu and co-workers at the Swinburne University of Technology in Australia say that their fibre-based optical nonlinear endoscopic tweezers, which exploit two-photon absorption, can provide a trapping force that is three to four orders of magnitude stronger than usual.

Here, for the first time, we demonstrate optical nonlinear endoscopic tweezers (ONETs) for directly controlling and manipulating aquatic micro- and nanobeads as well as gold nanorods. It is found that two-photon absorption can enhance the trapping force on fluorescent nanobeads by up to four orders of magnitude compared with dielectric nanobeads of the same size. More importantly, two-photon excitation leads to a plasmon-mediated optothermal attracting force on nanorods, which can extend far beyond the focal spot. This new phenomenon facilitates a snowball effect that allows the fast uploading of nanorods to a targeted cell followed by thermal treatment within 1\u00a0min. As two-photon absorption allows an operation wavelength at the center of the transmission window of human tissue, our work demonstrates that ONET is potentially an unprecedented tool for precisely specifying the location and dosage of drug particles and for rapidly uploading metallic nanoparticles to individual cancer cells for treatment. Two-photon absorption can dramatically enhance the trapping force applied to fluorescent nanobeads and metallic nanoparticles. Min Gu and co-workers at the Swinburne University of Technology in Australia say that their fibre-based optical nonlinear endoscopic tweezers, which exploit two-photon absorption, can provide a trapping force that is three to four orders of magnitude stronger than usual. Their device could therefore be a potentially important tool for in vivo biomedical studies. In principle, the nonlinear tweezers allow large amounts of gold nanorods to be delivered rapidly to a desired location, for example to kill cancerous cells. This allows operation with a near-infrared source at the peak in transmission of biological tissue (800 nm), thus allowing greater penetration and reduced photodamage in the surrounding area.","dc.creator":["Gu, Min","Bao, Hongchun","Gan, Xiaosong","Stokes, Nicholas","Wu, Jingzhi"],"dc.subject":["Imaging and sensing","Nanoparticles","Optical manipulation and tweezers"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Phys Rev Lett;

Although several fast/ultrafast PCR methods have been proposed, the use of a simple and robust PCR thermal cycler remains challenging for POC testing. Here, we present an ultrafast photonic PCR method using plasmonic photothermal light-to-heat conversion via photon\u2013electron\u2013phonon coupling. We demonstrate an efficient photonic heat converter using a thin gold (Au) film due to its plasmon-assisted high optical absorption (approximately 65% at 450 nm, the peak wavelength of heat source light-emitting diodes (LEDs)). The plasmon-excited Au film is capable of rapidly heating the surrounding solution to over 150 \u00b0C within 3 min.

To date, all demonstrations have involved using sustained external electric or thermal consumption to maintain a desired emissivity. In the present study, we demonstrated control over the emissivity of a thermal emitter consisting of a film of phase-changing material Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) on top of a metal film. This thermal emitter achieves broad wavelength-selective spectral emissivity in the mid-infrared. The peak emissivity approaches the ideal blackbody maximum, and a maximum extinction ratio of >10\u2009dB is attainable by switching the GST between the crystalline and amorphous phases. By controlling the intermediate phases, the emissivity can be continuously tuned. This switchable, tunable, wavelength-selective and thermally stable thermal emitter will pave the way toward the ultimate control of thermal emissivity in the field of fundamental science as well as for energy harvesting and thermal control applications, including thermophotovoltaics, light sources, infrared imaging and radiative coolers.

The team coated gold substrates with thin layers of the phase-change material Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST).

Specifically, the wavelength of the emissivity peak shifted from around 9 to 13 micrometres as the thickness of the GST layer increased from 360 to 540 nanometres.

Such frequency combs allow counting of optical frequencies and have a wide range of applications. The required optical bandwidth to implement self-referencing is typically obtained via nonlinear broadening in optical fibers. Recent advances in the field of Kerr frequency combs have provided a path toward the development of compact frequency comb sources that provide broadband frequency combs, exhibit microwave repetition rates and are compatible with on-chip photonic integration. These devices have the potential to significantly expand the use of frequency combs. Yet to date, self-referencing of such Kerr frequency combs has only been attained by applying conventional, fiber-based broadening techniques. Here we demonstrate external broadening-free self-referencing of a Kerr frequency comb. An optical spectrum spanning two-thirds of an octave is directly synthesized from a continuous wave laser-driven silicon nitride microresonator using temporal dissipative Kerr soliton formation and soliton Cherenkov radiation. Using this coherent bandwidth and two continuous wave transfer lasers in a 2f\u20133f self-referencing scheme, we are able to detect the offset frequency of the soliton Kerr frequency comb. By stabilizing the repetition rate to a radio frequency reference, the self-referenced frequency comb is used to count and track the continuous wave pump laser\u2019s frequency. This work demonstrates the principal ability of soliton Kerr frequency combs to provide microwave-to-optical clockworks on a chip. A compact, precision tool for counting and tracking laser frequencies may improve atomic clocks and optical data transmission devices. Frequency combs use laser pulses to produce equally spaced spectra that can link radio frequencies to optical domains.
