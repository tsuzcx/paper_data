In this country, as we are subject to extreme seasons, more particularly as regards the rainfall, the subject is one of peculiar interest. In a paper read before the California Academy of Sciences in February on the subject of our extreme seasons, I brought forward a number of observations to show that these were due to broad polar and equatorial currents occupying large portions of the earth's surface continuously, and without much perpendicular or horizontal disturbance, except at the borders where the currents meet. The facts I then brought forward showed that from October to the middle of February a northerly current prevails over this portion of the American continent, extending from one to two hundred miles to the westward of San Francisco to the eastern edge of the Mississippi valley, whilst a southerly current prevails over the eastern side of the continent as far as the Atlantic. The southerly current to the westward extends uninterruptedly across the whole breadth of the Pacific to the coast of Japan. This same distribution of air currents without much perpendicular or horizontal mixing has apparently continued during the summer, and acounts, I think, satisfactorily for the extreme heat that has marked the continental climates over so large a part of the northern hemisphere. Nor is it surprising that the summer temperature on the continents should be so universally hot, as a horizontal wind, either from the north or from the south, blowing over the land in summer must necessarily be a hot wind. That there is no cosmical cause for this elevated temperature is proved by the extremely low summer temperature prevailing over the Pacific between this place and Japan. The mean temperature, as ascertained by observations made on board the mail steamships between here and Japan was, for Nov. 1869, 70\u00b0\u00b72, for January, 62\u00b0\u00b79, for May, 1870, 61\u00b79, for July, 65\u00b77, giving a mean of 2\u00b0\u00b77 less for May and July than for January and February. The difference in favour of the winter temperature would be still more marked were the coast temperatures eliminated, as they perhaps should be; as these were much above, the mean in summer and below the mean in winter. As to the causes that lead to the peculiar distribution of the air currents in certain seasons, I have not the slightest idea, but I think that, admitting the fact, it affords a satisfactory explanation of anomalous temperatures both in winter and summer.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"3","prism.number":"54","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"28","prism.endingPage":"28","prism.copyright":"1870 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003028c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/003028c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003028c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003028c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Extreme Seasons","citation_volume":"3","citation_issue":"54","citation_publication_date":"1870/11","citation_firstpage":"28","citation_lastpage":"28","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/003028c0","DOI":"10.1038/003028c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/003028c0","description":"A GREAT deal of speculation has been indulged in to account for the extreme seasons that have prevailed over so large a part of the northern hemisphere during the last few months.

They were decidedly interesting, not only as attempting to show that the belts of limestone interpolated in the great beds of Laurentian Gneiss were organic in their origin, but also from the art which the authors displayed in the mode of placing their views before the public. The realistic manner in which the fossil Eozo\u00f6n canadense is drawn as it were from the life, coupled with the fixed belief in most men's minds that limestone is necessarily organic in its origin, predisposed many to accept the theory without much inquiry. The reputation of Dr. Carpenter as a physiologist was alone considered sufficient to settle the matter. These views did not, however, long remain unchallenged, for in the following year Professors King and Rowney, in a communication \u201cOn the so-called Eozo\u00f6nal Rock,\u201d detailed the elaborate investigations by which they arrived at the conclusion that the presumed fossil was purely a mineral production. The replies that naturally followed were literally little more than reiterations of previous statements, excepting in the important admission from Dr. Carpenter, that the several features (that is chamber casts, canal system, and proper walls) could be separately paralleled elsewhere. He, however, took his stand upon the combination of the whole found in the Canadian specimens. To the fatal objection that all had been obtained from metamorphosed rocks Dr. Dawson replied by producing a specimen from Tudor, Ontario, which Sir W. E. Logan goes no further than to declare is from comparatively unaltered limestone, but which Dr. Dawson considers furnishes a conclusive answer to all arguments drawn from metamorphism. Since then I am not aware that any further evidence in favour of the organic hypothesis has been made public. On the other hand, Professors King and Rowney announced in a paper, read before the British Association at the Liverpool meeting, that they had discovered the features of the so-called organism in the Ophite of Strath in the Isle of Skye, an altered sedimentary deposit of the Liassic age, in which evidence of its mineral origin was conclusively proved. Here, at present, the matter rests; but in my opinion ample materials exist for forming a judgment, not by reliance on authority but by independent reasoning. With this object in view, and with your permission, I will proceed to detail a few of the facts of the case. Before doing so I would, however, call attention to the strange absence of any allusion to obvious objections which characterises the first series of papers, and to the persistent begging of the question involved in constantly speaking of the specimens as undoubted fossils. The adoption of this objectionable practice under authority of such eminent names is prejudicial to an impartial judgment, as it indirectly influences the mind. I am quite willing to admit that there existed sufficient reasons for suspecting them to be fossils, but I submit that it is not philosophical to state so distinctly before a thorough examination of all the objections. For evidence of this having been done I search these papers in vain. How then can any one, accustomed to scientific methods of investigation, help suspecting that under all this scientific and pictorial use of the imagination there exists or lurks a fallacy?","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"3","prism.number":"60","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"146","prism.endingPage":"147","prism.copyright":"1870 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003146b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/003146b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003146b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/003146b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Eozo\u00f6n Canadense","citation_volume":"3","citation_issue":"60","citation_publication_date":"1870/12","citation_firstpage":"146","citation_lastpage":"147","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/003146b0","DOI":"10.1038/003146b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/003146b0","description":"IT is now about five years since a series of communications to the Geological Society of London by Logan, Dawson, Carpenter, and Sterry Hunt, announced the discovery of organic remains in the Laurentian rocks of Canada.

I am quite willing to admit that there existed sufficient reasons for suspecting them to be fossils, but I submit that it is not philosophical to state so distinctly before a thorough examination of all the objections. For evidence of this having been done I search these papers in vain. How then can any one, accustomed to scientific methods of investigation, help suspecting that under all this scientific and pictorial use of the imagination there exists or lurks a fallacy?","dc.creator":["READE, T.

And first, as to the fact that the surface water of the Atlantic Ocean, in moving northwards from the equator to 60\u00b0 lat., has almost wholly lost the easterly motion of rotation it should have brought with it. This loss is imputed by Mr. Croll to friction only, and he argues that the much lower velocity of the northward current must, therefore, be wholly neutralised by friction. This is his main argument, which he has repeatedly adduced, and to which he has hitherto received no reply. But, although his reasoning might be admitted if the conditions affecting the two motions were the same, it seems to me to be quite inapplicable to the present case. If, in the temperate zone, the ocean expended uninterruptedly in an east and west direction round the globe, it would no doubt retain a considerable portion of the equatorial eastern motion, and whatever deficiency existed might fairly be imputed to friction. But the Atlantic is actually like a huge lake, with continuous eastern and western shores, and the water which flows northwards along the eastern shore is prevented from moving eastwards, not by friction against wafer or even against the shore, but by having to perform work in lifting or heaping up the water against the shore, just as the water of a pond or lake is heaped up on the leeward side by a strong wind. As the direction of the motion of the water will, however, by the hypothesis, be oblique or somewhat, north of east, some of the motion will be diverted northwards along the eastern shore, and thus tend to increase the northerly flow. The 9,925 pounds of energy (according to Mr. Croll) are not therefore consumed in overcoming the frictional resistance to eastward motion, but for the most part in doing the actual work of overcoming gravitation and holding up the waters at a higher level, and the theoretical amount of this rise can, no doubt, be easily calculated for us by Mr. Croll.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"6","prism.number":"147","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"328","prism.endingPage":"329","prism.copyright":"1872 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/006328b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/006328b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/006328b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/006328b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Ocean Circulation","citation_volume":"6","citation_issue":"147","citation_publication_date":"1872/08","citation_firstpage":"328","citation_lastpage":"329","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/006328b0","DOI":"10.1038/006328b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/006328b0","description":"ALTHOUGH no mathematician, and only an amateur in physics, it appears to me that the difficulties and objections of Mr. Croll on this subject may be obviated, and the whole question elucidated by a reference to the admitted facts, and a common sense interpretation of them.

I sealed a tube on to a flask of about 100 cc. capacity at right angles to the neck, and drew out the end so as to form a capillary orifice. About 30 cc. of water were put into the flask, and a thermometer in an india-rubber cork was wired into the neck. On boiling the water the steam had not issued during more than half-a-minute, before the temperature was 102\u00b0C., and in less than ten minutes it had reached 118\u00b0C.; fearing the safety of the apparatus, I did not proceed further, nor indeed did I wish to do more. The joint experiments of Drs. Sanderson and Bastian, then newly published in your paper, led me to this. My view being that Pasteur's experiments on milk, mixed with carbonate of lime, and the liquid known as \u201cPasteur's solution\u201d mixed with carbonate of lime, conclusively show that liquids which ordinarily develop Bacteria, will, if they remain neutral after boiling at 100\u00b0C. also develop these organisms raise the temperature to 110\u00b0C. and the Bacteria no longer show themselves.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"8","prism.number":"193","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"200","prism.endingPage":"200","prism.copyright":"1873 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/008200a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/008200a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/008200a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/008200a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Dr. Bastian's Experiments","citation_volume":"8","citation_issue":"193","citation_publication_date":"1873/07","citation_firstpage":"200","citation_lastpage":"200","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/008200a0","DOI":"10.1038/008200a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/008200a0","description":"REGARDING Dr. Bastiars's letter in NATURE of June 26, I am happy to be able to make a note of an experiment which is of interest and importance.

On boiling the water the steam had not issued during more than half-a-minute, before the temperature was 102\u00b0C., and in less than ten minutes it had reached 118\u00b0C.; fearing the safety of the apparatus, I did not proceed further, nor indeed did I wish to do more. The joint experiments of Drs. Sanderson and Bastian, then newly published in your paper, led me to this. My view being that Pasteur's experiments on milk, mixed with carbonate of lime, and the liquid known as \u201cPasteur's solution\u201d mixed with carbonate of lime, conclusively show that liquids which ordinarily develop Bacteria, will, if they remain neutral after boiling at 100\u00b0C. also develop these organisms raise the temperature to 110\u00b0C. and the Bacteria no longer show themselves.","dc.creator":["HARTLEY, WALTER NOEL"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["HARTLEY, WALTER NOEL"],"citation_author_institution":["King's College,"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Dr. Bastian's Experiments","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Dr. Bastian&#39;s Experiments&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"008222b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The conclusion to which these experiments pointed was that there is a kind of photographic irradiation, caused either by the bright light producing an intense state of chemical activity, which has the power of extending itself in every direction; or what seems more probable, the parts of the collodion on which the bright light is falling become luminous and reflect light to the surrounding parts of the sensitive film, and thus extend the chemical change on each side of the true optical boundary line. As the subject is at present under discussion, I send you the results of the following experiments, which seem to support the above conclusion. In a darkened room a vertical opening 18 in. by 5 in. was made in the shutter; over the opening was fixed a piece of paper thick enough to stop most of the light, and only allow as much to pass as would give a decided but not deep photographic impression. Three long, narrow, parallel openings were cut in the paper, one opening was left clear to the sky, the next was covered with one thickness of tissue paper, and the third with two thicknesses of tissue paper. There was thus produced three parallel bars of different brightness on a uniform and darker ground. Sensitive wet plates were prepared in the usual way on glass and opaque black plates; across the front of the plates, and almost in contact with the collodion, was fixed a horizontal bar of thin blackened metal in such a position that it would cross the image of the luminous bars in the camera. The photographs, after exposure, were developed in the usual way, and it was found that the shadow cast by the horizontal opaque bar was not bounded by straight lines, but the ends of all the bright bars projected into the shadow, and the brighter the bar the farther it projected. I had no means of measuring accurately the bar and its shadow, but there seems but little doubt that the bright bars extended underneath the opaque bar, whilst the edge of the darker ground at the side of the bright bars gave the correct line of the shadow. Now this extension of the bright bars could not have been caused by the reflection from the back of the plate, as this result was always got whether glass or opaque black plates were used. Nor could it have been caused by the oblique pencils referred to by Lord Lindsay and Mr. A. C. Ranyard, because, the opaque bar being close to the collodion, these pencils could not get underneath. The natural conclusion seems to be, that this extension of the bright bars must have been caused by some molecular reflection taking place in the collodion. This form of irradiation can easily be distinguished from the irradiation produced by reflection from the back of the plate, as the latter is simply a sort of haze surrounding the bright object, extending some distance from it, and gradually fading away, whilst the former extends a very short distance and has a well-marked outline, though not so sharp as those parts of the image where there is no irradiation. The irradiation produced by reflection from the back of the plate, and some forms of irradiation due to the imperfections of the lens, though fatal to artistic photography, yet do not interfere much with its scientific value, as they do not affect the accuracy of outline, though they do affect the clearnesss of the photograph. Molecular irradiation, on the other hand, whilst it scarcely affects artistic photography, is fatal to scientific accuracy. The manner of preventing this latter form of irradiation has been already pointed out, namely, by reducing the intensity of the light falling on the sensitive surface to only that necessary to produce a distinct impression. In artistic photography this is almost never possible on account of the different amount of light on the different parts of the subject, while for scientific purposes this may almost always be done. The imperfections of the image due to the lens seem to be as various as the forms of lenses; one lens used in the experiments gave a curious double hazy-image of the bright object. When the image is near the centre of the \u201cfield\u201d the double image fits over the true image, producing an effect somewhat similar to, and was at first mistaken for the effect of reflection from the back of the plate. At first this double image was somewhat puzzling, as it always made its appearance even when opaque plates were used. The two images were, however, afterwards separated by bringing the true image near the outside of the \u201cfield,\u201d when the true image and its double were photographed alongside of each other.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"10","prism.number":"245","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"185","prism.endingPage":"185","prism.copyright":"1874 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/010185a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/010185a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/010185a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/010185a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Photographic Irradiation","citation_volume":"10","citation_issue":"245","citation_publication_date":"1874/07","citation_firstpage":"185","citation_lastpage":"185","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/010185a0","DOI":"10.1038/010185a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/010185a0","description":"IN a letter to NATURE, vol. ix. p. 183, I gave a short description of some experiments on photographic irradiation.

W. Bennett, in NATURE, vol. ix. p. 485, has escaped my notice hitherto and remained unanswered. Mr. Bennett, alluding to my letter on \u201cMicroscopic Examination of Air\u201d (NATURE, vol. ix. p. 439), asks on what ground I refer the \u201ctriangular pollen\u201d captured on my slide to the birch and hazel. The identification resulted from comparison under the microscope.

On inquiry the same shock had been felt at the schoolhouse of Tynron, by Mr. Laurie; and over an area of several parishes around the upper course of the Nith the shock was felt, causing walls to vibrate and cupboard dishes to tingle. Two concussions of less violence were felt between 11 and 12 o'clock on the previous evening.

We may add that, until quite lately, Cambridge treatises on Mechanics always used the expressions \u201caccelerating force\u201d and \u201cmoving force\u201d (to the great confusion of learners), with the noteworthy exception of Sandeman's \u201cMotion of a Particle,\u201d where \u201ceffect\u201d was used for \u201cforce.\u201d So troublesome and misleading was this terminology found for students that one well-known Cambridge writer in a little work on Dynamics, introduced it in a way which reminds one of the trembling and caution with which Sidney Smith brought the word \u201cmetaphysics\u201d before his audience at the Royal Institution. But these authors could claim the venerable authority of Newton for those terms; and if they had taken care to introduce them in the exact way in which he does, no difficulty would have ensued. Unfortunately, until Mr. P. T. Main edited Newton's \u201cSections,\u201d our editions of that work began with Lemma I., and ignored his \u201cDefinitions\u201d and \u201cLaws of Motion.\u201d In the \u201cDefinitions\u201d Sir I. Newton tells us that the term \u201caccelerative force\u201d is used as an abbreviation for \u201cthe accelerative quantity of a force,\u201d or the velocity generated by it in a given time; and the term \u201cmoving\u201d or \u201cmotive force\u201d as an abbreviation for \u201cthe motive quantity of a force,\u201d or the momentum generated by it in a given time; and if these expressions had always been explained in this way, i.e. as signifying what may be called the velocity-effect and the momentum-effect of a force, there would have been no room for misconception and no need of cautioning the learner against the notion that there were two different kinds of force. Perhaps with regard to Leibnitz it may be questioned whether his physical ideas were so incorrect, and whether he may not have used the terms referred to in the same way that Newton did, viz., as abbreviations, and so as to embody the notions of the different effects of a power or influence on the motion of a body, viz., its work-effect, its momentum-effect, its velocity-effect, &c. It must, however, be allowed that the term \u201cconservation of force\u201d (originally it seems due to Helmholtz) is very misleading, for a meaning of \u201cforce\u201d is therein required which is not included in the original dynamical ideas; and the notion intended to be conveyed could only be given by a new term, \u201cenergy,\u201d or work-power, with its attributives actual and potential. But, after all, the whole controversy on the word \u201cforce\u201d is as to the method of measuring a pressure or tension; if we regard the time of the action, the effect is represented by the momentum; and if the space through which exertion is made, the effect is represented by the work.1 Either of these would then measure \u201cforce,\u201d and there would be no inaccuracy if careful explanation were given as to the method used and the sense of words.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"14","prism.number":"365","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"568","prism.endingPage":"569","prism.copyright":"1876 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/014568b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/014568b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/014568b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/014568b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"On the word \u201cForce\u201d","citation_volume":"14","citation_issue":"365","citation_publication_date":"1876/10","citation_firstpage":"568","citation_lastpage":"569","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/014568b0","DOI":"10.1038/014568b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/014568b0","description":"IN the Times' report (Sept. 9, 1876) of Prof. Tait's lecture at Glasgow on Force, it is stated that \u201cthe lecturer showed how the incorrect physical ideas of Leibnitz, and some of his followers, had introduced the terms vis viva, vis mortua, and vis accelerairix,\u201d and that these terms were found also in English works.

On the general subject of the article I do not propose, nor would it be proper for me, to say a word. I am concerned only with the concluding remarks of the writer on a letter of mine to the Times. Nothing has appeared to me more astonishing than the use, or rather abuse, which is occasionally made of the report of Lord Dufferin's committee on ships designs. If their authority can be claimed for any statement, I see on all sides a readiness to claim it. Should anything they have said militate against a favourite view, their authority is depreciated, and a comparison is sometimes invidiously drawn between the supposed opinion of the majority and that of an intelligent minority. Now if I be included with the unintelligent majority, I am quite content to find myself in such good company; but if on the contrary, I am included in the minority, I utterly and absolutely, refuse a compliment at the expense of my distinguished colleagues, with whom I shall always esteem it no small honour to have served.

He seems to think their duty was to make their report a treatise on Naval Architecture. The absurdity of such a notion is apparent on the face of it. In fact they were required to give an opinion on certain designs of ships submitted to them as to their being in accordance with, the latest developments of the theory of naval architecture. It was no part of their duty to descant on the principles which were successfully applied in such designs; but undoubtedly if they observed that in any direction caution was necessary, they were bound to remark it. In none of the designs was there any indication of a tendency to curtail initial and maximum stability of their due proportions; had there been they would certainly not have failed to call attention to it. But while they found the design of the Devastation in all respects sound, they yet thought it desirable that the range of stability should in future designs be somewhat enlarged. In recommending such enlargement they by no means committed themselves to any such absurd dictum as the writer imagines\u2014that range of stability is all that is requisite for the safety of a ship.

I was coming by one of the lake steamers from Como to Menaggio, in September, 1875, and saw a humming-bird hawk moth, Macroglossa stellatarum, fly to some bright-coloured flowers on a lady's hat on deck, and hang, poised over them for a short time, and then fly away.

After awhile, as the full daylight broke, it left the smoky region above and came down towards the deck, and I then discovered it to be neither bird nor bat, but a specimen of the death's-head moth, Sphinx Atropos, whose flight I then witnessed for the first time.

It was the chief object of my communication to NATURE, vol. xvii. p. 183, to show the latter fact as far as the observations go up to the present time. I did not, however, venture in that article to make a guess as to the future, which really could have little weight till we have another year's observations. Yet I thought it desirable, nearly two months ago, to place in the hands of Prof. Balfour Stewart the evidence that the possibility of such an event, as an obvious conclusion from my results, had not escaped me. As Mr. Jenkins has published his guess, I may do the same with mine. The latter differs, however, from his in a very important way. He supposes the next maximum will be in 1887, whereas I suppose that the weak maximum of 1797 may be repeated near 1880. In this latter case the interval between the two will be nearly double that found by me (forty-two years), during which the sun-spot period appears to have all its different lengths.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"17","prism.number":"432","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"280","prism.endingPage":"281","prism.copyright":"1878 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/017280c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/017280c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/017280c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/017280c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Sun-Spots and Terrestrial Magnetism","citation_volume":"17","citation_issue":"432","citation_publication_date":"1878/02","citation_firstpage":"280","citation_lastpage":"281","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/017280c0","DOI":"10.1038/017280c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/017280c0","description":"MR.

It was the chief object of my communication to NATURE, vol. xvii. p. 183, to show the latter fact as far as the observations go up to the present time. I did not, however, venture in that article to make a guess as to the future, which really could have little weight till we have another year's observations. Yet I thought it desirable, nearly two months ago, to place in the hands of Prof. Balfour Stewart the evidence that the possibility of such an event, as an obvious conclusion from my results, had not escaped me. As Mr. Jenkins has published his guess, I may do the same with mine. The latter differs, however, from his in a very important way. He supposes the next maximum will be in 1887, whereas I suppose that the weak maximum of 1797 may be repeated near 1880. In this latter case the interval between the two will be nearly double that found by me (forty-two years), during which the sun-spot period appears to have all its different lengths.","dc.creator":["BROUN, JOHN ALLAN"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["BROUN, JOHN ALLAN"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Sun-Spots and Terrestrial Magnetism","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Sun-Spots and Terrestrial Magnetism&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"017302c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The force of gravitation, of attraction and repulsion between two bodies permanently electrified or magnetised, and all dual forces or actions and reactions directed along, and depending only on the distance between two bodies, and not at all upon the time, are of this kind.

When two such bodies approach, or recede from each other, whatever time elapses or whatever course they may pursue about their centre of mass, not only are the momentary transfers between actual and potential energy equal in energy value at every moment of the motion (for this is general, and by this condition only the bodies returning twice to the same distance from each other might have very different energies of motion at the two returns); but the whole energy of motion which can be gained between two distances is a definite one, and as this would not be so if the bodies returned twice to the same distance with different actual energies, nor if they returned twice to the same distance with different potential energies, it follows at once that not only is the sum of the actual and potential energies at any one distance invariable with the lapse of time and with any intervening motions of the bodies, but since the gain of actual energy from this distance to any other is the loss of potential energy, the sum of these two energies is also the same at one distance as it is at another, and it therefore varies neither with the time nor with the distance of the bodies from each other.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"17","prism.number":"433","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"302","prism.endingPage":"303","prism.copyright":"1878 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/017302c0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/017302c0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/017302c0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/017302c0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"The \u201cPhantom\u201d Force","citation_volume":"17","citation_issue":"433","citation_publication_date":"1878/02","citation_firstpage":"302","citation_lastpage":"303","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/017302c0","DOI":"10.1038/017302c0","citation_doi":"10.1038/017302c0","description":"THE famous principles of conservation and dissipation of energy, which have done so much to promote the progress of physical science in recent years, were undoubtedly first inferred and generalised from certain similar laws in the theory of forces which, as we find noticed by Prof. Tait in NATURE (vol. xiv. p. 462), were first propounded by Newton.1 If in any mechanical system, Newton observes, urged by any forces, to which we must add those which arise from friction, the action of a force reckoned as a gain in the system is measured by the product of its impulse and the space through which it is pushed back, or as a loss in the system when the product relates to a space through which the force is allowed to act, and if as action of the same kind in the system we also count its gains and losses of actual energy of motion, the whole amount of action in the system remains unchanged during the motion.

Referring to my assertion that the heat of the rock \u201cis pretty uniform\u201d in the lower levels, Prof. Barker announces that there are \u201cthe most remarkable differences, some of the higher levels being much hotter than some of the lower levels.\u201d This is perfectly true, and the fact is no disproof of my assertion. In the article to which Dr. Lesley refers (Silliman's Journal, April, 1879) I said that there are striking differences of temperature in the rock, and endeavoured to explain them by showing that there is a great mass of rock which may be regarded as heated to a tolerably uniform degree at all points in the length of the lode, on any given level, and that in this general mass there are isolated localities, most of which show a temperature above that of the rock at large, but some of them below it. I pointed out the conditions under which these local maxima occur, and gave the explanation to which I thought they led. The hot spots are evidently narrow and long, and as the mine openings sometimes intersect and sometimes follow them for some distance, a given level will be for a part of its length in a hot belt and for a part in the general mass of heated rock, or one level may be in a hot belt and show a much higher temperature than the level below, which entirely escapes the exceptionally hot ground. In this way thermometric variations are obtained between different levels and between different parts of the same levels, and these facts were all brought out in my article.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"20","prism.number":"517","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"503","prism.endingPage":"503","prism.copyright":"1879 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/020503a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/020503a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/020503a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/020503a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Heat of the Comstock Mine","citation_volume":"20","citation_issue":"517","citation_publication_date":"1879/09","citation_firstpage":"503","citation_lastpage":"503","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/020503a0","DOI":"10.1038/020503a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/020503a0","description":"I NOTICE in NATURE, vol. xx. p. 168, that Dr. Lesley quotes from Prof. Barker an opinion in regard to the heat of the Comstock Mines in Nevada.

The object of this letter was to obtain, if possible, a copy of the Proceedings of the Royal Society (vol. vii.), referred to in my centenary notice of Gauss (NATURE, vol. xv. p. 533). I have not succeeded in obtaining this volume, and I learn from Mr. Walter White that there is no copy available from the Royal Society. In the course of a subsequent correspondence I have learnt several family particulars which, as I have Mr. Gauss's permission, I should like to give to supplement my former notice referred to above. I am the more disposed to do so as the notice of Gauss in the Encycl. Brit. (vol. x.) gives but scanty details, and, I observe, gives the erroneous date of April 23 (for April 30) as his birthday (vol. xv. p. 533), and further, all reference to Gauss's married life was omitted in my notice. Gauss, it is well known, was twice married. By his first wife he had two sons, Joseph and Louis, and one daughter, Minna; Joseph died in Europe four or five years ago, Louis died in infancy, and Minna, wife of Prof. Ewald, of G\u00f6ttingen, died about ten years before her father. The second wife was Minna Waldeck (there is a letter from her mother to Olbers, in Dr. Bruhns's \u201cBriefe zwischen A. v. Humboldt und Gauss,\u201d No. vi.); by her Gauss had also two sons and a daughter. This daughter, Theresa, died in Europe. The second son, William, settled in Missouri, and died August 23, 1879, at St. Louis. My informant says he died rich, and his sons are very well circumstanced in business: one son is a Presbyterian minister. Eugene Gauss, the eldest son by the second marriage, is the only living child of C. F. Gauss, and is in his sixty-seventh year (almost entirely blind with cataract in his eyes); he is Mr. R. Gauss's father; he left Europe about 1831, and has not since left his adopted country. The family propose to publish a translation of the several memoirs of Gauss in book form, and are very desirous of procuring copies of his letters to scientific men, more especially such as would be illustrative of his character and thoughts on general subjects. I have an extract before me of a letter from the daughter Theresa (date December 6, 1850), in which she says: \u201cI cannot tell you much out of our quiet, simple life; one day and one year resembles very much the other, although they are peaceful days and years, for father, even now in his advanced years, retains his health unimpaired, and an always cheerful and happy frame of mind;\u201d and then follows an account of the celebration in July, 1849, of his \u201csemicentennial doctors\u2019-jubilee.\u201d Brunswick and G\u00f6ttingen heaped honours upon him, and the \u201cKing sent him autograph congratulations and bestowed on him the degree of a higher order; of letters and addresses there was no end\u201d... \u201cthen father delivered an address in the University hall, which was filled to overflowing with spectators and auditors, and which was so decorated with flowers as to look like a fairy palace. Even the houses in the streets through which he passed were decorated, and the city swarmed with well-dressed people as on a holiday. When at last, at seven o'clock, he returned home from the dinner, he was indeed very much exhausted, and it was well that the torch-light procession, which the students had thought of getting up in his honour, was, at his wish, omitted.\u201d It was a matter of regret to the old man that not one of his sons was able to be present.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"21","prism.number":"542","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"467","prism.endingPage":"467","prism.copyright":"1880 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/021467a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/021467a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/021467a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/021467a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"C.

The tree was a fine oak about forty feet high, and the lightning seemed to have struck not among the smaller branches at the top, but about two-thirds of the way up the main trunk, just where several of the larger branches came off from the stem.

Three of them are in Cygnus, and have lines whose wave-lengths are 580, 568, 536, and 467. The fourth star, Oeltzen 17681, has lines at about 582 and 470 (NATURE, vol. xxii. p. 483). The line or band at 467 appears to be common to all, and that at 580 to the last four. The line at 486 in Ll. 13412 coincides with the F line of hydrogen, but is not visible in the other stars. The line at 545 is also absent in them. This star therefore appears to resemble the others in kind, but not in the material of which it is composed. It is also much brighter than the others, so that it is not a difficult object with a small telescope. Its position for 1880 is in R.A. 6h. 49.3m. and Dec. \u201323\u00b0 47\u2032.

Newton and his brother, the Hon. Ed. Newton, Colonial Secretary of Jamaica, published in the \u201cJamaica Handbook, 1881, p. 117, as follows:\u2014\u201cPROCELLARIID\u00c6\u2014\u0152strelala jamaicensis, Bancroft, Jamaica Petrel. Procellaria jamaicensis, Bancroft, Zool. Journ. v. p. 81; Blue Mountain Duck, Gosse, \u201cBirds of Jamaica,\u201d p. 437 (Hill); Pterodroma caribb\u00e6a, Carte, P.Z.S. 1866, p. 93, Pl. x.\u201d During certain seasons of the year it is remarkable that this sea-bird should be found in holes under trees and in burrows on the Cinchona plantations and in the unfrequented woods of the Blue Mountain range, at elevations from 6000 feet to 7000 feet. The natural inference was that the birds make their nests on these nlaces. But, although careful search has been made during the last two years, and a reward offered for nests, eggs, or any signs of nidification, nothing whatever has been found in that direction. It is therefore very probable that the birds use these holes and burrows simply as resting-places during the day, from whence they sally forth at night to their feeding-grounds at sea.

Newton and his brother, the Hon. Ed. Newton, Colonial Secretary of Jamaica, published in the \u201cJamaica Handbook, 1881, p. 117, as follows:\u2014\u201cPROCELLARIID\u00c6\u2014\u0152strelala jamaicensis, Bancroft, Jamaica Petrel. Procellaria jamaicensis, Bancroft, Zool. Journ. v. p. 81; Blue Mountain Duck, Gosse, \u201cBirds of Jamaica,\u201d p. 437 (Hill); Pterodroma caribb\u00e6a, Carte, P.Z.S. 1866, p. 93, Pl. x.\u201d During certain seasons of the year it is remarkable that this sea-bird should be found in holes under trees and in burrows on the Cinchona plantations and in the unfrequented woods of the Blue Mountain range, at elevations from 6000 feet to 7000 feet. The natural inference was that the birds make their nests on these nlaces. But, although careful search has been made during the last two years, and a reward offered for nests, eggs, or any signs of nidification, nothing whatever has been found in that direction. It is therefore very probable that the birds use these holes and burrows simply as resting-places during the day, from whence they sally forth at night to their feeding-grounds at sea. The latter is distant only, as the crow flies, about twelve or fourteen miles. The birds are found in their burrows chiefly during the months of November, December, January, and March. Sometimes two lie in one hole, and dogs easily find them; but it has been noticed that the birds are always full grown, and with no apparent nest.

This is only too apparent from the reports which appear in the papers after a gale, and in which are generally detailed the estimated pressures and velocities of the wind as recorded by the anemometers at the principal meteorological stations.

Last year, in July, I was residing on Naphill Common, Buckinghamshire. About midday, during my absence at Oxford, a violent thunderstorm broke over the district, and appeared to extend from Oxford to London. On returning I found that the house had been struck by lightning, apparently in two places. One chimney was knocked in through the roof, the debris partly filling up my room. The kitchen chimney had also been visited, the lightning breaking some of the brickwork of the hearth, and passing a person cooking at the fire; two or three others were in the house at the time, but no one was hurt. On carefully examining the marks left, I found that a door in a room adjoining the one above-mentioned had been split, and some iron knobs knocked off and broken, the screw nails being removed out of the wood, and a large hole several feet square made in the side of the house. From examination of the outside of the wall at the foot of the kitchen chimney, the bricks showed displacement opposite the marks inside at the hearth. I believe a tree was struck, and a water-trap or cesspool shifted out of position.

Last year, in July, I was residing on Naphill Common, Buckinghamshire. About midday, during my absence at Oxford, a violent thunderstorm broke over the district, and appeared to extend from Oxford to London. On returning I found that the house had been struck by lightning, apparently in two places. One chimney was knocked in through the roof, the debris partly filling up my room. The kitchen chimney had also been visited, the lightning breaking some of the brickwork of the hearth, and passing a person cooking at the fire; two or three others were in the house at the time, but no one was hurt. On carefully examining the marks left, I found that a door in a room adjoining the one above-mentioned had been split, and some iron knobs knocked off and broken, the screw nails being removed out of the wood, and a large hole several feet square made in the side of the house. From examination of the outside of the wall at the foot of the kitchen chimney, the bricks showed displacement opposite the marks inside at the hearth. I believe a tree was struck, and a water-trap or cesspool shifted out of position. Some men using a reaping machine in a neighbouring field stated that they knew the storm was coming by the fire playing about the blades of the machine. A boy who had been near at the time said that he saw a large ball of fire fall on the house, which it seemed to enter; it then reappeared, and passed into the meadow. I therefore think it likely that the damage done to the rooms and side of house was due to the electric development called a fireball.","dc.creator":["MILLAR, W.

Four specimens were obtained by me, but three of them, owing to some unknown cause, became considerably damaged and practically useless. The fourth specimen, which was found by me nearly a month ago, is still alive and evidently in good health. It is, when in progression, about 31/2 inches in length, but it often elongates itself considerably more and at other times becomes nearly coiled into a thick lump. It possesses thirty-one pairs of feet, the last three of which it rarely puts to the ground except when it goes backwards for short distances. Several other pairs at intervals along the body are carried off the ground in the same manner. It seems distinctly restless under the influence of light, appearing comfortable only when it retreats into some moist and darkened corner. When handled, it frequently discharges its viscid secretion, but as frequently neglects to do it when handled for the first time after a long interval, but more especially when touched or taken up for three or four times in rapid succession. It has been kept in an old sardine tin with small pieces of decayed wood, which were taken from the stump in which it was found, and the wood is kept in a moist condition. The locality from which it was obtained was the Hoorubea Creek, about twenty miles from Georgetown, on the east coast of the Demerara River, close to the meeting-point of an extensive forest and a water savannah. The four specimens were obtained in the same locality; and, though I have sought for them continually in other places, up to the present I have been unable to find others. From the long period of time during which this specimen has survived in confinement, I think there will be no difficulty, when I have obtained a large number of specimens, in sending them alive to England to Prof. Moseley and others. Unfortunately I have no possible access here to any literature on the group.

Four specimens were obtained by me, but three of them, owing to some unknown cause, became considerably damaged and practically useless. The fourth specimen, which was found by me nearly a month ago, is still alive and evidently in good health. It is, when in progression, about 31/2 inches in length, but it often elongates itself considerably more and at other times becomes nearly coiled into a thick lump. It possesses thirty-one pairs of feet, the last three of which it rarely puts to the ground except when it goes backwards for short distances. Several other pairs at intervals along the body are carried off the ground in the same manner. It seems distinctly restless under the influence of light, appearing comfortable only when it retreats into some moist and darkened corner. When handled, it frequently discharges its viscid secretion, but as frequently neglects to do it when handled for the first time after a long interval, but more especially when touched or taken up for three or four times in rapid succession. It has been kept in an old sardine tin with small pieces of decayed wood, which were taken from the stump in which it was found, and the wood is kept in a moist condition. The locality from which it was obtained was the Hoorubea Creek, about twenty miles from Georgetown, on the east coast of the Demerara River, close to the meeting-point of an extensive forest and a water savannah. The four specimens were obtained in the same locality; and, though I have sought for them continually in other places, up to the present I have been unable to find others. From the long period of time during which this specimen has survived in confinement, I think there will be no difficulty, when I have obtained a large number of specimens, in sending them alive to England to Prof. Moseley and others. Unfortunately I have no possible access here to any literature on the group. I do not think it is generally known, but Mr. Im Thurn has once previously found specimens of Peripatus in the Essequebo division of British Guiana. His specimens were, however, very small ones.","dc.creator":["QUELCH, JOHN J."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["QUELCH, JOHN J."],"citation_author_institution":["British Guiana Museum,"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Peripatus in Demerara","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Peripatus in Demerara&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"034312c0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

I had supposed the book entirely out of print; and the last reprint of a very few copies to meet a small demand still existing, chiefly in England, was made entirely without my knowledge or consent. On its very face the whole aspect of the book is antiquated; but in it there was brought together certain positive knowledge in connection with the weighing and measuring of a\u00ebriform matter, derived chiefly from the classical researches of Regnault, which is still of great importance and not readily found elsewhere; and this is, unquestionably, the reason of the continued demand for a compilation made more than twenty-five years ago. I have, until within a few years, had the expectation of revising the book and presenting the old facts in their new dress, but the failure of my sight has obliged me to give up the plan, and younger men must do the work.","dc.creator":["COOKE, JOSIAH PARSONS"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["COOKE, JOSIAH PARSONS"],"citation_author_institution":["Cambridge, U.S.A."],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Cooke's \u201cChemical Physics\u201d","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Cooke&#39;s &#8220;Chemical Physics&#8221;&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"035151a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The sky was cloudless, except a long thundercloud which extended from near south-south-west to almost south-south-east, the upper portion of this cloud being about 12\u00b0 above the horizon. From this, cloud issued from one to three streams of conspicuous white light, the north-easterly stream being the largest and brightest, and this continued visible from 9.40 until 10.5 (the others were only seen for five minutes). The streams were at an angle of about 53\u00b0, and moved slowly easterly (the cloud moving in the same direction). The longest stream reached an altitude of 25\u00b0, and at 10 o'clock exactly (G.M.T.) the base was immediately over the Avonmouth Lighthouse. The light of the streams was more persistent and less flickering than is usually the case with aurora borealis.","dc.creator":["LOWE, E.

Many years since, I captured a viper on Cannock Chase, in Staffordshire. The animal was rather sluggish, so I got it into a box unhurt, and carried it home. There I shook it out on to the ground. There came out first the slimy body of a Lacerta vivipara, followed by a thinner and livelier viper than that which had entered the prison.

Many years since, I captured a viper on Cannock Chase, in Staffordshire. The animal was rather sluggish, so I got it into a box unhurt, and carried it home. There I shook it out on to the ground. There came out first the slimy body of a Lacerta vivipara, followed by a thinner and livelier viper than that which had entered the prison. This result was not surprising, for the victim was about half as long as the swallower, which may explain the ejection of the former when the latter exchanged the fresh air of the Chase for a stuffy box.

The cones were seen, and one of them handled, by myself and many members of the Geologists' Association five years ago, when we were entertained at luncheon by our excellent Rural Dean, the Rev. J. T. Brown, Rector of St. Paul's, Wokingham. The fact will be found recorded in the Proc. Geol. Assoc., vol. ix. p. 223. The other instance was a few years earlier, and the tree which bore the cones is, I believe, still standing on the lawn of Sandhurst Rectory.

The cones were seen, and one of them handled, by myself and many members of the Geologists' Association five years ago, when we were entertained at luncheon by our excellent Rural Dean, the Rev. J. T. Brown, Rector of St. Paul's, Wokingham. The fact will be found recorded in the Proc. Geol. Assoc., vol. ix. p. 223. The other instance was a few years earlier, and the tree which bore the cones is, I believe, still standing on the lawn of Sandhurst Rectory.

The whole appearance of trees and air and sky was very beautiful. Some of the trees caught a large quantity of snow, fastened to the branches in a form resembling elliptical cylinders, of which the lower lines of the branches were elements. I made some measurements on the extremities of drooping branches of an elm-tree on our lower campus. One twig with a diameter of 0\u02d921 inch sustained a mass of snow with diameters of 2\u02d950 and 2\u02d933 inches; a second, 0\u02d915 inch in diameter, carried snow the diameters of which were 2\u02d930 and 1\u02d993 inches; so that the area of the cross-sections of this snow was not far from 120 and 153 times that of the twigs which supported it. Two other measurements were still more remarkable. In one the twig was one-tenth of an inch in diameter, and the mass of snow had diameters of 2\u02d940 and 1\u02d975 inches, making the area of the sections 420 times that of the wood; and in the other, a twig 0\u02d911 inch in diameter, carried snow with diameters of 2\u02d950 and 2\u02d905 inches, so that the area of the sections of the snow was 424 times that of the wood. The snow was so loosely attached to the branches that it seemed impossible to make accurate measurements of the weight of the twigs and of the snow which was piled up on them; but the ratio of the weights was, of course, by no means equal to the ratio of the sections\u2014which was practically that of the bulks\u2014of the wood and the snow.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"43","prism.number":"1113","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"391","prism.endingPage":"391","prism.copyright":"1891 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/043391a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/043391a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/043391a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/043391a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Snow on the Branches of Trees","citation_volume":"43","citation_issue":"1113","citation_publication_date":"1891/02","citation_firstpage":"391","citation_lastpage":"391","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/043391a0","DOI":"10.1038/043391a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/043391a0","description":"FOLLOWING upon the remarkable ice-storm of which I wrote you last month (NATURE, February 5, p. 317), we have had a wonderful and beautiful display of the amount of snow which the branches of trees can bear.

The first storm appeared over the east of the Bay of Bengal, in about lat. 15\u00b0 N., on May 20. The centre crossed the bay on a W.N.W. track during the 21st and 22nd, and appeared on the Orissa coast on the 23rd. Here it slowly recurved and followed a N., N.E., and E. course, finally passing away on May 29 or 30 into Assam and Manipur.

For myself, I welcome any quaternionic innovations that may (ultimately) tend in the direction of the standpoint assumed by Prof. Gibbs and others, and foresaw some two years since (when a very bulky manuscript came to me for my opinion) that there would be some quaternionic upstirring.","dc.creator":["HEAVISIDE, OLIVER"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["HEAVISIDE, OLIVER"],"citation_author_institution":["Paignton, Devon"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Quaternionic Innovations","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Quaternionic Innovations&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"049432d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

JOLY'S strictures on the units of heat at present in use will meet with a ready endorsement from those who have worked on calorimetry. The large calorie is too large for convenience in most cases, and the small calorie is too small, while the confusion created by different writers using different units with the same name is scarcely reduced by their writing one with a capital and the other with a small c.

It was found in a curved iron pipe intended to deliver water from a well at the baths, and appears not to have been used for some time. The entire length of the pipe was four feet, and the diameter five inches.

In the Spey district of Scotland, for instance, the great increase of distilleries, both in number and in malting capacity, has in recent years so increased the effluent that although any one distillery may not in itself seriously pollute so large a body of water as the Spey, yet their joint effluent is so great, it is alleged, that the pollution is serious, prejudicially affecting fish life, spawning and the taking of the fly by salmon, and rendering the river otherwise unfit for primary uses. Be these allegations true or false, the fact remains that at the present moment interdict hangs over one distillery\u2014the Macallan Glenlivet Distillery\u2014and if no method is found of avoiding the discharge and consequent fungoid growth, &c., there is no saying what may be the issue and ultimate result to what is now a very large industry. It is not proposed to discuss the two sides of the question\u2014the maintenance of the industry or the preservation of the purity of such a fine river as the Spey, or other rivers similarly situated\u2014but rather to consider what can be done to meet both sides. Now it may be held as true that there is no operation to which the burnt ale or spent lees of a distillery can practically be subjected to, that will render the effluent innocuous. The effluent may be evaporated or spread over irrigation fields, or treated with chemicals or charcoal, and yet the processes are in one way or another defective; and there appears but one solution, not to pass the effluent into the rivers, but take it away in pipes or barges to the sea. In many cases this is quite impracticable, even by the joint action of a number of distilleries; but in some cases the effluent has successfully been taken miles in pipes and discharged into the sea. As is known from large experience in outfall pipes for sewage and paper works effluents, it requires a carefully designed arrangement, the cost of which can only be determined after a minute survey; and usually the cost turns out to be too great, and then there appears to be one solution by passing the effluent out in the form of a fine spray from the top of a high chimney or iron lattice tower. The natural question at once asked is: But you pollute the air instead of the water, and what the better are you for doing so? In the first place, what is discharged is not a gas which, if of a noxious quality, might hurt by being inhaled. It is not like soot, which might leave a black mark on your face or clothes. The spray, if it fell on your skin or clothes, could do you no harm, or at least infinitesimal harm. It is not a poisonous liquid, as cattle can drink it. If it fell on trees or grass, except in large quantities, which would not be the case, it would not burn them. Pollution of air is not objected to unless it be in great excess; indeed, we all pollute the air to our neighbours' and our own disadvantage. We send out gases and smoke from our chimneys, which find their way to our neighbours' carpets and curtains and clothes, and we put out the foulest of gas\u2014viz. sewer gas\u2014daily and hourly from the ventilating pipes of our modern house drains, and many of our factories, electric light stations, &c, pass out gases which individually one would say would be sufficient to affect a whole city.

I.

The method was based on the supposition that the light emitted by the particles, in virtue of their incandescence, so overpowers the reflected sun-light that the lines are invisible. That the coronal light is strongly polarised is well known, and there is scarcely any doubt but that the polarised light is reflected sun-light. If, now, a Nicol prism be placed before the slit of the spectroscope in such a position as to transmit the polarised radiations, these will be allowed to pass with almost undiminished intensity, while the emitted or unpolarised light will be reduced in intensity by one-half. The great change in the ratio resulting might easily be sufficient to bring out the dark lines distinctly. I feel firmly convinced that this experiment should be tried at the Sumatra eclipse of next May, for I have successfully accomplished it in the laboratory with an artificial corona. It was found that a gas flame in a strong beam of sun-light shone with a pure bluish-white light, due to the reflection or rather scattering of the sun-light by the minute carbon particles.1 The flame thus illuminated showed the Fra\u00fcnhofer lines distinctly, but by reducing the intensity of the sun-light a point was reached at which they disappeared, and the spectrum appeared continuous. The light scattered by the flame was found to be completely plane polarised in certain directions, giving us just the required conditions, namely, particles emitting a continuous spectrum, and scattering a polarised solar spectrum. In front of the slit of the spectroscope a Nicol prism was arranged in such a manner that it could be drawn into and out of position by a cord. The Fra\u00fcnhofer lines could be made to appear by sliding the Nicol in front of the slit, and disappear by drawing it away.

One can hardly imagine normal upper and lower arm bones shifting into the ill-drawn shapes into which I have sketched the bones. The radius and ulna of both arms, instead of being much shorter than the humerus, would, if inserted, be longer. If the left humerus of the figure is assumed to be correct in length as shown from A to B in my added black line, then the true length of the ulna should only reach from B to C, and not be half as long again as in the painting. On the other hand, if the length of the right ulna is considered correct as from D to E in my added black line, then the humerus would, in nature, reach from E to F\u2014assuming the relative proportions of humerus and ulna to be 13 and 10\u00bd.

As, of course, you are well aware, all priority in scientific discovery depends upon publication. In the case of the medical man mentioned in the article there has never been any publication of scientific facts, and the reference to the comparative immunity of the small intestine from cancer has a very different scientific explanation from that given in the British Medical Journal, 1906, p. 715. The real reason is the very small extent of the original piece of gut, out of which, by growth within itself, the mammalian small intestine is developed. If the explanation given by this medical man were correct, the c\"cum ought to be as immune from cancer as the lower end of the small intestine.

As, of course, you are well aware, all priority in scientific discovery depends upon publication. In the case of the medical man mentioned in the article there has never been any publication of scientific facts, and the reference to the comparative immunity of the small intestine from cancer has a very different scientific explanation from that given in the British Medical Journal, 1906, p. 715. The real reason is the very small extent of the original piece of gut, out of which, by growth within itself, the mammalian small intestine is developed. If the explanation given by this medical man were correct, the c\"cum ought to be as immune from cancer as the lower end of the small intestine.

The construction of this apparatus for demonstration purposes will well repay the teacher and student.

The preface to his collected works, published in the following year, contains a charmingly written memoir of him from the pen of his friend W. K\u00fchne, the accomplished Heidelberg physiologist. The obituary notice of Koch in NATURE rightly stressed the immense value to bacteriology of his invention of the plate-method for obtaining pure cultures of micro-organisms. The incident reported by K\u00fchne in his memoir of Cohnheim has reference to that, and to Cohnheim's contact with Koch in consequence of it in the year 1875. At that time Cohnheim was already full professor of pathology in the University of Breslau, and his brilliance as an investigator was already attracting to his laboratory men of promise from all parts.

The preface to his collected works, published in the following year, contains a charmingly written memoir of him from the pen of his friend W. K\u00fchne, the accomplished Heidelberg physiologist. The obituary notice of Koch in NATURE rightly stressed the immense value to bacteriology of his invention of the plate-method for obtaining pure cultures of micro-organisms. The incident reported by K\u00fchne in his memoir of Cohnheim has reference to that, and to Cohnheim's contact with Koch in consequence of it in the year 1875. At that time Cohnheim was already full professor of pathology in the University of Breslau, and his brilliance as an investigator was already attracting to his laboratory men of promise from all parts. Koch, on the other hand, was in country practice in Silesia, and quite unknown to the scientific world. Koch's discovery of the plate-method led to Cohnheim's discovery of Koch, and the enthusiasm and remarkable prevision at once shown by the young professor of pathology regarding his unknown compeer, only two years younger than himself, are strikingly told by K\u00fchne.

The Rio Tinto, known by the Phoenicians as 'Ur-yero', or 'River of Fire', because of its deep red colour and high acidity, flows through the world's largest pyritic belt in southwestern Spain. Surprisingly, eukaryotic microbes are the principal contributors of biomass in this hostile river, which has a pH of 2 and contains much higher concentrations of heavy metals than are typically found in fresh waters.

The Rio Tinto, known by the Phoenicians as 'Ur-yero', or 'River of Fire', because of its deep red colour and high acidity, flows through the world's largest pyritic belt in southwestern Spain. Surprisingly, eukaryotic microbes are the principal contributors of biomass in this hostile river, which has a pH of 2 and contains much higher concentrations of heavy metals than are typically found in fresh waters. Here we show that the Rio Tinto shows an unexpected degree of eukaryotic diversity and includes new lineages that we have identified by sequence analysis of genes encoding small-subunit ribosomal RNAs.

They acquire antigens in peripheral tissues and migrate to lymphoid organs where they present processed peptides to T cells. DCs must therefore exist in distinct functional states, an idea that is supported by observations that they downregulate endocytosis and upregulate surface molecules of the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) upon maturation4,5,6,7. Here we investigate the features of DC maturation by reconstituting the terminal differentiation of mouse DCs in vitro and in situ. We find that early DCs, corresponding to those found in peripheral tissues, exhibit a phenotype in which most class II molecules are intracellular and localized to lysosomes. Upon maturation, these cells give rise to a new intermediate phenotype in which intracellular class II molecules are found in peripheral non-lysosomal vesicles, similar to the specialized CIIV population seen in B cells. The intermediate cells then differentiate into late DCs which express almost all of their class II molecules on the plasma membrane. These variations in class II compartmentalization are accompanied by dramatic alterations in the intracellular transport of the new class II molecules and in antigen presentation. We found that although early DCs could not present antigen immediately after uptake, efficient presentation of the previously internalized antigen occurred after maturation, 24\u201348 hours later.

DCs must therefore exist in distinct functional states, an idea that is supported by observations that they downregulate endocytosis and upregulate surface molecules of the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) upon maturation4,5,6,7. Here we investigate the features of DC maturation by reconstituting the terminal differentiation of mouse DCs in vitro and in situ. We find that early DCs, corresponding to those found in peripheral tissues, exhibit a phenotype in which most class II molecules are intracellular and localized to lysosomes. Upon maturation, these cells give rise to a new intermediate phenotype in which intracellular class II molecules are found in peripheral non-lysosomal vesicles, similar to the specialized CIIV population seen in B cells. The intermediate cells then differentiate into late DCs which express almost all of their class II molecules on the plasma membrane. These variations in class II compartmentalization are accompanied by dramatic alterations in the intracellular transport of the new class II molecules and in antigen presentation. We found that although early DCs could not present antigen immediately after uptake, efficient presentation of the previously internalized antigen occurred after maturation, 24\u201348 hours later. By regulating class II transport and compartmentalization, DCs are able to delay antigen display, a property crucial to their role in immune surveillance.","dc.creator":["Pierre, Philippe","Turley, Shannon J.","Gatti, Evelina","Hull, Michael","Meltzer, Joseph","Mirza, Asra","Inaba, Kayo","Steinman, Ralph M.","Mellman, Ira"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Annu.

The landmass known as Beringia is an extensive region that existed during the Pleistocene epoch and included the land bridge between present-day Siberia and Alaska, now submerged beneath the Bering Strait.

Experimental studies have shown that the introduction of predators can cause rapid evolution of defensive morphologies and behaviours in prey1,2,3,4,5 and chemical defences in plants6,7. Such defences may be constitutively expressed (phenotypically fixed) or induced when predators initially attack8,9,10. Here we show that non-lethal exposure of an animal to carnivores, and a plant to a herbivore, not only induces a defence, but causes the attacked organisms to produce offspring that are better defended than offspring from unthreatened parents. This transgenerational effect, referred to as a maternally induced defence, is in contrast to the more common defences induced in single individuals within a generation. Transgenerational induction of defences is a new level of phenotypic plasticity across generations that may be an important component of predator\u2013prey interactions.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"401","prism.number":"6748","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"60","prism.endingPage":"63","prism.copyright":"1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltd.","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/43425","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/43425","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/43425.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/43425","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Transgenerational induction of defences in animals and plants","citation_volume":"401","citation_issue":"6748","citation_publication_date":"1999/09","citation_firstpage":"60","citation_lastpage":"63","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/43425","DOI":"10.1038/43425","citation_doi":"10.1038/43425","description":"Predators are potent agents of natural selection in biological communities. Experimental studies have shown that the introduction of predators can cause rapid evolution of defensive morphologies and behaviours in prey1,2,3,4,5 and chemical defences in plants6,7.

We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to define the clonal architecture in eight sAML genomes and identified the range of variant allele frequencies (VAFs) for founding clone mutations. At least one mutation or cytogenetic abnormality was detected in 83% of the 150 MDS patients and 17 genes were significantly mutated (false discovery rate \u2a7d0.05). Individual genes and patient samples displayed a wide range of VAFs for recurrently mutated genes, indicating that no single gene is exclusively mutated in the founding clone.

We developed a volumetric multispectral optoacoustic tomography platform for imaging neural activation deep in scattering brains. It can record 100 volumetric frames per second across scalable fields of view ranging between 50 and 1000\u2009mm3 with respective spatial resolution of 35\u2013200\u2009\u03bcm. Experiments performed in immobilized and freely swimming larvae and in adult zebrafish brains expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP5G demonstrate, for the first time, the fundamental ability to directly track neural dynamics using optoacoustics while overcoming the longstanding penetration barrier of optical imaging in scattering brains. The newly developed platform thus offers unprecedented capabilities for functional whole-brain observations of fast calcium dynamics; in combination with optoacoustics' well-established capacity for resolving vascular hemodynamics, it could open new vistas in the study of neural activity and neurovascular coupling in health and disease. Scientists from Germany and Israel have developed an optoacoustic tomography method that can directly image fast neural activity in whole scattering brains. The team led by Daniel Razansky at the Helmholtz Center and Technical University in Munich and Shy Shoham from the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology discovered that genetically encoded calcium indicators have an optoacoustic signature and devised a rapid functional optoacoustic neuro-tomography system that can simultaneously record neural activity across volumes of 50 to 1000 cubic mm at 10 msec temporal resolution. The breakthrough technique was used to image the indicator GCaMP5G across adult zebrafish brains, thus overcoming the longstanding problem of light scattering that hindered penetration depth of fluorescence microscopy. The team says the technique could be readily customized to work with additional probes operating at longer wavelengths.","prism.publicationName":"Light: Science & Applications","prism.publicationDate":"2016-08-15","prism.volume":"5","prism.number":"12","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"e16201","prism.endingPage":"e16201","prism.copyright":"2016 The Author(s)","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa2016201","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2016.201","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa2016201.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/lsa2016201","citation_journal_title":"Light: Science & Applications","citation_journal_abbrev":"Light Sci Appl","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"2047-7538","citation_title":"Functional optoacoustic neuro-tomography for scalable whole-brain monitoring of calcium indicators","citation_volume":"5","citation_issue":"12","citation_publication_date":"2016/12","citation_online_date":"2016/08/15","citation_firstpage":"e16201","citation_lastpage":"e16201","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/lsa.2016.201","DOI":"10.1038/lsa.2016.201","citation_doi":"10.1038/lsa.2016.201","description":"Non-invasive observation of spatiotemporal activity of large neural populations distributed over entire brains is a longstanding goal of neuroscience.

Here, we present the first report of low-voltage high-gain phototransistors based on perovskite/organic-semiconductor vertical heterojunctions, which show ultrahigh responsivities of ~109A\u00a0W\u20131 and specific detectivities of ~1014 Jones in a broadband region from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. The high sensitivity of the devices is attributed to a pronounced photogating effect that is mainly due to the long carrier lifetimes and strong light absorption in the perovskite material. In addition, flexible perovskite photodetectors have been successfully prepared via a solution process and show high sensitivity as well as excellent flexibility and bending durability. The high performance and facile solution-based fabrication of the perovskite/organic-semiconductor phototransistors indicate their promise for potential application for ultrasensitive broadband photodetection.

The excellent optoelectronic properties of organolead halide perovskites make them promising for various optoelectronic devices.

Their high sensitivity is attributed mainly to the strong light absorption and long charge carrier lifetimes of the perovskite.

However, several challenges currently exist in diagnosing MAP accurately at the molecular and neurocognitive level before the MAP model can contribute to the discovery of SCZ biomarkers. We directly assessed subcortical brain structural volumes and clinical parameters of MAP within the framework of an integrative genome-wide RNA-Seq blood transcriptome analysis of subjects diagnosed with MAP (N=10), METH dependency without psychosis (MA; N=10) and healthy controls (N=10). First, we identified discrete groups of co-expressed genes (that is, modules) and tested them for functional annotation and phenotypic relationships to brain structure volumes, life events and psychometric measurements. We discovered one MAP-associated module involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis downregulation, enriched with 61 genes previously found implicated in psychosis and SCZ across independent blood and post-mortem brain studies using convergent functional genomic (CFG) evidence. This module demonstrated significant relationships with brain structure volumes including the anterior corpus callosum (CC) and the nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, a second MAP and psychoticism-associated module involved in circadian clock upregulation was also enriched with 39 CFG genes, further associated with the CC. Subsequently, a machine-learning analysis of differentially expressed genes identified single blood-based biomarkers able to differentiate controls from methamphetamine dependents with 87% accuracy and MAP from MA subjects with 95% accuracy.

However, several challenges currently exist in diagnosing MAP accurately at the molecular and neurocognitive level before the MAP model can contribute to the discovery of SCZ biomarkers. We directly assessed subcortical brain structural volumes and clinical parameters of MAP within the framework of an integrative genome-wide RNA-Seq blood transcriptome analysis of subjects diagnosed with MAP (N=10), METH dependency without psychosis (MA; N=10) and healthy controls (N=10). First, we identified discrete groups of co-expressed genes (that is, modules) and tested them for functional annotation and phenotypic relationships to brain structure volumes, life events and psychometric measurements. We discovered one MAP-associated module involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis downregulation, enriched with 61 genes previously found implicated in psychosis and SCZ across independent blood and post-mortem brain studies using convergent functional genomic (CFG) evidence. This module demonstrated significant relationships with brain structure volumes including the anterior corpus callosum (CC) and the nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, a second MAP and psychoticism-associated module involved in circadian clock upregulation was also enriched with 39 CFG genes, further associated with the CC. Subsequently, a machine-learning analysis of differentially expressed genes identified single blood-based biomarkers able to differentiate controls from methamphetamine dependents with 87% accuracy and MAP from MA subjects with 95% accuracy. CFG evidence validated a significant proportion of these putative MAP biomarkers in independent studies including CLN3, FBP1, TBC1D2 and ZNF821 (RNA degradation), ELK3 and SINA3 (circadian clock) and PIGF and UHMK1 (ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis). Finally, focusing analysis on brain structure volumes revealed significantly lower bilateral hippocampal volumes in MAP subjects. Overall, these results suggest similar molecular and neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of psychosis and SCZ regardless of substance abuse and provide preliminary evidence supporting the MAP paradigm as an exemplar for SCZ biomarker discovery.","dc.creator":["Breen, M S","Uhlmann, A","Nday, C M","Glatt, S J","Mitt, M","Metsalpu, A","Stein, D J","Illing, N"],"dc.subject":["Diagnostic markers","Molecular neuroscience"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Mol Cells; citation_title=Gene expression profiling of the rewarding effect caused by methamphetamine in the mesolimbic dopamine system; citation_author=MH Yang, MS Jung, MJ Lee, KH Yoo, YJ Yook, EY Park; citation_volume=26; citation_publication_date=2008; citation_pages=121-130; citation_id=CR1","United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.
