The three separate instances given in which the dogs showed a violent antipathy to butchers, either without seeing them or when they were dressed as gentlemen, clearly indicates that it was through the sense of smell that the painful sensation was experienced; and this is quite in accordance with the wonderful delicacy and importance of this sense in most animals, and especially in dogs. It is natural to suppose that some ancestor of these dogs was systematically and cruelly ill-treated by several butchers, perhaps from some thievish propensity or other bad habit which required frequent punishment, so that the smell of a butcher came to be invariably associated with pain and a desire for revenge. But the most important fact to observe is, that there must be some peculiar odour developed in human beings by constant contact with flesh, which a dog can recognise apart from individual peculiarities and in spite of perfect disguise. Now the power many animals possess to find their way back over a road they have travelled blindfolded (shut up in a basket inside a coach for example) has generally been considered to be an undoubted case of true instinct. But it seems to me that an animal so circumstanced will have its attention necessarily active, owing to its desire to get out of its confinement, and that by means of its most acute and only available sense it will take note of the sucsessive odours of the way, which will leave on its mind a series of images as distinct and prominent as those we should receive by the sense of sight.

Lake George, which is generally considered the largest sheet of fresh water on the Continent, is only some twenty-three or twenty-four miles in length and seven miles in breadth at the widest part, and even this lake had no existence twenty-four years ago. A bit of swampy ground across which drays could pass, occupied, in 1852, what is now the lowest part of the lake-bottom, and the rest was taken up by squatters and small farmers, who little dreamed, when they settled on the rich alluvial plain, that within a few years they would be hopelessly driven from their homes by the advancing waters. The present lake is situated, at an elevation of about 2,000 feet above the sea, at the lower end of a shallow basin formed by a fork near the southern extremity of the Blue Mountains, and about 150 miles from Sydney. This basin is some forty to fifty miles in length, and from fifteen to twenty miles in breadth, the mountains rising somewhat rapidly to a height of several hundreds of feet on every side except the south.

That the minor planets could never have passed the major planets, as they would be certainly caught by them during the immense number of revolutions in which their orbits would be nearly equal. Therefore the earth cannot have dropped in from much farther than Jupiter's present orbit; for if during its revolutions it came within one-sixth of the distance from Jupiter that it now is from the sun, it would be mastered by Jupiter. 2. By the retardation of Encke's comet it seems that if the comet had the same orbit as the earth, its distance from the sun would diminish about 1/25000 per year. But for any appreciable lengthening of the earth's life-period, the earth must have started much more than one-tenth farther from the sun than it now is; that is to say, it must fall in much quicker than at the rate of its present distance from the sun in 108 years. This shows that the individual portions of Encke's comet must be much more than two miles in diameter, even supposing it to have as great a mean density as the earth, and to consist of a shower of solid meteors. Thus if the earth's history should be lengthened by any important amount from this cause, the nucleus of Encke's comet must consist of a shower of bodies of as great a density as the earth, and of a considerable size, each weighing very much more than 100,000,000 tons. And considering that there must be thousands of such bodies to compose it, the total mass would be greatly beyond what is considered possible. 3.

I therefore take the liberty to invite friends of science to make such observations in accordance with the system which I have introduced in Scandinavia; a schedule for recording observations, along with the necessary instructions, will be sent to any one who, before the end of August, informs me of his name and address.","dc.creator":["TROMHOLT, SOPHUS"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["TROMHOLT, SOPHUS"],"citation_author_institution":["Professor of Mathematics Bergen, Norway"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Auroral Observations","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Auroral Observations&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"022338a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It was easy to count ten or a dozen such sheep in a flock, and when one was missing it was pretty safe to conclude that a good many had strayed with it, so that the shepherd really kept count of his fleck by counting his speckled sheep. As fences were erected the flocks were made smaller, and the necessity for having these spotted sheep passed away. Their wool also being of small value the practice soon grew of killing them off as lambs, or so young that they had small chance of breeding, and it surprised me how at the end of my sheep-farming experience of about eight years the percentage of coloured lambs produced was so much smaller than at the beginning. As the quantity of coloured wool from Australia seems to have much diminished, the above experience would appear to be general.\u201d","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"23","prism.number":"583","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"193","prism.endingPage":"193","prism.copyright":"1880 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/023193a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/023193a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/023193a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/023193a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Black Sheep","citation_volume":"23","citation_issue":"583","citation_publication_date":"1880/12","citation_firstpage":"193","citation_lastpage":"193","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/023193a0","DOI":"10.1038/023193a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/023193a0","description":"THE following extract of a letter from Mr. Sanderson of Chislehurst, who permits me to publish it, seems worth placing on record.

It was easy to count ten or a dozen such sheep in a flock, and when one was missing it was pretty safe to conclude that a good many had strayed with it, so that the shepherd really kept count of his fleck by counting his speckled sheep. As fences were erected the flocks were made smaller, and the necessity for having these spotted sheep passed away. Their wool also being of small value the practice soon grew of killing them off as lambs, or so young that they had small chance of breeding, and it surprised me how at the end of my sheep-farming experience of about eight years the percentage of coloured lambs produced was so much smaller than at the beginning. As the quantity of coloured wool from Australia seems to have much diminished, the above experience would appear to be general.\u201d","dc.creator":["DARWIN, CHARLES"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["DARWIN, CHARLES"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Black Sheep","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Black Sheep&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"023267d0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The contrast of colours was very striking, but there was little difference in size. In a letter recently received from the Rev. Mr. Webb, I find that it was previously observed by him, and it appears as one of his own discoveries in the second edition of \u201cCelestial Objects,\u201d published in 1868. The red star is there classed as 6.5 mag., and the blue as 8.

The contrast of colours was very striking, but there was little difference in size. In a letter recently received from the Rev. Mr. Webb, I find that it was previously observed by him, and it appears as one of his own discoveries in the second edition of \u201cCelestial Objects,\u201d published in 1868. The red star is there classed as 6.5 mag., and the blue as 8. The two stars, therefore, appeared to differ very considerably in magnitude when seen by Mr. Webb, while to me, eleven years subsequently, they seemed quite nearly equal. Hence I conclude that the red is a variable, and I wish to call the attention of observers to it while it still remains in view.

Mr. W. H. Dall, of the Smithsonian Institution, had previously, in a letter to me, dated October 24, expressed a similar opinion. I have been unable to procure for examination and comparison a specimen of the North American shell, and am consequently compelled to arrive at a conclusion from a study of Mr. Meek's figure and description in the report npon the \u201cUnited States Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel,\u201d vol. iv., pp. 176-178, woodcut 6, and plate 17, figs. 19-19a.

If you reduce the temperature you reduce the capacity of air for vapour, first by its reducing the capillary attraction, and secondly, by reducing one of the conditions that makes OH2 a vapour. If you reduce the pressure, you enlarge the spaces between the molecules and reduce the capillary attraction, if I may apply this term to a gas. This is borne out by the balloon ascents of Mr. Glaisher. At 4 miles high the temperature was 8\u00b0, the dew-point was - 15\u00b0, or a difference of 23\u00b0; at 5 miles it was 28\u00b0, and at 30,000 feet he states that there is no doubt that the dew-point is a difference of 50\u00b0; that is, the higher, the less vapour. But this will not be the case with marsh gas, as it is a permanent gas, and being of less density than even vapour, or about half the density of air, there is no reason why it should not be found in larger quantities at greater altitudes; and I think that its effect there would be that in the temperate zones and at the poles it would radiate its temperature of say from -8 at 30,000 to -30, and produce cold and rain, snow and floods as the storms on the Alps and the floods on the Continent, and in the Tropics to make the nights colder.

With the exception of about nine days of unfavourable weather, I have seen several meteors night and morning throughout October, but they were generally small and transient. I have counted fifty-two from 10 p.m. of October 3 to 4.30 a.m. of the 4th, many of them large and of several seconds' duration. The largest of these passed slowly from the first bright star on the left of Capella, in Auriga, to a point about 1\u00b0 below \u03b1 Cygni. The smallest of them blinked rapidly before the eye in the zenith over the Milky Way, which, this night, was the principal theatre of their display. From 3.30 to 4.30 a.m. I counted forty of the fifty-two meteors. From 1 a.m. to 4 of October 8 I observed very brilliant meteors. One at 2.25 a.m. darted from about 1\u00b0 above Capella and disappeared at a point \u00bd\u00b0 from Phad in the Plough, without exploding and without leaving any trace of light behind. It was as large as Venus. At 2.40 a.m. a very large and brilliant meteor dashed out from a point midway between Capella and the first bright star to its right in Auriga, and sped along above the Pleiades and Aries through the Square of Pegasus, and exploded 3\u00b0 beyond it, leaving no fire in its wake. October 15, 11.38 p.m., a very unusual meteor sailed slowly from \u03b2 Ceti to within 1\u00b0 of Betelgueux, in the right shoulder of Orion. After travelling two-thirds of its journey, it exploded into four, three of which formed the head of an arrow, and the fourth adorned its tail, all the four sending out bright nebulous light behind them. At 2.50 a.m., October 26, a large ball of fire (bolide), apparently seven inches in diameter, illumined the heavens with great brilliancy as it descended from about midway between the third and fourth bright stars on the left of Capella, exploding twice during the last half of its journey, and disappearing just as it reached the moon. It had no tail. It was seen by some of the Paisley night police, and one of them was frightened that it would dash the moon out of the heavens. This bolide had no detonation in either of its two explosions, and the last of it was only about the size of Jupiter. One policeman describes it as a large fiery ball of the size of the full moon, but this is an exaggeration. The extraordinary meteor of October 15, after its explosion, was described by an ob erver as a wellformed arrow of flaming fire, followed by a ball of fire with a tail. To me it appeared to resemble the head and body of a fish, as well as the form of an arrow.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"29","prism.number":"733","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"56","prism.endingPage":"56","prism.copyright":"1883 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029056b0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/029056b0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029056b0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/029056b0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Meteors","citation_volume":"29","citation_issue":"733","citation_publication_date":"1883/11","citation_firstpage":"56","citation_lastpage":"56","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/029056b0","DOI":"10.1038/029056b0","citation_doi":"10.1038/029056b0","description":"THE meteors during October have been numerous, and the most of them proceeded from some point in Auriga.

But the two cases are very different. Even apart from the unconscious corroboration to which he alludes (and which as evidence of a fact I consider better than even verification by the same observer), we must remember that the stirring of water for a long time in the same direction with its paw is not quite so habitual an action on the part of a bear as is the ordinary swimming movement on the part of a skate. As for any difficulty which the skate may have had in seeing the food approach its mouth, surely the fact of its opening its mouth when the food was near enough to grasp is no better evidence of design than of accident. In either case, under the conditions, and more especially the \u201cattitude,\u201d described, the seizure of the food at the proper moment can only be ascribed to the sense of smell, which in the skate is so highly developed. Lastly, why does your correspondent begin by saying that verification would have been desirable, and end by arguing that it would have been of no use?

But the two cases are very different. Even apart from the unconscious corroboration to which he alludes (and which as evidence of a fact I consider better than even verification by the same observer), we must remember that the stirring of water for a long time in the same direction with its paw is not quite so habitual an action on the part of a bear as is the ordinary swimming movement on the part of a skate. As for any difficulty which the skate may have had in seeing the food approach its mouth, surely the fact of its opening its mouth when the food was near enough to grasp is no better evidence of design than of accident. In either case, under the conditions, and more especially the \u201cattitude,\u201d described, the seizure of the food at the proper moment can only be ascribed to the sense of smell, which in the skate is so highly developed. Lastly, why does your correspondent begin by saying that verification would have been desirable, and end by arguing that it would have been of no use? Even if the experiment had failed on repetition, he says, his inference would not thereby have been negatived. If this is so, assuredly there would have been no object in repeating the conditions.

In the hope that some further light may be thrown on the origin of the green-colouring matter of many Tertiary green earths, I would ask the favour of being allowed to solicit references to any foreign literature of the subject with which any of the numerous readers of NATURE may be acquainted.","dc.creator":["IRVING, A."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["IRVING, A."],"citation_author_institution":["Wellington College, Berks"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Green Colouring-matter of Decaying Wood","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Green Colouring-matter of Decaying Wood&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"037584b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It moved very slowly to the east, and, after a duration of about 13 seconds, disappeared at the point R.A. 11\u00b0, Decl. + 8\u00b0. Its place of first appearance was near R.A. 332\u00b0, Decl. 7\u00bd\u00b0, so that the length of its observed path was about 42\u00b0. The nucleus was followed by a thick train of sparks, and at the end it divided into two parts. This meteor was observed at Oxford by Mr. W. H. Robinson, of the Radcliffe Observatory.

The Bristol observer watched the meteor through 91 miles of its course, and the duration of 13 seconds would give a velocity of 7 miles per second.

In each case only two eggs were laid, and the breeder himself, without being able to tell why, is of opinion that nearly all his hatches consisted of male birds. As there are still many embryos of those Eclectus in my hands, the sex of which is not yet determined, I hope to be able to make known the result of my investigation later, whether the pairs are always males, or always females, or consist of a male and a female bird, at least sometimes. Meanwhile, I should be glad to hear if anything more is known about the sexes of birds which lay only two eggs at a time.","dc.creator":["MEYER, A.

It was much larger than Jupiter, which was on my right, in the constellation Pisces, shining to the best advantage on a dark blue sky. After the retina of my eye got clear of the dazzling light of the meteor, I turned to Jupiter, which was in a favourable condition for comparison, the clouds being opportunely absent, but it looked at least three times smaller than the meteor, which, indeed, was entitled to be called a fire-ball. It illuminated the whole district with the brilliancy of the noonday sun. I traced it back through Mira Ceti, and to the right of Mesartum Arietis, into the direction of Andromed\u00e6. This magnificent meteor exploded near the earth, without any detonation. The light was perfectly white.

It was much larger than Jupiter, which was on my right, in the constellation Pisces, shining to the best advantage on a dark blue sky. After the retina of my eye got clear of the dazzling light of the meteor, I turned to Jupiter, which was in a favourable condition for comparison, the clouds being opportunely absent, but it looked at least three times smaller than the meteor, which, indeed, was entitled to be called a fire-ball. It illuminated the whole district with the brilliancy of the noonday sun. I traced it back through Mira Ceti, and to the right of Mesartum Arietis, into the direction of Andromed\u00e6. This magnificent meteor exploded near the earth, without any detonation. The light was perfectly white. There was a very peculiar feature in the apparition of this meteor: it appeared to be very near to me, and between its body and the horizon behind it there seemed to be a vast distance. In its explosion it assumed very large dimensions, and the effulgence lasted for three seconds with undiminished splendour. In reality there were two explosions.

Moreover, the sparrows sometimes attack the flowers while still in the sheath, and before it is certain what colour they will be.","dc.creator":["MCLACHLAN, R."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MCLACHLAN, R."],"citation_author_institution":["Lewisham"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Sparrows and Crocuses.","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Sparrows and Crocuses.&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"045463b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A function of the time may well, with any assigned degree of accuracy and for any length of time, be approximately represented by a sum of circular functions, and nevertheless the periods, amplitudes, and phases may not approach definite values when the length of time for which the approximation is to hold good is increased indefinitely. I think this is quite clear from the example I have given in my last letter (p. 100), and it is not necessary to write out other examples. Now, Prof. Stoney shows how one may find by Fourier's theorem the amplitudes, periods, and phases of a sum of circular functions if one only knows the values of the sum. This deduction is not new to me. I worked out the same equations in a slightly different form, when Prof. Stoney's first letter made me further think about the subject. The deduction does also apply to functions that are approximately represented by a sum of circular functions, but only under the restriction that the time for which the approximation holds good is long in comparison to the longest period of the circular functions.

A function of the time may well, with any assigned degree of accuracy and for any length of time, be approximately represented by a sum of circular functions, and nevertheless the periods, amplitudes, and phases may not approach definite values when the length of time for which the approximation is to hold good is increased indefinitely. I think this is quite clear from the example I have given in my last letter (p. 100), and it is not necessary to write out other examples. Now, Prof. Stoney shows how one may find by Fourier's theorem the amplitudes, periods, and phases of a sum of circular functions if one only knows the values of the sum. This deduction is not new to me. I worked out the same equations in a slightly different form, when Prof. Stoney's first letter made me further think about the subject. The deduction does also apply to functions that are approximately represented by a sum of circular functions, but only under the restriction that the time for which the approximation holds good is long in comparison to the longest period of the circular functions. In chapter iv. of his paper \u201cOn the Cause of Double Lines, &c.\u201d (Transactions of the Royal Dublin Society, 1891), Prof. Stoney should have added this restriction.

AVELDON'S letter on this subject, in NATURE of May 3, calls, I think, for a few farther observations. He first criticises the statement that \u201cthe survival-mean must, on cessation of selection, fall to the birth-mean,\u201d by showing that there are probably cases in nature in which the survival and birth-means may coincide, owing to the removal by selection of all individuals above and below the mean, they being approximately equal in number. This is, no doubt, the case with certain characters of a species, but probably never with all or even with most characters. Darwin states that in France and Germany white pigeons are killed off by kites, and that on the coast of Ireland blick fowls are also killed off by sea-eagles. These and other analogous facts render it probable that in many species of animals colour is kept to the inconspicuous and protective mean tint by the elimination of all individuals which vary much on either side of it, and thus, as regards colour, the birth-mean and the surrival-mean may be almost identical. But with many other characters this is not the case. In sheep, cattle, and horses it has been observed that when the larger lowland breeds are taken to bleak mountain regions they gradually dwindle in size, only the smaller and hardier of each generation surviving the severe winter and spring climate and the comparatively innutritious food. Here the elimination is clearly in one main direction; and the absence of this selection due to the transference of the whole body of such reduced individuals to a milder climate and better pastures, would no doubt lead to a slight increase of average size, indicating that the birth-mean had been above the survival-mean. So also in the case of the half-wild horses of Circassia, which are greatly exposed to attacks of wolves and to extreme vicissitudes of climate, swiftness, strength, wariness, and a hardy constitution must be kept at a high level of efficiency by the elimination of the less gifted in these qualities; so that here again the birth-mean must be below the survival-mean. In such cases as these there seems no difficulty in the fact that the mean characters do not change for many generations; for this is in accordance with Darwin's principle that natural selection \u201ccannot produce absolute perfection, but only relative perfection.\u201d When the average characters of a species have reached a point such that it can permanently maintain itself in a given area, then no further change will occur; but, the less efficient being constantly weeded out, the survivalmean will be necessarily a little above the birth-mean.

It would seem that the worm was exceedingly rare.

Our specimen, the type of the genus Deitdrexetastes founded by Eyton in 1851, in Jardine's \u201cContributions to Ornithology,\u201d on a skin from an unknown locality, formerly in Lord Derby's museum, has evidently been examined by Dr. Sclater, for its label bears, in the well-known calligraphics of that distinguished authority on this group, the name Dendrexetastes temmincki. The difficulty I have in ascribing our specimen to that species is the cause of this note. According to the fifteenth volume of the \u201cBritish Museum Catalogue of Birds,\u201d by Dr. P. L. Sclater, the genus contains but two species, D. temmincki and D. devillii, which, by his key on p. 140, are distinguished from each other, the former by having \u201cblackish cross-bands\u201d on the belly, and the latter having that region \u201cuniform brown.\u201d On consulting Eyton's original description in the \u201cContributions to Ornithology,\u201d I can find no mention of any cross-bands on the belly; for there are none on the skin, which is apparently that of a mature bird. In looking up next the description by Lafresnaye, in the \u201cRevue de Zoologie\u201d for 1851, of his D. temminckii, to which Dr. Sclater has relegated as a synonym Eyton's D. capitoides, I read:\u2014\u201c\u2026 pectoris ventrisque plumis totis umbrinis, in medio macul\u00e2 triangulari-elongata nivea nigro marginata notatis; ventris maculis strictis; fere linearibus; subcaudalibus pallide rufescentibus, albo late, fuscoque anguste vittatis \u2026\u201d These words, as I interpret them, make no mention of the presence of cross-bands on the belly of D. temmincki, while the latter half of the quotation, in regard to the under-tail-coverts being pale rufous, with broad white and narrow fuscous spots, does not apply to D. capitoides, for the type-skin before me presents no such characters. The plate illustrating Lafresnaye's description of the first-mentioned bird (loc. sup. cit.) shows its breast-spots to be much narrower, though not linear, and shorter than those in D. capitoides, while the spots on the feathers on the upper part of the belly can hardly be termed \u201cfere linearibus,\u201d which they are, however, in D. capitoides. The lower belly in the plate, \u201cplumis totis umbrinis,\u201d shows, just as in the last-mentioned species, not a single cross-band. It would appear to me, therefore, that D. capitoides, Eyton, can scarcely be = D. temmincki, Lafr., while the latter differs from D. devillii (of which I regret our museum does not possess a specimen), and, I take it, from D. capitoides, by its smaller and narrower throat-spots. The subcaudal characters separate D. capitoides from D. temmincki, and apparently the typical D. devillii is separated from it also by the \u201cstriis strictissimis\u201c of the breast, and the very linear shaftstripes of the upper neck feathers. Is D. capitoides = D. devillii? Or are there three species?

The plate illustrating Lafresnaye's description of the first-mentioned bird (loc. sup. cit.) shows its breast-spots to be much narrower, though not linear, and shorter than those in D. capitoides, while the spots on the feathers on the upper part of the belly can hardly be termed \u201cfere linearibus,\u201d which they are, however, in D. capitoides. The lower belly in the plate, \u201cplumis totis umbrinis,\u201d shows, just as in the last-mentioned species, not a single cross-band. It would appear to me, therefore, that D. capitoides, Eyton, can scarcely be = D. temmincki, Lafr., while the latter differs from D. devillii (of which I regret our museum does not possess a specimen), and, I take it, from D. capitoides, by its smaller and narrower throat-spots. The subcaudal characters separate D. capitoides from D. temmincki, and apparently the typical D. devillii is separated from it also by the \u201cstriis strictissimis\u201c of the breast, and the very linear shaftstripes of the upper neck feathers. Is D. capitoides = D. devillii? Or are there three species? I incline to the opinion that there are.","dc.creator":["FORBES, HENRY O."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["FORBES, HENRY O."],"citation_author_institution":["The Museums, Liverpool"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Note on the Dendrocolaptine Species,...","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Note on the Dendrocolaptine Species, &#8220;Dendrexetastes capitoides&#8221; of...","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"053032a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Wiener devised a method of examining colour photographs through a right-angled prism in such a way that pigment colours, which owe their hues to absorption, are distinguished from interference colours by not changing their positions when seen through the prism. The application of this method to colour photographs by Lippmann's process and the older processes of Seebeck, Poitevin and Becquerel, shows that in Lippmann's photographs the colours are due entirely to interference. In Becquerel's process they are due mainly to interference, though pigment colours are formed to an extent which is generally very small, but which increases with the duration of the exposure. The colours on Becquerel plates do change with the angle of incidence, though the changes are very small, probably in consequence of the high refractive power of the film. Further, when the film is examined from the back the colours do not occupy the same positions as when they are viewed from the front. It follows that the colours on Becquerel plates are due essentially to the same cause as those on Lippmann's plates, and the theory of standing waves is applicable in both cases.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"54","prism.number":"1387","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"77","prism.endingPage":"77","prism.copyright":"1896 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/054077a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/054077a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/054077a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/054077a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Becquerel's and Lippmann's Colour Photographs","citation_volume":"54","citation_issue":"1387","citation_publication_date":"1896/05","citation_firstpage":"77","citation_lastpage":"77","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/054077a0","DOI":"10.1038/054077a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/054077a0","description":"THE point raised by Prof. Meldola (p. 28) is partially, if not completely, answered by Otto Wiener in a most valuable paper, \u201cUeber Farbenphotographie durch K\u00f6rperfarben, und Mechanische Farbenanpassung in der Natur,\u201d published in Wiedemann's Annalen, 1895, lv. 225\u2013281.

Grablovitz, and at the same time was so marked in amplitude and duration, it is not unlikely that it disturbed the entire surface of the globe.","dc.creator":["MILNE, JOHN"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["MILNE, JOHN"],"citation_author_institution":["Shide, Newport"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"Two Unfelt Earthquakes","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Two Unfelt Earthquakes&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"055463a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The machine is a large Holtz, used in the electrical department of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. It consists of eight glass plates of twenty-nine inches in diameter, inclosed in a glass case. It is driven by a motor which is worked by the 100 volt alternating main which supplies the electrical department with its alternating current. The initial charge is obtained from a small Voss machine which is inclosed in the case of the Holtz. The photograph was obtained in the following manner. The machine was started and the brass knobs of the conductors adjusted to give a spark of about seven inches in length. The knobs were now tested in the usual way (by presenting a metallic point to the conductors) with reference to the sign of their charge. A gelatine dry plate was then taken, inclosed firstly in an orange and then in a black envelope. The plate was placed between the knobs of the conductors in a line parallel with them and the sparks allowed to play over the envelope for a period of one second of time. The plate was then taken to the dark-room, developed and fixed in the ordinary way. The accompanying illustration shows the curious results obtained. A distinct break can be seen in the continuity of the sparks between the positive and negative poles. Round the positive pole the sparks are rushing off in a dense mass with a direction from the negative pole of the machine. At the line of separation of this dense mass of sparks is seen a depression as if the mass had been eroded by the negative charge, reminding one very forcibly of what happens to the positive carbon of the arc light. At the negative pole the sparks are much less dense and more fan-shaped, and radiate in the reverse direction to the positive sparks with the exception of a cone of sparks, which are much smaller, which approach the depression in the positive mass. This prolongation of small sparks towards the positive pole is seen in each of the photographs obtained. The results of the experiment are curious.

As neither his interpretation of Newton nor his argument based thereon was stated with sufficient clearness to enable a critic to locate the weak spot without running serious risk of misinterpreting him, it seemed better in the first instance to point out a well-known case in which precisely similar reasoning would lead to Lagrange's equations of motion where they are known to be untrue (the reason, and a proper remedy, being also generally known).

The night of November 14 was also clear, though at times a dark belt of cloud, which concealed the lower part of Orion, extended itself along the eastern horizon to the foot of Leo, and occasionally also small patches of cloud dimmed or caused a momentary disappearance of stars in or around Gemini. These slight impediments to observation continued also on the next night until between two and three o'clock on the following morning. It had been intended to commence observations here as early as the night of November 11, as the writer had anticipated that the Leonids would put in an early appearance in the present year; cloudy skies, however, prevented the possibility of knowing if these anticipations were realised. During a watch from 10h. 20m. to 12h. 30m. on November 14 (local time) eleven meteors were observed, almost half of which were Leonids as bright as stars of the first or second magnitude. The radiation from Leo was regarded as surprisingly good, considering the hazy or clouded appearance of the horizon, which rendered that constellation invisible until after midnight. In a forecast made by the writer for the present year he found that, so far as the Leonid epoch of November 14\u201316 was concerned, the maximum would fall between the hours 13 and 14 on November 15; but it was considered that the display on the latter night would be weak, owing partly to the reported insignificance of the Leonid shower on the night of November 15, 1902, the preparations for the due observation of which were generally frustrated by unfavourable atmospheric conditions. When, therefore, the radiation from Leo was found to be so pronounced during the early hours of the night of November 14, the writer found that he had entirely underestimated the probable strength of the shower for 1903. The watch, however, was not prolonged beyond 12h. 30m. on the night of November 14, as there was no possibility of a star shower taking place on this night, though, no doubt, there were manifest signs that the Leonids might be unusually numerous. The first watch on the following night lasted from 9h. 15m. to 10h., during which time four meteors were seen, one of them being a Leonid as bright as a first magnitude star. Its appearance was revealed by the rich streak it left in its wake as it slowly rose from the invisible radiant. The watch was resumed at eleven o'clock, and whatever misgivings might have been felt for abandoning the lookout on the previous night were quickly dissipated by the appearance of as many Leonids in the first quarter of an hour's observations as had been seen during a period about five times as long on the preceding evening. Between 11h. and 11h. 30m. the meteoric rate was twenty-two per hour for one observer facing due east, but by midnight it had fallen to sixteen per hour, though sporadic meteors were included in the count. Between 12h. and 13h. drifting patches of cloud probably prevented several meteors from being observed, and the rate did not rise above thirty per hour, but at 15h., when the sky had become quite clear, Leonids were appearing at the rate of one per minute. During the next half hour forty-one shooting stars were counted, and this high rate was more than maintained for the next two hours; indeed, it was estimated at one time that the meteoric rate was easily 200 per hour for one observer. The brilliancy of the display was as remarkable as its numerical strength. When the shower was at its maximum, few of the shooting stars seen were less bright than the second or third stellar magnitude; indeed, most of them, if observed apart, would have merited individual description, and almost every third or fourth meteor might be called a bolide. To an observer looking eastwards the radiation from Leo was very marked, but a few instances were characterised by a centripetal rather than the usual centrifugal motion as regards the well-known radiant. The most noted of these exceptional cases occurred between one and two o'clock, when a bolide of surpassing splendour passed slowly downwards, leaving a rich trail across the stars \u0435 and \u03b6 Leonis. When close to the \u201cSickle\u201d it exploded with a vividly white flash that imparted to it an almost startling brilliancy, and an instant afterwards a meteor as bright as Sirius made its appearance about twenty degrees further on, shooting down towards the horizon in a path that seemed to be a production of that of its more brilliant predecessor. Another meteor brighter than Jupiter shortly afterwards moved slowly downwards from within the \u201cSickle,\u201d passing between \u03b3 and \u03b7 Leonis one-third nearer the latter than the former star, and pursuing a course parallel to the line joining \u03b7 and Regulus. This west-to-east motion of the most brilliant members of a meteor display (for it has been noticed on other occasions by the writer) appears very significant. Several shooting stars shot from \u03b5 Leonis to \u03b2 Canis Minoris, or slightly below the latter star. There seemed to be a second centre of emanation much lower down in the \u201cSickle\u201d than that indicated by the foregoing meteors, and there was certainly another radiant altogether far away from Leo, and situated probably in or near Perseus. Several bolides passed out of sight overhead, arresting the attention only by their exploding flashes that momentarily illuminated the whole heavens. The pear-shaped appearance of meteors in the morning hours was very remarkable. These left rich trains which, like the meteors themselves, appeared of a yellowish tinge in the light of the waning moon or in the increasing twilight. Other members of the star shower dissolved in bright streaks, or made their appearance as vivid flashes of light, in the latter case generally at a great distance from Leo, bursting forth at one moment near the Great Bear, and in the next in the neighbourhood of Sirius. The largest number of meteors visible at one time was four. At six o'clock the activity of the shower, though considerably diminished, was still, even in the morning twilight, very noticeable.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"69","prism.number":"1778","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"80","prism.endingPage":"80","prism.copyright":"1903 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/069080a0","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/069080a0","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/069080a0.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/069080a0","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Leonid Meteor Shower, 1903","citation_volume":"69","citation_issue":"1778","citation_publication_date":"1903/11","citation_firstpage":"80","citation_lastpage":"80","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/069080a0","DOI":"10.1038/069080a0","citation_doi":"10.1038/069080a0","description":"THE return of the Leonids was clearly observed here on the night of November 15.

I have not seen insects visiting the flowers, neither have I found them in the pitchers, and conclude that the birds are attracted by the sweet juice itself rather than by insects in search of it as Belt suggests.","dc.creator":["BRYANT, ELLA M."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["BRYANT, ELLA M."],"citation_author_institution":["Dominica"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Pollination of Exotic Flowers","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Pollination of Exotic Flowers&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"071294a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The curves were slightly disturbed during the whole of February 9, but the storm may be regarded as commencing with a rapid movement of a few minutes of arc in the declination needle at 2.15 p.m., with a synchronous sudden rise of 45 \u03b3 (1 \u03b3 =0.00001 C.G.S.) in the horizontal force. The storm lasted an unusually short time, being practically over by 3 a.m. on February 10, but several large rapid movements were recorded. The largest declination movement occurred between 8.19 p.m. and 8.45 p.m. on February 9. During these twenty-six minutes the needle moved 57 to the west and then 73\u2032 to the east, the extreme westerly position being reached at 8.34 p.m. The most easterly position during the storm was reached at about 10.55 p.m., when the trace was off the sheet for a few minutes.

Odds ratio (OR, 95% confidence interval (CI)) for incident MS cases was evaluated according to four WF groups (no WF and tertiles of WF) in 3553 middle-aged subjects. The OR (95% CI) for MS was 2.06 (1.20\u20133.52) for the third WF tertile compared to the first tertile. This association was independent of confounding variables, especially relative weight change during follow-up. Subjects without WF had a 2.72-fold increase (1.64\u20134.53) for MS risk compared to the first tertile of WF. For MS components taken separately, similar associations were found for raised blood pressure, low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and increased waist circumference. Our results showed that WF was an independent risk factor for MS after 7 years of follow-up. Moreover, subjects without WF were also at risk for MS, due to the highest weight gain during follow-up. These results support the benefits of weight stability and emphasize the importance of weight gain prevention starting from early adulthood.","prism.publicationName":"International Journal of Obesity","prism.publicationDate":"2007-10-30","prism.volume":"32","prism.number":"2","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"315","prism.endingPage":"321","prism.copyright":"2008 Nature Publishing Group","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/0803739","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/sj.ijo.0803739","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/0803739.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/0803739","citation_journal_title":"International Journal of Obesity","citation_journal_abbrev":"Int J Obes","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-5497","citation_title":"Weight fluctuations and risk for metabolic syndrome in an adult cohort","citation_volume":"32","citation_issue":"2","citation_publication_date":"2008/02","citation_online_date":"2007/10/30","citation_firstpage":"315","citation_lastpage":"321","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/sj.ijo.0803739","DOI":"10.1038/sj.ijo.0803739","citation_doi":"10.1038/sj.ijo.0803739","description":"Weight gain is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome (MS).

The important thing to understand is the nature of the down-ward propelling force\u2014indeed, of both the upward and the downward force\u2014in either case.","dc.creator":["LODGE, OLIVER"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["LODGE, OLIVER"],"citation_author_institution":["University of Birmingham,"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"A Kinetic Theory of Gravitation","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;A Kinetic Theory of Gravitation&lt;/ArticleTitle&gt;","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"086347a0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Amongst the mammalian bones found on the floor of the cave, Dr. A. Smith Woodward and Dr. C. Andrews recognised remains of the woolly rhinoceros, the reindeer, and two varieties of horse. Abundant evidence of former hearths and numerous flint implements were found with the bones. Nine human teeth were also found, and it is to the nature of these I wish now to direct attention. The exploration of the cave was continued by Mr. R. R. Marett, reader in social anthropology, Oxford University, who is now preparing for publication a full account of the various \u201cfinds\u201d made in the Jersey caves.

A. Paterson to a plate in a portfolio of photographs from Assyrian bas-reliefs published at Haarlem, but now out of print. This plate represents a bas-relief in the great hall of Sinnacherib's palace at Nineveh, and consists of an upper and a lower portion. The latter depicts the monarch in his chariot, while the upper shows a reed swamp with wild animals. This swamp is believed to be part of a pleasure-ground made by Sinnacherib in the neighbourhood of the palace, into which wild animals were turned. It is divided in the bas-relief into an upper and a lower portion. In the left-hand corner of the lower half is shown a wild sow with a litter of young, as they might appear at the present day in the reed-brakes of the Euphrates. The other animals are three ruminants, about half as big again as the sow, but with longer legs. The two in the upper half of the scene\u2014of which one is lying down\u2014are hornless, and therefore females, but the third, in the right-hand corner of the lower half, carries spirally twisted horns, recalling those of the African kudu, nyala, and situtunga, although not corresponding exactly in curvature with any of them. The tail is relatively short, as in the nyala. The buck is represented with its head down, nibbling the stem of a reed; on its body, in addition to parallel lines representing the ribs, are certain patches, which may be intended for broken pieces of reeds. These animals have been regarded as deer, but the buck carries horns, and not antlers, and antlered deer are not inhabitants of reed-brakes. On the other hand, such situations are the resort of several African antelopes, notably the situtunga, and it therefore seems practically certain that the ruminants represented in the sculpture are antelopes. They must, moreover, be antelopes of an African type, as there are no marsh-haunting species with spiral horns known from Syria, or Asia in general, and the presumption is that they represent an extinct member of the tragelaphine group allied to the nyala and situtunga, in which the females are hornless. The tragelaphine group is represented at the present day in India by the nilgai and chousingha, in which the horns of the bucks are small, but there is evidence that in the Pliocene India was the home of species akin to the kudu and bush-buck.

I have recently placed the fluorescent vapour in a strong magnetic field, and find that when the mercury lamp is cooled and consequently the \u201c2536\u201d line is sharp, the magnetic field increases the intensity of the fluorescence several times. If the lamp is allowed to warm up so that the \u201c2536\u201d line becomes broadened and reversed, the opposite effect is obtained, i.e. the phosphorescence decreases in intensity with the field.

I have recently placed the fluorescent vapour in a strong magnetic field, and find that when the mercury lamp is cooled and consequently the \u201c2536\u201d line is sharp, the magnetic field increases the intensity of the fluorescence several times. If the lamp is allowed to warm up so that the \u201c2536\u201d line becomes broadened and reversed, the opposite effect is obtained, i.e. the phosphorescence decreases in intensity with the field. In this latter case the field strength that produces the greatest diminution in intensity increases with the temperature of the quartz-mercury lamp. The ordinary fluorescence produced by the light from the cadmium spark is not affected by the magnetic field. I am at present working with the idea of obtaining a satisfactory explanation of the persistent fluorescence and the various phenomena connected with it.","dc.creator":["PHILLIPS, F.

The maximum initial velocity was found to be independent of the quantity of hydrogen absorbed, while the maximum current was proportional to the quantity of gas absorbed.","dc.creator":["STUHLMANN, O.","PIERSOL, R."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_author":["STUHLMANN, O.","PIERSOL, R."],"citation_author_institution":["University of Pennsylvania,","University of Pennsylvania,"],"access_endpoint":"https://www.nature.com/platform/readcube-access","twitter:site":"@nature","twitter:card":"summary","twitter:image:alt":"Content cover image","twitter:title":"The Photo-electric Effect of Carbon as...","twitter:description":"Nature - &lt;ArticleTitle Language=&quot;En&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The Photo-electric Effect of Carbon as Influenced by its Absorbed...","WT.z_primary_atype":"Research"},{"_id":"094617b0","applicable-device":"pc,mobile","viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5,user-scalable=yes","msapplication-TileColor":"#000000","msapplication-config":"/static/browserconfig.e35b3b052c.xml","theme-color":"#000000","application-name":"Nature","robots":"noarchive","access":"Yes","WT.cg_s":"Article","WT.z_bandiera_abtest":"a","WT.page_categorisation":"Article_HTML","WT.template":"oscar","WT.z_cg_type":"Nature Research Journals","WT.cg_n":"Nature","dc.rights":"\u00a92021 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In yeast, processing of HAC1 mRNA by activated Ire1 leads to synthesis of the transcription factor Hac1 and activation of the UPR3. The responses to activated IRE1 in metazoans are less well understood. Here we demonstrate that mutations in either ire-1 or the transcription-factor-encoding xbp-1 gene abolished the UPR in Caenorhabditis elegans. Mammalian XBP-1 is essential for immunoglobulin secretion and development of plasma cells4, and high levels of XBP-1 messenger RNA are found in specialized secretory cells5. Activation of the UPR causes IRE1-dependent splicing of a small intron from the XBP-1 mRNA both in C. elegans and mice.

In yeast, processing of HAC1 mRNA by activated Ire1 leads to synthesis of the transcription factor Hac1 and activation of the UPR3. The responses to activated IRE1 in metazoans are less well understood. Here we demonstrate that mutations in either ire-1 or the transcription-factor-encoding xbp-1 gene abolished the UPR in Caenorhabditis elegans. Mammalian XBP-1 is essential for immunoglobulin secretion and development of plasma cells4, and high levels of XBP-1 messenger RNA are found in specialized secretory cells5. Activation of the UPR causes IRE1-dependent splicing of a small intron from the XBP-1 mRNA both in C. elegans and mice. The protein encoded by the processed murine XBP-1 mRNA accumulated during the UPR, whereas the protein encoded by unprocessed mRNA did not. Purified mouse IRE1 accurately cleaved XBP-1 mRNA in vitro, indicating that XBP-1 mRNA is a direct target of IRE1 endonucleolytic activity.

Here we show that viral escape from CTL recognition can result in the eventual failure of this partial immune protection. Viral mutations that escape from CTL recognition have been previously described in humans infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)5,6,7,8,9,10 and monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)11,12,13.

This new evidence indicates that large source areas of aeolian dust and energetic winter monsoon winds to transport the material must have existed in the interior of Asia by the early Miocene epoch, at least 14 million years earlier than previously thought3,5. Regional tectonic changes and ongoing global cooling are probable causes of these changes in aridity and circulation in Asia.","dc.creator":["Guo, Z. T.","Ruddiman, William F.","Hao, Q. Z.","Wu, H.

This suggests that the earliest eutherian lineages developed different locomotory adaptations, facilitating their spread to diverse niches in the Cretaceous.","dc.creator":["Ji, Qiang","Luo, Zhe-Xi","Yuan, Chong-Xi","Wible, John R.","Zhang, Jian-Ping","Georgi, Justin A."],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=Classification of Mammals above the Species Level; citation_publication_date=1997; citation_id=CR1; citation_author=MC McKenna; citation_author=SK Bell","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=Mammalian phylogeny\u2014shaking the tree; citation_author=MJ Novacek; citation_volume=356; citation_publication_date=1992; citation_pages=121-125; citation_doi=10.1038/356121a0; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=Epipubic bones in eutherian mammals from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia; citation_author=MJ Novacek; citation_volume=389; citation_publication_date=1997; citation_pages=483-486; citation_doi=10.1038/39020; citation_id=CR3","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=Cretaceous age for the feathered dinosaurs of Liaoning, China; citation_author=CC Swisher, Y-Q Wang, X-L Wang, X Xu, Y Wang; citation_volume=398; citation_publication_date=1999; citation_pages=58-61; citation_doi=10.1038/21872; citation_id=CR4","citation_title=Geochronology, Time Scales and Global Stratigraphic Correlation; citation_publication_date=1995; citation_id=CR5; citation_author=FM Gradstein","citation_journal_title=Nature; citation_title=A new symmetrodont mammal from China and its implications for mammalian evolution; citation_author=Y-M Hu, Y-Q Wang, Z-X Luo, C-K Li; citation_volume=390; citation_publication_date=1997; citation_pages=137-142; citation_doi=10.1038/36505; citation_id=CR6","citation_journal_title=Vert.

Here we use a recently compiled global data set of oceanographic observations1\u2014a database that is at least 40 times larger than currently used data sets (for example, ref. 2)\u2014to analyse the variation of the nitrate:phosphate concentration ratio with depth and geographical location.

We describe the archaeological characteristics of the Jiahu site, details concerning its dating, its place in the prehistory of the Chinese Neolithic, the ethnicity of its population and the results of a tonal analysis of a nearly 9,000-year-old musical instrument found there.","dc.creator":["Zhang, Juzhong","Harbottle, Garman","Wang, Changsui","Kong, Zhaochen"],"dc.subject":["Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","Science, multidisciplinary"],"citation_reference":["citation_journal_title=Wenwu; citation_title=Preliminary report for the second through the sixth excavation at the Neolithic site of Jiahu in Wuyang, Henan.; citation_author=null Henan Province, Institute of Cultural Relics.; citation_volume=1; citation_publication_date=1989; citation_pages=1-17; citation_id=CR1","citation_journal_title=Antiquity; citation_title=Notes on the recent discovery of ancient cultivated rice at Jiahu, Henan Province: a new theory concerning the origin of Oryza japonica in China.; citation_author=J Zhang, X Wang; citation_volume=72; citation_publication_date=1998; citation_pages=897-901; citation_doi=10.1017/S0003598X00087536; citation_id=CR2","citation_journal_title=J.

Several theoretical and laboratory studies on magma degassing3,4,5,6,7 and fragmentation8,9,10,11 have produced a general picture of the sequence of events leading to the fragmentation of silicic magma12,13,14. But there remains a debate2 over whether magma fragmentation is a consequence of the textural evolution of magma to a foamed state\u00a0where disintegration of walls separating bubbles becomes inevitable due to a foam-collapse criterion, or whether magma is fragmented purely by stresses that exceed its tensile strength. Here we show that tube pumice\u2014where extreme bubble elongation is observed\u2014is a well-preserved magmatic \u2018strain marker\u2019 of the stress state immediately before and during fragmentation. Structural elements in the pumice record the evolution of the magma's mechanical response from viscous behaviour (foaming and foam elongation) through the plastic or viscoelastic stage, and finally to brittle behaviour. These observations directly support the hypothesis that fragmentation occurs when magma undergoes a ductile\u2013brittle transition and stresses exceed the magma's tensile strength.","prism.publicationName":"Nature","prism.volume":"402","prism.number":"6762","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"650","prism.endingPage":"653","prism.copyright":"1999 Macmillian Magazines Ltd.","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/45219","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/45219","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/45219.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/45219","citation_journal_title":"Nature","citation_journal_abbrev":"Nature","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1476-4687","citation_title":"Tube pumices as strain markers of the ductile\u2013brittle transition during magma fragmentation","citation_volume":"402","citation_issue":"6762","citation_publication_date":"1999/12","citation_firstpage":"650","citation_lastpage":"653","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/45219","DOI":"10.1038/45219","citation_doi":"10.1038/45219","description":"Magma fragmentation\u2014the process by which relatively slow-moving magma transforms into a violent gas flow carrying fragments of magma\u2014is the defining feature of explosive volcanism.

But there remains a debate2 over whether magma fragmentation is a consequence of the textural evolution of magma to a foamed state\u00a0where disintegration of walls separating bubbles becomes inevitable due to a foam-collapse criterion, or whether magma is fragmented purely by stresses that exceed its tensile strength. Here we show that tube pumice\u2014where extreme bubble elongation is observed\u2014is a well-preserved magmatic \u2018strain marker\u2019 of the stress state immediately before and during fragmentation. Structural elements in the pumice record the evolution of the magma's mechanical response from viscous behaviour (foaming and foam elongation) through the plastic or viscoelastic stage, and finally to brittle behaviour. These observations directly support the hypothesis that fragmentation occurs when magma undergoes a ductile\u2013brittle transition and stresses exceed the magma's tensile strength.","dc.creator":["Mart\u00ed, J.","Soriano, C.","Dingwell, D.

Method Questionnaires were sent to 200 GDPs, chosen at random, to accumulate information on the use of protection, the preferred methods of eye protection and any experience of ocular injury. Findings Eighty-seven per cent of GDPs wore eye protection routinely, but their choice of protection was not always adequate and not worn for all procedures. Forty-eight per cent of GDPs had experience of ocular trauma or infection which occurred during a variety of procedures; 75% of these injuries resulted from not wearing eye protection.

Although female mating preferences may not be directly subject to selection, they can evolve via genetic correlations with other characters that are undergoing evolutionary change. The first set of models examines the evolutionary origin of mating preferences directed at one or more traits that may or may not be expressed only in males. When several selected characters possess additive genetic variance, an indirect selective force exists for the evolution of multivariate mating preferences. The magnitude of this force is proportional to the covariance between a female's relative preference for a given male's phenotype and the expected viability of his progeny. The contribution of any single character to this covariance determines its potential value as a mate choice criterion. The pattern of genetic and phenotypic covariation may cause selectively unimportant traits to be useful in mate choice. In the extreme, selectively neutral characters may become the objects of mating preferences, if they are relatively immune to random environmental variation and genetically correlated with selectively important characters. The second set of models examines the dynamic evolution of such a selectively neutral (\u201carbitrary\u201d) character that is both the object of a mating preference and genetically correlated with a third trait that affects viability. The outcome of evolution in this three character system is highly indeterminate. As in other sexual selection models, there exists a line of neutral equilibria wherein the mean of the criterion character matches the mean level of mating preference within the population, while the viability trait equilibrates at the phenotypic value conferring maximum viability. This line of equilibria, however, is not likely to be stable unless females choose mates according to absolute mating preferences. Thus, mating preferences that initially may arise as a mean of increasing offspring viability may nevertheless lead to indeterminate and potentially maladaptive evolutionary outcomes.","prism.publicationName":"Heredity","prism.volume":"55","prism.number":"2","prism.section":"OriginalPaper","prism.startingPage":"187","prism.endingPage":"198","prism.copyright":"1985 The Genetical Society of Great Britain","prism.rightsAgent":"journalpermissions@springernature.com","prism.url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy198591","prism.doi":"doi:10.1038/hdy.1985.91","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy198591.pdf","citation_fulltext_html_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy198591","citation_journal_title":"Heredity","citation_journal_abbrev":"Heredity","citation_publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","citation_issn":"1365-2540","citation_title":"Quantitative genetic models of female choice based on \u201carbitrary\u201d male characters","citation_volume":"55","citation_issue":"2","citation_publication_date":"1985/10","citation_firstpage":"187","citation_lastpage":"198","citation_article_type":"Article","citation_language":"en","dc.identifier":"doi:10.1038/hdy.1985.91","DOI":"10.1038/hdy.1985.91","citation_doi":"10.1038/hdy.1985.91","description":"Multivariate, quantitative genetic models are developed for the evolution of female mating preferences in situations where males contribute only their gametes to their progeny.

The magnitude of this force is proportional to the covariance between a female's relative preference for a given male's phenotype and the expected viability of his progeny. The contribution of any single character to this covariance determines its potential value as a mate choice criterion. The pattern of genetic and phenotypic covariation may cause selectively unimportant traits to be useful in mate choice. In the extreme, selectively neutral characters may become the objects of mating preferences, if they are relatively immune to random environmental variation and genetically correlated with selectively important characters. The second set of models examines the dynamic evolution of such a selectively neutral (\u201carbitrary\u201d) character that is both the object of a mating preference and genetically correlated with a third trait that affects viability. The outcome of evolution in this three character system is highly indeterminate. As in other sexual selection models, there exists a line of neutral equilibria wherein the mean of the criterion character matches the mean level of mating preference within the population, while the viability trait equilibrates at the phenotypic value conferring maximum viability. This line of equilibria, however, is not likely to be stable unless females choose mates according to absolute mating preferences. Thus, mating preferences that initially may arise as a mean of increasing offspring viability may nevertheless lead to indeterminate and potentially maladaptive evolutionary outcomes.","dc.creator":["Heisler, I Lorraine"],"dc.subject":["Biomedicine, general","Human Genetics","Evolutionary Biology","Ecology","Cytogenetics","Plant Genetics and Genomics"],"citation_reference":["citation_title=Mate Choice;

In optics, this has been traditionally achieved with lenses where a higher curvature and lens permittivity typically result in shorter focal distances (low f/D). In this work, we present designs and techniques for collecting, refracting and guiding incident light into an area of high power concentration (a hot spot) at extremely short distances. Specifically, a flat low-profile focusing mechanism is presented using a hetero-junction of anisotropic metamaterials (MTMs). The hetero-junction is formed from two cleaved finite slabs of low (near zero) permittivity anisotropic MTMs with rotated optical axes. The MTMs have near zero longitudinal permittivity while matched in the transverse direction. Such MTMs are shown to provide a unique ability to bend the transverse magnetic or p-polarized light away from the normal and along the interface, contrary to conventional dielectrics, and with minimal reflections; hence allowing for a low profile design. Realizations in the optical regime are presented using periodic bilayers of metal and dielectric. The proposed hetero-junction focusing device concentrates the normally incident plane wave and/or beam into a corresponding focal region similar to a lens via multiple refractions. The hetero-junction is capable of creating a hot spot very close to the device, much closer than dielectric lenses and it significantly outperforms the size requirements of thick high curvature lenses with low f/D ratios. The proposed designs can find applications in various scenarios including solar and thermo photovoltaics, photodetectors, concentrated photovoltaics, non-imaging optics, micro- and nano-Fresnel lenses. A thin, flat metamaterial junction that concentrates incident light to a local spot can potentially outperform a conventional lens. The design, as reported by Mohammad Memarian and George Eleftheriades at the University of Toronto in Canada, consists of two slabs of low-permittivity anisotropic metamaterials with rotated optical axes. The resulting flat, low-profile structure is capable of collecting and guiding light to an intense spot much closer to the structure than that achievable with a traditional lens. Such functionality could aid the collection of light for applications involving solar cells, photodetectors and sensors.

Only for three meteorites (Beardsley, Nuevo Laredo and Richardton) are the lead and uranium data known to be in tolerable agreement.","dc.creator":["GALE, N.

Rate of sweat production (sweat rate) per gland per hour was calculated. Using microtechniques, the concentrations of electrolytes and metabolites, osmolarity, pH, and viscosity were determined in undiluted pooled sweat. The following results were obtained: No significant difference was observed in sweat rate per gland between control subjects and patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas (CFP). Concentrations of sodium and chloride in sweat rose with increasing sweat rates in both control subjects and patients with CFP. In the patients with CFP, the lowest values were between 70 and 90 mEq/1 and the curve approached isotonicity. Chloride values were consistently lower than those of sodium. Concentrations of potassium decreased with increasing sweat rate in control subjects approaching a value of about 10 mEq/1. In patients with CFP, the values for potassium were frequently twice as high as those in the control subjects. Concentration of calcium dropped rapidly with an increasing sweat rate from 10 to 1\u20132 mEq/1. Concentrations of lactic acid and urea were high at low sweat rates and decreased hyperbolically with increasing rates. In patients with CFP, the values of both components were lower than those in control subjects. Urea was uniformly more concentrated in sweat than in plasma; the sweat:plasma ratio approached 1.0 with increasing sweat rates. Creatinine concentrations decreased with increasing sweat rate. No difference was observed between values in two patients and two control subjects. Glucose concentration was low (0.2\u20136 mg/100 ml) and was independent of the sweat rate. No significant difference was observed in comparing five patients with CFP and six control subjects. In control subjects, osmolarity decreased, with increasing sweat rate, from 240 to approximately 120 mOsmol/1 and then increased (mean 163 mOsmol/1). In patients with CFP, the curve was similar in shape but began and ended in a range of approximately 320 m/Osmol/1 (mean 299 mOsmol/1). The pH of sweat was acid at low sweat rates (pH 3.5\u20136.0) and was slightly alkaline (pH 7.0\u20138.5) at high rates. No differences were observed when comparing five patients and five control subjects. Viscosity of sweat was significantly elevated in five patients with CFP in relation to that observed in eight control subjects. This may be explained by the elevated concentration of salt in sweat of patients with CFP. The excretory pattern of urea, lactic acid, and creatinine in sweat of patients with CFP, compared with that of control subjects, argues against an increased rate of water reabsorption in the excretory ducts of the sweat gland. The course of the sodium and the chloride curve and the values of osmolarity in sweat favor the assumption that in cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, the precursor fluid is in the isotonic range; net sodium reabsorption can then be calculated and appears to be defective in patients with this disease. Speculation: It was shown that the concentration of most of the components of sweat vary with rate of sweating. This dependence on rate must be considered in studies on the effect of such variables as sex and age of the person, season, diseases, or drugs on composition of sweat.
